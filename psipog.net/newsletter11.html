PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance

Newsletter #11, for February 1st, 2005

"I hear and I forget.
I see and I remember.
I do and I understand."
- Confucius


Dear PsiPog Users,

Howdy howdy :-). First, the big news: our third PK Party is
scheduled for February 19th, at 7:00pm EST. It will take place
in the chat's practice room. Everyone is invited (as long as you
aren't banned from the chat), and you can even join with mIRC or
some other chat client if you want. It'll be super awesome and
fun, so don't miss it! :-P If you're going to come, read this
page before showing up:

http://www.psipog.net/calendar.php?view=1&day=1108857600

Anything else going on with PsiPog? I'm working on the new
forums. I've got some ideas rolling, and work is getting done.
Unfortunately it'll probably take up to a year to get it working
the way I want it to. If you want to check the progress, surf to
http://www.psipogbb.net . Click on the main picture, and you'll
be brought to a page with the progress.

Lots of new mail :-D. A friendly reminder - send all your
comments, questions, exercises, etc, to newsletter@psipog.net .
This newsletter is created from the things you guys write in -
so don't be shy!

"I'm new to psionics, and I wanted to know.... why does it take
learning the basics to do other things quicker? They seem to have
a little related, but not very much. How does it make it easier?"

My comments: You don't have to learn the basics to learn the
more advanced skills. But it helps. Think of it like any other
skill - when you first start to learn to play soccer, you don't
start with complex psyche out moves. You start with kicking the
ball with correct form, passing accurately, etc. In the same
sense, a lot of psionics requires the ability to focus your mind
100% on a task without distraction, strong visualization skills,
and the ability to alter your state of consciousness. If you
learn these basics, then you can build off of them in different
directions. You can take your trancing skill and have it help
you with Remote Viewing - or you can take that same trancing
skill and have it help you with Telepathy.

"Hello, I thought I'd share some of the things I've learned NOT
to do with psionics.
1) Don't link to people that are obviously crazy or poeple with
obvious emotional disorders. I've gotten short term disconcerning
effects from looking too closely at crazy homeless people.
2) DON'T TRY TOO HARD. If you are experiencing more discomfort
than you would when doing something simple you already know how
to do, stop and practice on something more simple.
3) Be careful with mirror shields; I've gotten weird effects
from making them inside out, or from trying to send stuff out
through them.
4) Always practice whatever shield you want to try out on a
smaller psiball level scale first. If you can't accurrately
program a psiball to act like you want your shield to, don't
attempt anything on a large scale.
5) Lastly, just focus on having fun. If you're trying to do
something that is serious or has too much emotional importance to
you, you increase the chances of going temporarily overboard."

My comments: Thanks :-). Great tips :-).

"My question is when is the next version of the chat supposed to
come out? Is it possible to make it so you can choose which port
to connect to the different servers on?"

My comments: Right now I'm focusing on the forums and updating
the scripts on PsiPog.net. The new chat won't be out for a
while :-/. I can fix the port issue with the new chat, but don't
hold your breath :-P.

"Hey, I was just playing ping-pong with a friend and we were
using some TK trying to get the ball to miss the table, and it
worked pretty good. We had a battle of our TK talents to keep the
ball on the table. I just figured it might be a fun way to
practice."

My comments: Cool idea :-). Some people find doing TK on a
already-moving object easier. It can be easier to alter the
trajectory of an object, than getting the object to move from a
still position.

"My question is, can someone who is linked with another person
recieve the visual images from the other person? For example, I'm
blind. One day when I'm good enough at psionics to try a link,
would it be possible for me to find out what color is exactly?"

My comments: That's a tough question. I've heard of blind
people learning to see using psychic abilities, but I've never
seen a serious study on it. Run a google search on synesthesia,
that might pull up something useful. Here's a link I dug up that
looks useful too:

"I don't know if anyone here is familiar with the Hutchison
Effect but I ran into it while on the internet. The Effect occurs
when radio waves interfere in an area encompassed by high voltage
sources. (I am not a qualified physicist - it's a quote).
More interesting are the phenomena included in the effect:
Dislocation, levitation, changes in temperatures, energy bursts,
what we call phasing (scientifically called fusion of dissimilar
objects), all are documented on film, writing and stills (not
mentioning the results still visible). There is also
teleportation included though it wasn't documented. Anyway, I saw
this and thought how similar those phenomena are to what we try
to do in psionics. Maybe we use our neural system to create
micro-Hutchison effects? You can search google for it and see
what you can find."

My comments: I've never heard of it, I'll have to look into it.
Sounds cool from what you describe :-P.

"Hi there. I had an idea for a telekinetic game the other day. It
requires two people who are well versed in making the psi-wheel
move in whatever direction they choose. Make the psi-wheel, put
it on the pin, then put it under a glass bowl or something to
block wind. Then, each person tries to move the psi-wheel the
opposite direction of the other person. It becomes a battle of
will!"

My comments: Cool idea :-).

Gabi writes:
"In newsletter 8 there was a letter that was talking about how to
tell if a psi ball is really there and not just blood rushing to
our hands. I think I might have found a way that works, though
it is a bit inaccurate if you are looking for numbers. Basically
what you so is: Test the air temperature with your hands and
make sure that all the air around you feels the same. Then you
hold your hands away from your body and away from each other,
that way you won't feel the heat from anything but your psi ball,
if it happens to be heat that comes. Next you make your psi
ball. Since your hands are apart it may be harder to do, but aim
for the center of the gap between your hands. No, you don't need
your hands but it helps with visualizing a psi ball for some.
Now you remove your hands but try to keep the psi ball in place.
Move one hand around and feel the air around you before moving to
the area where you made your psi ball. There should be a change
in the way the air feels around your psi ball, whether it be
warmer or colder."

My comments: Wow, this is a really good idea. I can't believe
I've never thought of it! :-P I hope you don't mind if I
recommend this test to people in the future :-).

Kermia writes about the forums:
"Just a quick word of support for for Ryan. I feel the isolation
too. I take your point Peebrain about the impossibility of
forums. I hope some new idea will prove workable."

My comments: I have ideas in my head that I believe will be
workable. Some of the mods aren't convinced they will be, but
we'll give it a shot :-). It will take a while, unforunately. I
believe the ideas will work, and it will be worth it in the long
run. The bad part is we are currently at the beginning of "the
long run", so we have a little wait :-P.

"I've been praticing psi-wheel for 3 or 4 weeks but still I don't
understand what is the problem? I've done psi-ball, meditation
and even though I try my best I still have no luck. My first
method was just to look at it and visulize it moving while I
relax and that didn't work so now my new method is to just see it
in my head like you would see it in the tunnel. I haven't give up
yet even though at time I just wanna break the damn thing. My
question is how long does it take to see reslut on the psi-wheel
or should I just forget about it and move on to othere things.
Anyway I hope you can help me figure out what's the problem is
and make my day little bettter. Thank you!"

My comments: The first problem I see is you've been practicing
for only 3 to 4 weeks. Granted, some people get it quicker than
that, but others take a lot longer. It took me about 1.5 years
of on and off practice. If you are bored with the psi-wheel,
give yourself a break for a week or two and try something else.
Personally, I usually go between TK and OBEs. When I get bored
of TK, I move to OBEs... when I get bored of OBEs, I move back
to TK. If you're feeling upset and angry, then it isn't going to
work. Stay relaxed, try to have fun, and keep upbeat about it.

=================================================================

That does it for this newsletter :-). Remember, send in your
comments and questions to newsletter@psipog.net - I love reading
them (even the ones I don't post I love reading).

The PK Party is a few weeks off, so I'll remind you guys again
next newsletter, and I hope to see everyone there on Feb 19th!
