                  <p>Hi I have been practicinng psionics for about two years now, about six months with psipog. It is a great site. Lately I have had some very high stress moments. Today I was so upset at school, things were really disrupted. A water bottle fell overa computer monitor fell over and the helmet of the
                  Suit of armor came off and slammed into the ground. They all did this when I was having a argiument with a teacher. Could hightened stress cause jumps in your TK ability??? Thank you.</p>

                  <p>Hi. I'm new to this site and the became intrested in TK. I've been trying to practice, with no success. I've come up with three short questions, please answer them! It would be helpful!</p>

                  <p>1) Is is possible for ANYONE to preform TK?</p>

                  <p>2) I have trouble concentrating, since I don't exactly know how to clear my mind, I'm always thinking of something! Do you have any suggestions? I am really intrested in trying to preform TK!</p>

                  <p>3) Once you are advanced, how big an object can you use TK on?</p>

                  <p>Sorry for the three question thing, but I find TK so intresting! LOVE the site!!!</p>

                  <p>1) We don't know. For large-scale effects, probably not. This _had_ been answered here before, more than once.</p>

                  <p>2) This is normal. _Most_ people start out not having a clue how to concentrate on anything. Start with something relatively simple: put together a picture in your imagination, keep adding details to it. Or, take up colouring. Yes, I mean with a colouring book and wax crayons.</p>

                  <p>3) That appears to vary widely from person to person. Some folks struggle with pushing a psi-wheel; others can lifted sofas.</p>

                  <p>Hi, if electrokinesis is real why do some people say its not, and if it is not real then why are there som many sites about it and some people saying they can do electrokinesis. I would just like to know from your point of view but do you think electrokinesis is real, do you have any good
                  reason.</p>

                  <p>Define "electrokinesis". If you mean the assortment of psychokinetic abilities that affect electronic equipment, electromagnetic fields, and computer effects, then yes, it exists. Most of it falls under the category of "microPK", and some of the effects have earned other names from the computer
                  technicians, fighter pilots and so on who encounter these effects in their jobs. PEAR Inc devotes its efforts to the study of these quirks of engineering.</p>

                  <p>As for some people saying it is not real, they have various reasons for this, ranging from an honest belief that it is nonsense to a vested interest in downplaying its existence. On the other end of the scale, some people claim to be able to do things that they cannot do in fact, for any number of
                  reasons. Also, be careful of websites. Some websites that appear to be detailed real-world psionics sites are actually backstory sites for role-playing games.</p>

                  <p>i can't say i have read every article on this website, but i must say that i have read a lot. Now i havn't tried the psi-ball yet, but i have tried the psi-wheel. But i was observing all the questions asked and reading all the answers. Now it seems to me, that some people are just not capable of
                  TK what so ever? Is this true. Cause i've tried with the psi-wheel, and i must admit it did not move whatsoever, altho i felt a strange coldness in the palm of my hand. Now i also to meditation, and i'm used to these abnormal feelings, specially if you do a body scan. (Not meaning TK, meaning body
                  scan as in meditation wise) Just saying that i always gave these odd feelings a thought. What i think i'm trying to get to, since trying TK can acutally kill you, well not kill you but you kno what i mean, should i even try it? Or keep on practicing? I always thought that everyone could do it if they
                  worked on it, but some of answers to these question make me thing that only certain people are capable? Or maybe i just need to read more on this, but i thought sending this in my be of use. -Good day</p>

It is unknown what, if any, indicators might exist to tell which people these might be, or what portion of the population might be in that (hypothetical) category.

                  <p>I have two questions, I know that it says to try to stick to one question, but I figure that this is easier for you than answering two separate questions. Anyway, here goes:</p>

                  <p>1) I've seen it mentioned several times that TK seems to reduce potassium and glucose levels in the body. Keeping this in mind, if you consumed large amounts of potassium and glucose, would you be able to (theoretically) make a "session" of TK last longer or even move things more powerfully in the
                  usual amount of time?</p>

                  <p>2) I've seen you (Rainsong) talk about what you dub the "Peter Pan" effect. You said that it was a "big if", even if you could lift something of your own mass and weight. Why is this? I can't think of any reason why you shouldn't be able to, as long as you can lift something else that has the same
                  mass, weight, etc. that you do.</p>

                  <p>1) No, the body has mechanisms in place to prevent blood potassium levels from getting too high. It does not have an effective method for keeping it from dropping too low. Both are lethal.</p>

                  <p>2) "Big if": I've never seen it done, and do not know if it can be. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that it is possible. Dropping your body would hurt more than dropping a rock, though, I expect...</p>

                  <p>Reasonably balanced diet should be fine. Potassium and glucose are _really_ common, and the body has mechanisms to get rid of excess potassium. The sudden potassium drop really has to be remedied after the fact, when it happens.</p>
