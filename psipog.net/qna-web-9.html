                  <p>You need a program to Unzip it. If you are running Windows XP, you should just be able to double click on the file and it should open up. If you are running Windows 98 or 95, you'll have to download WinZip. Look on www.download.com, and search for "WinZip".</p>

                  <p>I'm just wondering why you guys don't have a weekly or monthly event like every other friday afternoon there's a telepathy party or a pk practice on the first weekend of the month or something. Just wondering, cause the last thing was kind of unscheduled, and I didn't know it was happening, but my
                  point is, if it's scheduled, people can plan farther ahead for it. Just kinda a suggestion and question.</p>

                       class="smileyImg" />. I've given the mods the ability to schedule stuff on the Calendar, and I've made it so they can easily (hopefully <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"

                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />) post a Discussion or Practice, without my permission. So, hopefully, all the mods will start using it randomally, and say if a mod does something once every five weeks, then overall we should have something once a week <img src="smile.gif"
                       width="12"

                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />. The system is in place, and I think it will work nice, but we just gotta wait a while and see how well it turns out.</p>

                  <p>Sorry... the port restriction is based on the chat server, which isn't controlled by me. It's an IRC chat room, which means the port range is 6667-7000 by default usually. There's nothing I can do to change that :-/.</p>

                  <p>Im pretty sure this hasnt been asked already but if it has im sorry. Would it be possible to put an online cgi client such as the one available at <a href="http://cgiirc.sourceforge.net/."
                     target="_blank">http://cgiirc.sourceforge.net/.</a> I ask this because this would allow Unix and mac users access to the chat and also people like me who are behind a restrictive firewall. I also know that with the program i have suggested it is possible to stop people connecting to any other
                     servers or channels than the ones you specify. If not thats fine. Thanks.</p>

                  <p>CGI IRC uses the hosting server to connect to the chat server, then relays the chat information to the end-user via the hosting server. Puts a huge load on the hosting server (i.e., PsiPog.net). For that reason, it's not allowed by my hosting provider, and I agree with their decision.</p>

                  <p>I don't know when the next PK Party will be. Perhaps in the middle of April or May (2004), around there I would guess. It's still a far ways away, so no real need to start planning now.</p>

                  <p>As for the log, that is a common request. The thing is, the log really isn't that useful at all. It was basically me giving a small summary of the fork-you.com method, then telling everyone to go meditate for 10 minutes. After that, it was just random discussion for a few hours with a bunch of
                  people, with some bursts of excitement when someone got their spoon to bend. I don't see the educational purpose of having the log... it's kind of like one of those things that you had to be there to appreciate.</p>

                  <p>My personal preference is for whichever kind happens to be available. Quite often, you have a choice of perhaps two or three at most. They all work on the same principle. Edmund Scientific is one of the few places that sells them most of the time.</p>
