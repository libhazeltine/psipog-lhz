                  <p>I have not been practicing psi techniques long, but i still am skeptical. I just cant seem to make a psi ball! I have a few Questions:<br />
                  1. How do i know if i did it?<br />
                  2. What if i cant feel anything?<br />
                  3. How do you manipulitate a pinwheel thing?<br />
                  4. Is this all just a big put on?</p>

                  <p>1. Start off by feeling it. Eventually you can have third parties confirm it, or see it.<br />
                  2. You should be able to feel something. If you don't, keep practicing, and try different methods.<br />
                  3. Check under "The Kinesis" section in the articles, specifically the ones talking about "Telekinesis".<br />

                  <p>I have read the articles and this may sound stupid but some seem like they are saying that to program a construct you verbaly tell it to do something, Like some say to program your psiball to hold form, use the programming "hold form".<br />

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I have a couple questions about psiballs...</p>

                  <p>1) I've tried making psi balls many times now, and whenever I have the right amount of focus, I feel tingling in my hands, and sometimes when I stop, one or both of my hands will be cold (sometimes they're normal, though). Do these reactions seem like good posibilities that I'm creating a psi
                  ball?</p>

                  <p>2) I've tried flaring with no luck and I don't know anyone who would be willing to try and feel the psi ball as well to see if it's real. Any suggestions on how to find out if it's really there?</p>

                  <p>Many thanks. :)</p>

                  <p>1) Coldness is possible. That's a start - keep at it.</p>

                  <p>2) For now, I would base it on what you feel. Eventually, when you feel and think it's strong enough, drop by the chat and maybe someone else can try to confirm it for you. Or find an online friend to play "Pass the Construct" and see how well you do.</p>

                  <p>You shouldn't be worried unless you constantly piss off people with more skill than you. If you don't do anything out of the ordinary, chances are you won't just randomally be attacked. There is no "best" shield, if there was everyone would just use that. If I were you, I wouldn't worry about
                  being attacked, and only work on shielding as a way to control perceptive abilities - for example, you need to know how to shield if you want to control empathy. Or telepathy. And no, I don't think you started too soon, 13 seems to be a popular age <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>I have trouble sensing energy but do have positive results when manipulating it, ie. I can create a fairly dense psi ball, the trouble mostly comes when I try to keep track of the energy afterwards to throw it or even just leaving in one spot then being able to find it again easily. I have tried
                  to shell it and still have some trouble making sure it doesn't end up lost. How can I over come this please?</p>

                  <p>"Manipulating" psi-stuff and "Sensing" psi-stuff are two separate skills, sort of like the difference between being able to play the piano and being able to sing a line of music after hearing it once.</p>

                  <p>We get this question rather frequently, and there is very little variation in the wording.</p>

                  <p>First, re-read the instructions for making a psiball. In fact, read several different sets of instructions for making a psiball. The little spheroids have become very popular over the past several years, and you'll find many (slight) variations on the general theme.</p>

                  <p>Then, once you've read them. See if you understand them. Try paraphrasing the directions.</p>

                  <p>Third, try it again.</p>

                  <p>On the other hand, _making_ a construct and _perceiving_ a construct are two separate abilities. Have you checked to see if anyone _else_ perceived your results or lack thereof?</p>

                  circiling around me and feeding off me...then at school i was cold so i programed it to heat up...is this possible....like keep a construct up forever feeding of things to wait your every command until you die?<br /></p>

                  <p>The question is not meant for self gain. Can psi-balls or some form of telepathy, make someone (not love) but pay more attention to you? If so would this be labeled Empathy, Manipulation, what? Also, again, not for personal gain, can you make people pay less attention to a person?</p>

                  <p>Whether it is for self-gain or not has no bearing on the answer. "Making" someone pay attention to you, and "making" someone pay less attention to you, are both applications of telepathy. The least invasive method is to project either "over here! Hey, I'm here" impressions or "no-one here but us
                  chickens; look anywhere but here" impressions, either actively or from a shield-form.</p>
