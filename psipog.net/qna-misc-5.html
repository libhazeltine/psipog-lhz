               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hello!</p>

                  <p>First: thank you for this well-organized and invaluable resource! Information of this type tends to be obscured by hazy writing and poor website design -- congrats on breaking the obfuscation trend. :)</p>

                  <p>Second: I confess that I'm a skeptic by nature. However, I am also very open to the idea that there are bits of science out there yet to be discovered. It's absurd to assume we've already discovered all the secrets. I discovered psionics recently, and, although I haven't achieved any success
                  myself, I'm open to the idea this may be real.</p>

                  <p>I've been practicing for a short time every day. I'm busy with work and college, so I don't have as much time as I'd like. I haven't been able to feel any psi, yet, so I remain uncertain. Hovering at the back of my mind is the idea that the reports of success may be wishful thinking, or strong
                  self-hypnosis of some kind. But I would love to be able to do this, so I continue to try...</p>

                  <p>I notice that most of this site's users are very young. Many of them are in their early teens. More power to them... However, that is a more suggestible age. How old are peebrain, rainsong, and the other moderators? I'd love short biographies (new section of the site?) that might serve as
                  inspiration to keep at the practicing.</p>

                  <p>Thanks again! Whatever else, I'm having fun with the research. I hope I get it to work.</p>

                  <p>Thanks for your compliments <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Most of the staff here has passed the "teen age" era. I will only speak for myself because I want to respect the privacy rights of the other authors. I started my training when I was 15, and I'm currently 21. I originally started learning from Active Psy (which you can access from the Links
                  section, and is logged on the psipog.net server). From there, I learned how to make a psi ball. I visited a forum where I met Rainsong, and she helped me immensly. She has 20+ years experience. After that, a lot of my training has been just motivating myself to try new things... and then talking to
                  other people about new things to try. PsiPog.net helps me just as much as it helps everyone else - I get a shit load of valuable input from everybody, and I incorporate that into my training.</p>

                  <p>Skepticism is healthy. You sound like you have a good philosophy - I mean, at this point from your perspective, yeah it COULD be bogus. So investigate and try things out. Keep an open mind, but don't be gullable. Sounds healthy to me <img src="smile.gif"

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Glad to read a post by someone with some healthy skepticism. Skepticism is good.</p>

                  <p>At the time of this typing, I'm 33. Not much in the way of a biography, though: I'm a biologist, who has also been involved in psionic research (as subject in some projects, research assistant in others, and as lead researcher in still others). Peebrain said "20+ years" out of courtesy, not
                  wishing to reveal my age, I think. In truth, it is "30+"; I've been at this since I was a wee bairn.</p>

                  <p>Some parts of psionics I _still_ think are mightily improbable, even parts I have done. Psionics itself, however, was a "normal" part of my life.</p>

                  <p>A few of the "staff" showed up as "Debunkers", but honest debunkers. Experimentation led them to the conclusion that at least _some_ of this stuff is real. NI, for example, was one of these.</p>

                  <p>They share a lot of similarities... I personally don't like explaining things through fictional ideas because sometimes that can take your focus off of figuring out what psi really is, and instead you start to focus on how psi is like &lt;insert fictional psychic force here&gt;.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I figured if I wish to learn this psi stuff its better to take it step by step before jumping face first into the water. I used to meditate some, but never really understood when I was in a meditative state, if thats what its called. I use the breathing method of meditation, focus just on your
                  breath and hope a itch doesnt pop up somewhere on your body and ruin it. Ive got to the point that when I start meditating like 5 or 10 secs into it I start feeling a tingling all around my body, and I focus on that to intensify the tingling while still focusing on my breathing. Is that a meditative
                  state. Any help is appreciated. Thanks<br />

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>That sounds like you might be hitting a meditative state... although 5 to 10 seconds is a pretty short time. (Maybe you're sitting uncomfortably, and your body parts are going numb? <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"

                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />).</p>

                  <p>The key to meditating is to just calm your mind down and let it sit still for a while. Meditating doesn't really produce a tingling sensation (although I can see how it could in some cases)... it's more of a mental thing. What you might be doing is part meditation, part something else - perhaps
                  you are messing around with psi while meditating and that is what's producing the tingling.</p>

                  <p>Either way, there's no need to be worried about the technicallities of what is going on. When you meditate, you just RELAX. Relax your body, relax your mind. Sometimes weird things happen when you are relaxed for a long period of time. When the weird stuff happens, take a mental note of it, shrug
                  it off, then go back to meditating <img src="smile.gif"

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I've not been on this site long, but find it very interesting. I wanted to ask a question about the CNS (central nervous system, i.e. brain and spinal cord). I've read in some articles that over-extending yourself during any psychic practice runs the risk of cardiac arrest (which makes sense -
                  it's the same for physical exertion) From what I've read, I've come to understand that this is due to the CNS not being able to carry the amount of energy that the individual is pushing it to. My question: does the nervous system have the ability to cope with larger amounts of energy with practice
                  (like working a muscle), and is there a cut-off point to the maximum possible amount it can carry (e.g. no human can lift more than, say, a car)? I apologise for the length of the question, and thank in advance anyone who takes the time to answer it.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>That's a good question. Unfortunately, it is not known for certain what the limits actually are, nor whether they can be extended by practice (as far as I am aware, at least...there may be some new data somewhere).</p>

                  <p>In some cases, relatively minor effects have resulted in the death of the practitioner, apparently because of the inefficiency of the approach used -- too much effort exerted, for the body to tolerate, even though the actual end result was well within the usual tolerances.</p>

                  <p>One of the examples that springs to mind is a woman who needed to work herself up for extended periods of time (often measured in hours), just to move some matchsticks around. There is a reasonable chance that it was the preliminary "working up" that eventually killed her, rather than the actual
                  psychokinetic effects she produced. That would be Nina Kulagina, for those of you who might be wondering.</p>

                  <p>I expect that there is a "cut-off" point, but exactly what it _is_ has not yet been established.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I read somewhere (and saw soem video's) of a famous woman who used to demonstrate PK for scientists as they monitered her. From what i read it claimed that she was one of the best around...</p>

                  <p>Apparently she made a cluster of math sticks explode outwards around a table, and them drew them in again using PK back into a little pile in the center of the table. Whilst she was doing this her heart rate increased to such a level that she had a sevre heart attack and was rushed to
                  hospital.</p>

                  <p>I can't help but wonder how 'the best around' sufferes from heart attacks after moving 10+ match sticks across a table, when some of you guys can move objects are big and heavy as cars with no trouble?</p>

                  <p>If you're thinking of Nina Kulagina, there are several things about her body's responses to her PK that are different from the usual ones. For example, her blood sugar was reported to spike rather than drop when she was doing PK. Also, she was reported to work herself into a sort of frenzy,
                  sometimes for hours, before doing her stuff. That adds to the stress on the body.</p>

                  <p>Hey I'm trying to build a strong connecton with my subconscious and I heard a way to do this was through meditation. So while I was meditating I had the strong urge to crack my knuckles and I was wondering if it was my subconscious telling me to through emotions or was it just me?</p>

                  <p>Thanks in advance</p>

                  <p>This is a common mistake, perhaps because of the way I word my articles on the subconscious. Was it your subconscious telling you, or was it just you? Your subconscious IS PART OF YOU. That's like asking, "Was it me, or was it me?".</p>

                  <p>The hard part with the subconscious is differentiating between imagination and legitimate information. Stuff from your imagination comes from the conscious mind thinking too much, or expecting something, or not being patient enough to receive something legit. To fix that, you just have to shut
                  your conscious mind up. That's where meditation comes into play.</p>

                  <p>When you meditate, you are basically trying to either focus your conscious mind on one thing (or nothing) and not let it wander around. Once you get a feel for what a quiet conscious mind "sounds" like, it's a lot easier to figure out when you are receiving legit information or not.</p>

                  <p>As an exercise, try posing yourself some questions. Ask something you've been wanting to know, then sit around and wait for an answer. Some things I've asked my subconsciousness lately include things like, "How is my dad doing?", "Does my mom need me to call her?", "Should I buy some snacks while
                  at the store?"... Granted, not the most important things in the world I could be asking, but you get the idea. Ask something. Wait for a reply.</p>
