                  <p>are there any diference between psi and ki?<br />

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Good question... a pretty common question too. There are a few ways to answer this question. The first, and most obvious way, is to look at the technical definitions:</p>

                  <p>Psi - The unknown mechanism that allows PK, and ESP to function.</p>

                  <p>Ki/Chi - The vital force believed in Taoism and other Chinese thought to be inherent in all things. ( <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chi"
                     target="_blank">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chi</a> )</p>

                  <p>So, according to the definitions, I suppose the question would be: is chi what allows PK and ESP to function? I don't know enough about chi or PK or ESP to comment on it <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       border="0"
                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />.</p>

                  <p>Or you can interpret the psi/chi difference based on what it actually IS. Is it the same mechanism, but just a different label for it? Or are they different mechanisms?</p>

                  <p>The major problem is: no one really knows what the mechanism is. People say things like "life force", or "glob of energy" - but really when you break it down, we don't know. Psi is defined as unknown <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       border="0"
                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />. It kind of puts you in a hard position when you want to compare it to other things. Psi could, in theory, be a group of mechanisms. One of the mechanisms in the group labelled as "Psi" could be chi. Or perhaps chi is a group of multiple mechanisms too. Perhaps some places
                       they overlap, and other places they don't.</p>

                  <p>It's a good question, but I'm afraid no one really has a straight answer. If both interest you, practice both - and decide for yourself.</p>

                  <p>Hey I've got a question about teleportation and the "forbidden" act of phasing. Say I somehow teleported from one location to another. Would my clothes come with me or just drop to the floor where I originally was? Same applies to phasing, if I was wearing a ring and phased my hand through a wall
                  would the ring come off or come with or what? Rainsong?</p>

                  <p>It's not "forbidden", just dangerous to the point of stupidity. It appears that the clothes go with you, in both cases, but I have no idea why it seems to have happened this way. In the case of teleportation, I am basing this on hearsay evidence only, to give you a clear idea of the reliability of
                  the information.</p>

                  <p>I read peebrains seminar on OBE's, and was practicing at night time. When I was really relaxed, I thought I was about to have one.

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hi, I have a few questions on communicating with your subconcsious.</p>

                  <p>For the moderators that can communicate with the subconscious, I was wondering where the "feelings" that the subconscious sends are felt in? Is it around the heart area, head, throughout the whole body, etc? Also, once you get good at communicating to your subconscious through words, and you want
                  something from it, do you just ask it through words? Like.. If I wanted normal vision, do I just say "improve my vision until it's 20/20" once and it'll eventually happen?</p>

                  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Usually the feelings are in my head... I guess. My subconscious can "transfer" feelings to me in my heart area too, or my entire body for that matter. Usually my head though.</p>

                  <p>And yes, you can say things like "improve my vision until it's 20/20" to your subconscious. It helps keep you healthy too.</p>

                  <p>Do you know any good methods to "wake up" during sleep paralisys? This happens to me sometimes, and those times I feel like "detached" from my body.

                  <p>i have a question about OBEs.<br />
                  a few nights ago i was trying for one, i had relaxed my body as much as i could and was focusing on my objective. i belive i did it, my hand felt like it was descending in to my bed and i felt something hard underneath, my floor.<br />
                  the confusing part is that before my "hand" went "through the bed" i hadn't felt any prior vibrations, so what i realy want to ask is, is it possible to have a minor OBE (say, just a hand) without any prior vibrations?</p>

                  <p>The "vibrations" are often reported. However, they do not always occur, in cases of "OBE". It's possible to have regular and repeated "out of body experiences" without ever feeling a vibration.</p>
