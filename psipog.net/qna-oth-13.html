                  <p>When you have charged or imprinted an object (or person), how long does the charge stay there? Is it there indefinitely or will it just dissipate away with time?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Some objects remain charged for decades. Others lose their charge in a matter of minutes. It seems to vary with the kind of "charge", the circumstances of the charging, the substance of which the object is made, and the sheer amount of "oomph" involved. There are probably other factors, too.</p>

                  <p>It was a gradual process, not a "oh look, it works now". It's all about just listening for the answer, and decoding it. Your skill in both increases slowly over time, and eventually you can have conversations.</p>

                  <p>Not that I have noticed. It seems to be unrelated to psi in every way... except when you OBE a lot, you get better at psionics, strangely enough. It's all really still "unknown".</p>

                  <p>A lucid dream refers to one in which you know you are dreaming, while you are dreaming. Quite often, you can control the progress of such a dream, but the control does not define the lucidity. Awareness does.</p>

                  <p>In simple terms, it is an attempt to establish that what a person is experiencing is neither dream, nor hallucination. In other words, it is some way to see whether something has objective reality. In philosophical terms, this is often regarded as impossible. ;)</p>

                  <p>1) That is what happened most often, in my case. I do not phase deliberately, however, so to say the I can phase one part of my body through something would be misleading.</p>

                  <p>2) There are no articles about it because we do not know how to do it. If you care to experiment with it, check out sites about Quantum Teleportation. Any decent websearch will find quite a few sites about it, if you are disinclined to read books.</p>
