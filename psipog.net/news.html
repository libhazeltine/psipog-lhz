                  <p>PsiPog.net is not shutting down. It is being archived. This means that you can still type "psipog.net" into your webbrowser, and you'll still come here, and you can still browse ALL the articles, ALL the Q&amp;A, and everything else. It will ALL be here, and I am not getting rid of any
                  information.</p>

                  <p>The only thing that I am shutting down are the interactive portions of the site. That means that you can still access the Q&amp;A, but you won't be able to submit new questions. You won't be able to "log in". You won't be able to send PM's to people. You won't be able to post messages on the
                  message board. The chat will not exist. These are the interactive portions of the website that will be halted.</p>

                  <p>Please stop telling me how horrible I am for getting rid of this information. I am NOT getting rid of any information <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />! It will all be here - so relax. What I am getting rid of is my own personal involvement with PsiPog.net, which means all interactive portions of the site. Hosting an archive doesn't require me to be involved, and I'll be free to work on my future projects. Interactive
                       portions do require me to be involved, and it will keep me back from creating my next project.</p>

                  <p>If you think that it totally sucks that there won't be any forums or chat, then just sit back in your chair and breathe for a second. There are a million forums out there, and a billion chat rooms. Check out the <a href="links.html">links section</a> for some other awesome communities that you can
                  visit for your forum and chat needs.</p>

                  <p>But most of all, for the love of God, focus on what is important. Is it really important that you won't be able to spend wasted hours on my forum? Consider this a liberation, and use it to re-focus on your true goals. Stop falling prey to this community drama, and start DOING your own thing. Sit
                  and think about it.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>After a lot of thinking, I've decided that it's time for PsiPog to come to an end. It has a lot to do with my own realizations on why I created PsiPog in the first place, and what is important in life in general. I plan on archiving PsiPog over the following months - so don't think that this
                  information will be "lost", or anything like that. PsiPog generates enough money from advertising to support it's own existance, so the only real change is that I'm going to shut down the forums, disable membership, close the Q&amp;A to more questions, and shut down the chat. Basically, all the
                  interactive parts.</p>

                  <p>I'm not doing this all at once! This will be a slow process over the next 6 months to a year. But it's the direction we need to move in. I do plan to start another website based off of my new understanding of my entire experience, but it is in conflict with the ideals of PsiPog. Which is why
                  PsiPog has to be archived.</p>

                  <p>If you'd like to hear more about why I feel PsiPog needs to end, then please read my blog entry, <a href="blog/2006/08/re-interpretation-of-psipog.html">by clicking here</a>. Thanks for everyone's support, and I look forward to the next incarnation of our understanding.</p>

                  <p>Howdy,<br />
                  So for the past while, I've been denying new articles to the website, because I wanted people to wait until I got the new PsiPog.net up and running. I didn't want to bother with the current article system.</p>

                  <p>But I've been working on this new system for quite a while now, and it bothers me when someone sends me a good article, and I have to deny it because the new system isn't ready. So I made a temporary solution. I have a temporary article submission system in place, and I've given a group of smart
                  people access to it.</p>

                  <p>So everyone should start seeing new articles soon. At the very least, I'm going to start writing and posting articles I've personally been saving up. To see the newest articles, go to the <a href="articles.html">Articles</a> section, and scroll down to the "Top Ten Most Recent Articles" list.</p>

                  <p>Hopefully this will get some new information flowing around <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Edit: And it did! We have seven new articles up already, and I continue to expect more:</p>

                  <p>Howdy!<br />
                  PsiPog.net has recently been linked to by an article on <a href="http://stevepavlina.com"
                     target="_blank">StevePavlina.com</a>, a popular website on Personal Development. First, that's awesome <img src="smile.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Smiley"
                       class="smileyImg" />! I've been a reader of Steve Pavlina's site for a while (as shown in these news entries, back in November of 2005). The guy is cool as hell, and he talks a lot about things that apply directly to psionics, like beliefs and fear. He is starting a new category for his
                       articles, labelled "Psychic Development", and I can't wait to hear his take on things. His first blog on the topic is already a great read.</p>

                  <p>If this is your first time at PsiPog, and you found it by following the links in Steve's blog, then welcome <img src="smile.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Smiley"
                       class="smileyImg" />! The majority of information on psionics is in the <a href="articles.html">Articles</a> section, so feel free to browse around. If you have questions, your best bet is to <a href="search.php">Search</a> the site first, but if you still can't find an answer, you can either
                       <a href="http://psipogbb.net">visit the forums</a> or <a href="qna.html">submit a question in the Q&amp;A</a>. If you really have no clue where to begin, you can get an overview of psionics by reading my free eBook, located <a href="ebook.html">here</a>. Thanks for visiting, and thanks to Steve

                  <p>Someone e-mailed me, suggesting I check out a magician, Derren Brown. A quick google search brings up <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/M/mindcontrol/video/">THIS SITE</a>. This is really awesome, and while it is magic, I believe the implications of his tricks might be
                  useful to our understanding of psionics. Check them out! (I'm not implying that psionics is an illusion or trick in the mind, rather I want to point out how powerful situations, beliefs, and thought processes affect perception of reality).</p>

                  <p>The test with the new chatting system went pretty well! Sure we got in trouble because the bot misbehaved and pissed off the guys at darkmyst.org... BUT they forgave us and we got the major bugs fixed <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>I estimate it will take 1-2 weeks before the entire system is done. Once it is done, the chat will be open to ANY client (PsiPog Chat Client if you still want, or any other one).</p>

                  <p>Until then, the chat might be a little unstable while I balance between the two systems. I'll post another news entry when EVERYTHING is complete, and we switch systems entirely for good.</p>

                  <p>For the record, the chat is back the way it used to be for the time being: You MUST use the PsiPog Chat Client to chat.</p>

                  <p>Ok, so I've sort of hacked together a bot for the chat room. Chances are it's a little buggy, but I'm going to let it run for the weekend and see how things go.</p>

                  <p>You can NOT chat with the PsiPog Chat Client while the bot is activated (I haven't updated the client to work with the bot), but you CAN chat with any other client! For example, <a href="http://www.mirc.com/">mIRC</a> is a very popular client.</p>

                  <p>Point your settings to <b>irc.darkmyst.org</b>, and <b>/join #psipog_lobby</b> .</p>

                  <p>For those of you that don't know what that means, boot up mIRC and cancel out all those screens that pop up right away. Then type: <b>/server irc.darkmyst.org</b> - wait until it connects, then type: <b>/join #psipog_lobby</b> and follow the instructions from there. PM me if you have problem (via
                  <b>/msg [peebrain] help!</b> )</p>

                  <p>The chat will probably be buggy while I get it up and running, but try it out and let me know what you think!</p>

                  <p>I officially have internet! Hurray!</p>

                  <p>So... it's time to get PsiPog.net going again. I have a lot of plans and ideas. What I want to do (before I start getting to work) is to hold a meeting for EVERYONE to attend. I want to hear EVERYONE's ideas and comments about PsiPog.net and the community (that doesn't really exist right now
                  <img src="blah.gif"

Hopefully it'll be soon, like next Saturday, but I'm waiting for some things and I need to get an outline going too. So if you're interested in being a voice in the community, and helping
                       improve PsiPog, keep checking the calendar for when this meeting will take place.</p>

                  So I've finally graduated Basic Training - hurray! Unfortunately, my Tech School is being retarded and not letting me use my computer for another month. And the lab computers are complete crap (Windows ... 98?!). I'll try to keep things updated, but it'll be hard until I get MY computer up and
                  running. Nonetheless, it feels good to be out of Basic Training, and I have SOME freedom now. I'll try to resurrect the Newsletter, and start sorting out possible new Articles. I won't be allowed to chat on lab computers, but hopefully I can get some work done on the site.</p>

                  <p>Hey guys! Peebs, with is super haxxor skills, was able to get an email to us and had a message for all of you: "Hey everyone! I'm nearly out of Basic Training and PsiPog should be getting updated more often once I get back. I'll be graduating at the end of April, and should be back online during
                  the first week of May. The server that hosts PsiPog is acting up a little bit, and I can't fix it from this lab computer, so don't flip out if the website goes down. It WILL be back up once I get on my own computer during the first week of May. (Or the site might not go down at all... we'll see).
                  Thanks for continuing to visit, and thanks to all the moderators for stepping up to help out! Keep practicing and don't forget to have fun... and if you think your life sucks, try to appreciate the little things like not getting screamed at every 15 minutes ;-)."</p>

                  <p>Well, Peebrain is now in basic. We all wish him the best of luck, and look forward to his triumphant return sometime this May.

                  I'm going to be gone for a little while. I've joined the United States Air Force, and I'll be going to Basic Training on March 15th. I won't have access to the internet until I graduate Basic Training, which should be around the first week in May (hopefully <img src="blah.gif"

                  If you are reading this, then you are somebody interested in psionics in one aspect or another. Even though we are scattered all over the world, we are all connected by this same interest. Maybe you're somebody who wants to learn to make things fly across the room with telekinesis, or you might be
                  somebody who hears other's thoughts and want to learn control, or maybe you can't do anything and you're skeptical of it all!</p>

                  <p>Either way, we all share the same interest one way or another. In the future we will have forums, but until then our sense of community is hard to feel. But that doesn't mean your thoughts and ideas don't have an impact on PsiPog. Here is your chance to be heard and make a difference!</p>

                  <p>PsiPog is cool, and we work hard on it - but it can be better. It's not a finished product; there is always something that can change and improve it. I want your ideas on ANYTHING related to PsiPog or psionics. What features do you think would be cool? What events do you think would be fun to
                  attend? How can we make what we currently have work better? I have ideas myself, but I'm not egotistical enough to think I can come up with every cool idea <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>The students have been chosen for the Telepathy Groups. Jespers isn't going to teach, and I don't think eversosleepy is going to teach either. To fill the void, myself and annie have taken students.</p>

                  <p>Not everyone has responded to our e-mails, so here is the official roster. If you haven't gotten an e-mail from your teacher, and you're on this list, please report to the chat room or send a message to your teacher using <a href="index.html">PsiPog Mail</a>.</p>

                  <p>Hey hey!<br />
                  Would you like to be trained in telepathy by the PsiPog Staff? Do you think you'll be a dedicated and awesome student? Would you work hard if you had the opportunity? Do you like learning in a group setting?</p>

                  <p>PsiPog.net is trying something new - we're going to take a few groups of students, and teach them telepathy techniques, and try out new techniques. There will be three groups of students, one for each teacher (Jesper's students, eversosleepy's students, and Roy's students). For more information,
                  and a way to sign up for this awesome opportunity, <a href="groups.php">click here</a>!</p>

                  <p>This is all free; we just want to get some dedicated students to try some new ideas, and hopefully learn something that the entire community can benefit from. Click on the <a href="groups.php">link above</a> to learn more, and submit your application.</p>

                  <p>Hey all,<br />
                  Just giving you an update on what's been going on. Annie has a manual in draft form, that should be online soon, and I'm working on a manual as well... although I've still got a lot of work to do <img src="blah.gif"

                       class="smileyImg" />. I might also pound out another REAL article (not that boring "How to Practice" junk <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />) before my manual comes out. Also, I'll be putting that log up from the Telepathy Lecture/Practice thing. But not yet.</p>

                  <p>I'm also working on the new design, to get it finished before Thanksgiving. And I'm working on the new chat too, which will be 100x better than what we're currently doing. (I bet a lot of people out there will like the surprises I have for the new chat).</p>

                  <p>So.... nothing new THIS SECOND, but there will be. Also, if you didn't know, PsiPog.net sends out new material every other Tuesday in our newsletter. <a href="newsletter.php">Click here</a> to read about how to join, and previous newsletters.</p>

                  We're trying something new again - this time we want to do a huge lecture and practice session, all at once. <a href="calendar.php?view=1&amp;day=1099785600">Read more about it HERE</a>.</p>

                  <p>Myself, annie, SunTzu, and Brandon.</p>

                  <p>So that's good. I have two planned (although I don't remember what about this second <img src="blah.gif"

Other than that, the first newsletter went out this morning. If you want to join, look below and submit your e-mail address. If you want
                  to read the newsletter, then <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/psipog_newsletter/messages">click here</a>. They are available to the public and don't require any registration with Yahoo. And, what the hell, here's three more gmail invitations: <a href=

                  Things have changed slightly around PsiPog.net. You might not notice a huge change, but internally I reorganized a lot of stuff to make everything run a lot more quickly (which translates to costing me less money).</p>

                  <p>Well, if you just recently tried to get on PsiPog.net, you would have seen we were "Suspended" by my hosting company. No need to worry - the reason was because we're too popular and we were overloading the server.</p>

                  <p>So I upgraded our "hosting plan", and we should be ok for some time now (until they shut us off randomally again, and I upgrade... again <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>Howdy all,<br />
                  The chatters convinced me to do a lecture on Advanced Constructs. Read the event by <a href="calendar.php?view=1&amp;day=1092006000">clicking here</a> for more details.</p>

                  <p>Also, I've finished the PsiPog Pic program. You can download the latest version here: <a href="PsiPogPic11.zip">PsiPog Pic v1.1</a>. Most of you are probably like "what the hell is that?". It allows you to draw pictures and transfer them in a small amount of data... it might not
                  be too useful right now, but I plan on incorporating it into the new chat client. Test it out, and let me know if you find any bugs.</p>

                  <p>Other than that, I am working on some projects for the website... I plan on having a larger update in a month or so perhaps. Articles, client, new stuff, etc... For some reason I like to do it all at once <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>And before I post this - thank you for all your support concerning the Google Ads! A lot of people offered help, and a lot of people are helping out, and it's really cool <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Other than that, I hope your July treated you well, and have an awesome August <img src="smile.gif"

                  Yes that's right, I've added Google Ads to PsiPog.net. To be honest, I am BROKE, and I would rather add some advertisements than shut down PsiPog. Since I hate ads so much, and I don't WANT do force people to see silly ads, I made it so you can remove the ads if you are a member of PsiPog. It's free
                  to join, and all you have to do is go to Preferences and remove them. That's it. So, if you want help out, click on a few ads for me. Or if you want to be a freeloader (which is cool, that's what I would do <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />), then just go in your Preferences, and remove the ads. I think that's fair.</p>

                  <p>Yo!<br />
                  I'm really excited <img src="smile.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"

                       class="smileyImg" />. I'm still working on Chat Client v4, and it's going real good, but I still have a ton of work left. I thought I would list some features I plan on adding, just to get you guys excited too. This won't be out for a little while, and this list may change in the future, but
                       here's what I'm thinking:</p>

                  <p>1. You login with your PsiPog.net username and password, and that is your nickname (no more IRC nicknames, and no more /nick'ing).</p>

                  <p>2. If you can't /nick to change your away state, how will you go away? I plan on having Away Messages.</p>

                  <p>3. Security is 100 times better. We can keep the annoying chatters out a LOT easier. Mods will see this directly, and regular chatters will see it indirectly. Less ban evasion, less annoying people, more cool people who can follow the rules.</p>

                  <p>4. This is what I've been working on the past couple days - I am adding a "doodle" type of thing. What you can do is draw a simple picture, and send it to people. This will be great for RV practices (draw a picture of what you see, and send it to the room, and everyone else can view it). <a href=
                  "http://psipog.net/psipogpic.png">Here is a screen shot of a beta-version</a>.</p>

                  <p>5. I'm thinking of adding some computer/psi type games, that you can practice with a partner or group with. I'll try to think of games for all the major skills, and have games for each.</p>

                  <p>6. Tons of other cool ideas that I think of between now and the time I release it. If you have super cool ideas, and you think it's in reason, send me a message.</p>

Oh well, I just wanted everyone to know I'm not just sitting on my ass over here doing nothing, I <i>am</i> working on the client, but
                  it just needs a lot of work before it's ready. So, continue with your lives...</p>

In other good news, I bought <a href="http://tinyurl.com/26hwe">You Are Psychic!</a> by Pete Sanders Jr. I've read maybe a third of it and it's a pretty cool book. If you have $15 to kill and want a different perspective on psychic things, take a gander. The book breaks all
                       psychic experiences into four categories: psychic vision, psychic hearing, psychic feeling, and psychic intuition. It also has some cool visualizations you can do to enhance each of those four categories. Other than that, I've been kind of busy doing "normal real life"-stuff. Perhaps I can
                       motivate myself to get some work on PsiPog done in the next week or two. We'll see.</p>

                  <p>Alrighty...<br />
                  So I have some more bad news. I know, two bad news things in a row, I suck <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />. I'll try to get some good things going again after I finish with this.</p>

                  <p>GreatSheepKing has requested that I remove his articles... again. Yeah. This would be the second time. I don't like being a dickhead, but I'm kind of cornered into being one. I'll never post them again, and I'll never allow GSK to come in the chat room. I won't lie, I do have some "hard feelings",
                  but GSK's reasons for removing the articles suggest that he'll never want to go in the chat room, or do ANYTHING psi related ever again. So be it.</p>

                  <p>If you're looking for reasons "why", I'll paste some quotes that GSK gave me in his e-mail.</p>

                  <p><i>"Firstly, I have seen that within my time visiting Psi Websites ... that there is a drive, a desire, a wish to gain some form of power that we don't need, and that we shouldn't really have."</i></p>

                  <p>Assuming I'm reading this correctly, this means GSK believes we shouldn't even have psychic abilities. Obviously I disagree <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />. I find nothing wrong with wanting to learn more about your environment - that's how humans figure things out. We aren't taking drugs, we aren't spending tons of cash, we aren't hurting anyone... We are just looking inside ourselves and seeing what's up with that cool device
                       given to us called a "brain". How does it work? What can we do with it? Beats me! But I have a fun time trying to figure it out <img src="smile.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Smiley"
                       class="smileyImg" />.</p>

                  <p><i>"Secondly, The practice of Psi breeds contention"</i></p>

                  <p>I had to pull out my <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=contention">dictionary</a> for "contention"... He's claiming that the practice of psi leads to competition and arguing. Perhaps it does, and perhaps it doesn't... If it does, is that a bad thing? Competition is a good thing,
                  and so is arguing (assuming you don't rip each others eye lashes out from disagreement <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />).</p>

                  <p>And lastly... GSK has given us a question:</p>

                  <p><i>"I ask you now, all of you, what have you truly gained? And from then, I ask you what you've lost? Your morals? Your values? Perhaps... Your precious time?"</i></p>

                  <p>Well, I've give my answer, and you guys reading can come up with your own. This is a great question. What have I truly gained? I understand that I'm slightly emotional now, because I'm kind of mad, but I'll give this question some serious thought before I type some more. Do I do it for power? For
                  fame? Maybe a little bit. But really, after sitting here thinking for the past 15 minutes, I know exactly what I do it for. And I know exactly what I've gained.</p>

                  <p>I remember the first time I moved something with telekinesis. I was sitting in my bedroom with a key hanging from the ceiling on some string, watching TV and banging my head against my bed because I couldn't get that damn key to move. I was 15 and I had been trying to move that freaking key for
                  hours. The normal things kept popping in my head "this stuff is bullshit", "you can't do that, you know you can't, so give up", "this sucks". Hehe <img src="smile.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Smiley"
                       class="smileyImg" />. I was sitting next to it on my carpet and looked over to it, just daydreaming. It suddenly spun around in the weirdest way - a quick jerk to get it going, and a quick jerk to stop it after it went around once. I stared in amazement. Complete awe. There was no PsiPog, there
                       was no community, it was just me with the craziest idea that the other people out there who claimed to do this wern't nuts. Or at least, not all of them were nuts <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />. You know what I did after I realized I actually accomplished it? I exploded with excitement, and ran around my house with the biggest smile on my face. I didn't try to move that key so I could beat someone up at school. I didn't do it because I wanted to piss someone off. I
                       didn't want a million dollars, and I didn't want to tell people "I told you so!". For me, it's about the discovery. The rush of excitement of accomplishing a goal that you've been practicing so hard for. Others told me that I couldn't do it, but more importnatly, I told MYSELF that I couldn't do
                       it. But I did do it. I think a lot of people that visit PsiPog know that feeling that I'm talking about. I think GreatSheepKing knows that feeling, though he may have forgotten it, or brushed it aside because of something else.</p>

                  <p>I love the feeling of discovery. I love to learn! (Yes, I'm a nerd <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />). What have I gained? What do you gain from learning a musical instrument? I've been teaching myself how to play a guitar for almost two years now. I won't be in a band. I won't be a rock star. I won't get paid for playing guitar - in fact I've spent a couple hundred dollars
                       for all the equipment. But when I sit in a room with my friends, we can joke around, and sing to a few select songs that I know how to play (and sound absolutely horriable <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />). When I go into the PsiPog chat room, I can talk to kids who have that same excitement that I do. That want to learn because they love learning about how to do cool things, and get excited when they have a good practice session. I love to be a part of setting that up, and
                       making that possible with PsiPog. I love hearing new theories on how something works, or holding an online party to do something weird and interesting. I love when someone approaches me with this new thing they've been working on, and that sparks an idea in my head to try something too. We share
                       our ideas, we share our experiences. We don't go around and try to hurt each other. We don't try to spread nonsense either. We're not professional scientists, but we can think logically. We have a brain and we want to push the limits.</p>

                  <p>Have I lost my morals or values? Absolutely not. I'm not perfect, but I know I'm not a bad guy. And I know the majority of people out there reading this aren't bad people either. I think there are a lot of people out there that have the same feeling that I do.</p>

                  <p>So, yeah, I'll step off the soap box now <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />.</p>

                  <p>Hehe... But yeah. I feel better actually! Perhaps I needed to get that off my chest to remind myself and everyone else what it's all about at PsiPog. This stuff is cool! And yeah, it sucks that I have to remove GSK's articles, and I am going to be a dickhead and not let him post anything or come
                  and chat, but this is the hand I've been delt with. And if you agree with GSK, and think that psi is immoral or whatever, feel free to hit that [X] button on the top right corner of your screen <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />. If you've actually read this far, then I have a treat for you - I've updated the <a href="links.html">links section</a> to include some smaller websites that deal with psi. Not scientific studies and stuff like that, just other communities that I've come across and thought
                       were cool. As with anything on the internet, always set your skepticism level on "high", but I personally liked the sites, so maybe you will too.</p>

                  Got some bad news, but hey, don't let it get you down. First thing is that, if you read the flare party summary, you noticed how I asked for someone to give me a screenshot of the 8:28:30 spot. Well, someone luckily had it, but no flare was present like in the shot Astrodude15 sent me. So yeah, that

                  The flare party is over! It was cool, nearly 100 people showed up which just blows my mind, and we got some weird results <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>Alright, the official time and day has been set up for the Flare Party! It is May 29th (Saturday), at <a href=index.html>7pm EST</a>. Be there! Because it will be really fun!</p>

                  <p>The basic idea is, we get everyone together, and try to flare a psi ball in one location on a web-cam that we are all watching. ("flare" means to make the psi ball visible, which is why we'll use the web-cam, so everyone can see it!). Before you decide if you want to come or not, read <a href=
                  "http://www.psipog.net/calendar.php?view=1&amp;day=1085871600">this page</a>. If you do not read it, and you come and annoy me, I will be mad until I ban you, then I will return to feeling happy <img src="blah.gif"

                  Ok, I just got done reviewing 13 of the 50 or so articles in my inbox. Some good submissions in there that I plan on posting in a few days, assuming we can get it all figured out and everything, so look forward to those. I'll be hammering away at the rest of the submissions day by day.</p>

                  <p>The WebCam thing so far is doing ok. I talked to stony1205 and we got some things set up, but it's a little buggy. Hopefully we can get some bugs worked out and everything going smoothly. If not, I know some more people PMed me about WebCams they can offer, so I might be needing their help. Thanks
                  for offering your help guys <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Also, I'll be puttering around some source code today, so you might see some new features on PsiPog.net, maybe not, depends if I get something cool up <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>Howdy howdy!<br />
                  I've just been discussing some cool new fun ideas in the chat room with everyone, and we all had an idea to create a big ass flaring psi ball all together. So, the plan is, we want to get someone with a fast connection and a webcam to volunteer and play along with us. We'll get everyone in the
                  practice room and all try to flare to the one location, and make a real dense psi ball. Then we can all watch it over the webcam and hopefully it will be really cool <img src="smile.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Smiley"
                       class="smileyImg" />!</p>

                  <p>So: before this happens, we need a volunteer for the webcam. When we get that settled, I'll post the official date in the Calendar and try to get people to come. But the first step is get the webcam guy. So if you have a fast connection to the internet (DSL, Cable), and you have a webcam, and you
                  want to help us make a cool flaring psi ball, then PM me using <a href="index.html">PsiPog Mail</a>.</p>

                  <p>No date is planned yet, but hopefully if we get a volunteer soon, we can do it next weekend (the 22nd, or 23rd). If not, then it'll probably be the weekend after that. Let me know if you have a webcam and want to help! Thanks <img src="smile.gif"

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>It took me a fair amount of time and effort to connect to the PsiPog chat with the recent IRC server change, and as some of the same problems might be plaguing other people trying to connect, I thought I might inform you as to the difficulties.</p>

                  <p>Because of the problem of cloning on IRC, most Dalnet servers require a ident response, especially from people with larger ISP's (i.e. most DSL and Cable providers). With programs such as mIRC, an ident program is built-in and thus the problem is taken care of. However, with your program, a
                  separate ident server must be run. The program that I found (and that is recommended by Dalnet) is Ident Daemon, available at <a href="http://kline.dal.net/exploits/identd15.zip">http://kline.dal.net/exploits/identd15.zip</a></p>

                  <p>In addition, people behind firewalls or routers will need to open up port 113, which is the listening port for the ident ping and response. I suggest that you provide this information on the chat page, seeing as how less computer-saavy people are very unlikely to figure out why the PsiPog Chat
                  program is unable to connect.</p>

                  Finals are over! Yay! But who wants to hear about that... what are the plans?</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>More Articles - Approaching just over 50 articles that I have to review.</li>

                     <li>Chat Update - I want to update the chat, I want to make it awesome, and I want it to work for everyone who uses Windows.</li>

                     <li>Translations - Tons of those, gotta integrate them.</li>

                     <li>Other Cool Stuff - Maybe some fun stuff like a lecture or maybe I'll start doing some weekly discussions, something like that.</li>
                  </ul>So those are the main things I'm focusing on. Give me some feedback - what do YOU want ASAP? Articles? Chat update? Let me know what you think. Expect updates in the next couple days/weeks.

                  I've updated the <a href="chat.php">Chat Client</a> so we connect to a different server now. So, what does that mean? It means hopefully we don't have to deal with all those problems Austnet was giving us. It should be more stable... so I guess we'll just wait and see.</p>

                  <p>Only a few more days and I'm done with finals! One of the things on my "to do"-list is to get through those pending articles. So in about a week or two, look for new articles. Hopefully over the summer I can get those translations online too, that'll be quite the project. And I still gotta get v4
                  of the client, but that might not be for a while. So anyways... check back in a week or two and there should be new articles. In the meantime, keep reading, keep researching, keep practicing, and stop by the chat and say "hello" <img src="smile.gif"

                       class="smileyImg" /><br />
                  With the real chat being down, I decided to add a "Mini-Chat" to PsiPog.net. If you're logged in, go to <a href="index.html">Preferences</a>, and add the Panel "Mini-Chat" to your Member Nav bar. Post away! Normal chat room rules apply, and if I catch you breaking a rule, I simply disable it for you
                  and it doesn't work! <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"

                  <p><i>EDIT:</i></p>

                  <p>Ok... heh. It seems the "Mini-Chat" worked great, but it pretty much killed the server in about 30 minutes. I guess one person using it is no big deal, but when like 10 people start using it, and it refreshes a ton, and other people are accessing the site on top of that, it really kills the
                  server. So I've disabled it for now, and perhaps I can find a way for it to work. If not, then it was fun while it lasted <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>This is the second news entry for today, so be sure to read the news entry below this one about the chat. This news entry is concerning the "internal structure" of PsiPog stated in the last entry.</p>

                  <p>Ok, so this is important, so listen up:</p>

                  <p><b>If you submitted an Article to me...</b></p>

                  <p>In the past, if you have submitted an article to me, and you didn't get a reply, or maybe you updated an article, or whatever. You need to RESUBMIT the article to me, and it needs to be resubmitted to the address <a href="#">articles@psipog.net</a>. Do NOT send it to my
                  personal inbox, I have created a new inbox specifically for article submissions.</p>

                  <p>I forwarded all old submissions to that account, and I have 37 old submissions to go through. So, if you want me to read your latest submission, you need to resubmit. I don't know if I have your latest, or even if one of those 37 are yours. Resubmit, just to make sure.</p>

                  <p><b>If you submitted a Translation to me...</b></p>

                  <p>You need to NOT resubmit. I am, however, changing where you submit the tranlations to. If you want to submit a NEW translation, send them to <a href="#">translations@psipog.net</a>. Do not send me your old translations, I still have all 44 of those.</p>

                  <p>So, review: If you want to submit an old or new article, send it to articles@psipog.net. If you want to submit new translations, send them to translations@psipog.net. Do not send in old translations, if you previously sent them to peebrain@psipog.net. I have moved all those, and they are still all
                  set.</p>

                  <p>Ok cool. Other than that, the article submission process will change slightly again, but this is the first step. The translation submission process has only changed that now you send to translations@psipog.net, NOT peebrain@psipog.net.</p>

                  <p>Howdy,<br />
                  It seems Austnet (the network that PsiPog Chat is on) is doing a pretty piss-poor job of keeping everything up and running. So... you probably won't be able to connect to the chat for a few days, depending on how fast they figure out what happened, and how long it takes them to fix it.</p>

                  <p>Soon I hope to move the whole PsiPog Chat to a different network, so we don't have to deal with that Austnet crap constantly.</p>

                  <p>Other than that, I have some ideas on how to change some internal structures of PsiPog to help make things update faster and move more smoothly. You might see an update soon about that. It's approaching Final Exam time, so I'll be working on PsiPog a lot less than I already do, but after finals I
                  have a solid 3 weeks of screwing around, so I'll probably have a few updates in that time period.</p>

                  <p>Browsing around I found this interesting book, so I figured I'd let everyone know about it. If you got some time to kill the first couple pages are an interesting read. You can find the book on Amazon.com here:</p>

                  <p>Howdy,<br />
                  I still get a lot of questions pertaining to the PsiPog Forums. I honestly do not plan to have any forums up for a very long time. Like... years <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"

                  <p>But then I thought... well what the hell, there are a lot of forums out there that are cool, and PsiPog doesn't run them. So, I've found some forums for you guys to check out. Please be aware - like I said - PsiPog does not have any control over these forums (maybe that's a good thing? <img src=
                  "blah.gif"
                       width="12"

                       alt="Blah"

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Howdy howdy,<br />
                  I just got back from a week in Flordia - been chilling out on the beach for Spring Break <img src="smile.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Smiley"
                       class="smileyImg" />. It seems March is the month for vacations... a couple of the other moderators are on vacation as well. Now that I'm back, and getting back into the swing of things, I thought I'd let everyone know what the plans were.</p>

                  <p>First topic: articles. We want more. We want them to be really cool. Heh, ok <img src="smile.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Smiley"
                       class="smileyImg" />. As I always say, there is a few ideas tossed around, and a few drafts up for some new ones, but there isn't anything ready to be posted as of yet. Sorry.</p>

                  <p>Second topic: chat. Alrighty, here is something that there will be an update with. The client will be staying the same for a while (v4.0 coming along... slowly <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />), BUT, updates are going to be made concerning the structure of the chat. I was discussing some ideas with Mannen and the other chatters on how to have some more serious discussions, and more frequent practices, and we came up with an idea: Schedule discussion topics, and
                       schedule practices, using the Calendar. So, not only will we use the Calendar to schedule Seminars (aka Lectures), but we will use the Calendar to schedule specific times to discuss a topic related to psi, and to schedule a practice that people can come to.</p>

                  <p>So how's that gonna work? Mods will post dates/times on the Calendar, and either the topic of discussion, or the skill being practiced. For example, maybe February 31st (<img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />) we will schedule a discussion topic of "How do you think PK works?". Then at that time, in the chat, we all chill out and actually talk about something ON TOPIC. Or, we can for example, schedule a CRV practice for some date/time. People who want to practice just show up,
                       and have some fun. Please note: Practices and Discussions are NOT Seminars. Seminars = teaching. Practices = you already know what to do, and you practice it. Discussions = everyone just talks about something. So those are the plans for the chat room. Expect to see an update on that soon - I'll
                       post another News entry when I get the small system up and running.</p>

                  <p>Other than that, my inbox is officially flooded from my week vacation, so I gotta work on that too. Have a happy March 15th, and if you go on vacation, be safe <img src="smile.gif"

                  for Saturday, February 21 at 7:00PM EST. He is holding the PK Party in PsiOnline's chat room - information can be found <a href="http://www.angeltowns.com/members/psionline/chat.html">HERE</a> about their chat room and how to get to it.

                  We started a little past 7pm EST to make sure everyone was there, and jumped right in. After our group meditation, we all tried getting it to work for the next hour and a half. Lots of interesting discussions in the mean time... with a lot of cool results. With a total of 65 (!) people attending (at
                  one point), we got some cool pics of others' success. Unfortunately, I didn't bend mine (grrr! <img src="blah.gif"

Look at them, decide for yourself. Either way, I had a blast, and the party was awesome. I hope to do it again in the future. If you
                       missed it - bummer. You missed out. Try to attend the next one, whenever we decide to make that one.</p>

                  <p>I do have some more good news for you guys. GreatSheepKing stopped by the chat before the party, and told me I could put his articles back up! Totally awesome. He seems to be feeling a little down - if you see him make sure you tell him how much his articles help out. It's good the see the
                  articles available for the public. Check out the "Recent Article" list on the Articles page for a list of his recently added articles. Nothing new, but still good reading.</p>

                  <p>Other than that, it was an awesome PK Party, and it's good to have GSK's articles in circulation again. Keep checking back, new articles from new authors are sure to be coming.</p>

                  <p>Hey hey!<br />
                  The plans for the PK Party have been made. Please read <a href="calendar.php?view=1&amp;day=1076198400">this page</a> for more information. Read the entire thing. Then join us next saturday!</p>

                  <p>I will be allowing anyone to join from their own client. So if you use mIRC, feel free to join in. This is only temporary for the PK Party though. Just connect to Austnet and /join #projection at the specific time.</p>

                  <p>Everyone try to come! Hopefully a bunch of people will bend their spoons/forks. It doesn't have to be made of silver or anything (in fact, it's better if it isn't, you don't want to ruin a silver spoon <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>Yo yo,<br />
                  Just letting you know what's on the plate. I have new authors submitting stuff (as I mention in every news entry <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />), but I <i>should</i> be getting some new articles up by the new authors soon. Other than that, you'll notice Jan 19th has passed, so the chat room is obviously back open. Q&amp;A is doing good, though some questions are repetative... I suggest using the Search function. And
                       questions like "how do I make a psiwheel?" are just plain retarded. C'mon now <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />.</p>

                  <p>Anyways, before I break into a long rant... next topic. I was thinking about holding an Online PK Party (like we did a while back), where people come to the chat and we all try to bend some spoons or something together. Haven't made any decisions, if you like the idea come in the chat and let me
                  know what times you'd like it to be. Or you can <a href="index.html">Send Me Mail</a> and let me know.</p>

                  <p>So that's what's on the plate... I hope everyone is enjoying the cold weather (yeah right <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"

                  You guys that frequent the chat will notice that it's been disabled. The other mods and I have decided it's time to take a little break from the chat room. I enjoy the chat as much as everyone else (well, maybe not AS much, but I do enjoy it <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>Other news: still gotta go through all those submissions. Tons of submitted articles, tons of submitted translations. I need to get all of that organized. As far as new articles, there might be a few in the next couple days if I like some of the submissions, but no promises (I'm usually a hard ass
                  about new stuff, and it takes a long time to get a new author up and running <img src="blah.gif"

I know of one pending article from Rainsong that might be a while (we had discussed the topic, and she agreed to write it, but I don't know when she's going to start on it). Other than that, my articles are
                       still/always pending <img src="blah.gif"

I have a TON of submissions from new authors that have yet to be reviewed, and I also have a TON of submissions of unreviewed translations. Hopefully after the holiday I can hunker down and get some work done. I have started on chat client
                       v4.0, and am progressing slowly. Other than that, I'm just going to relax for a few days, enjoy the time with my family, and get back to work when the time comes. Have a Happy Whatever-You're-Celebrating <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Hey all<br />
                  Just letting you know what's going on. I've gotten a TON of e-mails regarding translations. Unfortunately, it is approaching final exam time (my last final is tuesday, the 16th), so it's real hard to keep up with it. I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who is e-mailing me regarding the
                  translations. I don't have time right now to reply to everyone personally, but, to answer the most common question: Yes, I am getting your e-mails, and thanks a bunch <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>I am sitting on two new articles from new authors, and I'm <i>still</i> working on mine. So, expect the two new ones soon, expect mine... who knows when <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>Either way, just letting everyone know what's going on, and what to expect. Drop by the chat if you have any questions. <img src="smile.gif"

It means a lot to me, and the community, and I can't wait until I can make them public for everyone. Speaking of making them public, when will I be posting the
                       translations? I don't know yet. Unfortunately, it's almost December, and that means: Final Exams. Eeeek! <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>Other than that, what news is there? Everyone is working hard on writing more articles, which is awesome, and more new authors are presenting me with new material, which is also awesome. Keep checking back, hopefully the Newbies section will be up soon, along with more articles, and eventually the
                  translations. Oh yeah, and let's not forget about Chat Client v3.2 <img src="blah.gif"

                  Now we're back into some productive action. I've put up two new articles from annie, one from me (Peebrain), and one from Oneta. The Telepathy Manual is back online too (thanks Rain and Keith <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Hey guys,<br />
                  Got some bad news... All the articles from PsiPogAuthor (aka KMiller) and GreatSheepKing are being removed. Why? I can't really give you a straight answer... Nonetheless, they aren't my articles, they are their articles, and this is what they have decided to do. This is obviously not what I would
                  decide <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       alt="Blah"
                       class="smileyImg" />. I'm on a lab computer right now, so I can't delete them this instant, so when I get on my home computer the articles will be deleted.<br />
                  <br />
                  Sorry guys... On the plus side, most of the articles were stuff that a lot of people could do, so hopefully we'll have some "replacement" articles up, and perhaps that will stimulate some new ideas coming from another author. It sucks, the staff here isn't happy either, but... what can we do? It's
                  not our decision...<br />
                  <br />
                  Sorry again, keep checking back for new articles.</p>

                       class="smileyImg" />! In case you haven't noticed, PsiPog has changed a bit in the past day or so. I changed the left image a little to try and get more people to notice the larger sections, and I added *dun dun dun* the <a href="qna.html">Q&amp;A</a>! Inspired (read: copied) from the great
                       <a href="http://www.awkworld.com">Andrew W.K.</a> <img src="blah.gif"

                       class="smileyImg" />. Basically, you submit questions, and we answer them - simple, huh? The bad news is the Forums have been destoryed in the process (oh boo hoo). Hopefully this new form of communication will be more fitting to this site than the Forum was.</p>

                  <p>Also, I've added two new articles. The one from PsiPogAuthor that I promised in the last News entry, and the Shielding Seminar log from annie. Check the <a href="article.php">Article</a> section, at the bottom where it says "Recent Articles", for quick links to them. I still have some more
                  articles from annie sitting in my inbox, and I believe Gnome aka Mazrim aka Jaspers has a new article for me soon. Rainsong and I are still working on ours, but those should be around soon as well.</p>

                  <p>Other than that, enjoy the new Q&amp;A, enjoy the new articles, and keep checking back because there's still more stuff coming <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>You might notice that some of PsiPogAuthor's articles have been deleted. No need to panic; I can't disclose the reason for this, so don't ask me or KMiller, or we will reply with a witty and clever remark <img src="blah.gif"

                  If you haven't noticed, the Media has been offline for a little bit, and so has the Forums. (Please to not PM me asking why the Forums don't work - read <a href="frm.php?sdb=1&amp;showmes=17373"><b>this</b></a>). No, the Forums aren't back online, in fact I'm getting rid of them
                  all together (and replacing them with something that will be better suited for this site, hopefully <img src="blah.gif"
