                  <p>Generally, between the periods of switching objects, you will feel an inability to move it for a few practice sessions (never fear, it can be done and you can do it). For instance, someone that is going from being able to move a psi-wheel to trying to move a pencil usually will not be able to do
                  it the first time, but a few practices later will be able to move it. My suggestion: switch to a closer object, instead of a pencil, try a toothpick and as sopon as you able to move that, then move onto the next object.</p>

                  <p>I don't think I could claim that it is _easy_ to learn PK, regardless of how old or young you are.</p>

                  <p>It is not yet known whether telekinesis is something that everyone can learn. The other main categories of psionics seem to be able to be learned by just about anyone, given sufficient time and practice, but there is some doubt as to whether this is true of telekinesis.</p>

                  <p>Shielding, in itself, is a separate skill from telekinesis, and is much easier to learn. If your ambition is to create force-bubble types of shields, however, then some skill in telekinesis would be required.</p>

                  <p>It _might_ be possible to lift oneself into the air telekinetically. I personally cannot do it.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Yep. It seems to happen more in microPK than macroPK, but trying _too_ hard can sabotage your efforts. This is one of the reasons that people are often advised to maintain a "playful" attitude when practicing. It is certainly possible to make PK work by sheer force of will, however; there is
                  simply a better-than-even chance that too _much_ force-of-will will backfire. (As an example, when I do microPK, if I "try too hard", I normally get statistically significant results, but in the wrong direction.)</p>

                  <p>I'm only new to this psionics stuff (5 days actually) and managed to move a psi wheel on my first day. I've been reading that people use their hands to move objects but I can move the wheel just by looking at it, no hands. Is this good or do you need to focus on moving objects with your hands
                  nearby?</p>

                  <p>I've used them and they work pretty good, in my opinion. I actually plan on writing an article on the Hemi-Sync CDs that is produced by the Monroe Institute. But before that article comes out, my summary would be: they help me trance out a lot easier, and could be used to help you along. Although
                  they come with some risk, that you should be aware of - specifically, some people have seizures and stuff like that when listening to them. Use your common sense if you decide to try them out, and know yourself and your limitations. If you have a history of seizures, do NOT use them <img src=

                  <p>So yea, I guess I was one of the fortunate one, because I tried the psiwheel for the first time, and I got results after several attempts. I made sure to found out what not to do, like how i should approach the psiwheel w/o creating small wind current with my hands...but..here's my question:</p>

                  <p><br />
                  I'm pretty sure doing telekinesis requires a certain energy, and doing too much telekinesis can probably drain that energy, so how do I regain this energy back? I'm just asking because each successful attempt with the psiwheel, it seems as though the psiwheel's turn is getting smaller and smaller
                  every time, which was a total attempt of 5-6 times within a span of 4 hours.</p>
