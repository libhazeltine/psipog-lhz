                  <p>I've been reading the article entitled Communicating with your Subconscious.

My questions are what are good questions to ask the

                  <p>2. Normal? Heh. None of this stuff is normal. But yeah, weird stuff happens, like vibrations, and shit like that. It's not NORMAL, but it does happen.</p>

                  <p>3. Oddly enough, yeah this is kind of common. Robert Peterson never practiced PK but displayed some PK skill after training for OBEs over a long period of time (www.robertpeterson.org).</p>

                  <p>Some people think it's weird or insane to be able to (or try to) talk to your subconcious mind, and when you really think about it, it's not all that strange. You live with tons of bacteria inside and outside of you. If they weren't there, we would be more prone to infection and be weak. Our
                  bodies are one huge system of tiny organisms working together, and we send signals to our subconc. mind all the time without realizing it. Having said that, why would anyone think that talking with your subconcious is insane, when in reality, it's a part of daily life? ...right?</p>

                  <p>Maybe because you think you cannot OBE? Since when does failure mean that it's impossible for you to do it? Even then, it sounds like you're progressing pretty good - just keep working at it, day by day, and you'll get it. If you are really concerned about this "repressed memory", then you might
                  want to see a psychiatrist, or a hypnotist <img src="blah.gif"

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Is there a specific technique/breathing method one can use in order to NOT have an OBE?</p>

                  <p>The reason I ask is that I have been trying to get obe for quite some time, and I did a couple of times, sort of. Still, every time I exit in my 'second body' I get so freaked out that I back off into physical immediately. That's not the point though, I guess I just need to practice until I
                  overcome the fear of the unknown.</p>

                  <p>Ok, now to the point - yesterday night I also tried to obe, but my mind began to wander (I might have even fell asleep, can't remember) and suddenly I felt I was 'thrown' out of my physical which as always seriously freaked me out. So I dive back into physical, but I still felt I was 'out of
                  phase'. This happened around 2am...and after that I was lying there for about an hour and a half with my eyes open, trying to keep the vibrations low and afraid that if I fall asleep I would be 'thrown out' again.</p>

                  <p>I know what you mean - it can really be a pain in the butt after a while. My suggestion is to just try to fall asleep as fast as you can. Instead of "easing in slowly" to see if you can catch the right state, you want to just blast right by that correct state and into sleep. Try falling asleep
                  watching TV, or exercising a lot so you are really tired. Go back to those old bad habbits that you had to break to have OBEs.</p>
