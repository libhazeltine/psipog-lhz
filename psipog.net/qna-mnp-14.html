                  I am kind of new here, but searched for my question and found none.<br />
                  Anyways, is it possible to merge constructs from different people to create a more powerful one allowing a group to manipulate things etc. better, or does people's psi conflict with each other cancelling it out?</p>

                  <p>I have read your bit on newbies and understand you probably wont want to answer this question but here goes. I read your artical on making a psiball and (although only 13) i caonsider my self to be a physicist. Anyway, at first i disreguarded it as bieng nonsense but curiosity drove me to give it
                  a go. I was amazed at the reult. I chose the sun as my source of energy and i actually felt my hands warm up! Please could you tell me how this works. There must be a scientific explanation but i cant think of one other than your subconscience decides its real and therefore makes you think your hands
                  are warming up. As I said before, I know you probably have better things to answer but please answer mine aswell as i fell a growing intrest in psionics....</p>

                  <p>The physics behind psionics is pretty much a big question mark. At this point, it's perfectly logical to conclude you're "tricking" your body - actually, it's possible that you are! This is why it's important to do tests to see if what you're doing is just a mind game, or is actually something
                  physical. For example, I used to make psi balls around thermometers to see if the temperature would change. Think of ways to test it, and give it a shot.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Well, like many others, I started practicing the basic psi-ball a while back. After a few sessions (20-40 minutes, usually when I wake up and before I go to sleep and sometimes other times during the day if there's time), I felt the push/pull in my hands, like magnetism. From the Q&amp;A I
                  understand this can be a sign.</p>

                  <p>Now, I wasn't sure, so I tried to make a rudimentary "hot" ball. I started gathering energy from the sun and myself rather than the earth and myself (I use my own energy kind of as a closing ceremony, as in "And that's all the energy you're recieving" after I'm done putting energy in). Now, I felt
                  the magnetism, and there was also a definite warm sensation in between my hands and on my knee (hands were resting on the knee). I decided to go from warm to cool, and envisioned the head escaping, being replaced by cool energy. Almost immediatly it felt as if there was a change, which built as the
                  energy drifted off and was replaced by coldness.</p>

                  <p>This seems odd to me. Is it normal for a heat-ball to be able to change too a cold-ball so easily, or was it just my imagination that played a trick on me?</p>

                  <p>I can feel the shield, personally. Sometimes I stick my hand out and feel it. You can also test it to see if it works - if you have programmed it to act a certain way, see if it's working. For example, if you program a shield to reflect constructs (mirror shield), have a friend toss a psi ball at
                  you and see if it bounces off. Another way is to get a third party to scan you and see if they pick up the shield. (You have to be careful though, sometimes the person scanning doesn't see things correctly though).</p>

                  Just recently I've noticed it has been becoming extremely difficult to practice my PK.

I was just wondering if I could get help to see if involontary,
