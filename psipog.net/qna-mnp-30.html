                  <p>Basically, if you just start running a mile a day, when you used to just sit on the couch all day, you get tired.. right? Same thing with psi. Your body isn't used to making psi balls, so it gets tired.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>The concept behind the shell is to hold the psi balls shape. For most people, when they don't make a shell, the psi ball will fall apart after a short amount of time. To make the psi ball stronger (and last longer), you program a thin layer of psi around the psi ball to "hold this psi ball
                  together". That's what the shell is. Use visualizations of steel or armour or something like that. Make it solid.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I have a couple of questions. I was reading the articles about Psi Balls, and attempted to create one, I could feel a sensation, but I couldn't do much else it would just disperse when I stopped focusing. I was looking over the Telekinesis articles, because I want to be able to use that ability,
                  and I was wondering, couldn't Psi Balls be used for Telekinesis, as Programming them to surround an object, say a lock, and moving it to the locked postion?</p>

                  <p>Also I noticed that the sensation I feel when making a Psi Ball resembles that of another sensation I get. When I am walking backwards, or not paying attention to where I am going, if I am about to run into something say a pole. The side of my body which will hit (usually my back) begins to get a
                  slight burning like sensation. As with my Psi Balls, it doesn't take long to make one, but I want to put them to some use and wondered how to strengthen them and eventually use them.</p>

                  <p>To answer your first paragraph: Yes. You can program "telekinesis" into a psi ball. Look up information on "force bubbles".</p>

                  <p>To your second paragraph: To strengthen your psi balls, practice. Make complicated shapes and weird programming. Check out the "So You Think You've Mastered Psi Balls?" article.</p>

                  <p>Think of swimming. Now if you jump in the middle of a pool and flap your arms around like a nutjob, you'll sink. If you calmly move your arms around, you'll swim. It's kind of the same with energy manipulation - if you strain and strain until your face is red to move psi, it might move some psi,
                  but you really won't be getting anywhere and you'll "sink". Instead, relax, breathe in and out calmly, and gently guide the psi - don't force it.</p>

                  <p>I'm kind of worried that your website teaches about psi and there are only 5 articles about shielding while you don't teach about psi combat. I am not saying to start combat or anything, I'm just afraid of having a weak sheild and no knowledge of any kinds of combat. It just seems that more effort
                  should be put into that area of manipulation, because I want to know how to make a shield as strong as I can so that I will not have to worry about attackers.</p>

                  <p>I know it's really the authors choice, and that you can make up your own sheilds, I just think that more people should be able to protect them selves better.</p>

                  <p>Your ability to block an attack is your responsibility. We can't help it if you don't practice enough and have poor skill. We can try to teach you shields (like we do), but it's up to you to use that information in a productive manor. Practice. Think. Create. It's not our responsibility to make
                  sure you are able to protect yourself - train and take control and do it yourself.</p>

                  <p>I've recently noticed that my shields seem to block my manipulation abilities as well as some of my precognition and (very rudimentary) TK. After dropping my shields, which of course I can't do very often, I find a much higher success rate with TK and precog, as well as basic manipulation
                  (psiballs mainly). My question is, is there a method for refining my programming to keep this from happening? I'd like the benefits of shielding (i.e. not going insane) without the expenses of losing the rest of my ability.</p>

                  <p>My cousin, is a teenager and she says she would like to learn psi, but she wanted to know if it could be used to help her immune system become stronger. The Doctors told her that her immune system is just weak due to genetics, not like "boy in the bubble" weak, she just gets sick constantly. So
                  can psi help in this area, I guess making a shield to protect from illness or something? Any help would be appreciated.</p>
