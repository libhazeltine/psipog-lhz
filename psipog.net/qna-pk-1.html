                  <p>I'm not very clear as to what TK is. What I mean is that if I make a psiball and make it spin the psiwheel by pushing it, is that TK? Or is that a completly different thing?</p>

                  <p>Using a psiball to move something falls under the category of telekinesis, yes.</p>

                  <p>Telekinesis is nothing more or less than moving or altering an object by psychical/psionic means, rather than poking it with a stick or using your hands, or something along those lines.</p>

                  <p>I have jut two questions I've been wondering lately:</p>

                  <p>Does telekinesis prove Sir Isaac Newton's laws false?<br />
                  <br />
                  And i've seen questons about how practicing telekinesis effects potassium levels but am still confused on something:Can telekinesis really cause any serious affects on your health?</p>

                  <p>Im not sure if these are acceptable questions and am not sure if they havent been answered yet but thank you for taking the time to read over them.</p>

                  <p>a) Telekinesis does not disprove any laws of physics, including Newton's.</p>

                  <p>b) Yes, telekinesis really can cause serious effects on your health, up to and including ending it permanently. Many (perhaps all) psionic effects affect the glucose and potassium levels in the blood. Actually, intense concentration affects them, too. The problem is that psionic activity can cause
                  them to change quickly. A sudden drop or rise in either chemical causes problems. If the rise or drop is severe enough, it will kill you.<br /></p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>It should be possible, in theory, but you'd need to maintain control of the temperature of all the kernels, for the entire time. However, why would you want to? Some kernels will remain unpopped in any case, so if you were looking for a demonstration-effect, your results would need to be perfect
                  and repeated. Oh, and by the way, avoid freezing the workings of the microwave while you are at it, or there could be a certain amount of unpleasantness involved.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Before I ask this question, I'd just like to give a little background of myself for credibility purposes (not to brag.) I've been taking piano lessons for more than 8 years now, and every recital piece that I've played was memorized.</p>

                  <p>Moving onward, I seem to memorize things a lot easier than most people (and quicker, too.) How I memorize it, I cannot describe. My piano teacher says that she sees the notes in her head as she plays, but I do not... I just play the song. My fingers know where to go, and not a thought goes through
                  my head about the song.</p>

                  <p>I also find that when I try to play a difficult piece, it doesn't work out too well... but when I let my fingers sort of move on their own, it turns out perfect.</p>

                  <p>My question is, is any of this related to the mindset one must be in for telekinesis? The "just do it" kind of thing seems to relate closely, but does anyone have any personal experience with something similar to this?</p>

                  <p>I'm having trouble with being consistent in TK and I'm just looking for a new perspective to see what works. Sorry that there's a lot of non-psionics related stuff in here, but I couldn't think of any other way to ask the question.</p>

                  <p>Yes it is, however this is usually due to wind currents in the room... Is your fan/AC off? are you blowing on it? and questions like these are the ones that you wan to be asking yourself... One sure way to insure that there are no wind currents is to place a glass over the psi-wheel, and then try
                  to move it.</p>
