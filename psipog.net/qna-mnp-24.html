If the instructions were understood, and there is nothing seriously wrong with whatever parts of one's body are required for psi-ball construction, five minutes. I've heard of folks taking as long as half-an-hour, but in those cases, the problem was more with
                  perception than construction....</p>

                  <p>Na, you can make a "normal" psi ball that isn't flaring. You don't need to know anything other than "visualize energy going into your hands" to make a psi ball. Flaring and extra programming stuff are things you learn after you make a psi ball, if you want.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Well, I made some psi constructs lately at my school, and now many people have changed when they're around me. People will call me a witch or satin, while others think it's awesome and are begging me to tell them how to do it. Others are scared of me, and my friends don't think of me the same any
                  more. People who play too many games or watch too much tv are after me as well, and I just want to make it how it used to be when no one knew I could use psi.</p>

                  <p>Now, here are my questions:</p>

                  <p>1) Is there a way to telepathically change the minds of over 300 people in a gym?</p>

                  <p>2) Is there a sheild I can make to attract friends of mine and repel people who aren't?</p>

                  <p>3) Is it possible to get back to before people found out about psi?</p>

                  <p>It's just been so frustrating and confusing lately, I don't know what to do. Please help. Thanks. (I can't do empathy, but I feel like I might be able to...)</p>

                  <p>1) Yes, but that falls under the category of "assault and battery", and is therefore "combat"....which further means that it is not a topic for discussion in this site.</p>

                  <p>2) See answer #1.</p>

                  <p>3) They'll either get used to it or they won't. Assaulting their minds will not help your case. Sure it might work for the majority of your "friends" (are they really friends if you can seriously consider such an act?), but some folks are pretty much immune to these kinds of attacks, and a few of
                  these are inclined to retaliate, one way or the other.</p>

                  <p>I have been working with shields for some time now, but I have a question about programing. I have read about shields that can "self-manage". Actually it's more like they drain energy automaticly when needed. Suposedly it works with programming the shield. The book is entitled: "Placing it on
                  auto". I was wondering if you've ever herd or had any experiance in this and is it even legit?</p>

                  <p>It works, if you have enough skill to add the extra details to the programming. It's not very difficult, in fact. _However_ there is a tendency to forget to conduct the other sorts of maintenance that such a Shield occasionally needs, such as cleaning and repair of actual damage.</p>

                  <p>What you are doing is possible, yes. However, it isn't a "psiball". A psiball is, by definition a spheroid "ball", hence the name. Likewise, psicubes are cube-shaped, and psi-puppies are puppy-shaped....</p>

                  <p>Why hasn't anyone tried to publicize psi with books on how to use it and show it to the world and make money off of it? I mean it seems like that would be incredibly profitable to make a few commercials and books on psi and make psi a more normal part of life, such as taking psionics for an
                  elective or something in school. I mean it seems like people are trying to hide it, when there could be more publicity made of it, unless that's already been tried, it still seems like people could be going around the country demonstrating psi and selling books and tapes to read and listen to about
                  psi.</p>

                  <p>It's been done. The ones who are best at the publicity thing, though, tend to be written off as fakes. Lots of books have been written on the topic, some good and most not so. The subject is popular enough for publishers to regard such books as marketable.</p>
