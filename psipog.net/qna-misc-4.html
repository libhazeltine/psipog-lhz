               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>hey guys, I have been trying an excersise where I balance a fork on a needle and spin it like a psi-wheel. I tried "attracting" and "pushing" it with both hands, and my left hand seems to be better at "pulling" and my right is better at "pushing". why is it that way? and is that normal, for people
                  to be better at a certain psi function with one hand than the other? also, i have tried to get a spoon of the same size and weight to spin, but I can't, it just seems to be something about the shape. Why's that?</p>

                  <p>Various people have noticed that one hand seems to be more inclined to "push" and the other to "pull", as you put it. I have no idea why this is so. Nor do I know why the fork will spin and the spoon won't, unless there is some kind of irregularity in the metal at the point of balance.</p>

                  <p>For me, the few times where I have stopped for months, I can pick it up again, but it is different. It is more like lifting weights, I didn't forget how to train, but I can't lift as much as I used to be able to. On the perceptive side, it has just kinda faded away and I am not as perceptive as I
                  used to be, but I can percieve what I used to if I put enough force into it.</p>

                  <p>Hello again, this time a have a weird question. Sometimes, usually when around the house or in my car/van, I start to sing a common sond to myself in my thoughts, kind of unconcious but mostly concious. Sounds normal right? Well if I do it when one of my family/friends (mostly my sister(age 11))
                  is near me for a short period of time he/she starts to hum or sing the song aloud! I wasn't quite sure what this is called or is a form of and how I could learn to develop whatever I'm doing... By the way, is that normal?</p>
