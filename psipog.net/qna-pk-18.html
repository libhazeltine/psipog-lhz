                  <p>Pay attention to how your body reacts. If you start feeling fatigued, dizzy, short of breath, or display any of the other early signs of either (look them up...there are lots of online sites that discuss them in detail), stop what you're doing, have a snack and rest for a while.</p>

                  <p>Once, for a psiball, I visualized a cold energy source, and when I had concentrated on it for some time I noticed I felt cold. Out of curiosity, I visualized my arm on fire, and it felt noticeably hot. I went back and forth like this for some time, alternately visualizing different parts of myself
                  covered in ice and then burning, and with concentration the same thing happened every time. Is this some kind of Pyrokinesis/Cryokinesis or just the power of suggestion on my subconscious (or something to that effect)?</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hi</p>

                  <p>Three things that have been on my mind?</p>

                  <p>1) Whenever I attempt to move the psiwheel, I can get it to shake and even jerk to one side occasionally, but the problem is right when I see it moving the desired direction, I get excited, and then it suddenly stops. Does my sudden change of emotion have anything to do with the stops? Do I need
                  to keep my cool the whole way through TK? If so how? How can I overcome my obstacle and move on?</p>

                  <p>2) I'm a beginner as u can already tell and reading through your site I have came across the notion the psi ball is the most popular way to start. Is it the most practical way to start? I mean, do I have to master the Psi ball before attempting TK. Is it considered harder, are there any negatives
                  for starting with TK.</p>

                  <p>3) I'm kind of a like-to-know-everything-about-everything guy and I was wondering if there was any article about the cautions while using TK (sorry for sounding like a wuss), I've searched around and all I could find was self exhaustion</p>

                  <p>I tired to make sure that any of my questions weren't already asked; hopefully I?m not wasting your time.</p>

                  <p>Thanks for your time and great site</p>
               </div>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1) If a change of emotion messes things up for you, then yes it is a problem. There is a distinct possibility that your concentration is being broken by the "Oh cool, it worked!" effect. You might find the book _The Inner Game of Tennis_ by Galloway, to be of interest. Hint hint.</p>

                  <p>2) Psiballs are a popular way to start. They are not necessarily the best way to start, if constructs aren't your thing. You certainly do not _have_ to master Psiballs before trying PK. (I'd been doing PK for about a quarter of a century before I'd ever _heard_ of Psiballs).</p>

                  <p>3) Not an article per se, no. It isn't wussy to find out what the risks of a new activity are. The main known risks are chemical: hypokalemia and hypoglycemia, both common (but not universal) affects of psionic activity. Both can kill.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>First of all, for the record, (because this is a common problem) "Sean" did not write the essay in question, and the complaint that "it doesn't work" and further queries ought to be directed to the one who did, as is mentioned elsewhere on this site.</p>

                  <p>As for the meat of the question, when I wrote that essay originally it was for a different purpose, and I only altered it slightly for use on this site. The bulk of the information therein, such as it is, assumes that the reader is already familiar with psychokinetic workings. I did not re-write
                  it sufficiently. My bad. (There's a story behind both why it was written, and why it ended up published here, but both stories are fairly uninteresting; I won't bore you with them here.)</p>

                  <p>Visualization on its own will not accomplish the objective, in macro-psychokinesis of any variety. One of the assumptions I made in that article, is that the reader already knows this (the person for whom it was originally written does indeed know this). No matter how well or how vividly you
                  picture the little dots mentioned, if you don't put some "oomph" into the equation, nothing will happen, whether you keep at it for ten minutes, a month, or twenty years.</p>

                  <p>By "oomph", I mean the stuff referred to as "psi" on sites like this, but that is a circular definition. It helps, some folks, to have experience moving the psi-stuff around and using it for less-taxing purposes than PK, before attempting PK. And then, getting the ubiquitous Psi-Wheel to move
                  reliably under glass takes less effort for many people, than lighting fires does.</p>

                  <p>All that said, some people attempt to learn macroPK effects, using workable methods correctly, and yet have no results at all for ten or fifteen _years_. In spite of what some people will tell you, this is not always a short-term project, and it is quite possible that it will _never_ work, for
                  some folks.</p>

                  <p>There are other methods for heating and cooling things psychokinetically which are published in hardcopy and on the net. Some are workable, some are "creative fiction". I sat in on one of Winged Wolf's classes over at the Psion Guild a while back. The method she taught is on their site somewhere,
                  and it works for heating water, at least. (www.thepsionguild.net Not to be confused with the psychic-reading organisation of the same name)</p>

                  <p>do you think there is a connection between electrokinesis and the way electric eels work?<br />
                  because i was in a biology lesson the other day, and we were talking about electric eels work. and my biology teacher said that electric eels connect their nerves together to form a electric shock.<br />
                  do you think that electrokinetics, such as myself, connect nerves together to created the electricity?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>There are a number of animals who produce electrical attacks in the manner of an Electric Eel, the eel in question probably being the best-known. That, or the Electric Catfish. These animals have specialized muscle structures for this purpose, in their bodies, which are absent in humans.
                  Therefore, it is probably reasonably safe to say that "electrokinesis" in humans is not accomplished in quite the same manner.</p>

                  <p>There is a fairly broad range of psychokinetic applications which fit under the game-derived category of "electrokinesis".</p>

                  <p>Mental interference with electronic devices is generally considered a basic use of microPK, something that doesn't even _superficially_ resemble the workings of the hunting methods of the electric fishes.</p>

                  <p>Forcing an electrical device to work, or charging a battery, psionically _appears_ to be some kind of conversion of energy, perhaps analogous to generating electricity from steam or falling water. I've seen no evidence of a spark or electrical current between the operative and the object, in these
                  cases, and contact is not required. (If anyone has seen or read any such evidence, I'd appreciate hearing about it. No such thing as "too much data" :D )</p>

                  <p>The static-electricity shocks which are produced by friction, such as on wool carpets and in some weather conditions, are sometimes mistaken for "electrokinetic" effects by over-enthusiastic youngsters. Such shocks cannot be considered psychokinetic. It is nothing more than a standard transfer of
                  electrons under reasonably-well-understood conditions. It _does_ have a connection to the shocks produced by electric fish, however. :) (For those who can ground, then produce a significant "shock" in otherwise static-proof conditions, this static-electricity disclaimer might not apply. Expect some
                  fairly intensive Physics stuff, if you ever try to prove it to someone, though; grade-nine General Science won't cut it.)</p>

                  <p>Using psionics to program a computer disk, or to corrupt such data, has very little in common with the fish effect.</p>

                  <p>If Sparkz chooses to elaborate on the abilities s/he considers to be electrokinetic, I will edit the reply appropriately to reflect the specifics. The question, as asked, was too broad, but interesting.</p>

                  Oh yeah and if the psiwheel doesn't spin when its under a glass but does spin when its NOT under a glass does that mean that i am doing TK? And I take all precautions that there is no wind from the AC,breathing,etc....when its not under a glass.</p>

                  <p>If you are using magnetic effects, it is not telekinesis. There are several magnetic and electromagnetic effects that can superficially resemble telekinesis, and psi has some properties in common with electromagnetism, but psi (and tk) has been demonstrated in circumstances where electromagnetism,
                  as currently understood, cannot function.</p>

                  <p>Not enough data on the second question. Generally, suspect that tk is _not_ involved if the psiwheel spins when not protected, but fails to do so under glass.</p>
