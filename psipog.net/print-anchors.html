   <p><em>by Oneta</em></p>

   <p>As you have all probably seen in your favorite animes or Sci-fi shows how that special someone utters those few words (usually the name) before each show of ability. You may ask yourself why the need to say this, which is what ultimately led me to the idea of the following process. After a little bit of
   research, analysis from other sources on the Internet, and of some of the things I do daily, I reached the conclusion of why this happens. I will also teach you how to utilize this into your psionic practices daily.</p>

   <p>First off, we wonder about the words a character might say before arranging his or her hands in a particular order and performing a special ability. We will start off by calling this the "Anchor". The anchor is where the spark of chain reactions takes place within this being and through processes of memory the
   actions take place. Psychologist have ascertained that memory becomes permanent if something is repeated eight times. This happens much the same way when after a while of practicing psi balls you cup your hands and notice one almost forming on its own at the mere thought of making one, or when you are sometimes
   reading the articles and notice an influx of energy in a part of your body. Except instead of just using hand formations or words separately we will combine them into what we will call an anchor.</p>

   <p>The ability of physical actions to be sparked by our memory works almost in the same way remote viewers often scribble lines or small pictures before an actual word will come to them. It happens this way because the signals sent out by the unconscious are intercepted by the ANS (Autonomic Nervous System) first,
   usually manifesting itself in a (if allowed) physical action, then travels up through the subconscious into the lower parts of the conscious. This shows that thoughts have physical reaction, whether noticed or not. Just as the Remote Viewer may choose to scribble or not, either way the ability for the physical
   action to take place is always there.</p>

   <p>The following process will assign habitual effects to certain gestures that, when carried out, automatically create the results you desire in a shorter time through processes of memory. It is all just like taking a different route to remember something you have forgotten rather than trying to remember directly
   what you have forgotten.</p>

   <p>For the following activity you may need to ground/meditate each time before making the construct. This is to make sure you have enough psi required for each construct, and that they all are about the same in creation. This helps keep results even.</p>

   <p>Let's start off with the basics; first make a psi ball. Then simply after you are satisfied with the results, finish simply by saying the word "psi ball", which will be your anchor for making future psi balls. As you say it feel the psi ball and take notice of what it is you are doing and how you did it. Make
   sure your intent is clear of your psi ball and that you are satisfied with your results, because you would hate to have the process of making unstable psi balls programmed to memory. It is best done at least the eight times and spaced by an hour each as to not effect the memory of it as a one big training session,
   but instead as a simple creation of a psi ball at eight different times during a period of *one* day (For some it may be the need to do it more than eight times if you feel you are not getting results). After you have accomplished this, sleep or whatever, and then try your results by simply cupping your hands and
   saying "psi ball". If done correctly at the mention of psi ball while your hands are cupped, one should take form. After you have mastered this, try more exotic ways of this like making a pyramid construct and say "pyramid" in place of "psi ball" and so on and so on, until you are making larger more complex
   constructs the same way.</p>

   <p>This can even be used to reach altered states such as Alpha and Theta quicker for practice sessions. Simply use the method of choice to enter into each state whether it be trance or brainwave software, and once you are sure you have reached each state, anchor it. I would recommend an anchor for these such as,
   touching your thumb to pinky and saying "theta/alpha". It is best in the learning process to do this eight times in a period of one day with an hour between each. Modifications can be made as long as you find them working.</p>

   <p>As within it's uses for Telepathy, I am not advanced enough in this subject as to say whether this method is accurate with every aspect of it, and for that maybe you should check out <a href="art-guide-to-triggering.html">Triggering</a>.</p>

   <p>There are many uses besides the few mentioned here such as various finger connections along with preferred words to perform telekinesis. The possibilities are only limited to memorizing all the anchors you have assigned.</p>
