PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #18, for August 6th, 2005

"Science does not know its debt to imagination."
- Ralph Waldo Emerson


Dear PsiPog Users,

Howdy howdy! No real updates on PsiPog.net lately, and it'll
probably die down a bit for a few weeks. I've just graduated
part of my Tech. School (in the Air Force), and I'll be moving
from Arizona to Flordia... which means I gotta pack up my
computer and get a new internet service. I plan to be back
online around the 26th of August - but until then, there won't be
any updates on PsiPog.net.

On the plus side, I am working on the new forums, and a new
eBook, so some cool things are on the way - but you'll just have
to chill for a little bit :-P.

Alrighty, let's jump into the mail bag:

=================================================================

shogun asks:
"Hey I've got a question that I've been wondering about ever
since I got into psionics. Why is it that you (and people as good
as you in psionics) never use it for gain. For example, why don't
you ever go to a casino one night and TK the roulette wheel or
read people's minds in card games. It seems with a skill like
that you could be the next poker champion. Haven't you ever
considered it?"

My comments: What makes you think we _don't_ do that? I've used
psi in poker games to win, and I know other mods have too. Just
because we don't talk about it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
There is this myth that people with psychic skills can only use
it for "pure" and "good" reasons - this is complete bull.
Psychic abilities are SKILLS, and you can use that skill for
whatever you want.

"When I was young I randomly had OBE's. I never told anybody
about this because there were no open minded people within 20
miles from my house. Anyways I finaly was able to sneek onto my
dad's computer to see if anyone could help me with control my
OBE's. Though most of it didn't help I was able to find one guy
who really seemed to understand what he was talking about...
Robert Bruce.

I'm sending you the link to his explination of Astral Projection
I hope it will help. AstralDynamics.com

I was also hoping you would put the rope tecnique in your OBE
article. It has really helped me gain control over my OBE's"

My comments: Robert Bruce is a strange character... I'm in the
process of reading his book (also titled Astral Dynamics), and
parts of me are impressed by his knowledge, but other parts of me
are very skeptical and question how he actually KNOWS this stuff.
Although people have reported that his techniques work, so he
must be doing SOMETHING right :-). Either way, I'm holding off
my judgement until I finish his book and try some things he's
suggested. Psionics and OBEs are very complicated, and we should
ALWAYS be skeptical of someone who seems to have all the answers.

"I've read a good bit of stories of people using TK, but all I'm
reading is mini things -- rolling a marble, moving a pen,
spinning a psi wheel -- and some things that are considered
macro-PK don't really seem too impressive. Some basic articles
say that anyone can use psi, but what about those who have been
able to use it like a toy? So far I have only been successful in
doing TK without trying (and some a bit impressive - sliding a
chair across a room from watching a horror movie), but when I do
try, I exhaust myself to almost passing out. I have been able to
use basic psi just for the fun of it, but for people like me, is
it even remotely possible to enhance your psychic abilities to
the point that even macro-PK could not affect you?"

My comments: I'm not sure I understand your question, but I think
you're asking: How come you can easily move things when you
aren't trying, but when you do try it's really hard and
exhausting? My answer would be: I don't know :-). But what you
describe is actually pretty normal (if that makes you feel any
better :-P). When the conscious mind gets out of the way, it
seems the subconscious mind/body has little trouble moving
things. Stories of poltergeisting talk about amazing things -
levitating objects, making them fly across the room, moving
furniture and other large objects - while stories of controlled
PK pale in comparison. Rolling pens, spinning paper, etc. Why
is it like this? We haven't really figured that out yet.

"Well I made my psiweel spin but I'm sure everyone knows how to
do that. I'm writing because of my method; for such a long time
I could not spin the weel until I shot a spiraling beam of psi at
the tip of the psiweel and it spun!"

My comments: Cool :-). Thanks for sharing. This is why it's
important to invent your own methods.

cauf writes:
"When I try to do TK it seems to make wind push something. Say if
I look at a paper and want to push it I can feel wind going down
my arm and push the object. But if I sit in a room with no way of
making any wind at all the wind still seems to come or a cold
feeling comes down my arm. Is this normal?"

My comments: It sounds like you're pushing psi down your arm. Is
it normal? Eh... yes and no. It doesn't surprise me that you
can move things with that technique. Experiment with it and see
what else you can do. Can you send it down both arms? Can you
spin multiple psi wheels? Can you spin them in different
directions?

Diego writes:
"A friend of mine told me that some "bad", powerful and ancient
entity has "found me" but she told me not to worry too much as
she has put some kind of protective charm around me. I thought
that if I tried having an OBE it would posses my "empty" body.
I've read about some kind of security measures that the body
uses to prevent this like the silver cord and telepathic bocking.
Do you think it is safe for ME to have an OBE while this entity
has the knowledge of my existence?"

My comments: The first thing I am skeptical of is your friends
statement that some ancient entity has "found you". How can she
tell? Why do you trust her? Other than that, there are REPORTS
of things you can do to protect yourself - but I've never heard
reasons WHY these things actually protect you. Nor have I ever
heard of other entities possessing "empty" bodies! I personally
think it's just another thing people worry about because they
don't understand what is going on. We fear the unknown. If you
feel better after having "protection", then go for it. I
personally think it's all myths and superstition though. (Another
question to ponder is: why does some ancient entity care about
you? Don't you think they have better things to do? :-P)

obsidian writes:
"I was thinking the other day how to slow down the postings on
the forums. As to avoid people posting so constantly that its
like theire chatting. I dont know if this idea was said in the
meeting that was had but here goes:

Instead of stopping people from posting more than every five
minutes or something, only limit the time between posting in the
same thread. That should be good for people who dont spend much
time online and usualy post their stuff in "bursts" and leave
till the next day; and at the time avoid people from flooding
places with nonsense."

My comments: That sounds like a good idea! I'll have to remember
that if things aren't working out.

"I am a begginer to psionics and will be using blogger to log my
daily practice and results. I hope to use it as a guide for
begginers like my self with no resources for like a program for
learning. It is http://psilog.blogspot.com "

My comments: Cool :-). Thanks for sharing.
