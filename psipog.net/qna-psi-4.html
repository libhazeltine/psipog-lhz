                  <p>I have a friend who has developed Telepathy, though he can only read minds to get numbers from 1 to 100. I read that stress is the cause of the natural development of psi (and also that it is hereditary). However, he doesn't seemed stressed out and I'm sure no one in his family has any experience
                  with psionics. Is it possible that he developed Telepathy through eustress (the good stress)?</p>

                  <p>Although it is possible that he has developed telepathy through a form of stress, the research on those types of situations is _very_ limited, in my experience.</p>

                  <p>In a research paper I read recently, they were discussing the apparent genetic heredity of psionic ability. The way that they described is was the same way that they described babies being born with callusses on their feet, in that it was a trait that was inherited through the use of the parents
                  (mother and father are difficult to determine with each of these cases), and cited a few other rare examples from nature.</p>

                  <p>However, this explanation doesn't appease me much either. Honestly, I don't know what causes any type of psionic developement beyond the fact that psionic parents yeild psionic children (whether this is through the above phenomenon, sub-conscious messages, exposure to psionic phenomenon, or
                  psionic parents teaching their children psionics I can but guess). Also, some naturals seem to just "crop up" through occurence, and become sensitive after finding the benefits of such abililty.</p>

                  <p>So, in answer to your question: Stress may have induced a particular instance of telepathy and caused in him a desire to learn more (and begun training). However, we have very limited research as to the process on how people become psionic without training.</p>

                  <p>Do you think there is a conection between being in a very sleepy state and the effectivness of Psi? Last night I had an OOB and I was doing it with my own free will.I had to tell myslef to stop doing it because it felt sort of wrong like It felt hard to move.I would try to move my arm and it would
                  move slowly and only if I tried my hardest to move it.</p>

                  <p>To tell you the truth I've never trained with Psi.I seem to be able to do it better when I relax myself and think of nothing.</p>

                  <p>I personally believe the majority of the benefit is better communication with the subconscious. If you're in a sleepy state, your subconscious is more open to suggestion.

                  <p>The Threefold Law is a religious thing, not a Physical law. It is from a religion very different from mine, so I'm not going to comment further.</p>

                  <p>Moving and/or affecting objects with psi "energy" is "psychokinesis". It is indeed possible, and has been done, by assorted humans, chickens, and so on. In the strict sense, "energy" is nothing more or less than "the ability to do work". Therefore, moving or affecting an object _must_ be done with
                  energy. I suspect that you were referring to the looser usage, hence the initial answer.</p>

                  <p>If you're having trouble with tk, you're not alone. That complaint is rather common, really. Work on small, simple effects, such as the ubiquitous "psiwheel", and forcing dice-rolls. Some folks pick it up immediately, and others take twenty years or more. Most people give it up as not worth the
                  effort, unless they are coming at it from the other side of things, needing to learn to control tk that happens when they _don't_ want it to.</p>

                  <p>I have been working on the PSI wheel for a short time now and have been getting great results (pat on my back). Anyway, about the time I started doing PK I got involved with self-hypnosis and subliminal hypnosis and have gotten very noticeable results. I recently read your article (I think it was)
                  about the sub-consciousness and its connection to PK, I started wondering if you could use subliminal messaging hypnosis to, for a lack of a better word bring out or heighten your abilities? I have seen subliminal tapes for almost everything under the sun except for anything encompassing the whole
                  mind over matter thing. I know the concept of how to make them, but would it be worth my time? Have you ever played with the idea?</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hello, I am a 14-year-old, new to the site and only just begining to discover my psionic ability. Before I found out about PsiPog, I had already been taking a class in the Chinese discipline Chi-Kung, also spelled qigong. In the first class, the instructor giuided us through the creation of what
                  he called a chi-ball, a process remarkably similar to Peebrain's method of making psi-balls (focus &amp; relaxation, visualization, drawing energy from your source, adding energy to the ball, etc). I have searched your fascinating site fairly thoroughly, and I don't think this similarity has been
                  addressed elsewhere on PsiPog (if I am wrong, please correct me). My question is: is it possible that psi is, in fact, the same energy that eastern philosophers have been calling "chi" for thousands of years? Has anyone else involved with PsiPog used chi-based disciplines to improve their psionic
                  skills?</p>

                  <p>Yes, yes it is entirely possible that they are the same thing.</p>

                  <p>If you can accomplish psionic effects with it, it is therefore "psi". Psi is nothing more or less than the mechanism that allows such things as psychokinesis and telepathy to occur. It might be more than one mechanism, in fact. If you can move things with Chi/Qi, for example, it is therefore also
                  Psi.</p>
