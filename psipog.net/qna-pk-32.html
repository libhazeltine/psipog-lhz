                  <p>Hey,<br />
                  I know this is probably a question that has already been asked on this site, but at the moment I'm slightly strapped for time (My parents are finally out, and I'm not quite sure when they'll be back)... I havent been able to do psyonics for a while, but everything seems to be coming back right now..
                  (I'm still new at this and things are cutting in and out so to speak...) I was wondering if it were possible to effect the timing on street lights. If I'm stressed or emotionally charged, I've been able to change a red light to green and vice versa (sometimes skipping yellow almost entirely).. its
                  dangerous, and I know it- is there some way to controll it?... *opened a door at the mall today using it... my friend thought it was an automatic door... none of them are... it kinda freaked me out..*... this is normal... right..?<br />

                  <p>To gain control of that aspect of psychokinesis, as with most, the usual answer is to "practice". Practice affecting less-dangerous devices, though, such as the lamp in your bed-room, rather than street-lights.</p>

                  <p>Two. Micro and macro.</p>

                  <p>Telekinesis and Psychokinesis are the same thing. Both words mean "the movement or alteration of a physical substance by or with the mind, and not using any of the conventionally-recognised means of accomplishing same." They are often abbreviated as "tk" and "pk" respectively.</p>

                  <p>MicroPK involves messing around with probabilities. If you need statistical analysis of a large number of experimental trials to establish that the effect is not due to chance, the kind of pk you're doing is "micro".</p>

                  <p>MacroPK are the kinds of things more often associated with the word "telekinesis" in this kind of forum: spinning the psiwheel, levitating objects, heating water, lighting fires, and so on. If it can be demonstrated relatively conclusively on one trial, it is "macro", regardless of the size of the
                  effect.</p>

                  <p>Does telekinesis on the hands feel as a pressure slowly greatening or more of a instant magnetic force? Ni believes we are able, but I think Ni is confused by that fact that he started off with psi tk and possibly now has found his way over to some higher magnetic energy that is more powerful and

                  <p>Short version: whether he "has found his way over to some higher magnetic energy" or not, the effect is still psychokinesis (or "telekinesis", if you prefer....same thing). And, more to the point, if he can do psychokinesis with it, then it is "psi" by definition.</p>

                  <p>It's utter nonsense. Yet another variation of the new-age cattle-droppings which derive from half-understood Theosophical writings. The early books of Theosophy forbade demonstrating any verifiable psychic abilities. "Forbade", not "claimed it was impossible".</p>

                  <p>Telekinesis has been demonstrated without the loss of the ability by the one who demonstrated. I myself have done so...and I am certainly not the only one.</p>

                  <p>First off, your site is really a great site for this information. Hope it stays up for a loooong time:) I hope im not being neive asking this, but how long, roughly, would you say that one would need to practice a day to get a good advance in CryoKinesis? ALso, would meditation be needed, and if
                  so, this calms down the mind, right? but ones mind would get streessed again later through the day, so would meditation help? Thanks</p>

                  <p>1) The time it takes varies with the individual. Some people can get it to work in a matter of minutes, on their first day. Some take _years_ of practice, half an hour a day, six or seven days a week....and some never get it to work.</p>

                  <p>2) Meditation can be helpful, and can also be quite pleasant. It is not required, however.</p>
