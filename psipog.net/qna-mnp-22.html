                  <p>Hello! Well, this is my third question, but I promise not to overdo it in the future...<br />
                  As far as I've understood, there are two ways of making objectively visible psiballs or constructs: accidentally, which happens rarely, and by flaring it, which, if you have the neccesary skill, happens every time you try.<br />
                  But why is it "so simple" to make it visible just by employing a technique like flaring, while it is such a rare and hard thing to make the actual psiball visible? And, if light means energy and enough-light-to-be-visible means MUCH MORE energy, should I suppose that by flaring the bloody costruct
                  much more energy is employed than by actually CONSTRUCTING it????<br />
                  Thank you,<br />

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Alrighty - first thing I'll address is a small technicallity: when you make a psi ball visible, you are flaring it. You can also accidently flare a psi ball. So it's not "accident or flaring", it's "accidental flaring or intentional flaring". But now to the heart of your question...</p>

                  <p>This is what's going on - when people talk about accidental flaring, they are usually beginners who don't know how to flare intentionally. They usually make a psi ball, like they always do, but since they have a bunch of practice under their belt, they may put some extra oomph into the current one
                  they're making. As a result, it might flare. So, at first, it's usually accidental and it does take focus and practice to learn how to do it intentionally.</p>

                  <p>After you get the hang of it after a while, you can intentionally flare a psi ball "so simple". So, when you read an article about someone flaring it easily, that's because they already went through that stages of messing around with it, and having a hard time getting it to flare. They practice,
                  they learn, and NOW it comes to them easily. When you read about someone accidentally flaring, they are still in the "earlier stages", and at that time, it is harder.</p>

                  <p>I don't understand your last question, so I'll stop here.</p>

                  <p>Hi<br />
                  I have his question that just keeps bugging me. I know I don't have any psion around here in my city, so I'm relatively safe, and I don't have to bother much with defending. <img src="smile.gif"

                       class="smileyImg" /><br />
                  But since I started in psionics that I got curious, and I'm not trying to ask any way of attacking but, can anyone devise their own psichic attacks? And also, if it isn't asking much or being nosy <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"

                       class="smileyImg" />, do any of you guys (or girls) know how to attack. And also, I know this is offttopic, but how is "psichic" spelled, "psychic" or "psichic"?</p>

                  3) It is "psychic", refering to the soul or mind, personified in Greek myth by the Goddess Psyche. Same root as "psychology".<br />
                  By contrast, "psi" is the English spelling of the Greek letter at the start of Psyche's name, and was used as a variable, in reference to whatever mechanism allowed for telepathy and pk.</p>

                  <p>1) Vibrations are not a common sensation for shielding. Only way to tell for sure is to check and see if a shield is there...or better yet, if someone else is willing to check it for you, get a second opinion.</p>

                  <p>2) Those are standard symptoms of doing too much at once. The symptoms do _not_ indicate that you actually accomplished anything psionically, however.</p>

                  <p>What is the difference between a psi-ball and a ki-ball?

                  <p>A "psi-ball" is made out of "psi"; a "ki-ball" is made out of "ki". (Likewise, "tinfoil-balls" are made out of "tinfoil"; "icecream-balls" are made out of icecream; "lint-balls" are made out of "lint"; "snow-balls" are made out of "snow";....you get the idea.)</p>

                  <p>If a "ki-ball" can accomplish any verifiable effect in its own right -- be it healing, glowing, or knocking over your kid-sister's glass of orange juice-- it is therefore _also_ a "psi-ball". "Psi" is a fairly broad term, defined more by what it can _do_ rather than what it _is_.</p>

                  <p>My name is ben, and I'm having trouble with creating those "psiballs". I am starting to have doubt, but i know that doubt is THE worst enemy that you can have, so i try everyday. I get a "tingling" sensation almost every time, but i'm having trouble with the visualization part of it. Ok, what I do
                  is I try to think of SS4 Goku from dragonball z standing behind me with his hand on my shoulder, then i try to imagine his energy flowing into me. I get sord of a "tingling" feeling in my fingertips, but not in my palms. And I practice with my eyes closed, what am i doing wrong? is it because i don't
                  practice enough? Im really need some help with this... Oh, and i have Tourrettes Syndrome.(It's a psychological disorder) and I was also wanted to know if that would interfere or enhance my mental ability to create psiballs...Thanks, Ben</p>

                  <p>Tourrettes won't prevent you from creating psiballs.</p>

                  <p>As for making the psiballs, themselves, try tensing one finger and pointing it at the palm of the other hand. While the finger is tense, pretend it is a laser-pointer and draw on the other palm, from a distance of a couple inches. See if you feel/see/hear anything.</p>

                  <p>Then, "point" into a spot, with the same tensed finger, and spin the "laser" into a ball.</p>
