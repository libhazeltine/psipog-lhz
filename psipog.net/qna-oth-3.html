                  <p>Hello, I was just trying to go out of body, I have never actually done this, and when I tried to induce the infamous "vibrations" my bodie started shaking, almost like miniature convulsions; also, my left leg tensed up, and my head was shaking more than the rest of me. My question is this: Am I
                  doing something wrong such as trying to create the vibrations, starting too early, etcetera. Or is this normal and will stop once I am more relaxed trying this?<br />
                  Thanks much, and good luck for everyone affected by Katrina.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Don't worry about creating the vibrations. Vibrations only happen SOMETIMES, and some people NEVER feel them. Worry about the primary goal: leaving your body. The vibrations aren't physical vibrations either - your physical body parts aren't vibrating (although it FEELS like they are when/if the
                  vibrations happen). Short story shorter: vibrations happen sometimes, and are more of a neat little side effect. Don't get hung up if you aren't feeling them. But don't be surprised if you do feel them.</p>

                  <p>I was reading the Q&amp;A, and I came upon one that said something about "lentation"... So I looked up 'lentation' in the articles, and Q&amp;A... and it didn't really tell how to do lentation. I also looked up 'time distortion' in the Q&amp;A and articles, but there were 37 pages of results... so
                  yeah... I was wondering: is there an article that explains how to do lentation?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>No, not here. The are many conflicting beleifs about what the true nature of lentation is. (ex) is it biofeedbacking your adrenaline to surge (indicating that continueing practice harms you) or is it a psychokinetic slow down of time (dubious), or does it depend on our time perception? At any
                  rate, because no one is truely sure on what it's nature is (or indeed, how to do it), there is no article on lentation on psipog.</p>

                  <p>However, I know that there are several books about it. Try searching ebay for "controlling the moment" "being the in moment" "slowing time" and such, occasionally in joint with remote viewing.</p>

                  <p>'Lentation' is a term that was invented to label time distortion. I think 'time distortion' is a good enough label (and so does pretty much everyone else), so you might find more information on google using that term. Meditation and hypnosis accomplish this.</p>

                  <p>Hi,<br />
                  Funny you should ask. I've had so many people ask about this that I've been working on a book about my inner voice and how to develop it.<br />
                  I'm still writing, though, and the publication process takes two years (at least for my pokey publisher) so don't hold your breath.<br />
                  <br />

                  <p>1) This is true. Pendling is used to simplify communication with the subconscious.<br />
