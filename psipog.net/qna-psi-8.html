                  <p>I was trying to find out more about what psi really is and how it occurs by looking in a dictionary(I couldn't get on the internet at the time and we don't have an encyclopedia). It was the only source of information at the time, so I went to the back where it had meanings of symbols and signs. Of
                  course psi was one of the symbols. It classified it's use as physics and electricity and it had three names as definitions: dielectric flux, electrostatic flux, and luminous flux. I then tried to find their definitions and they came up with some intresting results.</p>

                  <p>Dielectric means that it can sustain an electric field, but does not conduct a current. Electrostatics deals with the phenomena accompanying electric charges at rest or static electricity. A luminous flux was the rate of flow of light radiation. And a flux is any excessive or unnatural discharge
                  of a fluid from body matter.</p>

                  <p>I'm not to sure what it means, but I am guessing that psi is a flux and that it can sustain an electric field and is a phenomena that comes when electric charges rest or static electricity occurs.</p>

                  <p>Can someone tell me what is useless about the above information and what is good? I'd like some insight on my research.</p>

                  <p>Excellent question. "Psi" is used as a variable, much as other Greek and Roman letters are, in Maths and Physics. This variable denotes an "unknown quantity".</p>

                  <p>The one we're dealing with here, is the mechanism that allows such things as Psychokinesis and Telepathy to happen. It may in fact be a group of mechanisms, rather than just one. It is _more_ understood now, than when the term was coined, half a century ago, but the details are still undetermined.
                  One of the more useful "models" is the "byproduct of nervous function" one bandied about on many sites. "Psionics" was coined in parallel to "nucleonics", "electronics", and so on, with an "unknown mechanism". Hence "Psionics", rather than "Psyonics" which would have been derived from "Psychic" or
                  "Psychical", itself derived from "Psyche" (referring to the mind or soul)....from the name of the Greek Goddess Who personified the concept of the mind.</p>

                  <p>hey all,<br />
                  I have a quick question... When doing tk, is there a force pushing back at you as a reaction from the force you are exerting? Like in Newtons law "every action has an equal and opposite reaction". IF so that would put some limits on what one can move. For instance, if you try to push over a tree you
                  would just be pushing yourself backwards.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Yep, there does indeed appear to be the reaction from the force you are exerting. On something small like a psiwheel, it is not likely to be enough to notice. Lift your couch, on the other hand, and you'll feel it. As for the tree, that would depend on the age and species, don't you think? A
                  yearling Dwarf Crabapple would be different from an adult Douglas Fir. ;) People keep telling me that there are no practical limits to what can be moved telekinetically. My experience of it, however, would indicate otherwise. Whether such limits as my colleagues and I have found are "real" or "all in
                  our heads" is open to question, I suppose.</p>

                  <p>All throughout the articles (about TK) on this site, the authors keep mentioning everything in the Universe is made up out of energy, and all this energy is connected to eachother. Now I've read on this site that psionics can be used to heal certain "minor" diseases. Wouldn't it be possible to
                  heal life threatening diseases as well? Let's take cancer for an example. If it's possible to set a candle alight with your mind by making the atoms move faster, shouldn't there also be some way to correct the defective cells in a cancer patient's body? This doesn't seem all that strange to me, but
                  what is your perception?</p>

                  <p>Yes, it can be done. However, it is possible to do more harm than good if you mess up. Most psionic healing methods beyond the simplest approaches for the most minor of conditions require knowledge of anatomy and physiology, and other things appropriate to a medical school A site such as this one,
                  devoted to teaching beginners the bare rudiments of psionics, is not the correct forum to teach healing in depth.</p>

                  <p>It varies with the context, but sometimes I've used it to mean the same mechanism designated as "psi", in an awkward attempt to avoid the silly "this is what psi is, and those things are not psi" arguments. Whatever it is that you would use to push a psiwheel around (those of you who aren't using
                  heat convection currents, that is) or to Send a Ping: those are "psi". My personal "oomph" slang also is meant to imply that the New Age White-lights-and-fluffy-bunnies idea of "You just need to visualise this; you don't need to use any energy" does not apply to whatever activity is under discussion.
                  If it affects something outside your own body, "energy" of some variety is needed. Psionics does not violate the laws of Physics.</p>

                  <p>As far as I know, the discovery was accidental. Instances of clairvoyance and telepathy were noted in experiments with hypnosis, and these incidents piqued the curiosity of the researchers. Later, in the twentieth century, the Soviets experimented with training regular folks in psi-abilities,
                  simply for lack of a ready supply of "gifted" personnel to test. When they were successful in such attempts to some degree or another, the experimentation in that regard was widened. These all pre-date the birth of the regulars here at PsiPog, though; the idea that psionics can be taught to "nons"
                  did not originate with us.</p>

                  <p>I have heard of the "myth" that we only use about 10 or 20 percent of our brain for concious thought. Even though I've done research on this all over the internet, I still don't know if this is true or not. But, hypothetically, if it was true, would that remaining 80 or 90 percent (subconcious) be
                  able to cause all these happenings mentioned on this site? I've read most if not all the articles and they usually mention the subconcious and how it causes these things, so, wouldn't our subconcious mind be 4 times as powerful as our concious?

I believe that carbohydrates are pretty flamable (if I'm remembering my biology class information correctly)... and our body is made up of a ton of carbs, so my guess would be that something screws up, and starts a huge chain reaction.
