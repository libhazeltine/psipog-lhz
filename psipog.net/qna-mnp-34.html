                  Yes, manipulating psi can cause nerve damage. Do not move it along your neural pathways. Please read Rainsong's article on this matter.</p>

                  <p>Psiballs are primitive psionic constructs. Many kinds of Shields are also psionic constructs. Therefore, Psiballs have something in common with many kinds of Shields. Both constructs can be programmed to do an assortment of things, but the average newbie's Psiball lacks the "oomph" to accomplish
                  much.</p>

                  <p>Hey, i tried making a psiball today. I was lying down in the bed, looking at the lamp visualising that the energy flowed from the lamp to my body.</p>

                  <p>Then i closed my eyes, and lifted my hands cupped and i visualised the power coming from my feet, arms, legs, everywhere and that it went from there up into my hands.</p>

                  <p>I did that for a while, maybe 1-2 minutes and then it felt like it pushed a little inside my hands and it felt quite strange at my wrists, like there was power around the wrists.</p>

                  <p>And the eyes started to flicker a little while i did it. It had no effect and it wasnt visible when i threw it, but do you think i was on my way making a psiball?</p>

                  <p>You don't have to. You don't have to learn anything, really. But I think I get where your question is coming from - will you need shields from just practicing TK? Probably not. With TK, you are affecting the outside world, not being affected by the outside world (which is what shields are there
                  for). But if you start meditating, who knows what "doors" you'll open <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>1. You don't HAVE to... but sure, try it out. Try visualizing (aka imagine) the energy moving around your body and into your hands.</p>

                  <p>2. At first it's kinda hard to know for sure. After a few times though, you start to feel it (like, you feel a warm pressence on your skin, for example).</p>

                  <p>3. Could be warm, could be cold, could feel pulls, or pushing... Just keep practicing and find out yourself what it feels like.</p>

                  <p>4. Some people get it their first try, most in a week or two, and some have never created one. So... try, and try, and when you get it, you get it.</p>

                  <p>It isn't so much a matter of changing your appearance (or not-appearance, in the case of invisibility), as affecting how other people perceive you. Making people think you look like a fox is well within the realm of possibility, but the illusion will be incongruous if you don't act like a fox.</p>

                  <p>It is optional. Some of us simply use the stuff that seems to accumulate in our fields, and some prefer to deliberately "generate" the stuff on an as-needed basis. However, if drawing from an outside source works for you, go for it. Be aware that for some people, using "outside" energies appears
                  to cause problems, so you might want to keep an eye on things, when experimenting.</p>
