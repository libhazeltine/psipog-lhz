Dear PsiPog Users,

We got a BUNCH of new e-mail from people about the newsletter, so
that's awesome. I'm going to try to get through most of it. I
love hearing from everyone, so let me know what you think by
e-mailing: newsletter@psipog.net

"I have a friend who doesn't want to do anything with the site
(I dunno why) BUT! He discovered a new way to shield!

He was imaginating himself as an atom. He was the core and the
neutrons where surrounding him like a shield. He started feeling
the shield right away! and I did it too and it was the easiest
technique to shield!"

My comments: Cool :-). If it works, use it.

"Can you put something about contacting your subcounsious? I've
tried it but I don't know if I'm really contacting it or I'm just
making up the answers, so could you help me out? Thanks!"

- - - - -

My comments: Well, you ARE making up the answers.

Remember that the subconscious is just another part of YOU. That
part of you is delivering messages to your conscious mind every
second. Even RIGHT NOW. I would suggest clearning your mind of
as much thought as possible. Get all that junk out and just stay
quiet for a few minutes. You need to be good at getting your
mind to shut up. After you can do that pretty good, pose
yourself a question, and WAIT for the answer. Don't create an
answer. If you receive nothing, then that's ok - just keep
waiting. Don't think to yourself "Hmmm... I bet I'll receive
something like Blah, or that I won't receive anything at all."
Keep your mind quiet, and sit there and wait.

Speaking of shutting your mind up, I received a message about
meditation. The next message will tie in with what I'm saying
here, so keep reading! :-P

"I have noticed, that though many people (writers to be specific)
on PsiPog mention meditating before doing stuff... But there is
not a very clear How-to or steps mentioned for meditating. So I
thought I would mention it and maybe you will write something
about it.

And I will also mention my favourite meditations.

First of all the world famous HamSa meditation...
In any relaxed posture in a quiet place focus on the sound of
breathing. It sounds like Ham or Hum when going in and Sa when
coming out......... Thats it.

There is another one I do specifically for Telepathy... I don't
know if it really counts as a meditation. I stare at a candle
flame in a dark place for some time, and breath slowy throught
nose, and eventually, my mind just gets blank.... Maybe its for
focus, maybe not, but it works for me ;-)"

- - - - -

My comments: Good stuff :-). There are a lot of meditation
techniques, but the idea is pretty simple. All you want to do is
just slow your head down for a second, and relax.

Breathe deep, close your eyes, and get in a comfortable spot.
Just relax. It's so simple, it's confusing :-P.

One meditation technique that I use is called progressive
relaxation. What you do is lay down, close your eyes, and start
breathing in deep and slowly. After you're comfortable, just go
to each body part, and tell it to relax and sleep. It takes a
while to get through the entire body... But don't rush it. The
point is to just relax, so take your time.

For example, I first start with my feet. I tell my feet, "Hey
guys, you did a great job today, but now it's time to just relax
and fall asleep." I relax all my muscles in my feet, and just
let it go. Then I move to my calves. Then my thighs. My hips,
abdomen, chest, arms, neck, shoulders, back, and face. If you're
interested, you should be able to find some more indepth tips
online or at your library.

The Doctor writes about Psychokinesis:

"Wat up milkshakes,
This is the DOCTOR! Im going to give you some aid, : p.
Ok guys here it goes:

Lets try a battery. Ok, you want to roll the battery. What you do
is this. Picture the object as your thumb. Do exactly want you do
when you want to move your thumb. Just try to add some wieght
that is equal to the battery. Now move your "thumb" slowly!
Remember, the battery is your thumb.

Practice guys.
DOCTOR's approval!:p"

My comments: Heh, good idea :-). Imagining the object is part
of your body is a good way to develop that "oneness" connection
with it.

"Hey, I was wondering if there are any practices to Lucid dream.
Ive heard of a reality test but it doesnt seem to work for me.
Any information would be appreciated."

My comments: Actually, I'm working on a Lucid Dreaming Manual for
PsiPog.net - but I don't know when I'll be done. In the
meantime, I suggest surfing around www.dreamviews.com . They
have some good information, and a friendly community to help out.

=================================================================

Alrighty :-D. Thanks to everyone for writing in.

As far as news about PsiPog.net is concerned - I'm planning on
updating to the new design before Thanksgiving. I'm also working
on a Lucid Dreaming Manual, and maybe another article too. Annie
has sent me a Manual as well - once we pound out the details,
that will be online too.

I've been working on the new chat as well. So, hopefully SOON
there will be some cool updates. Thanks for reading! :-)
