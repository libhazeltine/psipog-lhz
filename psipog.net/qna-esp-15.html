                  <p>erm well. ok so, telepathy requires two minds. and no, you can't just make up an imaginary friend. try the psipog chat to find a practice partner.<br />
                  as far as animals go, i don't know dude. what animals do you have handy?<br />

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I'm 28, and have had this ability for at least 10-12 years...I can "see" with my eyes closed. Usually it happens spontaneously just before I go to sleep, in a semi-hypnogogic state. I usually don't even think about it twice, or mention it, But last night, it was stronger than ever.</p>

                  <p>I could see everything clearly, but I was still fully awake! I squeezed my eyes tightly shut, just in case, but still it was like having them wide open. I waved my hand in front of my face, and even moved around the room with no problem. I always half-figured that this ability was just my
                  imagination working overtime, but last night really confirmed it's authenticity. I had to cover my head with blankets just so I get some sleep! (Seeing with your eyes closed has disadvantages)</p>

                  <p>Also, I've been having these reccuring lucid dreams where I wake up in "layers". Meaning I wake up within a dream, over and over. I'm lucid the whole time, and it seems completely real, and it's unsettling. It's like having reality pulled out from under you, 4 or 5 times in a row.</p>

                  <p>My question is, what's happening to me? it's getting pretty weird, and I can't really talk to anyone about it unless I want to be labeled as crazy. By the way, you may be thinking that the seeing-with-my-eyes-closed thing is just another lucid dream. It's not.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Seeing with your eyes closed is actually not as uncommon as you might think. I can't express exactly, precisely how I "turn it off", but it is possible to do so. Your mind, brain, subconscious, and body are all really smart elements of you. My suggestion is ask yourself, or more specifically ask
                  your eyes "What do you need from me to make my eyes 'really' shut so that I can sleep?". I'm willing to bet money you'll get at least one answer from yourself.<br />
                  As far as the dreaming goes, it almost seems to me like you're taking some kind of medication. These "layers" as you describe them are usually associated with narcotics (not necessarily illegal ones!), anti-psychotics, and the like. If you aren't on any medication, and this is plain sobriety sleep
                  for you - try peebrain's method of continually asking yourself "Am I dreaming?". When the answer is yes, take it a step further. Tell yourself "I'm done dreaming now."<br />

                  <p>Sometimes I know things that will happen. Such as during class, I know who my partner is going to be and then it happens, it's him. Or I know what my verb will be in Italian class, and sure enough it's right. It just happens like a slap, suddenly I KNOW that it's going to happen, I am so sure of
                  it that I would easily bet a million. I'm not sure what this is. Someone told me I was clairvoyant and had the gift of sight as i also often get deja vu and I sometimes get really bad vibes/see glimpses of what i think are spirits/Feel like perhaps someone else it there.

                  <p>Hello!</p>

                  <p>I believe I am clairvoyant. I get feedback from people that i am right about the things I see. But somehow I've always wondered. When I focus on a person or an object, I get the answers in a colored daydream vision. This happens in awake state.<br />
                  I do however see pictures and visions that are in full color and appear like very clear "videos", but this usually only happens when I am in a hypnagogic state. I also dream about the future a lot.<br />
                  These colored daydreams seems to be telling the truth however, so I am wondering - am I the only one who sees it this way or should I always have clear pictures?</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Over 20 years ago I had a brief telepathic encounter with a man. (I felt eyes upon me and I looked up, asking "who are you?" He shouted back telepathicly, "You're with the wrong man" I shut down.) The experience then overwhelmed me and I blocked other encounters until 2 months ago. We are now
                  linked. I have been away from any association with paranormal activities (not experiences) during the 20 years. Until 2 days ago, when I found this site, I didn't even know or understand what was happening. This man is able to sheild himself so I am not too flooded with information. I, on the
                  otherhand, am broadcasting everything. I have read about shielding but need more information on how to filter every little brain side track away from him. I don't want to practice sheilding for fear of doing it wrong and temporarily blocking him. I do not want to break the link. I don't think that it
                  can be broken now. Because of my situation, there is no physical connection (he is 2 time zones away) or communication between myself and the man. I am Empathic, and avoid crowds as much as possible. I think that I have avoided too much contact in the past by hiding myself with a mousey exterior.
                  Everything is hidden behind that cloak and I don't allow most people to see me for what I am.<br />

                  <p>So let me get this straight.<br />
                  You want to have the benefits of intricate shielding, but don't want to practice it.<br />
                  Does that about sum it up?<br />
                  I recommend reading, then rereading the telepathy manual. I also recommend getting over your fear of breaking a link (which can always be reestablished!) and start shielding.<br />
                  Keep in mind, the longer you've had the problem, the longer it takes to recover.<br />
