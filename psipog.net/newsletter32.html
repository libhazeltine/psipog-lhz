"Every problem has a gift for you in its hands."
- Richard Bach


Dear PsiPog Users,

Psipog is still alive and trucking along at a steady pace. The
chat has picked up as everyone is on vacations during the
summer. Stop by and beware if you come unarmed with a bag of
insanity to unleash on those who have truckloads of it. As for
the progress of the new site design, it is still being coded and
hopefully out some time in the near future. Other than that,
good luck in your practices and don't stress yourself too much.

=================================================================

Last week's Activity
This time every take time upon going to sleep to try and
achieve and OBE. It is as simple as laying there till you feel
yourself drifiting off to sleep, and you are having brief
flashes of daydreams/minidreams. When this happens, try to
keep your mind awake while still experiencing what is happening
naturally. Once you feel ready(should be slight vibrations, or
a semi-detatched feeling from your body) to, try and focus on a
particular part of your body, and try and feel it moving out
and above your body. For a longer, and more understandable
reference go here : art-outline-to-shielding.html168


=================================================================

Activity #5:
This activity involves a bit of Remote Viewing and Energy
Manipulation. What I want you do to is program a construct to
be your "camera" and send it off to some remote location you
will have later access to, like your friends house(but not
without permission, of course). Be sure and to program to
to take in sights in the area. Then program another construct
that will sit at your house and recieve the information from
your "camera". Afterwards link the two, and then try at random
times to link to the construct in your house, and see if you
recieve any information from your "camera" construct.

This was sent in by DjBenz, Its a bit lengthy, which is why I am
posting it here at the front :

In my research I came across Out of body experiences. I am
convinced as of last December that I have indeed accomplished
it. Though not of my free will. Its hard to explain now being
that it happened 3 months ago but...my friend claims he can see
ghosts...and I believe him. He also has Lucid Dreams(which
i've also been studying). It was Sunday the morning I woke up
and felt a strange sensation. I rose up and was about to get
out of my bed when something happened. I looked down at my
hands and I swear when I moved them it looked like they
were doing Bullet Time or something like The Matrix. I could
see the trails of my hands when I moved them and then Bam its
over. The next night I spent the night at my friends house. I
woke up that night and saw my friend sitting up watching tv,
but I was having that weird sensation again only this time it
was stronger. It was like the WHOLE room suddenly went all
trippy (no I do not to drugs). Seriously though, everything
was moving and I was getting scared. I look at my friend and
tried to get his attention so I put out myhand and tried to
tap him on his shoulder, but I LIE TO YOU NOT my hand went
right through his body! I'm surprised that my mind could
handle that. He stopped and turned around slowly and then
I looked at my hands again and finally came back to normal.
Later on that week he told me what he saw. When I told him that
I tried to tap him he said he felt this extreme hot sensation
not necesarily HOT like an iron, but the way he described it
it was like his blood boiled from the inside that kind of
hot. Anyways he was stunned for a second and slowly turned
around to see what it was, and told me that
he saw this smokey hazy kind of ghostly shape in the air and
it had my face and it was looking right at him, but then he
looked down beside it and he saw me laying down with my eyes
closed sleeping. And then I went back inside my body and I
woke up. Of course I was not aware of this, but I believed
him because I had never felt that before. It was amazing, but
it only happened when I went to sleep. I began to think that
since I knew how to go through the vibration process on my
own awake and laying down, but am too scared to follow
through with it. It doesn't happen, but theres no
need for fear when you're asleep so I thought that maybe I
just did the vibration thing when I was sleeping and somehow
when I left my body. This only happened for a week, and since
then I've been trying to do it again, but again I seem to get
scared when I feel its about to happen. But on the other
hand...I really don't want to admit I'm not ready...

Also an advance story for those of you still reading ^_^.
There was one morning that I was watching TV and my friend
was sitting beside me. I was laying down and all of a sudden
I went to sleep. When I woke up my friend was way on the
other side of the room and he looked scared. I asked him
franticaly what happened since we had been experimenting with
my new found ability. He told me that my sock was touching his
leg and that he suddenly felt that burning sensation again and
he jumped up and turned around to see what it was. He saw me
rise out my body and get sucked back in, and thats when I
woke up. Also my friend told me later on that there was
one night that he woke up, and saw me walking across his
room. I walked by the TV toward the bathroom and he called
out my name, but I didn't answer. He then got annoyed and
was about to go to sleep when he turned over and saw me right
next to him sleeping. He thought this couldn't be possible since
he just saw me go to the bathroom so he waited. Thinking that
there might be someone else in his house, but he was to scared
to go look. Then when he saw me come out the bathroom and cross
the TV he said it looked like I was gliding across the room,
and then I went back into my body. Now the only explanation I
have for that since I don't recall this happening is that I was
somehow sleep walking, but in OBE form, which seems very odd.
Anyway these events only took place that week, but the symptoms
that I went through when it happened were so nerve breaking that
I stayed up all night every night just to shake them. Because
for some reason they only happened when I went to sleep. I would
wake up and you know the rest. I'm also puzzled at the fact that
when I touched him it felt extremely HOT we talked about it and
came to the conclusion that maybe: theghost of people who are
dead feel cold if you walk through them or something but if you
Astral Project you're obviously alive, so instead
you just get really HOT. Also in addition to that, he told me
that whenever I did this...my spirit was naked...this I don't
know if I should believe. I'd really like some opinions ^_^


My Comments: Well this is certainly a good combination for
finding some things out. You have one guy who can OBE, and
another who says he can see the other in OBE form. If you
are wanting to get more information about what is going on
personal experience is always the best for teaching ourselves.
You should work on being more passive, and maintaining a
calm state throughout the OBE process. If all of them happen
while you are asleep, work on telling yourself before you go
to sleep, that when such things happen, you are going to
remain calm, and try and associate with the events going on.
This way when the actual event occurs, your brain may decide
to relate your messages from earlier to what you are
experiencing, and this may help you remember to stay calm. As
for the hot/cold issue, not all ghost cases involve a drop
in temperature. This is just a cliche event most people
try and associate with all ghost, when in actuality
in some cases people report a rise in temperature. It all
depends on the situation, really.

Now to dig into the mail bag....

=================================================================

Mortal Abbattoir wonders:
I was wondering what to do about excitement during OBE's. Alot
of times, I will lay there.. get the minidreams.. then find
myself floating above my body, and something I find or see that
I was unable to in my physical body excites me to the point of
returning back to my body. For example.. once I was floating
above my body while my back and head lay against the wall. I
get closer to my head and move the hair out of the way and see
an extremely bright pea-sized thing right in the center of my
forehead. The moment I saw it, I exclaimed "My third eye!" and
came back to the physical.

Any techniques you know of on how to not get so excited?

My comments: As I mentioned earlier, you can work on telling
yourself you will remain calm. Also since you seem to be
working more with them from being awake, it will be a natural
reaction the more you have for the novelty to wear off of that
initial excitement. After this happens, you will notice that
they will last a bit longer. At this point OBEs normally tend
to end due to random unexplained reasons or you get frustrated
because of something that happens, such as once when I got
stuck in a chair. Extreme emotion tend to be the reason my OBEs
end. So just work on staying passive, and it will eventually
come with time.

IanuFyreBird asks:
I have been trying to perform Macro PK, and I can't seem to do
it. My problem is that I doubt that it's even possible in the
first place. In other words, I don't "believe." I've done Micro
PK, and it's worked time and time again (I used the die-rolling
test and got about 50-60 out of 100 on 3 -- the one I wanted)
but it doesn't seem to be proof enough for me. I just can't
figure out why it won't work, then I get frustrated and give up.

On another note, I notice that I have my own way of
meditating that I've never seen anyone else do, but...people say
their meditation doesn't work as well as mine. Obviously, this
is either because they're bad at it, or because my method works,
but I was wondering what you had to comment on it. What I do
is I try to make sure I'm in a quiet place, and I either sit
cross-legged or I lay flat on my back with a few inches between
each of my legs and between my hands and body. Then, I close my
eyes to fully minimize sensory input, and visualize my body in a
third-person view. I see colors flowing through my body, because
this is how I visualize emotion (red is anger, yellow is
happiness, blue is sadness, etc., etc., etc.) and I will it
to come together, normally in my hands. Then, I merely will it
to leave my body, leaving me devoid of emotion, then I can focus
on whatever task I have at hand, normally talking one of my
friends through a problem, because those are the ones that
frustrate me the most.

My comments: First off, I myself, still don't truly believe
half of the things I do. I'm not speaking figuratively from
some other perspective like I am amazed at what I do. I'm
saying that truly when I think about it, I don't accept it
as easily as I do that this or that exist. I don't think I will
fully accept it until I do something so utterly amazing that I
myself cannot deny. This here is where personal opinions come
into play. While bob may simply need to spin a psiwheel before
he believes in it, Jim an avid believer in Science has many
ideas of why it spun on natural causes rather than of his
ability. It all comes down to personal beliefs, and overcoming
the ones that you don't favor. But with all this said, and you
mention yourself that you are still able to accomplish PK
without fully believing that you are doing it. I see belief
as an acquired thing, at first they assumed the world was flat
but until adequate proof, and a few years of idea being around
did they accept it was round. So don't let the lack of belief
stop you from doing something you have seen yourself do.

Kingkai ponders:
Hello. whenever I am in a meditative or sleepy state, or
whenever my mind wonders, I feel a tingly energy in my hands
and they get numb. I know that my hands arent asleep because
I know how -that- feels. I was wondering if I could somehow
use this energy for telekinesis. Sometimes even if I barely
think about this happening, then it happens right there and
then. also, is it true we have chakras in our hands? if so,
then are my hand chakras perhaps opening up? Thanks in advance

My comments: I can't answer about chakras, because personally
I don't practice anything to do with them, really. As for the
energy building up in your hands, though, I can say this. A few
weeks after I started practicing on up into about a year later
I would randomly feel energy in my hands. I attributed it to
just becoming aware of this new found sense of energy, and went
about my business. You can try and move it around if you want
or have fun with it, but when I experienced it, it wasn't
really a build up, so much as me becoming aware that it was
there in the first place. As for using it for TK...I've heard
of one person who blends energy manipulation with TK and gets
nice results. It is basically just personal preference at this
point of TK. Later as you move to bigger objects, you may
want to give them a bit more energy and what not.

=================================================================

I was happy enough to find a group that talked about
telekenisis. Ever since I was in my adolesents I was facinated
by it.What are ways to develope this kind of ability and is it
even possible for people to develope this. I practice off and
on and sometimes I feel a weird sensation in my third eye but
nothing is happening.

My comments: When I first started Telekinesis, I first read
the articles on PsiPog, afterwards I tried it out, and could
only stop the psiwheel before I ever actually spun it. This
help me get motivated to actually try it. In time the more I
practiced the better I got. Its all about the motivation to
practice until you accomplish what you want to accomplish.
