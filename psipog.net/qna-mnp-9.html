                  <p>They can be detected, yes. However, whether any one specific person can feel them (ncluding the person who made them) depends on that person's sensitivity to such things. Making a construct and being able to detect a construct are two separate things.</p>

                  <p>When I make psiballs they are usually magnetic(at least feel like it)</p>

                  <p>I made my first psiball in just 5 minutes after reading how. About 2 days later, today, I just tried making a basic sheild and did it, followed by a (slightly)textured sheild of a blanket. Hopeing my luck would hold out I tried to make a psiball flare, but I quit when I started to feel fatigue.
                  Afterwards I noticed my hands were acting like magnets, but sticking to anything they touched. So I was wondering if:</p>

                  <p>1.If you feel magnets in your psiballs, could they accually magnatize the iron in your blood or something? This "could" be one reason people can fry electronics.</p>

                  <p>and</p>

                  <p>2.Will you yell at me for trying to flare to early?</p>

                  <p>Hello. Recently I've seemed to get the hang of things, from the curious newbie I was, I have developed some skill with constructs and general psychokinesis. Just recently, I decided to try flaring off a construct. I read the articles on it, and was getting pretty close to success, I could see an
                  after-image sort of forming... and when I got close to "exploding" it, the surge protector for my computer sparked off, and all of its insides melted. Is this normal? Or should I try some sort of a shield next time?<br />
                  Oh, btw, this site is really one of the most comprehensive, intelligent, and informative I've ever seen. Keep up the good work.</p>

                  <p>I made a large sheild surrounding my entire house and programmed it to pull in energy from things around it. Ive got a reservoir of energy now, the sheild leaks a little, but each day the energy inside it grows a little more, im now able to(finally) use telekinesis to move a psiwheel, and when im
                  making a construct inside it will use the energy in the reservoir as well as my own energy, this makes it easier, im able to make and manipulate constructs very easily now, I had started using a crystal before this, but it just wont store anymore energy, it is a small crystal, but it stored plenty of
                  energy, but its basically full now. I was wondering if you know the cons and pros of making a reservoir of energy like this.</p>

                  Con: pulling "energy" from surrounding "sources" implies that it is pulling from nearby people, animals, etc. This is an inherently hostile act --it can make folks very sick-- so don't be surprised it you get whapped for it. There is no kind of Shield that keeps out everything....</p>

                  <p>Is it possible to "put too much" into a shield? I was creating one today while meditating and I was feeling unusually more psychically active than normal. And I just kept adding more and more energy into my shield. Making it denser and denser and squeezing it tightly to my body. But I had to stop
                  because the pressure on my body was so strong that it was uncomfortable. I continued to meditate for another half hour or so, but the pressure would not go away so dispersed my shield and the pressure steadily lifted. Did I overdo it?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>It is quite possible to overdo that. Another possibility is that you weren't paying enough attention to the shape, size and format of the Shield you were making. There is no reason to squeeze it close to your body, unless you happen to like the "coziness" of that feeling. A lot of people find that
                  uncomfortable. Next time, try making it a bit bigger, to give yourself more room.</p>

                  <p>Its mass is negligible. Sensing constructs is a different ability from making constructs. For the moment, don't worry if you do not "really feel" yours. The only real way to establish whether it is there is to have someone _else_ perceive it.</p>

                  <p>Hello there,</p>

                  <p>I've been having alot of trouble even feeling the psi when I'm supposed to be pooling it in my body. None the less, I've read that the feeling might not show at the first couple of tries, but I've been trying for quite a while now, and still nothing. I've tried taking the psi from several places
                  such as Earth, the sun, the moon and the air itself, to mention a few. At the same time I've tried pooling it to different areas of my body, with no results either. I dont think it's my visualization either, since that's pretty much the simplest thing of it all. I've also been playing with PK, with
                  no results either. And I was sort of hoping that some of you could help me, and maybe tell me if there's some common mistakes that might apply to me. I feel absolutely nothing different, so the theory of the "no-that's-not-it" is probably not the problem either.</p>

                  <p>Thanks for reading, hope you'll answer it too.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>First the bad news:</p>

                  <p>1) Some people get no results at all in PK, for _years_.<br />
                  2) There are also some people who never really _feel_ the psi-stuff at all, even though quite a few of these people can use the stuff quite well.</p>

                  <p>As for what to do about it:</p>

                  <p>1) Practice as though you are doing it right. Most folks appear to have enough psi-stuff caught in their fields, anyway, to do basic practice. The symptoms of overextending yourself are physical; being unable to sense the psi stuff is irrelevent to that.<br />
                  2) Try some of the other aspects of psionics, such as the various games at the Garden of Dreams www.psiarcade.com/garden</p>

                  <p>Without further details about exactly what you are doing, it is difficult to offer more detailed advice.</p>
