                  I promise there are no new veins, but if it happens again please consult medical care. Or at the very least, chill out for a few days on the practicing.</p>

                  <p>Something thats happens to me sometimes is when im making a psi ball a small circle on my palms starts to tingle i was wondering if that was normal? Also i was reading Peebrain's article about making them denser and when i tried it the tingleing circles started feeling like they were being poked
                  by a needle then when i tried to expand the psi ball it kinda felt like it blew up cause i could feel/sense energy comeing out of it like a wave and then i was gone, so if you have any explanation on what happened id love to know.</p>

                  <p>Hi guys,</p>

                  <p>i have run into a problem that has literally stuck with me since this summer. During the summer i started practicing psiballs and got overexited by my results. anyway i was trying to make one and there was a weak outward push in between my hands. since i was certain i had finally made one i fully
                  believed that i could make one easily wenever i wanted and, unfortunately i wanted to to much. i did nothing all day but make psi ball after psiball. ever since then my left hand always feels like its pulsating with psi and its really annoying. ive spent hours at a time trying to get the psi out of
                  my hands using every way imaginable. so i wanted to know if any of you might have a way for me to remove the psi from my hand because i'd do almost anything to get rid of it. sorry for making this so long</p>

                  <p>thank you,<br />

                  <p>Quite the pickle you have yourself in.</p>

                  <p>There are a few things you can do to rid yourself of this feeling.</p>

                  <p>Visualization. Visualize any excess energy leaving your hand, melting off, dissipating, exploding.</p>

                  <p>Use Rainsong's rattle method. Use a "rattle" to rattle away the excess psi.</p>

                  <p>See a doctor if nothing at all works. Pulsating isn't a healthy thing.</p>

                  <p>I have 3 questions in one.</p>

                  <p>1) This one would help me alot, because I'm taking a medicine that makes me really tired in the morning, and I don't like coffee. No, I can't get off the medicine, it is one that I need. What I want to know is, is it possible to make a caffine psi ball? That is, one that makes you more awake and
                  alert.</p>

                  <p>2) Is it possible to make a psiball strong enough to knock over a wine/beer bottle, or another small object? If so, has anyone here done so?</p>

                  <p>3) This is a question out of pure morbid curiosity. Suppose someone made a permanent construct. The construct would be around for about an hour, and then the person dies. Would the construct dissapate, or remain?</p>

                  <p>1. I would need to know more about the medication you take. I would discuss your lethargy with your medical doctor before I'd turn to caffinated constructs.</p>

                  <p>I've been trying out psi balls for a while now but I was wondering if you could help me is this question I've been meaning to ask for a long time:<br />
                  When I try to create a psi ball, my hands and my face get really hot. My vision sometimes...uh...kinda blurs into a reddish color o_o;<br />
                  Is this normal?</p>

                  <p>No. This is not normal.<br />
                  It concerns me that your face and hands get hot while trying to make constructs.<br />
                  Do you drink enough water?<br />
                  Are you trying to run a marathon without any previous conditioning?<br />
                  Get a physical from your doctor. Drink water and keep up your nutritional requirements. And perhaps chill out a bit on the practicing. No one expects you to master the psi ball in a day. Good luck.<br /></p>
