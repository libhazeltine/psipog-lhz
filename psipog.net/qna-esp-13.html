                  <p>Recently Ive been noticing that my "visual thinking" has been getting more accurate. For example, Ill think about what Im going to be doing in a few days and when I think about it, I see myself doing something or something is happening around me...and when that day comes that I was thinking about
                  it usually happens, kind of like deja vu. This doesnt happen every time, but its becoming more common. I havent really done anything, so is this just me getting better at my visualization, am I experiencing anything other than that, or am I just tricking myself into seeing what I wanted to see?</p>

                  <p>Hard to say whats going on... could be a lot of things. Keep trying it out, and take notes on what you see. Sometimes when people rely on their memory, they remember things how they want to - so it's a good idea to write down what you see BEFORE it happens, and then compare it honestly with what
                  REALLY happened. If something legitimately weird is going on, then cool <img src="smile.gif"

                  well i have always been interested in pk, but lately i think i have developed empathy. my head sorta starts to throb around large groups of people. especially during a funeral or in a stadium. i think i have also rojected my own emotion into others. i know that i should create a sheild, but what kind
                  of sheild should i use?</p>

                  <p>I have been practice with psi-balls for about 2 days, and I am just starting to get some form of off-again, on-again feelings...I was trying to form one near a deck of cards during a game. Another person asked me later to stop, as they were feeling a "tingling" sensation "on the brain" whenever I
                  was practicing making psi-balls near the deck of cards in the center of the table. Any ideas? Anyone ever heard of this? How would I making a psi-ball, with not knowing I was trying to make it, from a person with limited experience and all the while being a little distracted...how could someone feel

                  <p>I'm new with trying out empathy. In fact, my first try was today. However, when I create the link from my heart to the targets' heart (The way Peebrain demonstrates), I get a sinking feeling in my stomach and heart, almost like being nauseous without having to throw up. It did this for every
                  target I practiced on. Is this an emotion that I don't understand yet, or is it just me feeling a construct in my gut? Thanks in advance.</p>

                  <p>If the problem is purely psionic, then shields are your answer. If shields aren't solving the problem, then make sure you have correctly identified the problem. Inspect yourself, and make sure YOU are ok. If it's affecting your relationships, that makes me feel like something else might be going
                  on instead of psionics. Maybe part of you is stressed out? I don't know - look at yourself and be honest.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hi! I really enjoy your page. As a young kid I really was interested in this world of psi and I read a lot of books on the Aura and dowsing. I found that I quickly became overflowed with too much info from the intuition and shut out the feelings for a few years. I am now ready to accept my gifts.
                  My problem is though that when ever I am in public places I often can feel or even more I hear what other people are thinking about me. At first I thought I was going crazy but now I understand. I am really working hard to construct sheilds and such but I still feel so much. I have experimented with
                  amulets and saying prayers but to no real help. In time will I be able to control this? Also how is it possible that one can hear thoughts? Thank you......Ryan</p>

                  <p>I've read all the articles towards Telephaty more than a dozen times, and I've read all articles related to it also but, everytime I try to use telephaty it just doesn't work. Someimes it would seem as if it would but it just doesn't. Same for Emphaty. I've tried everything. Maybe it's me. I do
                  believe in one being able to do so, but up to now no good results for me. Is there anybody who thinks can help me with this. I would indeed be glad and thankful for this.</p>

                  <p>Well... you can't just try one method out and see if it works, and if it doesn't conclude that you can't do telepathy. You have to practice over and over again. Think of it like any other skill - you wouldn't expect someone to learn to play the piano after reading a lot of articles on the subject.
                  You gotta get your hands on the keys and mess around. Practice more.</p>

                  <p>When I try and 'read' my friend, when practising the fruit game for example, I feel a tingling in my upper right part of my brain (the same feeling as psi feels) so I assumed it was the psi moving out of my head. When my friend recieves he feels the same thing,in the same place, but he feels
                  pressure when manipulating and gets a short headache that lasts the length of the reading. Is this also the psi moving into his head, or is this a reason to stop? Thanks</p>

                  <p>I feel a slight pressure/tingle as well. As long as it isn't painful, then I wouldn't worry. I believe it is related to psi because it happens when I "open up", and move psi around. I don't know specifically what it is though. If you feel it, then it sounds like you're on the right track.</p>

                  <p>I am a young teenager interested in developing telepathy. No problem just read the tutorials, right? Not exactly. See, I am bipolar in the first tutorial it says don't attempt telepathy if you have my condition. Is there still a way I can learn it? Thanks for all your help.<br />
                  Also, I think my condition lets me feel other people's emotions (more strongly). I often can tell exactly what they are feeling and I take on their emotion as my own. Is that just me being weird? Thanks again.<br />
