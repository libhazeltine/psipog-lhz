                  <p>I was looking at the media section and saw the videos of the psiballs being seen and picked up on camera. How is this possible? How does a camera pick up energy and display it? Lastly, if I want it to, could a camera see the psiball in different colors, like changing the color in the middle of
                  filming?</p>

                  <p>it has been stated that a persons blood sugar will drop while using psionic skills. Has this been proven by anyone? Also, what type of foods and/or techniques help to regain energy quickly?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>It's pretty easy to demonstrate, if you can get a group of people to take part in an experiment that involves blood tests. A glucometer is not a difficult device to use, and most people are capable of operating a stopwatch. For several days, test the blood sugar levels of the people in the group
                  when they are not doing anything psionic. For each "test" of this kind, test the blood three times, at the same intervals as for the psionic activity test....the latter, test the blood before the psionic activity. Time how long it takes to complete the activity, and re-test the blood at this point.
                  Re-test again, either at that same interval after the second blood test, or some other short period (five minutes, for example). The importance of doing the test with several people, and over a period of time, should be obvious. Ideally, the group should be big enough that some of them aren't doing
                  anything psionic in the second set of tests either. Such tests have been done, by the way.</p>

                  <p>Thank you for expressing that part of the question correctly. <img src="smile.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       border="0"
                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" /> It has been demonstrated that the blood sugar will (usually) drop while someone is using psionic skills. It has _not_ been proven that there is anything specific to _psionics_ responsible for the effect. It could just be the concentration needed. Other strenuous mental
                       and/or physical activities will also affect blood sugar. And, sometimes, the blood sugar spikes, instead of drops. This quirk in the data has several possible explanations, but the actual reason is not yet established, as far as I know.</p>

                  <p>Restoring blood-sugar levels is usually done by means of the time-honoured technique known as "snacking". Orange juice, for example, is digested quickly. So are "hard candies". If it doesn't belong as a major feature in a "low carb diet", it is appropriate for these purposes....for the same reason
                  the low-carb guys don't like them: the body processes them quickly, converting them to glucose etc, for immediate use. If you are diabetic, or afflicted with similar illnesses, you need to be more careful in your choice of snacks for this purpose, of course; but in such cases, you ought to be aware
                  of the remedy for low blood sugar already.</p>

                  <p>After you've corrected the immediate problem of low blood sugar, a heftier snack of a more balanced nature is recommended. A sandwich, for example.</p>

                  <p>Orange juice and similar fruit "snacks" are especially good for dealing with the immediate effects of psionic activity, because potassium levels are also involved.</p>

                  <p>I'm trying to teach myself how to fly. Like Neo and Peter Pan. I know those are movies, but I believe it is possible to do. Do I need to know how to manipulate psi and use tk or do you think it is possible without the use of telekinesis? Thank you for your help.</p>

                  <p>Flying without telekinesis involves mechanical assistance, in other words: either buy a plane ticket or get your pilot's license. The Peter-Pan thing would involve tk, by definition, if indeed it can be done. Big "if" there. If you are determined to do this, I would seriously suggest learning to
                  lift things other than your body, but of the same size and weight, before even considering "flying". If/when you try lifting the other object, you'll see why.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>This is the proper place for questions. No worries there.</p>

                  <p>There is some evidence that practicing one skill can improve related skills. For example, working on precognition can improve skill in clairvoyance, too (presuming the person to have both abilities, that is). Specialization is fine, if you want to go that route, but it doesn't necessarily make
                  anything easier. Doing several at once doesn't necessarily make anything harder. However, there is considerable variation from one person to the next. Try whatever appeals to you.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I understand that psionic abilities can be dangerous and can possibly hurt and/or kill the person using the ability. When I first found this out, I got a little worried. After all, of course I don't want to kill myself. I was just wondering, is there any way to lessen the chance of hurting
                  yourself when practicing psionics? Do you just have to make sure that you don't overdo it, or is there something else you can do? The reason I wanted to learn how to use psi, is because I want to help people. I don't want that to backfire and end up hurting myself or others.</p>

                  <p>On a completely different topic, I was wondering if you have to have pure intentions if you want to learn strong and advanced psionics. I ask the question, because if the study of psi ever does become 'normal' and 'accepted' and everyone starts to practice it, someone with malicious intentions
                  could use it to kill many people. Sure, they might be able to learn the basics, but would they be able to make it so strong that they could murder? Hopefully that would never happen, but I was just wondering if it could...</p>

                  <p>1) Main thing is to be careful; watch for symptoms of hypoglycemia when practicing, for example, and avoid doing extended practice-sessions that exhaust your body's resources.</p>

                  <p>2) You do not need to have "pure intentions" to learn "strong and advanced" psionics. The White-Lights-and-Fluffy-Bunnies brigade have been going on about this for years, but it has been demonstrated to be completely false. And yes, malicious people have used it to kill people.</p>
