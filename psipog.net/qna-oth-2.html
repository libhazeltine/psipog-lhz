                  <p>This article is as much of a how-to as I am going to give you. It is, in fact, more detailed than many online how-to articles about psionics. I am not in the habit of phasing inanimate objects together, and therefore am not going to tell you how to do it. I know people who do or did such things,
                  but they do not frequent this site -- No, I am not going to ask them, in order to relay the instructions here.</p>

                  <p>The chances of actually killing yourself using psionics are low. DO NOT TAKE THIS TO MEAN THAT IT CAN NOT HAPPEN. You can kill yourself with psionics, and I know several psions that have been in the hospital because of it. Let's compare this to anotehr question:<br />
                  is it likely that I will kill myself from drinking too much (alcohol poisoning, specifically)? The answer is no, because it is more likely that you will pass out, vomit, or a number of other things that you body does to protect itself BEFORE you die. However, many people die each year.</p>

                  <p>Is it likely that you will kill yourself? no, not if you are careful<br />
                  Is it likely that you will harm yourself? yes, and at that point, STOP.</p>

                  <p>If at any point you begin to feel pain in practicing psionics, stop.</p>

                  <p>Lucid dreams are what they are, to be frank. A lucid dream is defined to be a dream where you realize that you are dreaming. These dreams can lead to a variety of different effects (visualization building, "exercising" mentally, "speaking" to your sub-conscious). All of these may happen in a
                  normal dream, or in a lucid dream, just n a lucid dream you have dramatically more control over what is going on.</p>

                  <p>Hey, I have a question about Phasing. Now people don't really talk about methods of doing it because of apparently how much it hurts and the big risks involved, but people seem to assume that phasing is only with you and an object.<br />
                  If you're practicing phasing, could you not simply phase 2 other items, i.e. make one pen pass through another, and wouldn't it be roughly the same technique? This seems virtually risk-free, and if you screw up you end up with some cool fused pens. I don't see what the big fuss is as long as you're
                  not trying to phase your body?</p>

                  <p>Hey peebs, it's been a year but I'm active again.</p>

                  <p>Just got a quick question. I started doing OBE training and on my first try I put my body to sleep as you described. Then I had trouble trancing out and couldn't make it out, so i snapped out of it. Tried again a few minutes later and my chest started convulsing almost, just almost like a violent
                  breathing and heart rate. it was really weird and I'm wondering if you had any idea why it happened.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Were you scared? When I first started training OBEs, I would hit very strange states of consciousness - and these states would scare me A LOT. So much that my heart would begin to race from the intense fear. If you are having the same problem, I suggest just taking it day by day. If things get
                  scary, then snap out of it. Stand up and walk around. OBE'ing isn't something you do your first try - you have to build up to it.</p>
