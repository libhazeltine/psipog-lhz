                  <p>Hello Y'all, I'm a new member, and a friend got me into psionics. Thus far, it's pretty interesting, not to mention fun :). I do have days where I'm pretty horrible with psionics. Is this normal? Out of curiosity, practice does make perfect (or at least increase the psionic skills that one has?)
                  Anyhow, the point of this question, I was wondering if psionics downtime (days which one is unable to perform psionics) has anything to do with diet? If so, what's a recommended diet for enhancing psionics?</p>

                  <p>Some days are better than others, and some days NOTHING works. Yep, that's normal. Practice does indeed increase psionic skills, as long as the exercise is effective. Diet could play a role, but I'm not sure about specific details. I've heard orange juice and chocolate help. I prefer water,
                  although I was drinking about a gallon of OJ a day when I was heavily training about a year ago.</p>

                  <p>Hi Pebrain,<br />
                  1. Translation: you don't mention Italian, if interested, I could translate some articles, esp. those on telepathy, into Italian. Pls. let me know.<br />
                  2. Would it be possible to include dates of posting/writing of the articles within the articles themselves?<br />
                  3. I wanted to reread your two articles on the subsconscious, but haven't been able to find them - have they been taken off?<br />
                  4. Thanks to all ariters; articles are fab.<br />

                  <p>1. Italian is welcome. The only problem is that I have a million things to do, and working on getting the translations online is one of the things on the bottom of the list.</p>

                  <p>2. Yeah, that's possible, and I've thought about it. The only problem is that some of the earlier articles won't have the correct date on them because I didn't save the date they were originally posted. The new ones have the correct date. I'll think about it.</p>

                  I "do" the dream in real life and remember the dream I had vividly...this happens quite alot, I tell people this but they don't identify with me. Is this a psi skill, or am I going crazy, and if it is a skill which one is it?</p>

                  <p>Look into "precognition". Try to keep a record of your dreams on paper, so you can truly verify the experiences. Then you can show other people too. Comparing an experience to what you wrote down a week ago is better than relying on memory. Memory really isn't that great <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>Hello, greetings, Bon'joure, you get the picture:)<br />
                  Anyway I don't know what this question would fall under so here we go.</p>

                  <p>Is it possible for us to use psi energy to shrink objects and me? Meaning the physical body to the size of an ant? And would we be able to return to our original size? Could it be possible? Is it possible? Would it be considered Bio-PK or idioitic? I was just curious to see the world from a small
                  bugs point of view, it would be cool. One word for the public...Don't be squished;)<br />
                  Please answer my question, Im begging you</p>

                  <p>I gotta say that is a pretty creative question <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Is it possible? I don't think so. I am not an authority on what is possible and what is impossible though. I have never heard of anyone doing anything like this, and I don't even know how you would go about practicing it. So I vote "impossible".</p>

                  <p>But if you want to see the world from a small bugs perspective, there are more easier ways than trying to shrink your body down. The easiest way would be to close your eyes and pretend. If you want a more realistic view, try Lucid Dreaming. Lucid Dreaming is being aware you're dreaming, while
                  still inside of the dream. You can take control of your dream and do anything you want. That would be a more safer and less permanent way than shrinking your physical body down <img src="blah.gif"

                       class="smileyImg" />. If you want to make it even more realistic, look into Out of Body Experiences. Those take a lot more practice though.</p>

                  <p>In Peebrain's article on "communicating with your subconscience", he says we should try and translate our emotions into words and write them down as well, I haven't the faintest idea where to start, I was wondering if he could translate an emotion into words for us, to give us a sort of guide?

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Sure. Let me think for a second...</p>

                  <p>Ok... look at a common emotion: happy. Do you feel happy? Well, chances are if you feel happy one day, and if you feel happy another day, they aren't the same exact emotion. "Happy" is a very broad term used for a group of emotions. When I've gone on dates, I feel happy that I'm meeting someone
                  new. But the emotion is more like "This is exciting; I am excited by the fact that it's possible this new relationship could turn into something I've never experienced before. I am nervous. I am nervous because it's possible that the girl won't like me. I am happy to have this opportunity, and I am
                  calmed by the fact that if she doesn't like me, then that's ok too."</p>

                  <p>On the other hand, I have felt happy when I learned a song on my guitar. "This is exciting; My fingers can move quick enough to keep up with this song, and since I practiced hard it sounds like the original song. I am excited by the fact that I have put in a lot of effort into something and I have
                  accomplished my goal. I am proud, and I feel egotistical, because I sound good, and I want to show others how good I sound. I have practiced harder than my friend, and I can play better than he can. I am looking forward to a time in the future when I can play this song with all my friends, and we can
                  all sing along, because this song is really popular, and cool sounding."</p>

                  <p>Both of those paragraphs can be squashed into "I feel happy". But they can also be expanded quite a bit. I feel happy I am on a date. I feel happy I just learned a song. But really, that "happy" feeling is a sum of a lot of smaller and different feelings. Pull them apart, and disect them.</p>

                  <p>This is just a small example. Some emotions are pages in length when trying to translate them.</p>

                  <p>Yes, there are people who consider themselves to be wizards. There are even people whom other people consider to be wizards.</p>

                  <p>Yes, it is possible to say words, and yes, it is possible to make fire and stuff. The two are not necessarily connected.</p>

                  <p>If you make fire with "wizardry" it is still technically psionics, because it causes an observable, measurable effect in the real world. The difference between magic (other than the stage trickery stuff) and regular psionics is that most magic-users like to use props and bad poetry. If that is
                  your thing, fill your boots. It won't be any easier, though, no.</p>
