                  <p>I know that this question is probably common, but I searched and couldn't find it anywhere else, so I'm asking. How do I know if I've made a psiball? I know how to make one, in theory, but when I try to make one, I never know if anything I feel is real, or if it's just my subconcious (or
                  something) playing tricks on me. (I read somewhere that the feeling of making a psiball may be created by your subconcious, even though you may not have actually MADE a psiball.)</p>

                  <p>Good question. The only relatively reliable way is to have a third party (ie, somebody else) feel or see the construct, without knowing what to expect. Otherwise, the possibility of self-delusion is present.</p>

                  <p>Yeah I know that flaring means to make is visible but when he asks for two layers,I dont get what it means. Like when he said, make the two layers of psi balls feel the same look the same then spin? what does he mean,like picture the one your making in your head and the one you are making?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>The idea is that you have two parts of the construct. The first part is the actual physical construct in your hands. The second part is just your mental interpretation of the construct. It's not physical, it's just how you perceive the construct. Like thinking "this is the construct that is in my
                  hands" with a picture of the construct in your head. What Evan is telling you to do is link the image in your head with the actual construct. So, if your construct becomes oblong, the image in your head becomes oblong with it. Not after, not before, but it follows right along with it, almost like a
                  mirror reflection of it. Then he wants you to start spinning it, followed by his personal visualization of it. Does that help?<br /></p>
