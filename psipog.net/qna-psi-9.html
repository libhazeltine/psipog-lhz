                  <p>Precognitive dreams appear to be fairly common. Concerning your friend, what does he want you to do, if anything? As for your own precog, what do _you_ want to do, if anything? I'd recommend keeping a record of the content of the dreams, dated, and check periodically to see if they are as accurate
                  as they seem to be, and to see if there are any clues that would tell which ones _are_ precognitive.</p>

                  <p>Hey!</p>

                  <p>I was thinking, and i was digging out some theory i came up with recently on how it all works. And i think there is a connection between the energy, and the Subconscious.<br />
                  I think the Subconscious is directly connected to the energy, thereby able to manipulate it (energy) easily.<br />
                  Also a reason for beliefs, and feelings to be getting in the way of Psionics, due to them existing in the subconscious.</p>

                  <p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

                  <p>Seems logical to me. I don't quite understand how the subconscious would be "directly connected" to the energy though. Maybe there is more than one "thing" between you and energy? Maybe it's conscious-&gt;subconscoius-&gt;something else-&gt;energy? Or maybe:
                  conscious-&gt;something-&gt;subconscious-&gt;energy? Or maybe something completely different altogether?</p>

                  <p>Is Psi affected by gravity? It seems that it must be because it is referred to psi-balls having been "rolled" in some of the articles...but being able to make it stay in the air or something makes it confusing. So, is it affected by gravity?</p>

                  <p>I would assume that it is affected by gravity. I've had "heavy" contructs that rolled around, and "heavy" shields that I could actually feel weighing me down.

                  <p>Ah Rainsong, thank you for replying but I think I didn't get the message across I wanted to convey.</p>

                  <p>If you want to see the psiwheel move hard enough, you WILL see it move.</p>

                  <p>The thing is, you could only be tricking yourself into *thinking* that it moves, rather than it actually, phsyically moving.</p>

                  <p>I have to admit I haven't reached a definate conclusion myself on whether psi exists. But one arguement I have heard for it, is that "if psi dosen't exist, why are there thousands of sites and communities on the internet dedicated to it?"</p>

                  <p>The answer (could be) is that everyone on such sites only *imagines* that they are psychic, a type of unconcious doublethink.</p>

                  <p>Obviously, when I finally move the psiwheel I want to *really* move it, rather than just imagining I do (or as you said, have it move from other stimulus).</p>

                  <p>I await your reply on this difficult matter.:)</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Dear Psipog,</p>

                  <p>I want to start off by saying that I am not an open critic of psionics or psychokinesis. I have reserved my judgement for the past two years of my exploring it, because like many scientists I have neither enough evidence to prove or disprove it.<br />
                  I can't say whether you really move pencils or not.<br />
                  Perhaps you do, perhaps you don't.</p>

                  <p>My question is that, how do YOU know you move the pencil?<br />
                  As you would probably know, the human mind has an infinite capacity for deceiving itself. I have had many 'successes' with psychokinesis that, on closer investigation turned out to be false.</p>

                  <p>This did not discourage me or encourage me, but I keep trying. But if I was to move something by no other visible method, how did I know that I actually moved it?</p>

                  <p>A hard question with no obvious answer, but if you can think of one I would love to hear your reply.</p>

                  <p>Excellent question. With some targets of psychokinetic activity, there is varying degrees of probability that the intended effect could result from some other factor at that time. The psiwheel is a notorious example: heat from the hands, and assorted small breezes can move it. A pencil moving
                  around the table, in a roughly circular path, is less likely but still possible (combination of an odd warp in the table top and a lot of heavy trucks or a train passing nearby, perhaps?) Some other experimental targets (such as repeatedly stopping a radiometer without interfering with the light
                  source) are much more difficult to find an alternative cause for. Likewise, causing wave patterns in cloud chambers. If there is no known way to make an effect happen other than PK, as in the cases of the radiometer and the cloud chamber, then the result may be ascribed tentatively to PK, until such
                  a time in the future when some other mechanism might be discovered to cause those specific effects.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Basicaly I was searching for info about Psi and came across this link</p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.thepsionguild.net/Psigen.html"
                     target="_blank">http://www.thepsionguild.net/Psigen.html</a></p>

                  <p>I was just wondering about the section on "Specialty Psis",because my eyes look very similar to the picture they have there about "Generators". For the most part though, I don't have many of the "Generator" characteristics, but I do have alot of the "Specialty" and "Non" characteristics.</p>

                  <p>However, I have noticed that soon after learning about Psi I have started haveing some experiences that made me think that I was projecting psi without intent (I thought this before I ever heard of the above site).<br />
                  A few of the experiences are as follows:</p>

                  <p>Effecting the reception of a TV by being in the room (it sometimes go's all statticy and loud based on my placement in the room and closeness to the TV)</p>

                  <p>Also whenever I set a psi wheel up, it spins uncontrolably.<br />
                  NOT fast, it slowly moves about without my wanting it to. This increases as I get near it.(and I have tried putting it in glass to keep "wind" off of it)</p>

                  <p>(I realize that these characteristics could be for any psi user and don't nessesarily meen I am a Generator)</p>

                  <p>Anyway, I just thought that maybe I am (even thought I don't fit it like a glove) a Generator because I feel as though I am always putting out psi without a desire to. But maybe I'm just a non...</p>

                  <p>But my question is what do you think? AM I a Generator?</p>

                  <p>If you think this is all bunk, or has some truth to it, or is in fact very true, please answer my question acordingly.</p>

                  <p>The observations commented upon in that paper are still very preliminary. It has been noticed that rather a lot of people fit the secondary descriptions, especially for the "Generator" category. The only real way to tell for sure is to have your "tone" read, apparently, regardless of secondary
                  characteristics. (And don't bother PMing me to ask for such a reading. I cannot read "birthswitches".)</p>

                  <p>There are studies currently going on, looking into specifics of this. These two are pretty easy to check, glucose being the easier of the two. Quick blood test devices for blood glucose are made for use by diabetics. Such devices are handy for checking fluctuations in experiemental conditions,
