PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #5, for November 9th, 2004

"Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your
own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes."
- Carl Gustav Jung


Dear PsiPog Users,

Howdy howdy howdy :-). Here we are with the 5th installment of
our bi-monthly newsletter. Welcome to all the new people who
joined. I hope these are at least a LITTLE useful :-P.

Just a reminder - send all your comments, questions, ideas, etc
to: newsletter@psipog.net . I have a hard time coming up with
topics all the time, so it's cool to read what others have to
say.

Let's check the new mail. Zero Ena writes:

"Could you put something in there about how to do macro PK?
Cause I wanna try that to show off to the people at my school
that dont believe in psychics."

Alright - sounds like a good topic :-).

=================================================================

Macro-PK is moving stuff around with your mind. It's a really
cool skill to see in action. It's even cooler when YOU are the
one doing it :-P.

I do have some bad news though. Macro-PK requires practice. In
most cases, it requires a LOT of practice. Which translates to
a LOT of dedication, and motivation.

Try to designate a certain time every day to practice. When I
trained PK, I had an hour break between classes. I would find a
quiet place in the library, and practice until it was time for my
next class. If you just practice at random times every day,
chances are you will lose your motivation after a while. If you
have a SPECIFIC time, and you have nothing else to do during that
time, you can focus much better, and stay motivated.

The most common exercise for Macro-PK is the psiwheel. But the
psiwheel is boring, so let's try to think of something else.
There really is no rule here - just think of something light with
very little friction, that you can move. For example, you can
try:

1. Toothpick floating in water
2. Ball of lint
3. Hair
4. Styrofoam
5. String hanging from something
6. Pen balanced on the edge of a table
7. Coin on its side

You don't have to practice one specific thing, just use your head
for two seconds and look around to see what's available.

Ok, so you've got the object you want to move, and you have some
free time to try it out. HOW do you actually go about moving it?

=================================================================

There isn't one way to do PK written in stone or anything. It's
all very open ended. The people on PsiPog who write exercises
for PK are just like everyone else. They tried a bunch of stuff
and found a few things that worked better than others.

Get in your quiet area, make sure you won't be distracted. Start
to relax a little. Breathe a little slower than normal, but keep
it even, and comfortable. Slow down your brain, and just try to
chill out.

This is gonna sound a little weird... but try to develop a
relationship with the object you're trying to move. Don't go
psycho or anything, but mentally "reach out" and try to under-
stand the object. Maybe take the object in your hands and
inspect every little section. You're trying to connect with the
object. Set the object down, and try to picture in your head
that you're zooming up really close to the object. Closer than
you can get just from looking at it. If you notice a very small
crack, try to picture yourself zooming into the small crack so
much, that it seems like a huge valley.

You want to understand the object. You want to feel like the
object is a part of you. For example, if you're trying to move a
toothpick... don't think of it as "just another toothpick". This
is YOUR toothpick. What imperfections does it have?

It's hard to describe, but just keep "reaching out" with your
mind. After a while, you will feel a stronger connection to the
object. It WILL feel like another part of you. At that point,
it'll probably feel like you could move it if you wanted to. So,
move it. Don't throw yourself into a burning rage. Stay
relaxed, keep feeling one with the object, and try to will it to
move.

=================================================================

For more information and tips, be sure to check out the articles
on PsiPog.net. I can only go into so much depth in the
newsletter. The section on Macro-PK is located at:
http://psipog.net/articles.php?cat=301

=================================================================

Alright! This topic was much more fun and interesting than our
last one. If anyone has had success with Macro-PK, and you have
some tips, please send them in to newsletter@psipog.net . I'll
post them in the next newsletter.

Oh yeah, before I forget - PsiPog.net has a bunch of updates.
We added three new articles, and we're developing a new design
for the entire website. To check out the new look, click:
http://www.psipog.net/px

And the new articles are in the articles section - just check
the "Recent Articles" thing (scroll down :-P).

Have a great tuesday :-).
