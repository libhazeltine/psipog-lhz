         <p><strong>(I must say most everything here is based on my understanding of psychology and science, and while the concepts I will use here are proven, it makes no validation towards my claims, and therefore you must make the decision to accept or deny them.)</strong></p>

         <p>When you think about that statement and the fact that our brains are nothing but constant electrical reactions, you begin to understand why common problems arise in people such as in the following quote "We humans live in a thick, invisible smog of EM field pollution produced by radio and television
         transmitters, computers, telecommunication towers, and power lines." (Fitzgerald) . In the following quote another example is shown of an overlooked quality of today's society that might help us better understand what exactly is going on in the interaction of day to day living, "We have essentially
         electronically wired the nervous systems of our entire species with television, radio, and the Interenet into an endless feedback loop that can almost instantaneously focus the attention of humanity. From the collective focus might come alterations in the sub-atomic realm, such as mind over matter, or merely
         hallucinations" (Fitzgerald). With this global connection and constant barrage of unneeded influences, it is no wonder we begin to find ways to express them or merely find out what they are, which commonly results in paranormal happenings. "During hauntings and poltergeist phenomena, British researchers have
         used magnetometers that recorded power surges and sharply fluctuating magnetic fields within the room where these events are reported" (Fitzgerald). This shows the ability to measure certain paranormal activity, but before you start measuring the activity you must first know what kind you are dealing
         with.</p>

         <p>There are two basic types of paranormal activities: Hauntings and Poltergeist. "The difference is that apparitions are "live" and hauntings are recordings" (Auerbach). Apparitions are not going to be covered here much because they deal with more complex matters of the mind than just EM." Interesting
         enough, many apparitions sighted are of living people. Those can be in stress, dream state visiting familiar places or even having an OBE(out-of-body experience)" (Auerbach). As you see, they deal with the human mind rather than natural EM fields, and stretch beyond the scope of this paper, but that still
         leaves one last type of activity. "Poltergeist activity involves physical effects that can be witnessed by anyone looking in the right direction and can be videotaped, photographed, and otherwise recorded)" (Auerbach). This includes sliding chairs, events of telekinesis, temperature changes, and many others.
         Once you have established the difference in the types of paranormal activities it is time to figure out a little more about them and what makes each of them really tick.</p>

         <p>"In hauntings people report seeing a presence typically engaged in some sort of activity." This is as basic as it can get, your average ghost appearing doing its business, then disappearing, leaving no adverse affects. "The events and figures witnessed in hauntings tend to be repetitive both in what
         experienced and time occurred" (Auerbach). This too, can be an average quality of hauntings, and speaks for itself, hence the name "Haunting".The last one, "Speaking with "ghost" tends to do no good because they just go about their business as if you're not even there" (Auerbach). says a lot about what
         hauntings are. Would one speak to a movie in which they know the ending?(Of course they would.) But all jokes aside, what factor limits a haunting from responding? Maybe that it is just EM residue from past events and through natural properties of EMF's still radiates in the area.</p>

         <p>"What does appear to be stuck is some kind of environmental recording of events and people. The house or building or land somehow records its history, with the more emotion-laden events and experiences coming through 'louder' and 'stronger'" (Auerbach). This excerpt better expresses the idea of how EM
         fields can radiate events of the past far into the future. " One ability proffered by many psychics over the ages is psychometry: the ability to "read" the history of an object by holding or touching it. Objects, we're told, "record" their entire history, and some can decipher that with psi. And what is a
         house if not a big object?" (Auerbach). All this is made possible because when two EM fields come in contact with one another, the tend to tune the other one to their vibrations, therefore leaving behind traces or just a little residue from each person. When a sensitive enough person touches said object they
         are able to tune to the vibrational levels left behind of the person on the object and receive info of that person. "When I say that the apparition is "seen" or "heard", I don't mean that this is happening through the eyes or ears. First of all, remember that our actual perception of the world us involves a
         process whereby data is received by the senses, then screened and enhanced by the brain and mind. Perception resides not in the senses, but in the brain" (Auerbach). describes the way receive the information via EM link from the house. Further evidence of EM having hallucinogen-like side-effects are in the
         following "British scientist have accumulated evidence that these hot spots, or rogue electromagnetic fields can induce some EM sensitive people to hallucinate the appearance of angels, aliens, ghosts, and a range of other visionary perceptions. Such electrically driven visions and mystical experiences might
         be the direct result of electrical currents in the body being translated into images in the visual cortex of the brain." One would also debate, that everyone sees different things such as in "Besides the fact that when an apparition is present, not everyone experiences the entity, there can be a variety of
         experience that indicates as subjectivity on the part of the witnesses. Some might "see" the ghost, some "hear" his/her voice, some "feel" a presence or that they're being touche, and some "smell" his/her cologne or perfume." and say this falsifies the subject matter, but it only furthers the actual reality
         of it all. All of our minds are different, therefore we all think and perceive things differently, some more social, some more visual, so if bombarded with unneeded electrical currents we would each have our own way of dealing with them.</p>

         <p>The second type of Paranormal activity is obviously the only one left, Poltergeist. "Poltergeist while it literally means "noisy ghost," has come to represent a different model altogether from a parapsychological perspective. In poltergeist cases, physical effects are the central theme. These effects can
         run from movements and levitations and appearances/disappearances of objects to unusual behavior of electrical appliances, from unexplained knockings and other sounds to temperature changes, with all combinations possible as well" (Auerbach). Most commonly an effect happens separately, rather than a
         combination of them together, and it is not as reliant as a haunting. You could wait for days and not see a Poltergeist happening. " The poltergeist model is that of a situation caused by the subconscious mind of a living agent, generally someone in the household undergoing emotional and/or psychological
         stress. The agents are people who typically have no method of dealing with the stress on any normal level, so the subconscious takes advantage of the psychokinetic ability we all have to blow off steam" (Auerbach) It is also possible that a "haunting" can trigger that unknown agent in someone to produce
         psychokinetic effects, spawning the illusion of possession. " Poltergeist cases have, on rare occasion, also provided visual apparitions, though these are generally distorted, archetypal or even monstrous. In other words, you don't get a basic human ghost, but some other projection of stress, guilt, anger,
         fear, or frustration from the subconscious - a projection is telepathically sent out to others in the household" (Auerbach). This projection is real in a sense of your brain integrates it into the surroundings even though it is not really there, basically it is a hallucination.</p>

         <p>Even though we know that hauntings and our brains may be at work here, what else is playing a role, and bridging the gap between our stressful minds and the access to the objects? Some believe they have found the key in the Hutchison effect. "The Hutchison Effect occurs as the result of radio wave
         interferences in a zone of spatial volume encompassed by high voltage sources, usually a Van de Graff generator, and two or more Tesla coils" (The Hutchison Effect). This would be similar to a rare but natural occurring hotspot in the Earth's environment. "A Tesla coil actually has two coils, a primary one
         and a secondary one, The primary coil is charged to generate just the right magnetic field so that the secondary coil resonates. The primary coil has a low voltage but a high current, and the resonating secondary coil has a low current but a high voltage. In an electrical grid, a high voltage is necessary for
         the long distance transmission of electricity" ("Tower of Power"). As seen, it works much in the same as our brains broadcast brain waves in this world full of EM radiation we live in. "The radio wave interferences involved in producing these effects are produced from as many as four and five different radio
         sources, all operating at low power. However, the zone in which the interferences take place is stressed by hundreds of kilowatts" ("The Hutchison Effect") is an excerpt could represent a human's brainwaves radiating along with EM radiations given off in a hotspot to produce magnified
         Poltergeist(psychokinetic) effects. Now that the Hutchison Effect works, what does it do?</p>

         <p>Once in action, it was noted that the Hutchison Effect created effects very similar to Paranormal activity, mainly Poltergeist. "The spontaneous fracturing of metals, as occurs with the H-effect, is unique for two reasons: (1) there is no evidence of an "external force" causing the fracturing, and (2) the
         method by the metal separates involves a sliding motion in a sideways direction, horizontally. The metal simply comes apart" (The Hutchison Effect). This is an extraordinary example of Poltergeist activity for the following reasons: 1. There is no evidence of force(just like in Poltergeist activity), and
         2.The metal slide in a movement common to that of Poltergeist activity. "Some temporary changes in the crystalline structure and physical properties of metals are somewhat reminiscent of the "spoon bending" of Uri Geller, except that there is no one near the metal samples when the changes take place. One
         video shows a spoon flapping up and down like a limp rag in a stiff breeze. In the case of permanent changes, a metal bar will be hard one end, like steel, and soft at the other end, like powdered lead." Once again metal deformation with seemingly no apparent mode of force. Also strong evidence is shown in
         the similarity with the following "The device can also induce unusual aurora-like lighting effects in the mid-air. Once when Hutchison was filming in 1981, a sheet of iridescence suddenly descended between the camera and some of the hardware being used. It had a strange pinkish center to it, and after it
         hovered there for a short period it vanished just as suddenly as it had appeared." One last likeness is shown in "It must be mentioned that 99 per cent of the time the objects do nothing at all, and one can wait for days before anything happens, but it is just this erratic unpredictability that one finds when
         investigating poltergeist activity." (The Hutchison Effect) With all this evidence one might start to wonder if Poltergeist is really a product of the mind and those unseen forces that pollutes us throughout our lives with EM radiation.</p>

         <p>"Hauntings actually show that we are all psychic receivers to some degree." (Auerbach) This is true when you view a psychic receiver as some who can untangle the mess of EM signals given to them and form a clear picture about the 'apparition' . "Apparitions are nothing but consciousness - no sensory
         organs, no limbs, etc." (Auerbach). Once again, this is also true, because what is consciousness if not just a system of electric currents. "If there is anything to the electromagnetic theory of the paranormal, we should see heightened levels of evidence over the next decade in the form of increased reports
         of all categories of paranormal phenomena, including UFO sightings."</p>
