                  <p>There are people who shield that don't know about psi balls - but essentially a psi ball is just a chunk of a shield, smushed into a ball form. So, if you can make a shield, you can make a psi ball.</p>

                  <p>Think of it like clay. If you can create a large hollow egg with clay, then you can create a small ball with clay. Some people learn how to shield, but never realize they don't have to JUST SHIELD with the stuff they use.</p>

                  <p>That's pretty normal - we all have trouble focusing on one thing for a long time. Just gotta keep practicing, and 10 minutes will turn to 15 minutes. Then it'll turn to 20 minutes, etc... It just takes time and practice.</p>

                  <p>when I try to make a psiball, I normally do it in the dark. I'v never made a visible one, but I know its there. anyway, I look in between my hands, and when I close my eyes (or sometimes when I dont), it looks like I got my picture took, because I see that flash in my eye. is this a sign of a
                  psiball?</p>

                  <p>This Monday I spent about 20 minutes concentrating on a psy ball and I could see it .It was like a softball-sized flame and I lost control. I sent it at a tree, which caught on fire.<br />
                  I got in trouble for (playing with matches). I need to know how to keep control over my Psy balls or I might burn something bigger. Please help.</p>

                  <p>Honestly, I don't believe you.</p>

                  <p>Nonetheless, if you're having trouble with control, learn to shield. Or just don't spend 20 minutes on a psi ball. Work on a psi ball for 5 minutes, and learn to control it. That way you don't risk burning things down (even though I think you're lying).</p>

                  <p>The Psi-yoyos and other things were meant for _after_ psi-shapes are so well-practiced as to be boring. You are free to try them any time you feel like, but making more complicated constructs before you can do basic construct exercises is a bit like studying Calculus before you've learned
                  Arithmatic.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>My question concerns Internal Shielding and setting constructs. After reading Rainsongs article I was wondering if instead of blocking a "soft" internal shiedl could be used for different purposes.<br />
                  I had an idea of creating a internal bubble to help capture information. Specifically, for the use of learning and reataining information from sources. Thios could be used to help in Memory and Information retention and comprehension.<br />
                  I would be curious as to what other more wxperienced people have to say about this.<br />

                  <p>I usually use my own energy when making a psiball. I only make one because I will get really tired after making it. There was this one time that I wanted to put a little more psi in my psiball and when I was done it was difficult to breathe and I almost collapsed. Does this normally happen if you
                  use your own energy?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>It's uncommon with small constructs, but gets increasingly common with the more strenuous activities. So far, it seems to be the _use_ of the psi-stuff that causes the problem, rather than the production of the stuff, so it _probably_ makes no real difference which kind you are using, as far as
                  this effect is concerned. Don't push yourself too hard. That can kill you.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>hey everyone! im new to this sight, and i think its all very interesting.i already know this is is going to be long, but please, bear with me, im new. but what i'm most interested in is empathy. yea, i know, ur probably thinking, shes in the wrong category, but please, just keep reading.... it
                  will all make sense if u keep reading. ok, the reason why im mostly interested in empathy is, i love helping people out, especially my close friends, or people that are to scared to get close, a fear of getting close to somebody, and it would help me get close to the person by understanding wut
                  he/she feels. now even though right now all i know what to do are Psi Balls, i doubt it will be hard for me to learn empathy, because, very rarely, but, sometimes i can sense what somebody is feeling, but its only once n a while. i just want to strengthen my ability. but the problem is, i dont know
                  how to put a shield up. i know its something like a Psi Ball, but before i try learning anything about empathy, i want to learn how i can put my shield up in public places so i dont get so overwhelmed. i know i have to be strong enough to put a shield up for public places, but i want to learn how to
                  make a shield, and how to make them strong. my main concern is school. i am 15 years old, and i go to a very large high school, and i only want to feel certain people's feelings. right now its summer, and i have about a month before school starts. i want to learn how to put a shield up strong enough
                  for the whole school, except certain people, so i can be prepaired. but how do i do that? how do i put a shield up for the whole school, and take out a few people that i want to connect with? it seems so difficult to me, but, im willing to learn. and hopefully anyone who has had the same experience,
                  or similar, can please reply to me. it will be greatly appreciated.</p>
