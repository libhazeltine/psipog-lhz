                  <p>i do understand the doing telekinesis does take time and practice, but what holds me back is that my parents and big brother say that only psychic or gifted people can do it and not me. i keep telling them that telekinesis IS possible and we can all do it from a theory on the internet, but they
                  still don't believe me. IS telekinesis possible for all people? i want to prove to them that i can do TK, but i still need more info on how to do TK. PLEASE HELP ME! (i'm soory for asking so many questions, but i believe i can do TK and need every single piece of info as possible!) :) Thank
                  you!!!</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Fact is, "a theory on the internet" is most unlikely to convince anyone of anything. This is especially true for an idea that is impossible to prove. There is no evidence to suggest that everyone is capable of learning TK. _However_ there is also no clear indication of who can and cannot learn how
                  to do it.</p>

                  <p>The way to prove to your kinsfolk that you, personally, can do TK is to demonstrate it for them. There are quite a number of essays and "Q&amp;A" bits on this site that pertain to psionics in general, and TK specifically. Perhaps you should consider reading them. _All_ of them.</p>

                  <p>thank you on answering my questions. i appreciate it very much... when i was doing tk last night w/ the psi-wheel, i could've sworn i made it move b/c it was spinning gently in different directions, even though i knew it would take about 2 weeks if i really practiced. is it normal not to see
                  results right away even w/ different methods? this morning i meditated for about 15 minutes and got the psi-wheel to move only a tiny bit, but i think i was breathing on it that made it move. i wonder if the regular 5-10 minutes for 3 sessions a day will show results in about 2 weeks using different
                  methods? thanks once again!</p>

                  <p>Not sure where you are getting this "two week" figure from. Clearly it will take you more than a few minutes, seeing as you've already been at it more than a few minutes. Beyond that, all we can say for sure is that it _probably_ will take less than twenty years, if you are capable of tk at
                  all.</p>

                  2. i swear i made a pen moved when i was bored in class i decided to try and practice some tk and i made it move but only a small bit. am i imagining this or did i actually do tk</p>

                  <p>1) Accumulation of static electricity is not indicative of "electrokinesis". Edited to answer follow up question: No, it still is not indicative of electrokinesis. And yes, I have indeed heard of "bioelectricity".</p>

                  <p>Ok, im new to the site, but I wanted to ask about the psiwheel. I can spin it but I cant control the direction. It always seems to spin in a clockwise direction. My question is that when I want to change its direction, do I visualize it changing direction or mentally tell it to?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Push it in the other direction. Using PK involves exerting force against the object. Whatever you are doing to move it clockwise, push in the other direction. If you need to move your hands or otherwise alter your position to change the wheel's direction, you are faced with the very real
                  possibility that you have been using convection currents or other small air movements to move the psiwheel.</p>

                  <p>Try the "Kinesis" section in "Articles". Read all of them, and all of the "Perception" and "Manipulation" section as well. That combination should give you a reasonable base from which to start.</p>

                  <p>If you go at it sensibly, and pay attention to your body's warning signals, the answer is "anywhere from a few minutes to eighteen years". If you don't go at it sensibly, the upper end of that range is reduced significantly, but the "result" seen is "death" rather than telekinesis.</p>
