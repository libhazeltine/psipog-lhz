                  <p>Heh, Heh, Umm sorry for so much trouble, but I was wondering. You guys always tell precogs to keep a record of their dreams, but my precog it weird, most of the times I don't realized my dreams until the actual event happens and I sort of get a "flashback" so what am I to do about that?</p>

                  <p>Hi!</p>

                  <p>Concerning all the warnings you give about learning empathy and telepathy and never going to lose that ability: ActivePsy contains information about "shutdown" which should "deactivate" all active psi abilites on you.</p>

                  <p>Does "shutting down" not work with telepathy? Or is there another reason why ActivePsy and PsiPog seem to disagree?<br />
                  Thanks in advance!</p>

                  <p>Excellent question. You will find that there are descrepencies between the trial-and-error methods of different people, simply because of their differences of experience.</p>

                  <p>"Shutting down" can be done, in most circumstances, by many people. However, not all telepaths (including empaths) have that option.</p>

                  <p>Do most empaths try to learn bio-pk, or is it something that they can do or what? Cause it's like empathy is like a nose, people are almost good food, and a stomach is bio-pk. It seems useless to know if someone is hurt or if something smells good unless you can eat it or help them,... Right?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Heh... what an odd analogy...</p>

                  <p>Let's define some things so we're clear:<br />
                  Empathy - In the psioinc sense, it means to feel someone elses emotions psychically.<br />
                  Bio-PK - Influencing a biological system through psychokinesis.</p>

                  <p>What is empathy used for? Usually sensing what another is feeling. What is Bio-PK used for? Usually altering a physical trait of the body. Like blood pressure, or eye-sight.</p>

                  <p>Empathy is not only used to know if someone is hurt, it is used for other things as well. If the emapth finds an emotionally hurt individual, the empath sometimes doesn't want to help the person who is hurt. If the empath does want to help an emotionally hurt person, the easiest way would probably
                  be to talk to the hurt person. Just interact with them, and talk things out. Bio-PK is more of a "I would like to change a feature of my body". Not really a "I would like to alter the emotions of someone else". Even then, if you find out that someone is in emotional pain, chemically altering their
                  body to make the pain go away (which is what I would assume you're talking about, referring to Bio-PK) is only temporary. You can project "happy emotions" at a hurt person, and that can help them, but that's temporary as well. The best way to help, in my opinion, is to talk to the person about what
                  is bothering them. If it is serious, get a psychologist. Get to the root of the problem, don't just try to force it to go away.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Dear Psipog,</p>

                  <p>I have been trying to do telepathy for a considerable amount of time, and I have had not had any conclusive results. I think I might have read this somewhere on one of the old forums, but I've forgotten now, so:-</p>

                  <p>1. Is it possible that I might have some sort of shield up that I don't know about stopping me from succeeding? (Neither myself nor any of my psionic friends have been able to sense anything.)</p>

                  <p>2. Might it be a problem separating other people's thoughts from my own? I frequently say and think things that other people say, often at the same time, but I don't perceive them as anything but my own thoughts.</p>

                  <p>If you think it could be one of the above, please could you give me some advice on getting round it?</p>
