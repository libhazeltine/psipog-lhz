                  <p>Alright now, I've only been doing TK for 4 days (I'm not impatient) and I was just wondering how long it took you before you could whip out a psi wheel and spin it right off the start.</p>

                  <p>Another thing, I was practicin' (which I do a lot because this is sooooo freakin' sweet (thank y'all psipog)) and on my 2nd day right before I went to sleep, I was on a roll and I spun the psiwheel for over a minute without stopping. Only when I got decided to quit did the wheel stop. It seemed
                  that the less I focused (maybe my concious was out of action because I was tired) the better I could spin the wheel. I haven't reproduced those results to any degree. The most I get is 360 degrees in one motion, not a full minute++ of turning. Anyway, I was just wonderin' if you are better when you
                  are tired.</p>

                  <p>Thanks so much (I've always wanted to do this)</p>

                  <p>You see, you didn't lose the focus, but rather gave the "steering wheel" to your subc. That's exactly the right state of mind. It's like "day dreaming". And when you are tired you happen to "let go" and your subconscious becomes stronger.<br />
                  Nevertheless if you are NOT tired but still can go into that state of mind, you'll have even better results. I suggest you experiment with it and tell us about the results <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>ok,right now i can move a heavy psi-wheel.it has 3 layers of construction paper,1 layer of looseleaf paper,and a bottom layer of alluminum foil paper.all layers are made of 2" by 2"(i think thats the inches sign) pieces of the material.i could go on to more layers,but its already hard to balance
                  right now.so,i guess my question is,what should i go onto now?</p>

                  <p>I'm not sure if this is in the right category, but it has been said that meditation can help with TK if done regularly. I'm thinking about starting to do this, but there are many forms of meditation, and I'm not sure which one to apply.<br />
                  When you say meditation, do you just mean a no-thought meditation? Sit down, relax yourself and think nothing? Or meditating about being able to do better TK? Or would this be Self-Hypnosis? If there is a difference do you recommend meditation, self-hypnosis, or both?</p>

                  <p>The main reason that meditation is helpful is that it helps you gain control of your own mind, and quiet it down when you want to. Any sort of meditation will be helpful, from traditional zazen to archery. Self-hypnosis is also useful, both for learning to keep your mind in your control,
                  generally, and for a number of nifty effects that are easier in trance. The effects in question range from making pendling easier to stopping pain and the ever-popular "lentation". (For the record, "lentation" is more widely known as "time distortion". If you want to look it up, use the standard
                  term.)</p>

                  <p>"Biokinesis" is a political theory concerning the movement of populations as a basis for power.</p>

                  <p>As a result of the influence of certain role-playing games, the same word has become semi-popular as a slang term for the use of psychokinesis on living systems. This is also known as Biological Psychokinesis, BioPK, and DMILS.</p>

                  <p>How you would practice it would depend heavily on what effect you want to achieve. I would suggest doing some serious reading on the topics of Physiology and Anatomy before even _thinking_ about affecting an organism with PK.</p>

                  <p>Treat TK as you would any other sport. Would you run around and play soccer if you were sick? Probably not... I'd let your subconscious worry about the direct threat, then once that is finished, resume practicing. If you're interested in the effects of practicing while sick, give it a try, but
                  don't push yourself too hard.</p>

                  <p>1) Yes and maybe. Yes, by definition, whatever it is that makes telekinesis work is "psi". "Maybe", it might be pushing sometimes. However it is not always pushing unless you can push in some very odd directions relative to yourself, and it _might_ not ever be.</p>

                  <p>2) Yep.</p>

                  <p>There are not many "practical" uses for telekinesis. To pick those simple bathroom locks was probably the most "practical" thing I've done with it until now. <img src="wink.gif"

                  <p>So, it's kindof useless. The skill is impressive, but still useless. I can think about how tk could be used in brain surgery or space missions, but those concepts sound rather sci-fi at this point.</p>
