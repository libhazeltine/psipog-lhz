                  <p>I'm not sure, it usually hurts me too. I don't know why, I just know that you probably shouldn't do it without knowing what you're doing. A good rule is: if what you're doing hurts, then stop doing it.</p>

                  <p>If you want it to flare, then I suggest programming it to flare. Though some of mine have flared when I didn't program them to... usually if I put in a bunch of energy, then it sparks a little. The programming might have been inserted from my visualizations though.</p>

                  <p>To give you a straight answer: the more practice you have, the easier it is to say "make this one flare" and it does. When you're just starting out, you'll need to work on it, so it'll help it flare, but not force it to flare.</p>

                  <p>That skill is not sufficiently common to have a "typical" answer. The stats are insufficient. I've heard of some people picking it up quickly, as in a month or two, but others have tried for many months without visible results.</p>

                  <p>I think my first flared construct was four or five years after I "started" with psionics, but constructs were not the first thing I did.</p>

                  Do you think it is possible to make a psiball and then programm it to hover in the midddle of 3 people... then each person makes a link to the psiball and then sends colors or shapes to the psiball then the other two recive through the psiball?</p>

                  <p>Try a bunch of things, here are some ideas:<br />
                  1. Don't make the construct on your hands.<br />
                  2. Pinch off the constructs connection point with your other hand.<br />
                  3. Program the construct to not be sticky.<br />
                  4. Visualize a slippery substance (like oil) around your hands before you start making the construct.<br />
                  5. "Wipe" the construct off on a table.</p>

                  <p>In another question, Rain suggested that periodic lowering of a shield for cleaning was a good thing.</p>

                  <p>How would you suggest "dropping" a particularly stubborn shield? Stubborn means attempts at "depatterning" fail; visualized explosions seem to have no effect; visualizing removing it (reversing construction process) fail; etc.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>If the goal is cleaning, and you couldn't drop your shield, then you could just clean your shield while it's up <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>You've listed the most common methods for getting rid of a shield, and if those don't work, you might have to get help from a friend or be a little creative. I suppose getting rid of the shield would be like getting rid of any annoying construct. Attatch it to something else, alter the programming
                  to make it easier to remove, bust out the crystals, take it down little by little, hmmm... what else...</p>

                  <p>It's hard to believe that all those things would fail if you created the shield. If you have the skill to make something that concrete, then you should have the skill to get rid of it. If someone else made it, then get them to remove it. If they are not your friend, then you are stuck in the same
                  boat as everyone who is under psychic attack. Examine the construct, try to find a weakness, try to "confuse"/alter/kill it, etc...</p>

                  <p>Some shields are made specifically for the head... but you have to remember that your nervous system goes through your entire body. Why do people have strokes when they are stressed out emotionally? Because emotion isn't just part of the brain, it is part of the entire body.</p>
