                  <p>Holding fire in your hand is likely to result in a nasty burn, unless you have a very good insulator between your hand and the flame. However, both flames and freezing are possible, with practice. If you can affect the temperature of a substance by a few degrees, continue what you're doing.</p>

                  <p>_If_ they run in your family, then _if_ you happened to inherit that particular trait, then you _might_ be more likely to reach a certain level of skill in them, if you work at it. However, that doesn't make it an advantage. Needing to learn to stop and/or control an ability that presents itself
                  naturally is more of a nuissance than learning something by choice.</p>

                  <p>You have a few options:</p>

                  <p>1) Poke the buttons on the remote control with your mind. The "extend a tendril" approach is convenient for this.</p>

                  <p>2) Mess about with the electronics themselves, by any number of methods, micro or macro.</p>

                  <p>3) Poke the buttons or push the dials on the television itself, if it has such....some do, some don't.</p>

                  <p>The more advanced the device is, the easier it should be to affect. Old-fashioned black-and-white systems need brute force to turn their dials; up-to-this-millenium "tv-on-computer" bits can be messed with by microPK.</p>

                  <p>In an answer to someones question someone said that you could get hypokalemia and/or hypoglycemia.</p>

                  <p>hypokalamia is caused by low levels of potasium in your blood, and hypoglycemia is caused by too much or too little levels of sugar in your blood.</p>

                  <p>Although, i fail to see how practising telekinesis could affect your potasium or sugar levels in any way.</p>

                  <p>"How" and "why" are not established. It _is_ established, by fairly simple clinical means, that it happens. It could be a simple matter of "intense concentration", or it might be something more enigmatic.</p>

                  <p>There are blood tests for potassium and glucose levels. Measuring them before, during, and after telekinetic activity, and before, during, and after other kinds of activities is tedious, and involves a lot of poking with needles, but is not technically complicated.</p>

                  <p>Run enough of these tests with enough people, and it has not been difficult to establish that the activity affects the chemistry. It is rather more difficult to establish exactly what it is _about_ the activity that causes this effect, however.</p>

                  <p>"If you do A, B happens" is a _much_ easier thing to demonstrate than "If you do A, B happens _because_ of C by means of D".</p>

                  <p>And, for the record, "hypokalemia" _is_ low blood potassium, rather than "caused by". Likewise, "hypoglycemia" describes the condition of having low blood glucose levels, as opposed to being caused by same.</p>

                  <p>Hello. Btw I love this site. Anyhow I can perform Telekinesis most of the time, but sometimes there'll be a moment when I just can't do it. Sometimes I can do spin the psi wheel without going into deep concentration. Like 10 minutes ago I could do it fine, and just outta the blue I can't at the
                  moment. Is this normal for it to come and go? I am beginner at this btw.</p>
