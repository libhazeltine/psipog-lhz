               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hello to anyone reading this.</p>

                  <p>I have a problem about my concentration method. I read NotImportants first telekinesis article and practised for some months on the meditation technique where you stare at a candle for 20- 30 minutes, then practicing on a psi-wheel for up to forty minutes. I always get to the point where I can
                  'feel' the object but then a condition I have called Tinitis bothers my concentration to the extent where I can't concentrate anymore. tinitis is where I get a constant ringing in my head which I can't shake off, it comes and goes, but gets worse when there is nothing to distract me. Do you think
                  there is any simple way of getting around it, such as music or soothing noices, or should I work harder to drown it out? I've looked all around for a cure, and have tried different techniques, even spiritual healing, to get rid of it. I might be able to move on in my practice whilst I still have it,
                  if I really tried, but my progress would be a lot slower than it could be. Have any of you had any experience of this yourselves?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Yes, actually, as far as effectiveness goes, at least, hypnosis is useful. Some of the perceptive abilities such as clairvoyance and some forms of telepathy have been noted in hypnotic trance for more than a century. It is very easy to delude oneself with hypnotic suggestion, however, so be very
                  careful to document your results so you can check them later. Otherwise, you might find yourself doing nothing but "pretending", and yet relying on the results.</p>

                  <p>Ok, to start off with, I am asking an opinion question, and thats what I want, an opintion(Just to see what some of the mods think)</p>

                  <p>How do you personaly feel about the relationship between psi/wiccan/chaos magick/ki? I'm speaking mostly about the types/differences in the energy, because I know the techniques and results(If any) are completely different.<br />
                  Ex. Do you beleive the things that drive a wiccan's "spell" are the same that drive a psionic technique?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>"Psi" is whatever mechanism allows such effects as psychokinesis and telepathy to occur, in simple terms. Therefore, if you can make those effects happen using a spell, chaos magick, ki, or your own personal army of imaginary purple dinosaurs, then you are using "psi". If your spell, chaos magick,
                  ki, or personal army of imaginary purple dinosaurs cannot/doesn't produce such effects you are not using "psi".</p>

                  <p>Psi is not specific to any religion, nor is it a religious concept. "Wicca" is therefore not part of the equation at all.</p>

                  <p>It's really up to you. What interests you the most? What do you consider important? If you really really really want to do TK, and don't care how long it takes, then start in on that. If you want something you can do in a few weeks with some basic practice, pick something easier.

                  <p>I've been there... click on a random link on the internet and you're scarred for life. The way I got rid of the image was to gradually turn it into a "cartoon"-ish image, then alter the cartoon-image slowly. I did that by remembering the image, then I would try to "remember" the image again, and I
                  would recall most of it from memory, but then purposely taint the memory and "see" a different image in my head. Do that for a few days, and it should alter the image enough to where it's just junk.</p>
