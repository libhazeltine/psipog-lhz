                  <p>These are in relation to Umbra's question and to both RPing and OBEs...</p>

                  <p>1) When breathing, is it okay to move your chest up and down naturally?</p>

                  <p>2) Is too much twitching bad?</p>

                  <p>3) And if all of these are bad, and random thoughts enter your head at about, 2 every minute, should you just stop?</p>

                  <p>I am practicing extensively and I think these aspects of my training might cause bad habits or are hinderances. Thank you for answering my question.<br />

                  <p>I answered these accoring to my experience in Remote Presence other answers may apply when talking about OBEs.</p>

                  <p>1- When you breathe your chest naturally moves up and down, the only way to stop that is to stop breathing. Don't stop breathing!</p>

                  <p>2- Sometimes when RPing to a new location, or a place with shields I do get the random twitch or tick. If you are twitching a lot, stop practicing for a bit and resume when you've stopped compeletely.</p>

                  <p>3- I have never had random thoughts enter my head when calmly RPing, so that may apply more to the OBE skill.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>3- If random things enter your head every two minutes, just try to gently bring it back to your original state. If you catch yourself thinking about something strange, when you were trying to think of nothing, just being your attention back to nothing. It takes practice... and it can be hard and
                  annoying... but we all do it.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I have 2 questions about OBEs;<br />
                  Question 1: Are there any skills you need to learn before you can OBE?</p>

                  <p>Question 2: I read that sometimes you can't see when you OBE. If that's true, how do you always know that you're having an OBE?</p>

                  <p>Question 3: Me and my friend read PeeBrain's seminar on OBEs, and I have been trying averagly 3-4x a week since before christmas, my friend's started trying 2-3x a week after new-years, but neither of us have had an OBE. We both get the hullucinations, but thats as far as we get. How much longer
                  do you think it will take us to start OBEs?</p>

                  <p>Sorry about the length, and thanks.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1) Not really... Sleep Paralysis sometimes helps. Lucid dreaming helps some people too. Just have to be able to be good at falling asleep <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       border="0"
                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />. It takes practice.</p>

                  <p>2) Yes, that is true. Me personally, I knew I was out of body because it was just like walking around with my eyes closed. I could feel the walls of my room around me, and I would walk blindly out my door based on my memory of the room, and what walls I felt. Other times, I would "open" my eyes,
                  only to realize that I opened my physical eyes. So my entire body would feel like it was in the middle of the room, while my vision stayed in my physical body. Talk about weird experiences <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"

                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />.</p>

                  <p>3) I don't know... it's hard to gauge your process from a small description like that. The attitude you have to take is: no matter how long it takes, you will have an OBE. Make it a part of your life... like showering or doing homework. Just something you do every day or so without question.
                  You'll get it. Read up more on it too, to get your head thinking about it during the day. RobertPeterson.org has an online book that is really cool.</p>

                  While doing any of the above, do you phase out of your clothes, watches, or other things of the sort, or is there something the prevents that?<br />

                  <p>As far as OBEs and RP goes... your body stays in one spot. It's your consciousness that seems to move. So, your body sits there, with all your clothes on, etc... while your consciousness moves around outside.</p>

                  <p>I heard rumors about it being bad for you to OBE while laying on your stomach... I have done it multiple times without any problems. I don't know where these myths come from, or why they pick on the position you body is in. The state of your mind is more important about where your limbs are

                  <p>Keep a written record of every dream you remember, each morning, in a notebook, with the date of each (standard method is to use the date of the night you went to bed, rather than the morning you woke up, but any consistent dating system ought to be fine). Then, when one "happens", go back and

                  <p>In general, it makes no difference. Some people have a preference, one way or the other, and find that their workings are more accurate with one way than the other. The only way you'll know if you are one of these, is to keep records through several hundred pendling attempts, and see which one (if
                  any) works better.</p>

                  <p>It's a gateway to your subconscious. Good for dealing with fears too - Lucid dream something you're afraid of, and gradually overcome it. You can hone skills too while in a dream. Maybe you want to be a better skateboarder? Well, create a halfpipe, and let it rip. You won't break any bones and
