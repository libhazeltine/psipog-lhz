   October 13, 2000

   <p>Used to believe that belief played a big role in telekinesis. Now I think it is false. Belief in TK is important for motivation but no belief is necessary for the skill itself. Just energy control, focus, and concentration. Will-power.</p>
   <hr />

   <p>Purpose:<br />
   Release thought that <tt>telekinesis = move white paper on pin</tt><br />
   To program myself to think <tt>telekinesis = move anything</tt> (specifically, what I focus on...)<br />
   I must break down my biased thought little by little. I came across this thought while trying to move a pen. On my initial attempt nothing happened but after a while the white-paper-on-pin moved. No conscious effort was directed at it, I just focused the same way I always did.<br />
   <br />
   Experiment 1:<br />
   Move something other than white-paper-on-pin<br />
   <br />
   Set-up:<br />
   My white-paper-on-pin AND a purple-paper-on-pin.<br />
   <br />
   Purpose:<br />
   Move the purple paper AND NOT the white paper at the same time.<br />
   <br />
   This experiment should open my mind up a little. After this, I need to learn control over the two then move onto other objects.</p>
   <hr />

   <p>Weird outcomes:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>I focus on the white-paper-on-pin and it moves a little.</li>

      <li>I focus on the purple-paper-on-pin and it moves a little AND the white-paper-on-pin moves A LOT! Were talking 180 degrees in a tenth of a second!</li>
   </ul><b>Why can't I tap into that power when I focus directly on the white-paper-on-pin?</b>

   <p>Front part of my brain hurts - related to TK?<br /></p>

   Right, frontal area. Tingly left ear.
   <hr />

   <p>I can do it, just now it takes a long time to mentally switch focus. I switch, wrong one till moves for a while, then the movement goes to both, then the one I switched to finally starts moving on its own.</p>
   <hr />

   <p>My switching isn't consistent - sometimes it'll work like above but sometimes it doesn't work at all. The answer to correct this is obvious: Practice <img src="smile.gif"

   <hr />

   <p>I can feel it inside of me - I haven't done it in a week or so but once I got the paper out I could feel the energy in me - I could just tell how to move it and it worked first try within one second. How freakin' cool is that?!?! <img src="smile.gif"

   <p>Note: Switched purple paper with yellow paper - purple was creased in other places which bugged me.</p>

   <p>New offspring CD - WHOO HOO! Just wanted to let you know... <img src="smile.gif"

   <hr />

   <p>It's been a little over a week - still no problem though. Of course, I'm kinda disappointed the movements are of the same magnitude. I want to paper to float or fly off the tack! Instead it just rotates a ton. I guess I am improving though - it used to barely move. I just want to improve faster! I know I can -
   it seems like there's a secret and once I hit it - it'll become "clearer" er something. Maybe in Hollywood.... I guess I just need patience.</p>
   <hr />

   <p>Weird results when NOT focusing on the paper. I don't get it and I don't know what it is. I focus on the paper - I can get it to move a decent amount. I look at the table and think about its texture - the paper goes NUTS! What's up with that?!</p>
   <hr />

   <p>The paper... what... responds to thought? The thought drives the paper? Honestly, How Is This Possible? How Does it Work?</p>
   <hr />

   <p>My third eye hurts!<br /></p>

   Took a little while to get it going this time... made me nervous.</p>
   <hr />

   <p>My eyes always feel dry when I do TK. I don't know if it's related or not. Could just be air in here; could be 'cause I just woke up; could be I unknowingly don't blink while doing TK... I don't know - just something I noticed.</p>
   <hr />

   <p>Pain again:<br /></p>

   </center><br />
   Little higher than "normal"...
   <hr />

   <p>Belief does seem to play a little part in this. I think I was wrong earlier. I don't think you need it as much as you need to "want" it though. Still a factor...</p>
   <hr />

   <p>Other objects close to the paper seems to help... my finger, the binder,... I should do more tests. I think it helps focus on the area outside the paper - the space around it. (tried pen - it moved... did pen help?)</p>
   <hr />

   <p>I tend to hold my breath so I don't blow on it... If I inhale big, it'll usually spurt (the paper will move fast). Oxygen to brain gives strength.</p>
   <hr />

   <p><b>HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?!?!</b></p>
   <hr />

   <p>There's a thing that is really help and I've been doing a lot but I haven't written it down yet! What am I waiting for <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile" />? If I will it to move and it doesn't move by thought, I'll move it with my finger. Usually while the paper is moving I can do TK on it a lot easier. I'll play with the paper - THEN try TK. Just spin it around physically a couple times, then focus. If all else fails, this usually works. I think
        it's important too. If I think "this paper will move" - it's gonna move! With or without TK! This way I never really fail in my mind.</p>
   <hr />

   <p>Each session:<br />
   Open TK with focus. (I seem to need my focus here)<br />
   Later:<br />
   Move paper with or <u>WITHOUT</u> focus. (don't NEED it)</p>

   <p>I'll explain...<br />
   Like I can't just whip out the paper and move it. Usually I play with it physically then focus &amp; play, then it starts moving. Usually I continue focusing, but it doesn't seem like I have to. Like I was just watching the paper for 40 seconds - watching it move. No effort on my part, it was just going. After I
   open the TK up, it'll go on it's own. Whether it's my subconscious or something else - I don't know. I do know that I don't need to focus and don't need to try after opening it up.</p>
   <hr />

   <p>My eyes actually started to tear up while I was under intense focus. Related to TK? Maybe I just need to blink more often... <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile" /></p>
   <hr />

   <p>I had a lot of sleep (8 hours - better than normal 4-5!) and it moved with little effort while warming up. I think it's directly related to sleep.</p>
   <hr />

   <p>Three pages back I talked about being disappointed because I wasn't improving fast enough. My improvement seems limited now that I look at it... I can spin the paper more, but not faster. This means my "stamina" is getting better but the actual force used to push the paper isn't getting stronger. i.e., if I was
   a runner, I could run further but not faster. How do I work on strengthening force?</p>
   <hr />

   <p>Just for the hell of it, let's discuss what is needed to perform TK. Physically, you obviously need something to move. To me, it's the paper on the tack. Mentally though... now things aren't so obvious. At first I would say you need focus - but looking back, I didn't need focus to move it [sometimes]. Maybe just
   for the first step of warming up you need focus. Would this work for the beginner though? There are some times when focus hinders my ability - where I just need to relax and let go. Scientifically, your brain probably needs to be operating at a specific wave length/frequency. Maybe the focus brings your brain to
   that frequency? Then it's easier to hold onto it once you have it. This is all from someone who knows almost nothing about the human brain though :-). What I know for sure is what I feel... Like I said earlier, usually I start out with focus on the paper, then after I "open" it up, it moves with little to no
   effort. I keep saying focus over and over - maybe I should define it <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile" />? Focusing on the paper consists of (hmmm... this is hard) mostly a blank mind with the intent of moving the target. When the paper starts to move, usually it bobs up and down, then spins a little. I feel the same before and after it moves - except for some sense of joy that it's working. It's
        hard to give definite things because it's not consistent enough to see detailed patters. Basically, you just will it to move. That's the best way to describe it.</p>
   <hr />

   <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b><br />
   Keep it fun and be happy dammit! <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"

        alt="Smile" /> Seriously, it didn't work until I got in a good mood. Maybe that's why music might seem to help?</p>

   Strange tickle in my throat - probably not related to psi, but ya never know. Coughing a lot! tears...</p>
   <hr />

   <p><b>Static electricity...!</b><br />
   There's a thought [on how TK is possible]<br />
   Energy = electrons<br /></p>
   <hr />

   <p>Strange session:<br />
   Semi-focus from start - it moves right away. No intense focus.</p>
   <hr />

   <p>Visualization of a gust of energy works good - visualize wind.</p>
   <hr />

   <p>3-15-2001<br />
   Haven't written in a while... whoops! <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile" /> I barely need any focus at all anymore. I focus a small fraction of what I used to focus - I notice I have more control over it now too. It usually only moves when I want it to and I can get it to spin in a direction accurately. I knock it off sometimes but my force doesn't seem stronger.</p>
   <hr />

   <p>That's all folks... October to March in a few short entries... man I wish I wrote in it more often <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile" /> - oh well.</p>
