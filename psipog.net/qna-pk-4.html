                  <p>It is certainly possible to move large objects. However, the sheer number of things Carrie did at once, when she lost her cool at the prom, would kill most people who tried that. Gives new meaning to the concept of "over-extending yourself".</p>

                  <p>Hello,<br />
                  First off I just want to say despite my lack of sucess this week, I love this site and I think this is a really positive way to release negative energy. I'm still on the psi-wheel right now, anytime I start my session usually after about 20-45 I start getting a really severe headache, which lasts for
                  a short period of time sometimes at most 2 hours. Should I assume I'm trying to hard and is this a good sign that I'm making progress?<br />
                  I am also very interested in modern shamanism, which I've been putting aside for awhile until I get a better feel for this new skill, but what I'm getting at is that I know exactly what it feels like to "merge" with an object, or see with my eyes closed. Would psychoactives, like say Salvia Divinorum
                  that's used in meditation and is known for allowing people to "become one" with inanimate objects, help progress the process?<br />
                  When visualizing an object, should I be focusing on trying to see the object in my third eye, or should I have my eyes open? I can spontaneously see with my third eye sometimes before I go to bed, but when I consciously put energy into doing it, it becomes very difficult. One last thing, I apologize
                  for all these questions... How do I know if I am making progress when nothing is happening?<br />
                  I really look forward to any response, I know that was a lot of questions, please forgive me, if you want I can repost all these questions individually.<br />
                  I am extremely confident that I can succeed, and I already have it in my head that giving up is not an option. I know can do it!!! Thanks again.<br />
                  Take care,<br />
                  -Matt</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>If you are getting severe headaches as a result of your practices, it means you are trying too hard, yes. This does not give any indication of whether you are making any progress, one way or the other.</p>

                  <p>"Feeling" like you are merging with an object and actually _doing_ it are two completely different experiences. I would not recommend the use of psychoactive drugs for the development of psionic ability, for several reasons. The most obvious is that most psychoactive drugs are illegal in most
                  countries, in some of which possession of such drugs carries a death penalty. Also, with the illegal ones you have no guarantee that what the dealer _says_ you are buying is actually the substance you _are_ buying. I'll presume you are aware of the risks that many of them carry. In any case, there is
                  little-to-no evidence that such drugs assist in any way, and quite a bit of evidence that they interfere. Caffeine is the one that has the most evidence of being useful, and its usefulness is both restricted to "increasing telepathic sensitivity" and is a weak enough effect that the effect doesn't
                  even show up in some of its studies. (I presume, of course, that anyone pursuing Shamanism is studying under the guidance of a Shaman; it isn't the kind of thing one does by oneself, unless you are either very stupid or you have a deathwish.)</p>

                  <p>By the way, "becoming one with the object" is not required for any psionic activity, although that approach _may_ be used for some of them.</p>

                  <p>When visualizing an object, it makes no practical difference whether you "see" it in your head or as though it were in front of you. Go with which ever one seems easier to you; both will work.</p>

                  <p>How do you know if you are making any progress when nothing is happening? Unfortunately, you _don't_ know. That is one of the reasons that most people start with something other than PK; you'll _usually_ have some kind of result earlier, so you have some indication of whether you are doing it in
                  such a way as to produce effects.</p>

                  <p>For future reference, please submit questions in separate posts, rather than all together like this.</p>

                  <p>No. Holding ice cubes for extended periods of time will damage your skin and the underlying tissues. Reasonably cold baths are okay in some circumstances, but "reasonably" is the key word there. In any case, cold baths will not make you any more likely to be able to do cryoPK. They _do_ have the
                  potential to induce hypothermia, however...and this can kill you. It is also known as "exposure".</p>

                  <p>That's a good observation, but I don't see how that proves it's fake. It's not like it should be impossible to lift the heavier side with TK..? For example, if the force is directed to one spot off center, then the heavier side would tilt upwards. That's just one example of what could be
                  happening.</p>

                  <p>Maybe it is heat. But you can do tests to make sure it isn't the heat affecting it. One easy test is to try to make the psiwheel spin from across the room. Stand far away, and don't put your hands next to it, and see if you can spin it <img src="smile.gif"
