                  <p>What are the differences of Psychometry and Telekinesis? It seems to me that they are both transferring thoughts, except psychometry is through imprinting items.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Psychometry is the reading of the impressions imprinted on an item's field. By extension, it is often regarded as including the act of deliberately imprinting the item with such impressions. Neither of these actions affects the physical structure or location of the item, so far as can be
                  observed.</p>

                  <p>By contrast, telekinesis is the movement or alteration of the item, by psionic means.</p>

                  <p>Hi,<br />
                  My freind is an empath. He is finding it hard to control his emotio ns and is really comflicted. He is never sure that the emotins he is having is actually his. His lack of control is putting my telepathy of balance and I'm finding it harder now to read thoughts. How can he gain control over his
                  powers and how can I protect against it, because my sheild is'nt able to prevent him from affecting my moods aswell. Please help!</p>

                  <p>First of all, your friend needs to get a hold of his own emotions, and sort through them. From your description, we cannot even be certain he's an empath. He could simply be confused by his _own_ jumbled emotions.</p>

                  <p>Set your own Shielding to filter out emotional input, and see if that helps.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>hum... i have readed in some parts that when a person becomes telepath, can receive ALL the toughts of persons near the person. Well, i have some questions about this :</p>

                  <p>1. Doesn't that ability in being sensitive enough to hear those toughts make a person already able to manipulate energy with enough skill to do a shield ? Or that skill is independant of the skill of manipulating energy ? I ask this because telepathy is related to perception abilities, and
                  manipulating energy seems different, but at the same time perception abilities seem more difficult to develop.<br />
                  2. Does that kind of sensitivity or overflow also happens with clairvoyance ? A very sensitive person which becames clairvoyant also would need to shield ?<br />
                  3. Is it possible that when a person is such sensitive, that his wandering toughts can uncousciously send to other people and other people being able to hear them ? This is one the things i am most afraid in telepathy, in case someday i would aquire it. Shielding prevents this also, i hope ?<br />
                  4. This one is a bit off-topic, but even with pendling it can take several days to the pendule give accurate answers, specially those related to ESP ?</p>

                  <p>1) Nope. Different set of skills entirely.</p>

                  <p>2) It can, but it tends to be dealt with differently.</p>

                  <p>3) This is fairly common, actually. And yes, shielding can prevent it easily.</p>

                  <p>4) Yep. Pendling is only a mode of communication from your subconscious. Your accuracy in ESP-related questions will depend on your ability in ESP.</p>

                  when telepathic shielding, is it normal to experiance a certain level of seperation anxiety/sadness. also it appears that poeple treat me oddly when i do so, is it neccassary to add something to the shield to give off a more natural vibe?</p>

                  <p>Some people report such an anxiety/sadness, most often folks with some 'pathic ability. I say "some" because beyond a certain point, that "separation" becomes desperately-needed relief, rather than unfamiliar.</p>

                  <p>Some folk will react to a suddenly-Shielded 'path oddly, because the 'path won't be acting quite in his/her normal fashion.</p>

                  <p>Alright, so here I am, sitting in my room just watching TV like any normal person, right? I think I hear something and turn my attention towards the door, but it's just my cat coming in. That's cool. He's always been an interesting cat--Something about him, like he has a presence. Anyways, he hops
                  up on the bed and begins to stare at me. I stare back, and immediately, pow. It hit me. Our eyes locked for about 20 seconds, and if you own a cat, you'd know that's kind of strange for a cat to stare at you in an eyelock manner. After that he looked away and I looked away, but I could feel him. I
                  could tell that when I laughed at the TV the noise annoyed him. I could tell that when he looked at me I could "feel" intent. Which seemed to be eating a petting. I just dismissed this at the time and after a while he left the room. About 10 minutes later, as I am watching TV still, my head jerks
                  forward very roughly as if attached to a string then is released, sending it back against the wall. Is it possible that I unintentionally linked with my cat? Is linking with animals even possible?</p>

                  <p>My question is for anyone who can answer it. I would like to tell you about an experience of mine that i had a day ago. While I was trying to link up to a friend of mine telepathically,I got into a deep trance. As I was in the trance my chest started to feel funny in between my neck and the top
                  part of my chest. It felt as if someone tried to cut it open from one arm to another with something very cold. This feeling did not hurt but felt weird. Then soon after I started hearing something fuzzy like the sound you get when the radio isn't clearly on one station. Then it sounded like faint
                  voices that kept becoming louder and louder. Although the voices became louder i could not hear exactly or clearly what they were saying. It sounded as if they were all conversating but there still was the static noise in the background. This went on for 2 hours then i awoke from the trance like
                  state. I wasn't successful with the link to my friend but I thought what i did hear was other peoples thoughts. I just wanted to know if maybe thats what I heard. I usually practice tk and ive been doing so since feb of last year.I have been very successful in it but i wanted to try something new. If
                  you know what i experienced I would be happy if you could tell me but if not that is ok. Thank you</p>

                  <p>Once your rather good at Telepathy or Empathy, will you have control over the random links you made in the past accidently? Like, before you practiced Telepathy or Empathy you made links and not knew, but now you have control over when you want to make them, so does this give you full control over
                  it? (Note: This excludes if someone accidently connects to you, if your shiled lets them that is)Thank you for answering this! <img src="smile.gif"
