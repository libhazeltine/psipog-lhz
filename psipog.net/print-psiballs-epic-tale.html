   <p><em>by SheepKing</em></p>

   <p>The psiball is a small ball of psionic energy usually used for amusement or practice by beginners. It is used mostly during the beginning stages of a psions training to help them learn to gather/move psi energy. Even though you will mostly find people saying things like "Psiballs are useless", and the like, this
   is untrue. Yes, psiballs are basic constructs and they are simple in nature, but they provide you with experience you couldn't get any other way than practicing.</p>

   <p>To make a psiball you have to be able to move psi energy. This is quite simple, however; a lot of people have trouble doing so. The psiball is created by moving psi energy into a desired location in the form of a small sphere. For me, the standard psiball is a little bigger than a baseball, and smaller than a
   softball. However, they can be made quite large, to fit around the body in the case of a shield, and yes, even bigger than that.</p>

   <p>Now, you're getting anxious eh? "I know what a psiball is!" and "Hurry up already, I'm trying to forget that I haven't brushed my teeth!" (<img src="blah.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"

        alt="Blah"
        class="smileyImg" />) Well, before we go into that let me get a few more words in. After you get comfortable with making psiballs, I suggest going on and reading my article about how to make them last "How to Maintain your Constructs". In there you will find information about how to program constructs. I also
        suggest reading Peebrain's article, "<a href="art-so-you-think-psiballs.html">So You Think You've Mastered Psi Balls?</a>" So, you can find some creative ideas about what you can do with a psiball, and good ways to get practice.</p>

   <p>Now we are ready to get started. Some people seem to have a big * Cough * "problem", with deciding which position they should place there hands. This problem is quite easy to solve, simply do what is comfortable. Make sure you don't get your hands in a position so that it makes you tired and makes you get all
   shaky because of strain. I also suggest not having your fingers touching; it seems a bit "harder" when you have them touching. Basically I'm saying, "Don't like two hands? Use one. Don't like having them vertical? Hold them horizontal." Just do what feels right.</p>

   <p>Now, to start getting the psi flowing, you will want to visualize psi in your sternum. (The sternum is the location just under your ribs, place your hand on your stomach and your pinky touching the top of your belly button, this is the area you are going to want to use.) There are many suggestions of what to
   visualize, I say, visualize what ever your first impression of Psi looking like was. Think it looks like water? Use that. Light, fire... etc. I usually visualize it as a Blue/White light. Imagine it in your sternum moving around slowly, and attempt to FEEL your sternum while visualizing this.</p>

   <p>To move it, visualize it slowly moving up, going up your chest (Try to avoid moving it through areas of major nerve clusters.) and over to your shoulders, slowly, and attempting to feel it while doing so. Have it go down to your arms, and to your hands, have it pool there for a little, while, bring it back up,
   and then back to your sternum. Do this quite some times until you start to get the hang of it.</p>

   <p>Now, we start to make the psiball. Pull psi from your sternum, by the method suggested above. But, when you get to your hands instead of having it pool, have it flow out and shape into a hallow sphere. This sphere is what you are going to use as a shell. After you have created the shell you are going to want to
   program it, the programming will be to maintain the psi on the inside, and keep it in one location instead of having if fly every which direction. After you have successfully created a shell, you will want to fill it in. So do so. You have just made a psiball.</p>

   <p>To move the psiball from one location to another, you will want to move it just like you moved the psi from you sternum, and to your hands, and then back again. This time, it won't be in your body though. So, don't worry and give it your best try... If you think you failed, try again, and again and again. Even
   if you didn't fail, and just want to find something to have fun with, and improve your skill play around with the psiball.</p>

   <p>There are many ways to make psiballs, some people have much better success with doing it a certain way. The principles of it are the same; locate your "energy" source, move the psi, then put the psi into an area and use what "energy" you have to create the psiball.</p>

   <p>Peebrain says: "Create the psiball the size of a beach ball, then when you feel your ready compress it down into a smaller, denser ball. A lot of people seem to have good results with this."</p>

   <p>You can do the above, or you can simple create a small ball which is relatively hallow, and fill that in. It's entirely up to you to find out YOUR best method.</p>
