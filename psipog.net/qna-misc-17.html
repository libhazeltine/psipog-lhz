                  I was just wondering, is it possible to use telepathy with animals (i.e. read emotions, "thoughts" on so on), or even shield them. Maybe build a construct in front of them and see if they can sense it? Just for fun...</p>

                  <p>Hi,<br />
                  I'm new here, and I wanted to know, purly out of curiosity, about how common it is for someone to be born with psionic abilities. The reason that I want to know is because, for as long as I can remeber, I have been, let's say different. If anyone is curious about what I can do, don't hesitate to ask,
                  but bear in mind, I do everything by instinct, not by control.<br />

                  <p>Around PsiPog.net, it's not really uncommon at all. A lot of people are born with skills. I don't recall any studies done on a general cross-section of people... It varies on how much skill you're born with. Perhaps Rainsong can remember a specific study if she sees this question...</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>1) What are some practical uses of telekinesis? It seems that 99% of the things you can do with tk can be done much easier and with much less effort with your physical body. The only thing that comes to my mind is opening locks (I've read about it somewhere on this site, iirc).</p>

                  <p>2) Pendulum dowsing - maybe it's just me, but I have problems with answering/predicting anything involving numbers, for example, when doing practice questions I get weird answers like '2+2=7' or 'is 3&gt;5? - yes', etc. I'm pretty good at predicting the neares future regarding my school, friends,
                  family and such or at asking my subconscious for guidelines, but it gets all messed up with maths and numbers (not to mention predicting lottery drawings :P). Is it some kind of a general rule that numbers are harder to 'see' or is it individual?</p>

                  <p>1. Minor scale Macro-TK is kind of useless, other than the "holy shit, this really is real". Picking locks is possible... fudging up computers and other electronics, busting light bulbs... Could be useful? Heh. I bet you could come up with a bunch of small useful things. Large scale Macro-TK could
                  be VERY useful - pretty obvious.</p>

                  <p>2. Numbers do seem to be a problem, with a lot of areas. People trying to precog or RV the lottery don't do so well... but they can do fine with other things that are more subjective. I don't know what it is - perhaps numbers are too much of a "concept", while the other things are really like part
                  of reality. I.e., you can walk over and see and touch a bridge, but you can't really grab a 5 with your hands <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>I wasn't exactly sure where to put this since it kinda goes in every category, but am I overworking myself by practicing multiple skills from multiple categories everyday? Like I try to warm up with sensitivity training and basic psi manipulation (a psi ball or two) then you know try some
                  telepathy, well the list goes on and on. Am I getting nothing by going for everything? I just made a chart and tried to put some things on different days, but in all it still comes out to about seven different things a day. (if you don't understand the question please tell me so I can try to clear it
                  up)</p>

                  <p>Well, in the same regard, if you run 10 miles a day, then bike 20 miles, then go lift weights, then jump rope, then go attend karate class, then do some kickboxing... well... you're going to exhaust yourself. Your body needs time to heal and figure things out. If you over-do it a little, you'll
                  progress slower, if you over-do it too much, you could do some serious damage. I suggest working on maybe one or two skills at a time. Practice every day for an hour max.</p>

                  <p>Is psi the only 'mysterious force' at work out there or are there other things like Tai Chi? I was doing some research on it and found a site that talked about something called Tai Chi that used breathing exercizes to summon energy or something. There was a section there where they answered
                  questions and one of the questions was wondering if tai chi was psi, and he said that they are both energy from the body, except that psions make constructs to do things, while tai chi is using your body to do things. I'm not sure if any of that is true, but my point is, are there any other forces
                  out there that 'may' work, such as magick, ki, chi, tai chi, etc...</p>

                  <p>"Psi" describes any "mysterious force" that can be used to produce certain effects (telepathy, clairvoyance, and pk, mostly; the other abilities are considered "psi" by extension). If you can do one of those things with the other "forces" you mentioned, then they are considered "psi". The most
                  common model of what psi is, in these communities, involves a hypothetical particle given off by the nervous system. The model seems to work well. However, it is not the _only_ way to produce psionic effects.</p>
