                  <p>No, you will not feel something as solid as basketball/football/item. If you are feeling a magnetic pulsy feeling (and tingling), you are probably doing it right. However, have someone else feel it so that you can be positive that you are not experiencing a biofeedback.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hello, my name is Kiros, I'm 15 and I just started Psionics, oh, about 4 days ago. I'm doing well enough I guess, I did a psi ball on the first try. (I think, I'm not sure if I'm getting the right feeling). The thing about that is, when I form psi on my abdomen, I feel the same exact feeling I get
                  when I'm nervous or anxious. Would this mean that I'm just being nervous, not building psi? or that when I'm nervous I build up psi in my body naturally? Or perhaps psi is just connected to emotions?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>It could mean that you are getting nervous instead of making a psi-ball. Psi is a byproduct of the neervous system, so you are always making it (provided you are still feeling/alive). Psi is connected to emotions (although I have read no research that cites this specifically, many researchers hint
                  that the productivity of a psychic is based upon how interested in the experiment he is. psychic being bored produce poor telepathy and psychokinesis results, while being motivated tends to produce better results, while frustration can produce the opposite of the desired result). Advice: have someone
                  else feel the psi-ball, and see if you are just getting a nervous feeling or if you are, indeed, making a psiball.</p>

                  <p>Hey, I'm new to this psi-stuff and I'm kind of having a hard time knowing if I made a psiball or not. Anyways, I told my mom to put her hand between my hands after I thought I made a psiball. I felt a tingling and magnetic pull, but when she put her hand between mine, she said she didn't feel
                  anything. My question is, what would another person feel when they put their hands in between mine? And another, how would the person try to feel the psiball? Am i doing it right?</p>

                  <p>They should feel the same thing that you do. If they do not, it is a sign that you are doing an exercise that we call "biofeedback" which means that you are rtificially creating the sensation to yourself (kind of your mind convincing your body to feel certain things). At any rate, it is doubtful
                  that you have made a psi-ball (that time), sorry. What to do is to keep trying to make one, and do not focus on the feelings. Try to focus on gather energy and such. Use your visualizations instead of saying "my body should be feeling this". Good luck</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hello! I've read alot on psi balls and programming,<br />
                  and my brain tends to get a "weird" thought in<br />
                  it every time I make a stronger-than-usual psiball.<br />
                  When I start programming it, my brain thinks "Since<br />
                  this is a more powerful psiball it will need<br />
                  more programming." I was just wondering if this<br />
                  was true. In other words, will a more powerful<br />
                  psiball need more time put into it during programming<br />
                  if you want it to accomplish the task better?<br />
                  If so, how long would you suggest programming<br />
                  the average psiball? By average, I mean about<br />
                  1 minute put in to making it.</p>

                  <p>The amount of programming would be determined by the complexity of the construct, rather than its strength. A more powerful construct should be as easily programmed as a weak construct.</p>
