<FONT SIZE=+1>February 7th, 2004 PK Party</FONT>
<P>
The idea was the same as our <A HREF="pkp-dec02.html">December 14th, 2002 PK Party</A>.
A PK Party is usually something where people meet physically, and focus on bending
silverware.  We're internet nerds, so we decided to meet in the chat room instead, and
see if we could get results.  Part of the theory behind a normal PK Party is the atmosphere
it creates is inducive to the psychokinesis.  With
<A HREF="http://www.fork-you.com/">Fork-You.com</A> as a guide, we just tried to do our best
to recreate the atmosphere in a chat room, and see the results.
<P>
Below are the pictures I received from the chatters.  Could they be fake?  Maybe.  Make up
your own mind.
