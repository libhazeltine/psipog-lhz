         <p>What makes it an off day? What makes it a good day? In this article I'm going to try to help you troubleshoot what is happening with your psi for a particular day. Hopefully, with this paper you can change a possible off month to just an off day. Perhaps, you can even make an off day good enough to show
         results anyway. Whatever the case may be, it doesn't have to be a mysterious reason for missing the mark every time. Be forewarned though, a lot of this IS common sense. So, don't be upset if everything seems so simple and self-explanatory. Let's get on with the show.</p>

         <h3>Sickness</h3>I'm rarely sick, but there is a clear decline in ability when I am. I've spoken to a few others about this and the general consensus is to not practice when you're sick. You have no increased sending or receiving and psi doesn't want to come together too well. Another big downside of being
         sick while practicing is fatigue and headaches. I tire very easily when I'm sick and the headaches creep very slowly on. Now, I'm pretty much past the point of getting headaches from practicing alone so it's a bit annoying to have them crop up. I say just don't practice while sick. Wait until you're well to
         resume any training.

         <h3>Fatigue</h3>I'm not speaking of body fatigue where you kind of just feel like crap. I'm speaking of lack of sleep fatigue. This is actually an interesting hindrance. On one hand, it spawns these weird hallucinations that may or may not be psychic related. For instance, it's easy to hear voices and you
         might lapse into a waking dream and find that what you just dreamt happens after you wake up. On the other, they can't really be trusted because you're tired. So, if you just want a neat experience, try that out. Otherwise, get some rest because it's useless to practice while tired.

         <h3>Headache</h3>This can become a serious issue if you just keep practicing without a care in the world. To be honest, on the rare occasion that I do get headaches, I'm done - period. You should be too. I've made the mistake of continuing before, thinking I could take it. The headache lasted a whole day and
         a half. It wasn't just a dull thud either. We're talking hot-knife-through-the-brain pain. I recall sleeping most of that day to rid myself of thinking about it as well. I can't make you do anything obviously, but I wish I could make you stop if you happen to get a headache because you're just going to hurt
         yourself worse by continuing. That's all there is to say on that.

         <h3>Depression</h3>OK, this is serious too, and requires care from a healthcare provider or qualified counselor. If you are depressed, don't mess with psionics. It's already dangerous enough when you are sound of mind. Get healthy and then come back to it. End of story.

         <h3>Anxiety</h3>Now, I'm not talking about the mental disorder here. If that's your case, please read the DEPRESSION entry. I'm speaking of the anxiousness or nervousness you get when you're trying something new and aren't sure if it works or not. You all know that feeling right? You're not 100% sure it's
         going to work and are extremely excited that it might. Well, let me say that you should just back off from it and not waste your time because anything you do will just be counter productive. For one, it will reassert to you that it ISN'T real, and secondly, it will discourage you that you failed in getting it
         to work. The best thing to do is to just back off and gather your thoughts. Wait until you can try it in observer mode and are able to tell yourself you will evaluate the results after you give it a fair try.

         <h3>Diet</h3>Personally, I'm torn on this issue. You can look at it in two lights. One, you believe that potassium has a key factor in psionics. Or two, you don't. I do. I take 90mg supplements of it daily in a Centrum multi-vitamin. I don't have too healthy of a diet but I do stay full and more or less
         nourished. I can say that I've tried going without the potassium supplement before and it's caused minor heart pain and frequent spasms. It seems to be a key factor if there ever was one. You be the judge on this and you make the call. It's your body.

         <h3>Hunger</h3>Hunger is pretty interesting. Surprisingly enough, it seems to be pretty conducive to the receiving ability of psionics. I'm speaking of things like telepathy and empathy and such. If I had to offer an opinion as to why (and it's my paper, so I will) I'd say that it's because when your stomach
         is empty, you're paying attention to it. When you're paying attention to it constantly, you're also paying attention to the rest of your body. Thus, it allows you to tell what you're intercepting or what is being sent to you a bit better than normal. Now, I'm not saying to go starve yourself, because that's
         stupid. However, if you're ever in the position where you need a snack or a meal or something, give practicing a few tries and see what the results show.

         <h3>Concentration</h3>Have a rough day at work or school and think it's time to unwind with some practicing? Well, don't. It's not going to do any good if you're constantly thinking of what Bill did today instead of what color to send. Chances are, if you aren't thinking the thought clearly enough, no one is
         going to receive anything. Now, you just frustrated everyone and yourself with bad results. The best thing to do is to take a step back, and reflect on the day before you begin to get any serious practicing in. It helps everyone.

         <h3>Addiction</h3>I don't know how many of you smoke, but I do. When that craving is starting to hit, you can take a break and smoke or take a break and don't. Either way, wait until the craving has subsided to continue practicing. When it's all that's on your mind, you can't gather your thoughts well enough
         to be productive. Having that cigarette though can really feel like a boost in receiving ability though. Most likely, it's just because you're calm again and at peace. Kids, don't smoke.

         <h3>Alcohol</h3>Raise your hand if you're guilty of practicing while inebriated.<br />
         *Raises hand*<br />
         Yeah, I've practiced drunk before. It sort of helps, but it also sort of hurts. For one, you do receive a bit better, but forget sending. Secondly, you might make others feel nauseous or even drunk if you decide to connect to each other. Strangely enough, this works...but it's not the same feeling as actually
         being drunk. Really, I suggest that you don't practice at all while drunk. Try to do something a bit more fun with your time...c'mon you're drunk. There's gotta be lots of fun things to do.

         <h3>Drugs</h3>OK, this is the last subject I will cover. All I will say at this point (because I want to write a more in-depth article on it) is that drugs will not help you with psionic abilities. They twist your reality usually and this reality is twisted enough as is. So, let's all stay sober and drug free
         while we practice. K?

         <h3>That's All Folks!</h3>Well, that's it. A nice little list of ailments and hindrances for you to peruse. As you can see, most of these problems ARE problems. They don't help my abilities, and most likely won't help yours either. Hey, you could be the exception. Who knows right? Or, you can save yourself
         the time of experimentation and realize that a lot of these are bad avenues to go down. Whatever your choice may be, I hope your practices are more productive now and that you never have to say "I'm having an off day." without an explanation. Of course, there's always some strange fluke that is unexplainable
         as to why nothing's working right. (I generally sleep it off, or read a book) Psi's weird like that. Anyway, see you in the practice room.
