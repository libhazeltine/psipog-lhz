                  <p>"Bad"? No, not particularly. In order for it to be useful in stage performance, you need your skills to be reliable, and reasonably dramatic. Otherwise, it is easier to do stage magic with sleight-of-hand.</p>

                  <p>I was wondering about a 'skill' I have. I sometimes can predict the future. But it isn't like !THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN! It is more like a thought. For example, I once went to visit my mom's friends and I put on my Red Sox hat(Whooooooooooo). Then I thought, well what if she's a yankees
                  fan?(Booooooooooooo). And sure enough she was. This also happens for tv shows. Like I'll remember a Simpson episode right before it comes on (couple days before). But it just pops in my head, it is weird. And my mom also has this 'skill' She knows I have it. But the last time I told a friend, my
                  'skill' vanished for a couple weeks and slowly became stronger again. I AM CONFUSED!</p>

                  <p>This skill is generally lumped into a rather broad category of "precognition" or predicting the future. It sounds like you are doing pretty good at it, try to forecast specific things (instead of the random poppings into your head) in order to practice.</p>

                  <p>I was looking at a few other sites... And a lot of them mentioned 'ki', 'chi', 'prana', 'dan tien' and things like that... I was wondering if there's a site that lets you know about all of this stuff that isn't too confusing to understand.</p>

                  <p>Also, I've heard of ki blasts, and I have no idea what those are supposed to be, or how to do them. But I won't ask how to do that, because apparently Peebrain doesn't like that kind of question... :-/</p>

                  <p>So yeah... Help me if you want to, and thanks in advance if you do. If you don't answer, I'll just look up more stuff until I find what I'm looking for :) That might take a while, but oh well.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Very few sites compare all the sets of terms in a way that isn't completely skewed. Part of the problem is that the terms do not translate properly into English. Another part of it is that later systems borrow earlier terms without keeping the original meaning As an obvious example, compare some
                  of the "magick" sites' explanation of Chakras to the explanation in Theosophism, from which most of those magical systems are derived...or to the Hindu version, from which the Theosophist version is derived.</p>

                  <p>Most versions of "ki blasts" that you'll read about online are based on cartoons, rather than reality. Peebrain prefers his site to be based on reality. This is why he dislikes the ki-blast discussions.</p>

                  <p>Chi/Xi and Ki are roughly the same concept, one in Chinese and the other in Japanese. Either way, the concept overlaps "psi" but is not quite the same idea. Any of the serious sites devoted to traditional Chinese medicine should give you some decent information about it. Sometimes, it is possible
                  to get some information about it in martial-arts sites, but this is more chancy. "Dan Tien" is also to be sought in those sites.</p>

                  <p>"Prana" is an Indian concept. If memory serves, it is a Sanskrit word. Try yoga sites. I think it is also mentioned in Therapeutic Touch discussions.</p>

                  <p>Ok. So I've tried Pendling, and it appears to be working for me. *YAY!!!* Anyway, I was wondering: Does it really matter WHAT you use for your pendulum thing? On some sites, I've heard that you should use crystals and stuff. Personally, I just have a piece of string with my memory-key-thing on
                  it... (It was the only thing in my room that I could find that I could tie to a piece of string, really.) My string&amp;memory-key thing seems to be working pretty well for me. So yeah. My question is... Does it matter whether or not you use crystals?</p>

                  <p>And if it does matter, what kind of crystals would you suggest using???</p>

                  <p>Thanks in advance if you answer...</p>

                  <p>If it is small enough to be held easily, and can be conveniently attached to some kind of string, it's close enough: keys, rings, candies, fishing floats, pendant necklaces, assorted pebbles, beads....</p>

                  <p>If you do want to use crystals for it, quartz is generally the one to use (clear, rose, milky, amethyst, etc). The folks who claim that it must be perfectly clear with no inclusions (the flecks and cracks) are mistaken.</p>

                  <p>Hello.<br />
                  Whenever I try anything having to do with psi (making psi balls or shields mainly), I feel a slight pressure right under the point where my ribs stop. It's right in the center, below the breastbone. The pressure isn't uncomfortable or annoying, but it happens every time. Is this normal?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>It isn't unusual. As long as it is just a bit of pressure there, and it only happens when you are doing stuff with psi, you probably don't need to worry about it.</p>

                  <p>If, on the other hand, it hurts or if it starts happening even if you aren't doing anything, I'd strongly suggest consulting with a health-care professional. It's possible for something unrelated to psi activities to creep up on you, without being noticed, if you are accustomed to having a
                  periodic bit of pressure there anyway.</p>
