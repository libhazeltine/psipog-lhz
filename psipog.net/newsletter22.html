Dear PsiPog Users,

Hellooooo! I hope everyone had a good Thanksgiving :-). These
past weeks I've been working on the forums and my new eBook, but
neither are ready to be released yet :-P.

We have a lot of mail, so let's jump in right away:

"I was sitting in speech class and my friend was up doing her
speech. Well, since see gets extremely nervous and since I had
been reading your website and practicing I tried to put empathy,
I guess you could say, to practical use. I was sitting there
visualizing a tube attaching from her to me and I vizualized her
anxiety absorbing into me. I felt sick like I had "butterflies".
Then when she sat down it went away. So I thought, well that's
just a coincidence, but then I tried to do it to this other guy
presenting his speech and I felt the same thing. Do you think
that you can relieve someone of their emotions or is my mind
playing tricks?"

My comments: In a situation like that, it's hard to tell whether
your mind was playing tricks or not. A better way to test it is
to read someone when you can't predict what they might be feeling
by "normal" means. I.e., if someone is reading a speech in a
speech class, it's easy to logically conclude they might feel
nervous. However, if you can find situations where it isn't easy
to conclude what someone will feel, and try to feel their
emotions in those settings, you will have a better idea of
whether it's all in your head or not. Experiment! :-)

"I read the article about the Flare Party and thought that it
would be cool to try holding my own. I invited about 10 people
and when we tried to make the construct we were trying to make it
come out a red color, but instead of red there was no color at
all. Then one of my friends noticed that my face looked slightly
mishappen and we realized that the psiball was actually
refracting the light! Well my point is has anyone else done that
to such a degree, and if so I would like to hear about it."

My comments: Cool! Actually, it's been my experience that making
a construct distort light is easier than making a construct emit
light. That brings up an interesting idea though: maybe we can
try another flare party with the intention of distorting the
light instead of making it flare a color? Thanks for sharing!

Matt writes:
"I have recently formed a theory that it is possible to send a
certain feeling you get when you perform a skill successfully
through some sort of telepathy. I have not actually done this but
I have tried and strongly belive it is possible due to reading
many articles on psionics. I think this could be particularly
useful for teaching new psionics users because you would be able
to send them the feeling you get when you successfully preform a
skill. This way they would be able to visualize and duplicate the
event with ease. Any additional information or maybe some
experiences you had with something like this would be
appreciated."

My comments: Yes, this is possible. In fact, some people prefer
NOT to write articles because it is easier and more effective to
teach people one on one. I have a little personal experience
with this idea, but I have more experience in a slightly
different (but related) idea: you can also learn other "normal"
skills faster using a combination of empathy and telepathy,
along with watching the person perform the action. You gain a
better understanding of what you need to do to succeed.

"Hello. I've been trying to program my psi balls for over two
years. I know they're there, but as soon as I move my hands away
from the ball, it disipates. I've used all the methods in the
articles, and none of it's worked. Is there anything in
particular that may help?"

My comments: Take smaller steps, and work your way up to it. For
example, at first take one hand away, and only have the psi ball
in the other hand. Then when you get the hang of that, move the
psi ball along your arm (like rolling it along your skin). Move
it to different parts of your body. After that, try throwing it
from one hand to the other. Start with a short distance, then
make the distance bigger the better you get. Continue to
increase the distance until you are happy with the results. I
hope that helps :-).

"I found that deja vu is pretty normal for me, infact it's
pretty normal for most of my family as are premonitions. Maybe
its related to the fact that most of my family are practiced
Wiccans (neo-pagans). I'm not sure if it's psi related or if it's
just a family "gift". Premonitions can be a scary thing; I
started having them when I was 12 (my Aunt later explained that
it's pretty normal for my family). I was wondering if anyone else
has something similar passed down through family."

My comments: Skills do seem to pass down from generation to
generation. That could indicate that it has something to do with
the genes (i.e., nature), or it might indicate that parents with
psi talents will raise their children differently, that will
promote psychic development from a young age (i.e., nurture).
I personally don't have experience with this, but I know a lot of
people who were born with psychic abilities who fall in this
category.

"I read the article on anchoring and I decided to try it. I
visualized blue energy flowing from everywhere into me and making
a sort of blue fire/aura looking effect around me. I anchored
that to the word, "Charge". Then I did it over until I got to the
point where I could gather energy by saying that word alone. I
decided to gather energy manualy while saying my anchor word.
Wow! I got a sort of "Aura Vision", where I could see aurasiand
electro magnetic fields all the time. My psiballs were easeer to
make (and yes, I could see them). They looked kind of like heat
you can see when someone is grilling, that kind of wavy heat
coming off it, but with a little color. Any comments on this?"

My comments: Yes, I have a comment: COOL! :-). Thanks for sharing
your experience - this is a perfect example of how to correctly
use anchoring to your advantage. Good job, keep it up :-).

"Somehow I've become an almost conductor of electricity. It is
the weirdest thing. I used to be able to turn streetlights on and
off... and one time I turned it off and licked my finger and
could feel the electricity going through my tongue. Also, I used
to never have luck with psi-balls. One time I tried it with
electric energy and I successfully made the psi-ball... and I
could see VISIBLE sparks of electricity in the psi-ball!
Another thing: when putting my fingers together I can see the
electricity running between them and I can do it with other
people and they can see the electricity running between me and
them as well... they say it feels like needles being put into
them. It is REALLY weird. But then again... isn't everything
we do at PsiPog considered weird?"

My comments: Wow, cool :-P. That really is weird. I have heard
of those things you describe though - this link might help you
figure out what is going on (or give you a start in the right
direction):

"I have come up with a theory after discussing biology with my
friends, and I wanted your input on it. Our bodies, and any
living body, run on energy. This energy is produced from the
food we eat, and our breathing. This is cellular resperation.
Well anyway, my theory is that if we could unconsiously pull psi
into us, and im talking massive huge amounts, that we wouldn't
need to eat, and maybe not even need to breathe. This would be
because our body wouldn't need the food or air to make energy
because we are actively pulling it in psionically from our
surroundings. What is your opinion on this subject?"

My comments: Actually, there are people out there who claim to DO
this :-P. They still breathe, but they claim they don't eat
because they get enough energy from "other" sources. Some of the
famous people who claim to do this have been exposed as frauds,
however that doesn't mean that everyone who does this is a fraud.
I personally wouldn't recommend trying this out for health
reasons, but it has been documented. Check this out:
