                  <p>When you are asleep and you wake up and it feels as if you were falling, could that possibly be the result of an Out of Body Experience? If not, then do you know what it is from?</p>

                  <p>Surprisingly, the first page of results contains AP stuff. That would suggest that the falling sensation and OBEs are related in SOME way. What way? Beats me <img src="blah.gif"

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>A simple method is to close your eyes, and breathe easily (slowly, but not forceably so), and count each time you breathe out. Pay attention only to the breathing and the counting. Ignore any thoughts that wander through your mind. If you start to follow any of the stray thoughts, start the count
                  over again at "one".</p>

                  <p>What are your views on Anpsi? Animal psychic capabilities. I believe that my Cat and Dog may have some forms of powers, but I just need to pinpoint exactly what they are. Does anyone else have experience in this field? And is it possible to train them to use these abilities and maybe even
                  communicate with them on a Telepathic level?</p>

                  <p>I've never heard the term "Anpsi"... but I've had personal experience with some form of psychic communication with my dog. It didn't seem like telepathy, seemed very basic and simple. I've heard cats are sensative too... I haven't read any research on it, except for one study where baby chicks
                  used micro-PK to move a light controlled by an RNG to be over them so they were warmer.</p>

                  <p>Big "if" there. We don't know exactly what causes the pain. Some people have reported that they have phased without any pain involved.

                  <p>"A lucid dream is a condition in which you are aware that you are asleep and dreaming. It may or may not involve control of the dream. If you are not asleep and/or not dreaming, you are not experiencing a lucid dream."</p>

                  <p>Does this include when you are just dreaming (uncontrollable), and you can feel your physical body on the bed, can even reposition yourself during the dream, and yet not stopping the dream?<br />
                  I was led to believe that you might not be in complete control, but it's as clear as, say real life, or an OBE.<br />
                  And then I guess you cannot feel your physical body or let alone move it.<br />
                  I am having MANY of these dreams, and I confuse them with real life all the time. I never know wether I dreamt something or if it really happened.</p>

                  <p>I once started a whole argument with my parents because they found some stuff of mine I didn't want them to find, while I later found out that I had only dreamt that they found it... <img src="happy.gif"
