                  <p>hello. i have been an empath for the past 3-4 years. thank you for all the guidance your site has given me. last night i was on the phone to my girlfreind. we are very close. something happened. i can only describe it as my mind slipped into hers. i felt all that she felt, emotional and psysical.
                  it was like we were 1 being. after a while my legs started to twitch uncontrolably and i couldnt stop it. i had to get myself out of her*cough*. it was incerdibly difficult but i managed it. do you know what happened?</p>

                  <p>ok, so I have a friend who referred me to this site. so, many people I know say 'mirror' others Emotions, But understand I don't feel their emotions. Example: if I were around someone who was really happy I Look really happy, however I may not be. Also as soon as someone with anyother emotion
                  comes around I mirror theirs Instantly, so it looks like I'm bi-polar to anyone watching me. I seem to have more energy and be more alive whenever I'm around People who are very emotional. I never noticed until this friend said so. Also I get a really odd feeling somwhat like I forgot to call someone
                  (may be someone I haven't seen in years), but then I figure out who, and I call them they tell me things are fine, and latter the day or so some thing really bad happend like a near fatal accedent, or they say something about someone just died and they're on the way to the hospital. (both examples
                  have happened about 30 times) Plus I also get odd feelings about good friends just before something bad happens to them. this feeling has never been wrong, I warn them about how they should take another road or something, then hear later in the news that there was a carcrash on that road around the
                  time they would have been there (thats happened about 20 times). most of my friens listen to me when I say I have a feeling. anyway, I was just wondering what you guys call this. the friend whorecomended this site says I'm a psi-vampire with clarevoyance (sp), what does that mean? and why don't you
                  guys or gals add a glossary to the site?</p>

                  <p>Hello, I'm new here (16y, boy)...I keep having numerous dreams about different things, and after a month they all come true, exactly as I dreamt them, after this experience I thought maby things such as telepathy really excists.<br />
                  When I was about 12y, on the way 2 school I told my friend that I wanted to try "telepathy" (just for fun), and I told my friend to try concentrating on a picture three times.<br />
                  And I actually got freaked out after I "guessed" the pictures right.<br />
                  What's happening here? am I like psychic or something?<br />
                  And when I look up in the sky I can see some small roundlike particles swirling in all directions, I've figured out that it's not light, air nor any other gasses.<br />
                  Have I got something in my eye, if not what's this I'm seeing?</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I am hoping you can give me your insights in regards to what happened to me. This has been my first experience &amp; has really upset me. I was driving my pet bobcat to the vet just to have a few stitches put back in his leg. He was in excellent health. I was looking at the sunrise when the
                  thought "What a beautiful day to die" just popped into my head. It really scared me &amp; I considered turning the car around &amp; going home. I thought I was being silly &amp; put it down to lack of sleep &amp; I was very drowsy as I was driving. When I got to the vet, I told them 3 times that I
                  could come back tomorrow since I didn't have an appt. I was very nervous. They stitched his leg up &amp; the doctor told me he was going to give him a shot of penicillin. I asked him if he could use another antibiotic because my cat seemed off his food last week. He said ok. Talon was waking up &amp;
                  beginning to growl. The dr. said he would be ready to go home in a few minutes. He went into anaphlaxis shock from the antibiotic &amp; was gone very quickly. The book that I had taken to read in the waiting room was called She loves me not. My cat had been very quiet after we arrived at the vet. I
                  evened remarked to the vet about it. He said he was probably just scared. I believe my bobcat picked up on my thoughts &amp; knew he was going to die. But the book, I feel like he was sending me a message through the book title. I loved him dearly. He was my only companion. There were a lot of other
                  signs that happened a few weeks prior to his death. Any insight or info would be appreciated. I know I am responsible for his death. I will always listen to my inner voices from now on.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>When I attempt empathical transmission I need to recall an emotion in me first right?<br />
                  The problem is that several emotions cause a chain reaction that calls other emotions regarding them.<br />
                  For an example: about two years ago I had this crush for a girl and everytime I recalled her in my mind an emotion (no point of describing it right?) started up. About half a second afterwards it aroused another kind of emotion regarding it, and then another. I was luckey not to be overloaded (I've
                  had one of those emotional avalanches before and it's not nice).</p>

                  <p>It happens also in less romantic emotions and I was wondering how will it affect empathical transmissions I might attempt?</p>

                  <p>That is completely normal. That kind of "cascade" will result in a confused Sending of several jumbled emotions. You can Send several at once, sequentially or layered, but if you cannot control them, they get jumbled.</p>

                  <p>Practice in separating and "faking" emotions is helpful to clear this up. It is not the only effective approach, of course, but it does work. The only major problem with it is that it requires practice.</p>

                  <p>I have read Yumpers article on Remote Presence. ( <a href="art-remote-presence.html"
                     target="_blank">art-remote-presence.html</a> )<br />
                  Here is my question:</p>

                  <p>How do you actually leave your body in a RP? I have tryied this many times since and before Yumpers article. "slowly peal only my arm" he says. How do you actually do this? Whenever I try I either end up moving my real arm or end up visualizing an arm leave. I have walked around the house in this
                  visualizing state. Basically like a day dream. Is this what its or is it more real?</p>

                  <p>Visualize two copies of your physical self. Make one solid and the other slightly translucent. See the two images come together and overlap. Now, (keeping this image in mind) when you want to move a body part while in Remote Presence state, visualize the specific body part move.</p>

                  <p>In my experience, when I am RPing, I am unable to walk around. It over stimulates me and I stop RPing immediately. I am mostly successful when I am sitting or laying down, that way my physical body is at rest and I am able to focus completely on the task at hand.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Yes and no. One of the big problems with clairvoyance experiments is that telepathy cannot be ruled out. Also, in some contexts, clairvoyants are sometimes referred to as telepaths (especially in the area of military remote viewing). As for mistaking an individual's main talent, that is very
                  common indeed, especially if that individual doesn't particularly want their skills to be widely known. However, you'll find that a lot of clairvoyants are also telepathic, and vice versa.</p>

                  <p>When dealing with empathy, do emotions that you perceive tend to linger on or stay attached to you for a while? And if this does occur, how can you get rid of them one they're there?</p>

                  <p>Quite often, the emotions are transient, and go away once the person is out of range, or when you block the incoming signal, or when another stronger signal overpowers it.</p>

                  <p>As for getting rid of them once they are there, aside from blocking --which is sometimes not an option, admittedly-- you would do so the same way you bring your own emotions under rein...whichever method you use for that. Grounding the excess emotions to earth, by "washing" them away into the
                  ground, can be very effective.</p>
