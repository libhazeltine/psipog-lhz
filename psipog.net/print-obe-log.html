   <p>[18:59] * peebrain changes topic to 'Out of Body Experiences Seminar - PM Questions to: anniesocks, Yumper, Mannen, or Strata - Only ask questions when prompted to do so, please'<br />
   [18:59] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> alrighty<br />
   [19:00] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> first things first: thanks for coming to the seminar :-)<br />
   [19:00] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> let's jump right in<br />
   [19:00] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> the topic is Out of Body Experiences, aka OBEs<br />
   [19:00] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I might use the term OOB too to mean "out of body"<br />
   [19:01] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> there is a lot of information on OBEs on the internet and in books... unfortunately, a lot of it is pretty biased<br />
   [19:01] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> people experience something weird then make a theory on why it happens, then try to pass it off as a fact<br />
   [19:01] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I will attempt to keep everything based on personal experience<br />
   [19:02] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so... what is an OBE?<br />
   [19:02] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> basically, your conscious mind seems to seperate from your body, and can float around while out of the body<br />
   [19:03] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> leaving your body typically happens while between the awake/asleep border<br />
   [19:03] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> but people have reported leaving their body during the day (I personally haven't though)<br />
   [19:03] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> OBEs feel as real as waking life<br />
   [19:04] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> sometimes, while laying in bed, I have falling out of my body and hit the floor<br />
   [19:04] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> it felt so real that I thought I actually fell out of bed<br />
   [19:04] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so I mean, it's not like a dream-state, it feels REAL<br />
   [19:05] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I started my training in OBEs in summer of 2000<br />
   [19:05] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I practiced for about 6 months straight, every night<br />
   [19:05] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> after 6 months, I decided to take one night to just relax and take a break<br />
   [19:05] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> that night I had my first OBE<br />
   [19:06] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> to date, I estimate I've probably had 30-40 OBEs... though now that I think about it, I've probably had more<br />
   [19:06] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I lost count... :-P I've had a bunch<br />
   [19:07] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> how I got into it was basically surfing the web for psychic stuff, and came across it<br />
   [19:07] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> thought it sounded pretty insane, so I gave it a try<br />
   [19:07] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I searched for every single method I could find, and tried, and tried, and tried<br />
   [19:07] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I can remember my first OBE... I stuck my hands through my bed<br />
   [19:08] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> and felt the bottom of my bed with my finger tips<br />
   [19:08] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I snapped back into my body, walked downstairs in complete shock<br />
   [19:08] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> and told my parents... who looked at me like I was nuts :-P<br />
   [19:08] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> hell... it IS nuts!<br />
   [19:08] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> who leaves their body?!<br />
   [19:08] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> heh<br />
   [19:09] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so, before I jump into how to do it, please PM the mods with any questions that you have<br />
   [19:09] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> mods: please paste the questions in here, one at a time<br />
   [19:10] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I am going to cover how to do it, and techniques, so please don't ask something like "how do I have an OBE?"<br />
   [19:10] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> :-P<br />
   [19:10] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:10] &lt;raik&gt; Are OBE and RP same or not?<br />
   [19:10] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I have never RP'ed, so I can't speak from experience<br />
   [19:10] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> but, from what I've been told, RP seems to be different<br />
   [19:11] &lt;anniesocks&gt; OBE and RP are for the most part, the same. it's astral projection that starts making things a lot different.<br />
   [19:10] &lt;Strata&gt; psycofirek: is there anything you can do in an obe?<br />
   [19:11] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> you can do a bunch of cool things while OOB, like fly around, go through walls, random stuff like that<br />
   [19:11] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;PrinceSendai&gt; Would you ever not recall your OBE the next day?<br />
   [19:12] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Prince - I have forgotten parts of an OBE before, only to remember it later on, sort of like remembering a dream, but other parts are crystal clear<br />
   [19:12] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I think the "memory" part of your brain is all weird, just like while dreaming, so it's hard for your mind to record the information<br />
   [19:11] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:12] JumiJoze: hello, I want to ask, if it is possible to have a constant OBE, like controlling your body permanent outside<br />
   [19:13] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> JumiJoze - I don't know if that's possible, I've never tried, nor heard of anyone trying that<br />
   [19:11] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:09] &lt;Tefnakt&gt; Is everyone able to have OBEs?<br />
   [19:13] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Tefnakt - as far as I know, anyone can have an OBE<br />
   [19:12] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:11] &lt;SilverPSI&gt; can you see the "real" world like your dog and stuff<br />
   [19:13] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> SilverPSI - yes, you can see the real world<br />
   during an OBE<br />
   [19:13] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:10] &lt;Ananse&gt; Do you believe like some people that that feeling of falling when you're sleepy (like your hand slipping through the desk) is a partial-separation OBE?<br />
   [19:13] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Ananse - beats me<br />
   [19:13] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:13] &lt;Spoony_Bard&gt; Can Having an OBE be dangerous in any way?<br />
   [19:14] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Spoony-Bard - some people claim it can be, some people claim it isn't dangerous... My personal opinion is that it isn't dangerous, because any time I wanted to get back to my body, I would just will myself back.... it's definitly scary though :-P<br />
   [19:14] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:13] &lt;SilverPSI&gt; can you obe forever or do you just pop back in to yourself at some random point?<br />
   [19:14] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:13] &lt;Knightmares&gt; How do people see in an obe? What is there 'line of sight'?<br />
   [19:15] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Knightmares - it differs for a lot of people... I've read a lot of weird ways to "see" while out of body... personally, I usually either 1. can't see, or 2. see things like I normally see things<br />
   [19:14] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;Sirius&gt; what does everything look like while in an obe?<br />
   [19:14] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:14] &lt;Snyper_22&gt; I read somewhere that it was your subconcious mind that lifted out of the body. Your concious was just able to precieve and suggest things to and from the subconcious. Is this true? I think I read it in Journeys Out Of The Body.<br />
   [19:15] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Snyper - I don't remember that part in Journeys Out of the Body, but I don't think it's true... but I really don't know either way<br />
   [19:16] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I don't know HOW OBEs work, all I know is that I have had them, and I know how to induce them<br />
   [19:15] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;Snyper_22&gt; If you are out of your body, how are you able to hit the floor as you mentioned erlier.<br />
   [19:16] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Snyper - while OOB, objects sort of have like a "water tension" type of feel to it<br />
   [19:16] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> you can push on it, and if you push a little hard, you break the "tension" and can pass through it easily<br />
   [19:16] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:10] &lt;Jarryd&gt; is it harder to do OBE's in the day?<br />
   [19:17] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Jarryd - I have never OBEd while in waking normal life, only while in the borderline sleep/awake state<br />
   [19:17] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so I don't know how hard it is... it seems more rare, so that would suggest that it is harder<br />
   [19:18] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:19] &lt;PrinceSendai&gt; Can you affect physical objects while having an OBE?<br />
   [19:19] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Prince - I personally haven't... some people have reported affecting physical objects... some have reported affecting things while OOB, only to return to find it back the way it was<br />
   [19:19] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:19] &lt;Snyper_22&gt; Is it true that you feel vibrations before you have an OOBE?<br />
   [19:20] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Snyper - when I first started having OBEs I didn't feel vibrations, only after maybe my 15 or so OBEs did I start to feel them... so to answer your question: yes, you do feel vibrations, but sometimes you don't<br />
   [19:19] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:20] Tefnakt: Can you control Psi while having an OBE?<br />
   [19:19] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:19] &lt;Knightmares&gt; can the 'ethereal body' be trained and enhanced just like the physical body can?<br />
   [19:20] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Knightmares - I assume 'ethereal body' means the 'body' you're in while OOB... I haven't tried training that 'body' at anything, so I don't know<br />
   [19:20] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:20] &lt;SilverPSI&gt; can you obe forever or do you just pop back in to yourself at some random point?<br />
   [19:21] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> SilverPSI - I, obviously, have returned to my body, or I wouldn't be here right now... as for other people, if they permanently left, they couldn't return to report that they permanently left ;-)<br />
   [19:20] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:21] WindShade: This one's kind of strange, so I'm not sure if you'd have an answer. If a pregnant female had an obe, does her fetus experience this as well?<br />
   [19:22] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> WindShade - as I said, I'm trying to answer this based on personal experience, and I have never been a pregnant lady :-P... I haven't heard of it either<br />
   [19:21] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:20] &lt;Spoony_Bard&gt; Is this something that takes alot of willpower or can you pick it up fairly quickly with proper instructions?<br />
   [19:22] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Spoony - it takes a lot of training and will power... it took me 6 months, it took NI 5 months... hopefully with proper guidance, it will take less time... we both sort of just tried random shit out until we got it<br />
   [19:21] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:22] Prana: can you see your 'ethereal body' ?<br />
   [19:21] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:21] &lt;SilverPSI&gt; do you look like you when you are oob or can you change your shape?<br />
   [19:23] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> SilverPSI - I have read that you can change your shape, though I've never tried... I have looked at my hands while OOB, and they looked very weird... not like my normal hands... they were water-like and had ripples moving through them... strange :-P<br />
   [19:22] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;Vincent03&gt; How can you be certain if you've HAD an OBE?<br />
   [19:24] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Vincent - as I said above, sometimes I wasn't certain I was OOB, I actually thought I was still IN my body... generally speaking, when you start to fly through a wall, it gives you a hint that you aren't in your normal body :-P<br />
   [19:23] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:23] &lt;Jarryd&gt; can you go from a lucid dream into an OBE?<br />
   [19:24] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Jarryd - yes, that's a popular way to do it, actually, though I have never trained that method specifically<br />
   [19:23] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:23] &lt;Jarryd&gt; is this similiar to the idea of so-called "astral projection"?<br />
   [19:25] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Jarryd - Astral Projection (AP) seems to be different from what I've read... AP seems to be more fantasy based, while OBE is more reality based... but everywhere you go everyone has different definitions for AP and OBE, so it's hard to give a definite answer<br />
   [19:23] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:23] &lt;NwZ4EvA&gt; Does being oob affect the way you may think/percieve things? And if so, how?<br />
   [19:26] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> NwZ - it changes the way you perceive things, thinking seems to be normal though<br />
   [19:24] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:24] &lt;Psi-Sam&gt; one time i had a dream about getting hurt in my knee it felt soo real when i woked up my knee hurted.was that a OOBE?<br />
   [19:26] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> PsiSam - if you had a dream about your knee getting hurt, then it was a dream...<br />
   [19:26] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok let's hold off the questions<br />
   [19:26] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> and move on<br />
   [19:27] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> to the next subject: How to have an OBE<br />
   [19:27] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> The state of mind you want to be in is in the border-line sleep/awake state. If you are too far on the awake side, you stay awake for a long time, and it's annoying. If you are too far on the sleep side, you fall asleep, and don't wake up.<br />
   [19:27] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> You have to slowly fall asleep, and when you are in the correct state, you have to hold it for a little while and think of nothing.<br />
   [19:28] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> the next obvious question is: How do you know when you hit the correct state?<br />
   [19:28] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Unfortunately, I learned by trial-and-error. Which is why it took 6 months. But my training was sloppy because I didn't know what I was doing, so hopefully with a little guidance, you guys can get it a lot quicker than that.<br />
   [19:28] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> The most important key word for OBEing: passive.<br />
   [19:29] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> being passive is the key<br />
   [19:29] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> That means that no matter what happens, you have to accept it right away, and not respond to it.<br />
   [19:29] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> A lot of weird shit happens while your surfing different brain wave frequencies, you have to not get excited, not get annoyed, not freak out, not be super-happy, etc... Just remain still.<br />
   [19:29] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> That doesn't mean hurt yourself, if you feel like you're doing damage to your body or mind, snap out of it<br />
   [19:29] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> shake it off, try another day<br />
   [19:30] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> but if you hear a conversation of 10 people whispered into your ears (I told you weird things happen), you have to NOT freak out<br />
   [19:30] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> That comes with practice<br />
   [19:30] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> At first you will freak out because it's just plain freaky :-P. But after the 10th time, you take the attitude of "oh, this again", and that's the perfect attitude to be in<br />
   [19:30] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> that is called: being passive :-P<br />
   [19:30] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I remember when I was in training, before my first OBE<br />
   [19:31] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I hit this state where it seemed like I could see through my eyelids (weird shit goes on if you trance for long periods of time :-P)<br />
   [19:31] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I thought I was about to have an OBE, so I freaked out<br />
   [19:31] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> thoughts like "holy shit! I'm gonna finally do it! hurray!!!" started pouring into my head<br />
   [19:31] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> my heart started pounding like crazy, because I was so excited/afraid<br />
   [19:32] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I had to call it quits and wake myself up because my heart was beating so fast it scared me to go on<br />
   [19:32] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> know when to call it quits guys, don't hurt yourself<br />
   [19:32] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> you can just try again the next day<br />
   [19:32] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> it's not a race<br />
   [19:32] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so, remain passive, and just stay relaxed<br />
   [19:33] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> My first suggestion for success:<br />
   [19:33] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> if possible, practice while waking up. If you go too far and fall asleep, you'll wake up 10 minutes later, instead of 8 hours later. So you can try again. And again. And again. Take a saturday morning, set your alarm early, and just keep trying.<br />
   [19:33] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> My second suggestion:<br />
   [19:33] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> don't be anal about the method you use. You have to be PASSIVE, not thinking "ok, now what was the next step... oh yeah... no wait... yeah ok that was it". Relax, be passive, go with the flow, stay still, see what happens.<br />
   [19:34] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> My third suggestion: if you are the obsessive type, don't try to OBE every night. You are training your mind, and your mind needs time to figure things out, so don't bombard it with information every night. I would suggest trying to OBE 4 or 5 times per week.<br />
   [19:34] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I will be getting to some actual techniques, but are there any questions about the material I went over?<br />
   [19:34] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> please only ask questions on the material I just went over<br />
   [19:34] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I'll have a "free-for-all grab bag"-question time at the end<br />
   [19:35] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:34] &lt;_Triocalas|TP&gt; Is there another way to enter a trance apart from the hypnogogic state? Hypnotic perhaps?...<br />
   [19:36] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Trio - perhaps, I haven't tried though... I have done it only through hypnagogic<br />
   [19:35] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:36] &lt;Jarryd&gt; would certain drugs such as alchahol or marjuanna provoke OBE's ive been told they do? or is this just the affect of the drug?<br />
   [19:36] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Jarryd - drugs are bad, stay in school kids<br />
   [19:36] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:36] &lt;raik&gt; how long did it took you to get past the heart beating?<br />
   [19:37] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> raik - after a few times of "holy shit! I'm about to do it!", you start to feel less excited... it becomes familiar... like "oh, this again", so you stay passive... I don't know how long it took in terms of days, but it took maybe half a dozen more times at that state to quit
   freaking out over it<br />
   [19:36] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:35] &lt;Spoony_Bard&gt; Is OBE just basically a lucid dream? I mean you're in the Half-Half state, so why wouldn't this be considered one?<br />
   [19:38] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Spoony - I am a natural lucid dreamer, my earliest memory of my dreams were lucid... I have never had an OBE until I started training, and when I had one, I knew right away it was different than a lucid dream<br />
   [19:36] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:36] &lt;Bren&gt; You mentioned hurting yourself in OBE practice... I hadn't heard that that was possible. How do you mean that?<br />
   [19:38] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Bren - I mean that: use your head. If your heart is beating at 160BPMs because you're so excited, then take a break. Don't be stupid.<br />
   [19:37] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:37] &lt;SilverPSI&gt; you said something about a trance do i have to to have an obe?<br />
   [19:39] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Silver - I don't think it's REQUIRED, but it's the only way I know how to purposely induce an OBE... sorry kiddo, you'll have to train that mind of yours if you want to OBE :-P<br />
   [19:38] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:37] &lt;Knightmares&gt; can you communicate with people in the 'physical' while being in the ethereal?<br />
   [19:39] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Knightmares - I have tried, and failed...<br />
   [19:38] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:39] Psi-Sam: can you enter a OOB in a meditation state?<br />
   [19:40] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> PsiSam - I have read that you can, and I believe that you can, though I have never done it<br />
   [19:40] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:40] &lt;Jarryd&gt; is it good to sheild while in an OBE?<br />
   [19:41] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Jarryd - it's good to shield in general :-P... but I don't see an OBE as a specific reason why you should shield... usually you're the only one floating around out there :-P<br />
   [19:42] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:43] PrinceSendai: What do you see when you look in the mirror?<br />
   [19:42] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Prince - I never looked in a mirror... I have looked at my real body laying in bed though, and that is really freaky... I won't do that again<br />
   [19:42] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:44] Strata: What does Hynagogic mean?<br />
   [19:42] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> heh, Strata - it's a state of mind in between awake and asleep<br />

   [19:43] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> "Of, relating to, or occurring in the state of intermediate consciousness preceding sleep: hypnagogic hallucinations."<br />
   [19:43] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> (those hallucinations are the things that will freak you out :-P)<br />
   [19:44] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:45] JumiJoze: Ehm, have you ever leaved mother Earth and traveled through space and time? =)<br />
   [19:44] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> JumiJoze - nope<br />
   [19:44] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:44] &lt;Jarryd&gt; how do you tell the difference between an OBE.. and something like sleep paralysis or the hypnagogic jerk ? they all give somewhat similiar effect<br />
   [19:45] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Jarryd - because in an OBE I am not in my body, unlike sleep paralysis, and unlike hypnagogic stuff<br />
   [19:44] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok, let's move on<br />
   [19:44] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> now, in the last section on How to OBE, I didn't really give a step by step guide, just sort of outlined the idea<br />
   [19:45] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> moving on to a step by step thing you guys can try<br />
   [19:45] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> while I know I said don't stress out over the step by step stuff, you have to have SOME idea of what you're doing<br />
   [19:46] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so, use this as an example<br />
   [19:46] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> this is the technique I used while in my "prime" :-P<br />
   [19:46] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> (right now I don't use any technique, I just wake up out of body randomally :-P)<br />
   [19:46] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> 1. Get your body in a comfortable position - do NOT move it no matter what for the rest of your attempt. Your body will itch. Your body will get numb. Your body will SCREAM at you "MOVE ME RIGHT NOW!!!" - don't do it. Gotta use that thing called will power.<br />
   [19:47] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> 2. Take 10 minutes and just don't move. What I do is usually think about the day, or think about how cool it would be to OBE, or whatever. Your body stays still for 10 minutes, your mind can do whatever. The goal here is to get your body to fall asleep, so you can do some
   visualizations of different parts of your body "turning off", going into "sleep mode", or something like that.<br />
   [19:47] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> After the 10 minutes have passed, move to step 3:<br />
   [19:47] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> 3. Think of nothing. Just stop thinking all together. Your body should be asleep at this point (or close), now it's time to get your brain to fall asleep. No thoughts. If you catch yourself thinking, calmly redirect yourself to stop thinking. No emotions. No anything. Just
   stop.<br />
   [19:47] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Do that for as long as you can hold it without going insane :-P. It's really really hard. Usually takes only a few minutes before you start getting weird things. Remain passive, and just wait.<br />
   [19:48] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> this is where the hallucinations come in<br />
   [19:48] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> You will think you are physically poked. Don't move. You will think someone is talking to you. Don't respond. You will hear voices, sounds, see objects, see flashes of light, etc... Don't respond. Don't fall asleep. Just hover there as long as you can.<br />
   [19:48] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> 4. Leave your body. How do you know when it's time to leave? At first you probably won't. When I first started, I would just randomally find my body parts floating outside of my body, then snap out of my trance and be like "holy shit! that's not normal!". Upon which I would freak
   out, and snap back into body because I didn't remain passive :-P.<br />
   [19:48] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> You gotta just play around and figure it out for yourself... your mind has to figure it out and be comfortable with it. That takes practice.<br />
   [19:49] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> this stuff feels 100% real, and will freak you out at first<br />
   [19:49] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> gotta go little by little and get comfortable with it<br />
   [19:50] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so, basic procedure: 1. get comfortable in bed, 2. don't move your body for 10 min, 3. think of nothing, 4. eventually you'll notice you can leave you're body<br />
   [19:50] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok, questions on the material presented so far?<br />
   [19:50] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:51] &lt;Tefnakt&gt; While thinking of nothing, should eyes be closed?<br />
   [19:51] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Tefnakt - yeah<br />
   [19:51] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:51] &lt;_Triocalas|TP&gt; If you have a degree of subconscious control, and youve played around in th hypnagogic state wouldn't it be possible to use an "anchor" to get to that state quicker?<br />
   [19:52] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Trio - I suppose it would, though I've never tried... I'm usually more obsessed about thinking of nothing than "ok, let's trigger this state"<br />
   [19:51] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:52] Psi-Sam: What was the most scariest thing you saw in a OOB?<br />
   [19:52] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Psi-Sam: hmm... let me think about that and come back to it<br />
   [19:51] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;Vincent03&gt; What if you take medication like prozac and ritalin? Can you still have an OBE?<br />
   [19:53] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Vincent- I don't take any medication, so I don't know... try it and find out; I'm sure you can with enough will power and practice<br />
   [19:52] &lt;Yumper&gt; [19:51] &lt;Jarryd&gt; do you recommend the "rolling technique" when you roll out of your body? because i always worried that i would screw up and fall out of bed..<br />
   [19:53] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Jarryd - movement while out of body is a whole other topic to discuss, beyond the scope of this seminar :-P... basically, when you first get out, just move your arms around, that's usually pretty easy and safe<br />
   [19:52] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [17:51] &lt;NwZ4EvA&gt; Sometimes when i'm about to fall asleep, i feel a strange calm and a semi-weird, "detached" feeling from everything, is this the type of feeling you're aiming for when trying to induce an obe?<br />
   [19:54] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> NwZ - yeah, take that state x 100 and you probably have it ;-)<br />
   [19:52] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:54] psycofirek: can you meet up with friends in an obe?<br />
   [19:54] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:55] Shinsengumi: do OBE's have anything to do with the "psi" we use for PK or Telepathy?<br />
   [19:54] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Shin - beats me, seems to be related though, people who JUST trained OBEs have randomally had more psychic experiences<br />
   [19:55] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> including PK, telepathy, precognition, etc...<br />
   [19:55] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:55] JumiJoze: A quiet room would be the most ideal, or would smooth music also help?<br />
   [19:55] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Jumi - I suggest a quiet room<br />
   [19:55] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:56] Tefnakt: While you're OOB, do you see extra objects, kind of etheric objects?<br />
   [19:56] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Tefnakt - I have seen objects that don't belong there... I try to shy away from labelling it as something though, because in reality, I have no idea why that happens, and I think the people that labelled it in the first place have no idea either<br />
   [19:56] &lt;Yumper&gt; 19:53] &lt;PrinceSendai&gt; rephrasing Knightmares's question: is there a connection between the ethereal body and the physical body that restricts where you go?<br />
   [19:57] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Prince - you mean the infamous silver cord? ;-) I have never experienced seeing or feeling the silver cord, though I have had experience in difficulty of movement<br />
   [19:57] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> and getting yanked back in<br />
   [19:56] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;SilverPSI&gt; have you ever seen other people when you oob?<br />
   [19:57] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> SilverPsi - yes<br />
   [19:58] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;SilverPSI&gt; err were they oob to or not?<br />
   [19:57] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:58] jaci: when you're OOB do you have to travel to places or can you jump from one place to another?<br />
   [19:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> jaci - personally, I haven't learned how to "teleport", so I'm stuck with flying around... I hear it's possible though<br />
   [19:58] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:59] Knightmares: when someone leaves the body into the 'ethereal', can someone leave the 'ethereal' into another 'plane' so to speak?<br />
   [19:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Knightmares - I don't know, I just report what I see, I don't ever feel like I'm switching "planes" (however that would feel I don't know)<br />
   [19:58] &lt;Strata&gt; [19:59] Prana: can you speak when you obe?<br />
   [19:59] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Prana - not really.. it's more like thinking loudly<br />
   [19:59] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:00] Spoony_Bard: Can you do Anything? Such as blow up a house or something?<br />
   [20:00] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Spoony - I never blown up a house<br />
   [19:59] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;Tefnakt&gt; Does phasing in OBEs hurt?<br />
   [19:59] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Tefnakt - no<br />
   [19:59] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;Vincent03&gt; Um...What is the silver cord? Do you mean like when you are pulled back into your body???<br />
   [20:00] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Vincent - the silver cord is this thing that supposeably connects your travelling-body to your real-body...<br />
   [20:01] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I have never seen it, nor felt it, but I have been yanked around<br />
   [20:01] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:02] Knightmares: if you arn't in your body at a given time, couldn't another 'thing' just come and take it over, so to speak?<br />
   [20:02] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Knightmares - I don't think so... never tried though... when I go OOB, it's usually pretty deserted, and I've never asked for some 'thing' else to try and take over my body to find out :-P<br />
   [20:02] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:02] &lt;NwZ4EvA&gt; What is the feeling like right before you go into an obe? is it sort of like "drifting" or is it more controlled, like a "pulling". And also, when in the passive state, how do you remain passive while trying to leave the phsyical body, wouldn't that<br />
   [20:02] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:02] &lt;NwZ4EvA&gt; wouldn't that involve thinking*?<br />
   [20:03] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> NwZ - usually I trance out to a point where I don't know what I'm feeling... I just keep trancing for a long time, then sort of "wake up" out of body.... other times, the usual thought is "when will these vibrations stop!!!" :-P<br />
   [20:03] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> and yes, that does involve thinking... the only way I can get rid of the vibrations is to stop thinking "when will they stop!"<br />
   [20:03] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:03] Prana: do you think things you believe in (such as the silver cord) affect your OBE?<br />
   [20:05] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Prana - the thing with the silver cord is that people who didn't know about it still have experienced it, then they came together sort of like "oh, you experience that too?"... so that sort of confirms that there is SOMETHING<br />
   [20:03] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;SilverPSI&gt; is there any thing you cant pass throu like lead or people or something?<br />
   [20:04] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Silver - I have been able to pass through everything I have tried... I don't think I've tried lead specifically or anything... I've passed through walls, beds, floors, normal everyday objects<br />
   [20:04] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:06] JumiJoze: would it be possible to shield YOU against objects?<br />
   [20:05] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:04] &lt;ItIsAlive&gt; If you change something in the "ethereal" world, does it change in the physical? like opening a door or something?<br />
   [20:05] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:04] &lt;PrinceSendai&gt; Do you have any control over your physical body while in an OBE?<br />
   [20:06] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Prince - yes... sort of... I have control over my eye-lids :-P that's about it :-P<br />
   [20:06] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ItIsAlive - if I push on something, it doesn't move, and if I keep pushing, I go through it<br />
   [20:06] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:04] &lt;NwZ4EvA&gt; Is it possible to perceive energy while oob?<br />
   [20:06] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> NwZ - I have tried making a psi ball while OOB with no luck<br />
   [20:06] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:07] WindShade: Is it possible to pass through a force shield while having an obe?<br />
   [20:06] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> WindShade - I never tried it<br />
   [20:06] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:08] Psi-Sam: while in a oob cant your worst fears enter the oob as well?<br />
   [20:07] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Psi-Sam - it's not a nightmare :-P, but remember, you're suppose to be in a passive state... not thinking about your worst fears :-P<br />
   [20:07] &lt;Yumper&gt; [20:07] &lt;raik&gt; Can other more sensitive people feel you if you are next to them while obeing?<br />
   [20:07] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> raik - I've never tried, though I've read that they can<br />
   [20:07] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:07] &lt;Tefnakt&gt; Can you do anything with the etehereal objects?<br />
   [20:08] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Tefnakt - the objects that aren't suppose to be there? Once I picked up a piece of paper... another time I picked up a piece of wood...<br />
   [20:09] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:08] &lt;PrinceSendai&gt; Do your 5 senses work during an OBE?<br />
   [20:09] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Prince - sight, touch... smell I haven't noticed, sound it's sort of weird, not normal... taste I never tried :-P<br />
   [20:09] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:10] Spoony_Bard: Are you only limited to exploring? Can you do fantasy-ish things?<br />
   [20:09] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:08] &lt;Tefnakt&gt; Did it affect in any way to physical reality?<br />
   [20:10] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Tefnakt - the objects that I moved didn't have "physical"-counterparts<br />
   [20:10] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;Vincent03&gt; What if you saw a light above? what does that mean???<br />
   [20:10] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Vincent - beats me, goooo towarrrddsss the liiiighttt.... :-P hehe<br />
   [20:12] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;SilverPSI&gt; i once (wile obeing) saw...me...a diffrent me floting in front of me but he look...funny....not in a ha ha way ether do you know what that was?<br />
   [20:12] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Silver - nope, I don't know what that was<br />
   [20:12] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:12] &lt;PrinceSendai&gt; If someone touches your physical body, do you feel it?<br />
   [20:12] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Prince - never had that happen, though I couldn't feel the blanket on me, or anything<br />
   [20:12] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:14] Knightmares: What can extreme emotional extremities cause during an obe?<br />
   [20:13] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Knightmares - ummm... huh? like a panic attack? the worst I had was I thought I would never get back to my body, and I started to panic... I screamed "HELP! HELP!", then finally I just calmed down and willed myself back, and it worked fine :-P<br />
   [20:12] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:13] WindShade: Do you feel a strange vibrating sensation before leaving the body?<br />
   [20:14] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> WindShade - when I first started I didn't, but now I do nearly every time<br />
   [20:14] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I use it as a cue to "ok, now I can go OOB"<br />
   [20:15] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> my mind is trained right now to recognize the state of mind before the vibrations... I usually "wake up" at that point... then I just lay there thinking about random stuff, and think "hey, maybe I can get the vibrations going?", then give it a try<br />
   [20:15] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> if it works, then I go OOB<br />
   [20:15] &lt;Yumper&gt; [20:15] &lt;Bren&gt; about WindShade's question... at what point to you take it as a 'cue' and try to leave? As soon as they start, or later?<br />
   [20:16] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Bren - as soon as they stop, I can leave... they start up and I just remain passive for about... 5 or 10 seconds, then they stop, then I leave<br />
   [20:15] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:16] Knightmares: Is the projection always in real time or can it be focused towards a future event?<br />
   [20:16] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Knigtmares - beats me, I've never check what time period I was in while OOB, don't know exactly how you would check...<br />
   [20:16] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> once I OBEd at a friends house and saw him playing a video game... but in reality he was asleep at the time<br />
   [20:17] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so that would suggest that either 1. I hallucinated it, 2. travelled through time, 3. something else<br />
   [20:16] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:17] Shinsengumi: does OOBing have any practical uses except of being cool :P ?<br />
   [20:17] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:17] JumiJoze: could shieldings around objects and buildings stop your explore?<br />
   [20:17] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Jumi - I have heard that EM fields can mess you up while OOB, and stop you from moving, but I never experienced that personally<br />
   [20:17] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:16] &lt;NwZ4EvA&gt; When trying to obe, have you ever had certian body functions stop (or feel like they have stopped)?? if so, what do you do then?<br />
   [20:18] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> NwZ - certain body functions stop? like what?<br />
   [20:19] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:18] &lt;NwZ4EvA&gt; like breathing, maybe heart beat. It happens sometimes whenever i try to induce an obe, i sometimes can't feel myself breathing or things like that, which spoils the whole attempt<br />
   [20:19] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> NwZ - oh yeah, you just gotta trance more... trust that your body won't stop your heart from beating and just go into a deep trance<br />
   [20:17] &lt;Mannen&gt; Since your body is "sleeping" when you're OOB, can you do OBE's "instead" of real sleep, and still not be tired when you wake up?<br />
   [20:18] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Mannen - my OBEs usually last anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 minutes... so it's hard to notice whether my body missed the sleep or not<br />
   [20:18] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:18] &lt;Tefnakt&gt; Do clocks, watchs, etc work fine while OBBinG?<br />
   [20:19] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Tefnakt - I think I looked at my clock once in an OBE... it displayed correct time, if I remember correctly<br />
   [20:19] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:18] &lt;PrinceSendai&gt; Is there anything at all that can damage your ethereal body?<br />
   [20:20] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Prince - beats me<br />
   [20:19] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;Knightmares&gt; can yogic practices help to induce obe's?<br />
   [20:20] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Knightmares - beats me, I've never met one, as far as I know<br />
   [20:21] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:22] WindShade: Every time I have an obe, I make it only a few feet away from my body, and I'm always pulled back very sharply. Sometimes I can keep the struggle up for a while, but I feel like a wobbling drunk man... Is there a way to avoid thi<br />
   [20:21] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> WindShade - I've had the same problem... sometimes I can't get far, sometimes I can get real far... I don't know what triggers the problem, I would suggest just relaxing some... take 10 seconds to not struggle and not move, and just relax<br />
   [20:23] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:22] &lt;PrinceSendai&gt; Are you visible to others during an OBE?<br />
   [20:24] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Prince - one time I was visible to this chick... she screamed and called for her boyfriend... I felt guilty so I left... all my other experiences I have been invisible<br />
   [20:23] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;Knightmares&gt; can certain objects (scents or crystals) be used to alter/excel an obe?<br />
   [20:24] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Knightmares - I've never tried any scents or crystals, so I don't know<br />
   [20:25] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:24] &lt;NwZ4EvA&gt; If you think of things, for example: Thinking about being pulled back into your body, does it happen? and if so, how can you avoid thinking thoughts that would hinder your obe experience<br />
   [20:25] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> NwZ - it's not so much thinking it, it's more of willing it... if you will yourself to be back, you will be... although thinking and willing sort of intersect at some points... that can get you in trouble :-P<br />
   [20:25] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so, yes, sometimes your thoughts can hinder you<br />
   [20:25] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;Vincent03&gt; What if you heard a voice and it told you something while you were having an OBE? Does it mean anything?<br />
   [20:26] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Vincent - I don't know how I'm suppose to answer that question... :-P... when I heard the chick scream, it probably meant "ahh, I'm scared" hehe<br />
   [20:26] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;Tefnakt&gt; Referring to Prince's question: were you visible for an OBEing chick or a physical one?<br />
   [20:26] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Tefnakt - she was mowing the lawn, so I would assume she was physical<br />
   [20:28] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> let's take a 5 minute break so I can eat my sandwitch, then we can jump back into question asking<br />
   [20:31] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Psi-Sam: I suppose my scariest OBE was one of my first ones... I stood up in my room, and jumped out through my window to fly through the air... unfortunately, I really didn't know how to control my movement, so I just started spinning randomally through the air<br />
   [20:31] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> that scared me pretty good, because I couldn't figure out how to get back :-P<br />
   [20:31] * peebrain goes back to eating<br />
   [20:33] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> alrighty...<br />
   [20:33] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I would prefer more questions that aren't so definite, I am not here to tell you how things work<br />
   [20:33] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I am just here to share my experiences and let you figure it out on your own<br />
   [20:34] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ask away<br />
   [20:35] &lt;Mannen&gt; Are there any other common "sensations" prior to the actual OBE, other than the vibrations?<br />
   [20:35] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Mannen - loud hissing sounds, high pitched ringing... those usually go along with the vibrations<br />
   [20:35] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:36] psinoob: can OBE be fatal?<br />
   [20:35] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> psinoob - I don't know, I haven't met anyone who has died from an OBE :-P (how would I meet them?)<br />
   [20:35] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:36] Prana: if (during an OBE) you were to accidentaly hit something, then would you hurt (like say, get a broken nose)?<br />
   [20:36] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Prana - no... while out of body, your body is safe in your bed... unless someone wacks your physical body with a 2x4 or something while you're off in never-never land :-P<br />
   [20:36] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:35] &lt;Vincent03&gt; What I meant when I said there was a voice was that there was NOONE there...my parents were asleep and I have no siblings...Should I be afraid?<br />
   [20:37] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Vincent - you heard a voice, and you don't know where it came from? could be a hallucination, could be something else, beats me<br />
   [20:36] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:35] &lt;Shinsengumi&gt; does OOBEing have any practical uses except of being cool :P ?<br />
   [20:37] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Shin - checking up on friends or family far away<br />
   [20:38] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Shin - I do it more because it's something that I have no idea how it works, and I find it very facinating<br />
   [20:38] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:38] &lt;ItIsAlive&gt; if someone else was OBEing at the same time, and you found them, could you talk to them, and hold meetings with lots of people, no matter where their bodies are?<br />
   [20:39] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ItIsAlive - beats me, I've never tried meeting someone I knew while out of body<br />
   [20:39] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:40] WindShade: About only being a few feet away from the body. I notice that when I'm laying in bed in a semi-obe kind of state thing, I can see through my eyelids, but when I leave my actual body I can't see anything? Does this go away?<br />
   [20:40] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> WindShade - I had the same problem, one time I fixed it by squinting (weird, huh?), and now I fix it by just standing still while OOB and waiting for my vision to fade in<br />
   [20:39] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;Tefnakt&gt; How do you know when something/someone is physical or not, especially when you're in an unknown place for you?<br />
   [20:40] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Tefnakt - I don't know... I guess if the thing is flying around it's probably not physical :-P, use your head<br />
   [20:40] &lt;Mannen&gt; Is blurred vision "common" when OOB?<br />
   [20:41] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Mannen - I usually either have vision, or don't have vision... one or the other... sometimes my vision is distorted, but it's never blurred, it's more like... stretched<br />
   [20:41] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:42] Tefnakt: How to come back into your body? Just lie over it?<br />
   [20:42] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Tefnakt - will power<br />
   [20:42] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:41] &lt;Spoony_Bard&gt; Have OBE's helped you overcome anything? Be it a phobia or something.<br />
   [20:42] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Spoony - yeap, they have changed my entire outlook on life, personally<br />
   [20:42] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;SilverPSI&gt; have you ever had 180o vision if so whats it like?<br />
   [20:43] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Silver - I don't think so... I have had very confusing vision before, maybe that was 180 vision, I was too annoyed with it to figure it out... usually if my vision is not normal, I just close my "eyes" (turn off my vision), and move around blindly<br />
   [20:42] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:43] Prana: you said that your own body (during an OBE) was rippled, is that how other people look?<br />
   [20:43] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Prana - the only people I have seen I believe were physical, and they didn't have that ripple effect<br />
   [20:42] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:42] &lt;ItIsAlive&gt; what if you cant concentrate enough to get back into your body?<br />
   [20:43] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ItIsAlive - eventually you black out<br />
   [20:43] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:44] Tefnakt: Do you mean, for example, your body is in New York, and your conciussness in China and you don't have to go back NY to end OBE?<br />
   [20:44] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Tefnakt - beats me, the furthest I've been is maybe .5 a mile away... usually I start snapping back<br />
   [20:44] &lt;Yumper&gt; [20:44] &lt;Sirius&gt; if you were to obe all night.. could that take place of sleep?<br />
   [20:44] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Sirius - like I said to Mannen earlier, I don't know, because my OBEs usually last between 10 seconds and 10 minutes, so it's not enough to notice whether my body missed the sleep or not<br />
   [20:45] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:44] &lt;ItIsAlive&gt; and you wake up in your body after you black out? is it possible to get stuck in an OBE?<br />
   [20:46] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ItIsAlive - yes, I woke up in my body - now please think about this: how would I know if it's possible to get stuck out of body? I would either have to be stuck out of body myself (which you know didn't happen, because I'm talking to you right now), or I would have had to heard about
   someone else getting stuck out of body<br />
   [20:46] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> and where would that story come from, if the person didn't come back to tell it?<br />
   [20:46] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:47] WindShade: Strange question. Do you think it's dangerous to approach black holes, if possible?<br />
   [20:46] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> WindShade - beats me, I doubt you could find a black hole honestly<br />
   [20:48] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:49] WindShade: Have any of your experiences ever been painful?<br />
   [20:48] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> WindShade - while OOB, I have never been in pain, but before the OBE, I have been in pain from the vibrations<br />
   [20:48] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:35] &lt;Vincent03&gt; What I meant when I said there was a voice was that there was NOONE there...my parents were asleep and I have no siblings...Should I be afraid?<br />
   [20:49] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Vincent - should you be afraid? make up your own mind on what to feel<br />
   [20:48] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:47] &lt;ItIsAlive&gt; Is it possible to go to the ethereal reflection of other planets? could OBE be used to find signes of life on other planets (ethereal buildings or other strange architecture) or something?<br />
   [20:50] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ItsAlive - maybe, I don't know<br />
   [20:49] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:47] &lt;NwZ4EvA&gt; Could a coma be sort of like an obe?<br />
   [20:49] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> NwZ - could be, I have heard of people "dreaming" of seeing the doctor operate on them<br />
   [20:49] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;SilverPSI&gt; are things clear and in color when you OBE?<br />
   [20:49] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> SilverPSI - during the day, yes, during night everything has a gray glow to it<br />
   [20:49] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:50] Psi-Sam: is it possible to oobe in someones mind?<br />
   [20:50] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Psi-Sam - never tried, seems kinda rude :-P<br />
   [20:50] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:51] Prana: what happens if you get a headache during an OBE? do you just snap back?<br />
   [20:51] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Prana - I've never had a headache while in an OBE... usually if your body is having some sort of trouble, it will snap you back inside<br />
   [20:53] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> you guys are asking pretty weird questions, and I should expect that, because OBEs are really weird... I'm sorry I answer most of them with "I don't know", but I think that a lot of people make up stuff because they really don't know... I say "I don't know" because I really don't
   know, and if someone else does claim to know, ask yourself: how would they know the answer to that?<br />
   [20:53] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;Psi-Sam&gt; is it possible to oobe in the past? (and change an event?)<br />
   [20:53] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Psi-Sam - I have heard that it is possible to OBE to the past, though I don't think you can change an event :-P, but who knows, try it<br />
   [20:54] &lt;anniesocks&gt; [18:53] &lt;NwZ4EvA&gt; is it possible to have an obe but view it (mentally percieve) as a dream?<br />
   [20:54] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> NwZ - probably, I've been in weird states that seem like a mix between lucid dreams, normal dreams, OBEs, laying in bed, etc... all at once<br />
   [20:54] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> it's weird :-P<br />
   [20:55] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;Bren&gt; You said that OBE's changed your whole outlook on life... how so?<br />
   [20:56] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Bren - just the pure shock of "holy shit, how the hell can I do this? this is messed up!" is pretty mind-blowing :-P<br />
   [20:56] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;SilverPSI&gt; do animals "see" you like dog follwing you when your oob?<br />
   [20:56] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> SilverPsi - I never experienced messing with physical animals while out of body<br />
   [20:57] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:58] Saus_Soule: once you start having OOBEs, does that mean you can never stop? every time you lie down you might get attacked?<br />
   [20:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Saus - once you open that door, I would guess that the door stays open... though I've never tried to shut it... that's sort of like asking "once you ride a bike, can you unlearn it?" - your body and mind know how to do it... so it happens<br />
   [20:57] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;SilverPSI&gt; when you say physical animals do you mean you've seen not physical animals?<br />
   [20:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> SilverPsi - yes, that's correct, I've never seen a physical animal while OOB<br />
   [20:58] &lt;Strata&gt; [20:59] Bren: But other than that shock, it didn't change much?<br />
   [20:59] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Bren - that shock is pretty major, other things changed too, but I won't get into that<br />
   [20:59] &lt;Mannen&gt; &lt;SilverPSI&gt; er i meant nonphysical animals<br />
   [21:00] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> SilverPsi - I've never ran into any animals, physical or "nonphysical"<br />
   [20:59] &lt;Strata&gt; [21:01] Strata: Aren't you tired yet?<br />
   [21:00] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Strata - yes, I'm tired, and it's 9pm<br />
   [21:00] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so, thank you everyone for coming<br />
   [21:00] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> remember: just because someone on the internet claims to know about OBEs doesn't mean they do, try things out, experiment for yourself<br />
   [21:00] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> there are a lot of nut jobs out there spreading information on OBEs<br />
   [21:01] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> think logically, draw your own conclusions<br />
   [21:01] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> hell, I could be crazy, don't trust me, try it yourself and figure it out<br />
   [21:01] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> g'night, thanks for dropping by :-)</p>
