                  <p>Before I knew about psienergy my parents and even myself noticed I had the ability to sense an emotion another person was feeling, they also said I was very good at it ,my first question is can you still be a psionic when born and have parents who are non Psi. My other question is that after a
                  while my abilty started to get weaker and now i can barely do it anymore, is their a way I can retrain my mind to do it as well as It used to be?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>As for your first question:</p>

                  <p>1) "Sensing" the emotions of other people is not restricted to psychic/psionic ability. If you _don't_ pick up on the jist of what other people are feeling, at least occasionally, you're likely to be a sociopath ("path" in this case referring to "sick" rather than "feeling"). So, you do not give
                  enough data in your note for us to say whether you are empathic in the "psionic" sense of the word.</p>

                  <p>2) It is possible to be born with psionic talent, to parents lacking such abilities, in theory. In practice, the question is more complicated than that. One of the complications is that there is considerable disagreement over how much psionic ability needs to present in a person before that person
                  is considered "Gifted"/natural/(insert semi-derogatory term of choice here). A goodly number of supposedly not-psionic people have had evidence of some small degree of psionic activity.</p>

                  <p>Concerning your second question, the simplest answer is to do as other folks do who wish to acquire or re-acquire a skill: practice.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I have seen on a certain website that if you try to harm somebody while doing things like telepathy, it won't be allowed by "Higher Intelligence." If this is true, then why do psi vampires exist? And how come psychics can read people's minds and even control their thoughts whether for good or bad?
                  PS, I don't have any intention of harming anybody myself, i'm just curious.</p>

                  <p>The exact quote said this: ** You cannot desire to harm anyone; not "may not", but "cannot." Again you are working with Higher Intelligence, and It will not countenance destructive behaviour toward others. You simply cannot funtion from Alpha in a malicious or evil mode. This sort of thing happens
                  in Beta, not in Alpha, or Theta, and possibly not even in Delta. Proof? Go to level and try to give someone a headache. After visualizing this outcome for a short time, you will automatically come out of Alpha, and most likely with a headache yourself, while the target will be unaffected. **</p>

                  <p>The common claim that psi cannot be done without pure and selfless intent is total horse-pucky. Completely false. The idea that you cannot harbour ill/evil/harmful/malicious thoughts is equally nonsensical. It is bandied about by the White Lights and Fluffy Bunnies crowd, though. They might have
                  any number of reasons for such a bogus claim. Such reasons include:<br />
                  1) an easy excuse if their methods fail to produce results<br />
                  2) convincing people that "evil" folk have no power in the world<br />
                  3) bolstering their philosophical beliefs about balance and justice</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Feeling like you're reliving an experience like that is often a case of deja vu. One of the common explanations for the psychic version of this is the simple expedient of half-forgetting a precognitive dream, then being startled when the scene unfolds in real life.</p>

                  <p>The cats crossing the road at night probably indicates the cats' desire to be on the other side of the street, perhaps in search of mice, or feline companionship. Black is one of the more common coat colours.</p>

                  <p>"Negative energy"? Interesting concept...Energy is the capacity to do work. *shrugs* Making lights blink or fade is fairly common with minor pk, intentional or otherwise.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>As of late I've been expierencing problems with controlling my emotions. I've been prone to go through bouts of anger, minor depression, or I've just simply been annoyed by anyone's pressence other than the pressence of my close friends and my significant other. I studied (though have not
                  practice) Empathy and Telepathy within the past couple of months. My question is this: Is it possible that through studying these materials that my subconscious has learned these skills on it's own, and has taken to implementing them to a degree? If so, could this cause these bouts of
                  mood-swings?</p>

                  <p>Dear Kayne,<br />
                  I first recommend you see a doctor. Depression and severe mood swings are really nothing to play around with. And to answer your question, yes it is possible. Whether it's probable, likely, or true is in the air. Try shielding, if that doesn't work, perhaps that's not the problem. Process of
                  elimination. Again though I'd like to reiterate that depression and severe mood swings are SERIOUS conditions that are not to be reckoned with.<br />
