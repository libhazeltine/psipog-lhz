Now I agree with a lot of what you said, and I am part of the forum (becuase I figured what the hell, maybe it'll be fun) but that statement was a little bit of a generalization, don't you think?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">He is judging all of the members based on the captains.

<br />

<br />
Ah, someone who wants to argue with me. This should be fun. I don't know why you thought that debating me would benefit your statements but it's your choice. Let's get to it, shall we?
<br />

<br />
Over the years of being around the psionic community, I've seen countless members start their own psionic related web site. Do you know how many of those communities are still around? None. You're wasting your time role playing and basically bullshiting themselves. 
<br />

<br />
Starting this website is not going to benefit you nor it's members who you get to join. None of you have the required experience or skill to teach nor give advice on any psionic related ability. How dare you even say that you're qualified to begin teaching/assisting members with psionic related issues. You've been around for how long? Three months? Maybe four? Grow up, you're not ready to help manage your own psionics community.
<br />

<br />
Allow me to show everyone what one of the captains of this new community has stated in the past. These quotes were comments that you've made in the past concerning psionics as well as responsibilities.
<br />

<br />
1) Im too lazy. If anyone wants too, feel free to write them for me Very Happy .
<br />

<br />
2) Hey, Xiouslaidyn, how old are you now. Those voices might be talking about your age and something important happening to you or the world. And if you were trying to OBE, i would stop because the FOCUS FOCUS YES YES YES might be like (dont pick on me for saying this) an evil spirt trying to take over your body when you OBE. That would suck if it was. 
<br />

<br />
3) tastekinesis-taste objects from far away!
<br />

<br />
4) You are all so lucky im here Very Happy !
<br />

<br />
(just ingore &quot;ki&quot; and replace it with &quot;psi&quot;. Its the same thing.)
<br />

<br />
Do those comments look like they come from a mature moderator who has experience when dealing with psionics? No. Actually, those comments are quite humorous. Let's go over some comments that your &quot;leader&quot; has stated during his time here.
<br />

<br />
1) First of all, 2012 is bullshit, second: on the day of slayer, I'm going to fuck up any evil presenses that come my way. Third: Did you guys play Kingdom Hearts of something and then get scared? Because this sounds JUST like kingdom hearts to me, I hope this is real though, because I might get a keyblade.

It seems as if your captain is unable to remote view lost items without the help of other members. Yet, he is qualified enough to give advice on the subject? He didn't even give out coordinates! He has no idea what he is doing. How can someone who does not know anything about remote viewing or it's protocols have the right to teach and give advice to members?
<br />

<br />
Those are only a few reasons why I believe that none of you have the right or capability to start your own psionic related community and teach other members. Obviously your all hypocrites who's goal is to start your own community with the image of the boss. Like I said, you kids need to stop worrying about politics and start working on gaining actual skill.
<br />

<br />
You tell me you have skill, let's see it. Stop by the chat room at anytime and I'll be more than happy to work with you for a little bit. We also have a program that picks up on activity that energy gives off called the Geiger program. You say you have skill, prove it. I'm sick of hearing people bullshit around, show me that you have the ability/experience to be able to instruct other members. Like I said, anytime you wish and I'll be there.
<br />

<br />
I know I'm coming off as mean however, the truth is I'm simply looking out for you all. I don't want to see this group fall and quit like all the other communities started by members who wanted to break away from the community who've helped them and start there own. Take it from me, you will not benefit at all by doing this. 
<br />

<br />
Well, this rant is coming to it's conclusion. Please understand where I'm coming from and how I'm trying to help you. However, I'm going to make this clear right now. If you call me an idiot again, you and I will have a long talk based on respect. If at anytime anyone wishes to debate or discuss your new group, I will gladly participate. 
<br />

<br />
Take care.

			Hey,
<br />
stop freakin argueing like little school childs, we all know when ever someones in and arguement they usually always try to seem like the smartest most experienced person around wel guess what you AREN'T not a single one of you is qualified to diss anyone elses belief. I know personally Frost bitten put alot of time and heart into this and you guys are set to make it look like total fluff and thats just not cool. And I must ask this what makes <span style="text-decoration: underline">your</span> psionic comminities and <span style="text-decoration: underline">your</span> believes any less crazy or stupid or totally unqualified then anyone elses, Nothing! and anyway what would make someone qaulified to let people join their forums or social group anyway.
<br />

<br />
Thank you and good night
<br />

<br />
P.S. I havent been able to sleep lately and im just geting off the caffene problem

			They havent been fighting like school kids. They have been having a dissagreement. When people are in danger of following a path that will lead to no progress and a waste of time, the mods should step in. I respect Sean, Roy, Joe, and all the other moderators. They are watching our backs to provide a secure place to practice psionics. When someone comes along saying that they are making some sort of a militant group that involves Psionics, I would like the mods to step in and give their 2 cents. The first time I heard the TK part of the group were the ones in charge of stopping a meteor coming to Earth, my bullshit detector went off. Leave the moderators alone. I think everyone who insulted Roy on that forum is a coward. What he meant by no skill was very little skill. How would you like to be taught physics by a guy thats taking the same class as you? The mods and Sean are there to help. Once you guys start flaming them for pointless reasons, they may not want to help anymore.

If you think the forums full of little kids that are &quot;dumb&quot; and &quot;inexperienced&quot; then ignore them, although I can see why you were complaining about that thread that's bitching about Roy.
