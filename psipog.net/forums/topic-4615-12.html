			I have another theory.
<br />
Using Einstien's equation E=MC squared
<br />
Maybe your hand is switching into energy like the astral body instead of atoms going through atoms energy is going through atoms which would not hurt but feel a sensation like in astral projection.
<br />

<br />
If your hand temporarily slid over other atoms your cell processes would fail so making a whole in the object or becoming energy seems more plausible

			this one:

<br />
When one phases, one either teleports the subject into another dimension, or another plane of existence.....
<br />

<br />
but as there is a limit to human teleportation, u still get to see ur finger or wadeva u are phasing (the finger, in this case, is at this dimension and plane, at the same time as the other dimension or plane)

			Hey people, I haven't been on in AGES!! If anyone wants advice on phasing.. All I have to say is try and do it.. Jabbing your finger in a door non-stop would actually work lol. In fact, supposedly, driving an infinite number of cars into a wall for an infinite length of time, then it will go through at least once... cool, huh? Ummm.. and yeah.. Phasing is something about being able to break the barrier of electrons or something like that on the surface of the object and passing in between the particles or displacing them.. I doubt it's going into a different dimension or something that extreme.. But hey, I'm only a 15 year old so what do I know about scientific stuff in phasing?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			Don't think so. Phasing comes from using your energy to change the vibration of your body. When you figure your body, you figure it the same way you see yourself, including clothes so when you phase, your phase everything.

			nah man, seems like billbob is talking from experience. *sarcasm*

Theres plenty of people that have phased, and shared there experiences, none have reported flapping in the wind.

			Indeed. There was that guy that would phase while sleepping and lands in between the sofa down the floor, or phase while sitting before he noticed he did it in the first place. I should start taking notes of who does what, I never remember where to look for the info later  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			ever since i was realy young and saw kitty phase in x men i was always realy afraid of it. The way i saw it: if you lose control in pk then you toss some stuff over or whatever. If you lose control in phasing wouldnt you pretty much just phase through the floor and end up miled within the earth? Unless phasing isnt that strong and people only phase for a fraction of a second. I dont have any experience so i wouldnt know. I suppose that subconciously your mind wouldnt allow this to happen seeing as you realy wouldnt want to harm yourself and the brain in general is what controls every single thing in your body ergo this wouldnt realy happen

			That guy in particular was a natural in phasing. He said he couldn't &quot;unphase&quot; in middle something, seems like the density of whatever you are must be lower than your for you to unphase. So no, you couldn't get stuck in a wall or something. I knew another guy who wasn't a natural, he said to phase, you must concentrate like TK, but instead of doing it on the object, do it on yourself. I think it may have something more to it, something he may be doing but don't notice himself since is the only way he knows so is hard to compare. Again, one more to keep notes damn it!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />
