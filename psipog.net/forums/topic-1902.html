			A few days ago I had one of the most amazing experiences that i've had in a while. I was sitting down and my mind was clear, I was just relaxing, I began to see images in the darkness of my closed eyelids (Also no it wasnt the micro organism that live on our eyes, I can tell the difference between those and the images), as if I was doing Remote Viewing unintentionally, which is nothing new since this almost always happens, but what makes it amazing, to me atleast, is what comes next.
<br />

<br />
I kept my mind clear and just observed the pictures, I didn't even give them thought, well time passed by and they got into more detail. During the more detailed vision I could see something, like figures moving in the upper middle of the vision, I kept my mind clear though. After a while the vision got so clear, it was as if I was actually there, it was three blackish birds, large ones, flying. The terrain was a mountain and some grass below, also a stream or river flowing through. It was so vividly detailed and it was like I was viewing this through my eyes, it was not just how we imagine things and can see them in our 'minds eye'. I just observed how beautiful it was, but after some time I snapped out of it, so to speak and the dark closed eyelids returned. I don't know what this was, if it was Remote Viewing, an OBE to the 'Astral Plain' or whatever it can be... One thing for sure, I want to have another experience like it.
<br />

<br />
What do you guys think it was?

			Could it have been hypnagogic imagery to the extreme?  Mabye. Either that or OBE. I would say that isn't RV. 
<br />

<br />
  Time to begin singulating...Hmm, hynagogic imagery and OBE combined might equal AP.
<br />

<br />
  It could have been AP.

			Well I was sort of following the birds from near right behind them, if I was in control of my body I didnt use it much at all. Just seemed to automatically be following them. I mentioned the &quot;astral plain&quot; since it seems to be a reoccuring subject in the DP forum.

			In that case I would say that it would be part OBE and part dream. It is possible. Of course, you could have woken up in it.

			hmm i think i got something like that or it was dream to me because i dont realy remember because sometimes i sleep while meditation <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> but here the story . 
<br />

<br />
i was meditating and i got my mind cleared from all thoughts then i start to see things and some thoughts start to come to me then i saw big white house and it was very nice house alot of flowers and grasses then i saw something strange about small area of grasses move strangly not as air moving it so i zoomed to it to see what is between them and make them move like that so instead of seeing that creature i saw through his eyes and i saw that its body so close to the earth so it seems like rate then that rate go under the house from hole near the house . 
<br />

<br />
untill now i dont know if it was RV or it was dream that i slept while meditation <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .
<br />
 
<br />
but it was look like real not dream.

			This sounds a lot like a dream to me. I sometimes feel as if though I actually felt what happened to me in my dream if I wake up quickly enough. What time of the day was it? Were you tired? More details please.

			Oh my apoligies, I forgot to note those specifics, I could of sworn I had a while ago, anyways let me do it now.
<br />

<br />
It was in mid-day, sun still out and the power was out, believe it was around 4pm. I wasn't tired, I was very relaxed though, I was sitting up right too, not laying down. I was sitting there for a while and I dont believe I was sleeping for little to no time elapsed during that event, atleast to my knowledge it didnt, this happened a bit back, though to the best of my recollection I remember specifically knowing little to no time elapsed, indeed not long enough for a dream to play out. Now then I was all up to the idea it was a dream but I know for sure I was awake when the images weren't in great detail, it slowly got more and more clear then became that awe invoking scene. I have never had dreams that built up as my eyes were closed, the images I saw all of a sudden being the dreams I dream for that night.
<br />

<br />
I do know of dreams that feel as if your there, you can even feel sensations, I do have dreams like that, many times when im coherent (remember) my dreams I can feel whats going on, its like a lucid dream but im not aware its a dream or cant grasp it fully to take control as i've done a very few amount of times.

			heh, this reminds me of those dreams that people have where they're walking or whatever and fall only to find themselves trying to get a footing while sitting down perfectly fine. Those are usually pretty vivid when they happen to me. What makes you so sure it's not just one of those deals?

			Fact of the matter is i'm not sure either way and the only way to be sure is to try to recreate this event over and over running different tests. Such as keeping a clock timed and being coherent of it throughout, see if the pattern is the same throughout all of them, all of those likes.
<br />

<br />
Though if I did know for certain what it was I wouldnt of asked people for their thoughts, though like I said to me I think its not due to that factor, but i'm no expert in this field so i'm not saying i'm correct, merely being candid.

			The funny thing is that I think that it might have been all three! This is because all three of them have something to do with this. You could have been seeing something that was someone elses memory, you could have beed Out of Body, and it might have been an astral plain. I mostly think that this was an OBE which even then sounds kind of weird. All I can say that you had one, freakishly weird experience. And Danielh? Check this site out. It is hilarious!:  <a href="http://chucknorrisfacts.com/" target="_blank">http://chucknorrisfacts.com/</a> But as I look on the site, I see that you have already been there, danielh! Is'nt this the greatest?
