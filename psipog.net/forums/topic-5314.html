			Hi there,
<br />
so about me:
<br />
Well, i'm fairly new to this...I was into telekinesis for a while about six months ago, but then got extremely busy with school and eventually forgot about it.  I got back into it a few days ago.  Before i &quot;quit&quot; six months ago, i got fairly good with the psi wheel, so of course starting back up that was the first thing i did.  My first day with it was awsome, i could move it every which way, clockwise, counter clockwise, start it, stop it.  I think i did it so well because i had done it before and was really confident.  That was yesterday.  Today, i tried it again and had alot less control over it...i think its because i started doubting myself yesterday thinkign things like &quot;Well, what if its just the heat from my hands and i cant really do this&quot;...so im currently trying to overcome that mental block.
<br />

<br />
I've also been trying psi balls a little...im not really sure if i've made one or not...i can feel tingling in my hands and somtimes some heat when i try, but i've never felt resistance or attraction between my hands.  I also question myself alot when doign that saying &quot;Maybe my hands are just tingling because im holding them in this position a long time&quot;...another mental block i need to overcome.
<br />

<br />
A third thing im tryign is spoon bending...i've tried adding energy into the spoon and i've felt tingling in my thumb and forefinger, but i've never been able to soften it at all...i've only been trying for one day though, and i know it takes time...also, i've using really thick silverware (my moms good silverware), so maybe if i can find some old spoon thats thinner or try a plastic one or something...im not really sure where im gunna go with that.
<br />

<br />
Another thing i should point out is a serious problem i have with visualization.  When I try to make a psiball of course i try to visualize the energy flow, but i have trouble visualizing.  I try to visualize it goign down my arm or w/e and i either can only imagine it going very fast, or i imagine it going slow for like a second or two then i find myself get distracted or I start thinking about other things...i find my best success so far comes when i visualize it going very fast, but in large amounts...like watching a river flow.
<br />

<br />
Oh, one more thing, I am a very active lucid dreamer...i've probably had around 50 in my life...I cant do them &quot;At Will&quot;, but if i really want to have one i probably could within a week...i find them lots of fun.
<br />
If anyone is trying to lucid dream, i know alot about them and alot of differant methods you could try so ask me about it <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
sorry that was so long
<br />
thanks for reading if you made it to the bottom <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			welcome to the 'pog adg12012, glad that you found it.  it seems that belief is a major problem for you.  just think to yourself:  &quot;it is real.  it is possible.  i am doing it.&quot;  just think that.  you will start to believe sooner or later (hopefully sooner).  also, you are trying to analyze things too much, especially when creating a psiball.  if it helps, meditate or trance out a little bit so you can collect your thoughts and focus them towards belief and visualization.  if nothing else, it will come to you.  the members here will be glad to help, and some of them (including myself) have been practicing for years.  just remember to check out the articles and FAQ's on the mainsite first when you have a question, then the stickies.  we all get very annoyed with answering questions that have been answered in the articles, FAQ's, and stickies.  again, welcome to psipog, enjoy your stay!

its not really that i dont believe it, i mean sitting right here and reading all these threads i could never be more sure it's real, its just the way my mind works is very orderly.  I feel like i have to know why something is happening or it will bother me, and i do doubt myself alot.
<br />
I have no idea how to enter a trance...i've never even meditated, i dont know how to do that either
<br />
I'll read some articles on it i suppose
<br />

<br />
another thing i should point out is that no one knows i practice this kind of stuff...i dont want my family thinking im weird or sending me to a shrink or somthing...i plan to tell them eventually, but i want to get somewhat skilled with it before i tell them so i can give them a demonstration and proove it.
<br />

<br />
So it would be a tad aquward if my mom walked in my room and i was sitting on my bed in a trance <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

yeah, there are some articles on meditation that should help you out, i recomend checking them out.  if you want to deal with PK, i suggest that you try not to analyze how it will work.  only because you will be too busy trying to figure it out, and you won't be focusing on moving the object.

well, meditation isn't only used for psionics.  it is used in martial arts, buhdism, and a lot more things that can't be listed (it would take too much time).  if your mom walks in on you on a trance, it's not like you won't know.  you will still be able to hear her coming (depending on how well your hearing is) and you can snap out of it.  and if you didn't hear her, you can explain that you meditate to calm yourself down, you like the feeling, or something along those lines.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
