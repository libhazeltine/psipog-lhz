Nerves are delicate and complicatedly connected. You can't just rip them apart and put them together again, stop lying.

Just because someone speaks immaturely to you, that doesn't mean do it to them. (2 wrongs thing, I'm sure you understand already). And I might've been a<span style="font-style: italic"> little </span>hard on him, but I don't apologize for saying it. I don't think what he did was possible with the results he said he got. I think he's lying or greatly exaggerating his experience. So,<span style="font-weight: bold"> no</span>, Niushirra I don't think he could've put his hand in boiling water and come out with no burns/blisters, whatever. Whether you're nerves can feel it or not, you will be injured.(As I've said already).  
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">So if his nerves were disconnected at the time, by your reasoning, Niushirra, he could've put a blow torch to his hand and not recieved any injury. If he can't &quot;feel&quot; it, no injury? Sorry, I don't think that's how it works.</span>
<br />
I'm not sure if it's a fair comparison, but what about when dentists/doctors freeze your lips or another body part. Your nerves don't &quot;feel&quot; anything, yet if you bite your lips, or do anything that you would usually get injured doing, you will recieve that injury nontheless. Pain or not. I've thought about what you said and stand by my post.

			I didn't say anything about injury derrick! I was just talking about blisters since that's the only thing you mentioned. Of course his cells would start dying after a while but that's something completely different. I think bladey was right about your reading capability.

You're saying because he couldn't feel it, there would be no response. Response=blisters. Blisters=injury. My reading ability is fine. Please don't try to manipulate past words in order to make a point.
<br />

<br />
P.S How is using the blow torch for injury &quot;completely different&quot; than boiling water? Just because it is a more serious type? With your theory that I highlighted for you, the same should apply for any injury involving the nerves. You have conflicting points and do not want to admit it, which is fine, so I'm done.

			A response is different from an injury. You really can't read. The blowtorch kills cells and causes a change in the body directly. A dip in boiling water should cause the body to change the body itself. Indirect and direct change. One takes nerves.

Ok, i would just like to say, i meant rewired as in fixed, not like &quot;This wire goes here, i need to weld this one&quot; but more like i fixed it. Somebody did something to him to mess up his nerves, so i simply fixed them.
<br />

<br />
AND he didnt say if it was blistered/burned or not. I dont know.

Im not trying to say i want to start this fight again, im just explaining it. I would contact the person and ask  them to talk to you, but he isnt on right now.

			It doesn't matter. Nobody can prove or disprove that he actually rewired someone nerves. However, I find that to be unsafe.
<br />

<br />
I don't think he even said anything about how long the kid's hand was in the water. I could put my hand in boiling water without injury for a specific time(probably under a second though).

Regardless, It's ignorant to assume that one rewired another's nerve system without any hard facts that one did so.

			Ha ha ha, it's just so much fun to watch tons of people argue. 
<br />

<br />
Anyways, I can confidently say Psi_ninja, that your friend lied to you. I am assuming that your friend is your age. And at your age, many children lie to make themselves look better or cooler than they actually are. I'm sure you are aware of this fact. 
<br />
And then, boiling water can almost be opinionated, or stated wrong to say the least. Sometimes it can actually be used as an expression. &quot;Whoa, that water is boiling hot!&quot; But in reality, the water is only 94 degrees celcius, witch isn't boiling yet! 
<br />
Maybe the water was just steaming, and not actually bubbling. 
<br />

<br />
It all stands in the fact that your friend was either lieing, or was just not knowing.

&quot;The perception of pain occurs when the nociceptors are stimulated and transmit signals through sensory neurons in the spinal cord. These neurons release glutamate, a major exicitory neurotransmitter that relays signals from one neuron to another. The signals are sent to the thalamus, in which pain perception occurs. From the thalamus, the signal travels to the somatosensory cortex in the cerebrum, where the pain is localised, and the individual becomes fully aware of the pain.&quot;
<br />

<br />
(This is our current understanding of how it works. He said he felt no pain, that's why I'm putting this. It also means the injury happens before the pain is present)
<br />

<br />
&quot;Despite its unpleasantness, pain is an important part of the existence of humans and other animals; in fact, it is <span style="font-weight: bold">vital to survival</span>. Pain encourages an organism to disengage from the noxious stimulus associated with the pain. Preliminary pain can serve to indicate that an <span style="font-weight: bold">injury</span> is imminent, such as the ache from a soon-to-be-broken bone. Pain may also promote the healing process, since most organisms will protect an injured region in order to avoid further pain. People born with <span style="font-weight: bold">congenital insensitivity</span> to pain usually have short life spans, and suffer numerous ailments such as broken bones, bed sores, and chronic infection.
<br />

<br />
(Do you know why it is vital for survival and people with congenital insensitivity have short lifespans? Here I'll tell you.)
<br />

<br />
&quot;Congenital insensitivity to pain (or congenital analgia) is a rare condition where a child cannot <span style="font-weight: bold">feel</span> (and has never felt) physical pain. Cognition and sensation is otherwise normal, for instance they can still feel discriminative touch (though not always temperature), and there is no detectable physical abnormality.
<br />

<br />
These children often suffer oral cavity damage (such as having bitten off the tip of their tongue) or fractures to bones. <span style="font-weight: bold">Unnoticed</span> infections, and corneal damage due to foreign objects in the eye are also seen.
<br />
In some people with this disease, there may be slight mental retardation, as well as an impaired corneal reflex.&quot;

<br />
(Do you know why they suffer from these <span style="font-weight: bold">injuries</span>? Because they can't <span style="font-weight: bold">feel</span> the pain. Feeling the pain or not, having the nerves sense it or not, putting your hand in boiling water will injure you. &quot;Indirect&quot; or &quot;direct change&quot;(quote-Niushirra) or not. Try arguing with Wikipedia Biatch.)

&quot;We all know about pain, or at least we think we do. Things that damage our bodies cause pain. We learn to avoid pain because the experience is nasty, and in the process we learn to avoid stimuli which might damage us. The more the damage, the greater the pain, and the more we avoid it. Put simply like that, pain is obviously beneficial, in that it teaches us to avoid <span style="font-weight: bold">damage</span>, even though the experience of it is unpleasant.
<br />

<br />
In fact pain is really very poorly understood, in spite of years of study. We do not even know very much about how nerve fibres detect pain. Do the nerve endings react directly to pain, or is it that damage releases something from other cells, which then stimulates the nerve fibres? And how can pain be so variable? Is this something happening &quot;in the mind&quot; or are there processes happening out at the periphery, at the level of the nerve terminals, which might explain the variability of pain?
<br />

<br />
These are the questions that my lab in Cambridge is trying to answer. We abandoned the idea of studying pain in intact animals and went instead for the simpler situation of isolated <span style="font-weight: bold">nerve cells </span>cultured in a dish. We have found that they respond in many ways like pain-sensitive nerves in a real animal. For instance, we found that the temperature at which these isolated pain-sensitive nerves respond to <span style="font-weight: bold">heat</span> is very similar to the temperature at which a human subject reports that the sensation from a warmed object changes from a pleasant feeling of warmth to a sensation of <span style="font-weight: bold">painful heat</span>. (Hmm I wonder if boiling water would be considered painful heat  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> ) We found out something about the way in which heat actually stimulates the nerve endings - it is a direct process, caused by sodium ions flowing in through the membrane of the cell. So the actual response to heat is intrinsic to the nerve fibre itself, and does need any factors which might be released from nearby cells damaged by the hot stimulus. 
<br />

<br />
But the isolated nerve fibres did differ in an interesting way from their counterparts in an intact animal. If a hot stimulus is repeatedly applied to skin the sensation of pain gets worse and worse, as we all know, while our isolated nerves in culture always responded with a signal of the same size. This told us that the process of sensitization, by which the feeling of pain increases with time, is not intrinsic to the nerve fibres, but instead depends on factors released from other nearby cells which in an intact animal are <span style="font-weight: bold">damaged</span> by the painful stimulus. Nearby cells are, of course, not present in a culture of isolated nerve cells. We identified one of these factors as a protein fragment called bradykinin, which was already known to be present in elevated concentrations in damaged or inflamed tissue.&quot;

Niushirra, pain, sense, feeling, or any other stimulus that tells us about pain, will not prevent a &quot;<span style="font-weight: bold">response</span>&quot; of the body from happening. How about backing this,=&gt; &quot;I thought blisters were a bodily response of swelling based on the body sensing to much heat? Oh yeah, that's right, they are. Wouldn't that mean that <span style="font-weight: bold">since his nerves were rewired that the response to the heat couldn't happen</span>?&quot;, up with some facts. No? didn't think so. Debate over.

Please no comments on my rudness. All directed towards Niushirra (because of his ignorance) and noone else.

If you stick your hand in boiling water for a second or two enough to cause pain and a blister, there is no direct substantial damage to the body. Find a wiki article against that. I dare you.

Also the damage would not be substantial.

No shit moron. Ofcourse if it's only in for a second or two. Wow you're really stuck on this blister thing. You might not even get a blister. Anyone can jab their finger in boiling water for a second and have nothing happen to them. There's nothing special about that. That's not my point. The point of his post was to show he can have his hand in boiling water without any affects. Meaning, for it to be anything special, it had to be in the water for more than a couple seconds. I backed up my points. You still failed to back up the one, your main one, I asked you to. The one that's your own theory with no proof behind it. I'm done talking to you. I gave more than enough evidence and it's obvious there's nothing else I can tell you to admit you were wrong. Talking to a wall is useless. Consider me done with this thread.

P.S Don't you think he'd get more than just blisters from having his hand in boiling water?
