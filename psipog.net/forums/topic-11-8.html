			I think there are lots of types of -kinesis'. I just came to add this in because a forum was locked..  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />   I found this list of kinesis' before and it was really interesting and I've been trying some:
<br />
Karyokinesis... Supposedly a way to divide and replicate cells.
<br />
Aerokinesis... Wind control
<br />
Atmokinesis... Affecting weather
<br />
Audiokinesis, Soniokinesis... Mentally controlling sound waves
<br />
Biokinesis, Vitakinesis... Mentally altering biology (healing or DNA?)
<br />
Chlorokinesis, Xylokinesis, Agrokinesis... Affect growth of plants
<br />
Chronokinesis... Affect the [flow of time] or [perception of time]
<br />
Cryokinesis... Slowing down molecules oor something to make or manipulate ice?
<br />
Electrokinesis... Electricity of course
<br />
Geokinesis, Terrakinesis... Affecting earth
<br />
Gravitakinesis, Gyrokinesis... Affecting gravitrons or gravitational field
<br />
Hydrokinesis... Water
<br />
Lygokinesis... Ability to manipulate raw energy
<br />
Magnokinesis, Magnetokinesis... Magnetic field
<br />
Photokinesis, Lumokinesis... Generate or manipulate photons or light
<br />
Radiokinesis... Mentally manipulate the toxic radiation along the electromagnetic spectrum
<br />
Technokinesis (sometimes called Cyberkinesis, Technopathy or Cyberpathy)... mentally manipulate technology and/or machines
<br />
Telekinesis, Psychokinesis... Duh..
<br />
Thermokinesis... Heat, and only heat
<br />
Pyrokinesis... Manipulate or generate flame by somehow speeding up molecules
<br />
Umbrakinesis... Manipulating shadows
<br />
And so on...
<br />

<br />
Most of these are done with telekinesis, psychokinesis. Some aren't. Such as chronokinesis, where you just manipulate your perception... But it's still interesting... Could be a form of teleportation if you really slow it down a lot... As in almost stopping. I try to keep an open mind...

You dont have to give examples of all these crap terms.  Even though &quot;chronokinesis&quot; is not technically manipulation of matter, it is still a -kinesis term.  As the thread shows &quot;Valid <span style="font-weight: bold">-kinesis</span> terms&quot;.

			A few things here.
<br />

<br />
I've still yet to hear of anyone actually using &quot;chronokinesis&quot; in any form, altering someone's perception of time, or time itself.  I think it's pretty much impossible.
<br />

<br />
If you can prove me wrong, please go a week into the future and give me the headline of the New York Times.
<br />

<br />
And regarding &quot;fuck,&quot; I think the origins of the word is highly disputed among entymologists.  And I don't think any words are vulgar - some may be a little more intense than others, but sometimes you NEED that, dammit!
<br />

<br />
And regarding the plural of &quot;kinesis&quot; - if I'm not mistaken, it should actually be KINESES.  Because Kinesises has wayyy too many S's, and apostraphes are only use for posessive and in regards to letters (see &quot;S's&quot;).
<br />

<br />
And I think numbers.
<br />

<br />
Also, to whever argued about the &quot;slang terms&quot; category... in the south, &quot;y'all&quot; is commonly used just as &quot;telekinesis&quot; is commonly used.  That doesn't make it any less slang.
<br />

<br />
Actually, there are many words in common conversation which are slang.  I just can't think of any at the moment, but they're there.
<br />

<br />
And regarding fluffiness... yeah, it's a real problem.  Like the person who posted a while ago about having a family of witches, talking about &quot;shadowkinesis&quot; or whatever (I'm pretty sure that'd be &quot;umbrakinesis,&quot; though I still tink it's garbage).
<br />

<br />
You have to think scientifically, m'kay?  You cannot alter a shadow without altering the light or the object casting the shadow.  Chances are you CAN bend light (what would THAT be called?) but unlike Pyro- and Cryo-PK, which are speeding up or slowing down the vibrations of atoms, there would be no Umbra-PK, because shadows are the absence of light, and while heat is an energy, light is matter.
<br />

<br />
Yes, you heard me, matter.  Ever hear of photons?  Matter.
<br />

<br />
(Which would technically make it PK anyway, haha.)
<br />

<br />
Just note that I'm not trying to make any new terms - I think, scientifically speaking, you should understand something before naming it.  In THEORY, anything is possible.  In PRACTICE, things are a bit more difficult.
<br />

<br />
So yeah, unless you're writing fiction, you should try to not name something you can't confirm.  I think I'll stick to Sean's list.
<br />

<br />
(Sorry for the rant.)

eh.....most are correct and do-able.....but there are some that are actually derived from other -kineses.... like the technokinesis thing....its actually micro-electrokinesis......

who the heck would waste their time typing electro-psychokinesis when electrokinesis is gramatically correct??

			Tell me where terms like &quot;electrokinesis&quot;, &quot;aquakinesis&quot;, and &quot;geokinesis&quot; are acceptable in the scientific world?  What?  Psionics isn't science?  Well, what do you think paranormal researchers are?  They are scientists who are attempting to discover how the paranormal works.  Here is the definition of science:

<br />

<br />
I see the terms Psychokinesis, Telepathy, Remote Viewing, and those sorts widely accepted.  If you want to sound like you actually know what you are talking about, do the following:
<br />

<br />
1) Type out words and don't over capitalize
<br />

<br />
2) For god sakes, learn how to spell (or at least try)
<br />

<br />
3) It really wont kill you to type out about 4-5 more letters.  You hardly post here at all anyway
<br />

<br />
4) If you don't like the way Psipog is run, leave.  No one is keeping you here.  Those are the rules and you will abide by them while you are in this community (for however long it will be up).
<br />

<br />
Even though I am no longer a moderator here, I still act anal about this.  Respect the rules or leave.

Actually, light isn't matter. Light is a form of energy. From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon" target="_blank" class="postlink">Wikipedia</a>:

<br />
If it has no mass, then it has no matter, since mass is a measurement of the amount of matter in any given object.
<br />

<br />
But then again, since E=MC^2, all matter is energy anyways, so I guess it would be a moot point, wouldn't it?

Exactly. While it may be acceptable to use such gibberish on Yahoo Messenger, it's not acceptable here. This is a message board, not a chat room, you have plenty of time to type out your responses. Use that time to make your post coherent.

I've actually read about people using meditation to speed up or slow down <span style="font-weight: bold">their perception</span> of time. Time didn't change at all, but to them, it <span style="font-weight: bold">seemed</span> like it was going faster/slower. It doesn't sound that difficult, my perception of time changes constantly based on what I'm doing anyways.

			I would like to point out the error in a great deal of supposedly &quot;widely accepted&quot; terms.
<br />
For this let us seperate the words using cryo-pk as an example.
<br />

<br />
Cryopsychokinesis
<br />
Cryo-cold, ice, etc.
<br />
Psycho-mind
<br />
Alternate of psycho is tele-distance
<br />
and kinesis-move, manipulate, etc.
<br />

<br />
So cryopsychokinesis is manipulating cold with you mind from a distance.
<br />
however Cryokinesis, however cool it may sound, is simply refering to a refrigerator.
<br />

<br />
On the subject of cold I would also like to point out that there is no &quot;cold&quot; simply a lack of heat.
