			I was wondering, I can only make it spin well with my hands pretty close, about 3-4 cm away from it. Could it be my heat? I can close my eyes, look away, or think about anything and it still spins. I'm betting this is probably my heat, because I don't think I could be this good after only 2 days. Also, is it supposed to be harder to do it under a container? To verify it wasn't done with my heat, I put a <span style="font-weight: bold">PLASTIC</span> container over it. Nothing moved at all. So this is were I turn my questions to you. Please help?

1. 3-4 cm is definately heat, you need to move much farther away or use a container.
<br />
2. the container does not make it harder, it just appears that way because you haven't actually done pk yet.

			3-4cm might not be heat. I just tried that distance and I'm not convinced it was. There is only one way to test it for someone who can't move the psiwheel under a container, and that is to have really cold hands/room and try it. I have done it just like DerkaDerka has explained before and afterwards I was feeling a little skpetical about and my hands were freezing cold! Try practicing without hands and that doubt will go away, leaving you open to new levels.

Putting a container over it just creates a mental block that makes you think it is harder, when really, it's not. This is because we have been bought up in the physical world and can't get the laws of physics out of our heads. For example, &quot;you can't get past this container and go throught it without moving it&quot; etc. You can do it with pk because it is a universal thing that exists in time and space wherever you want it to. 
<br />
I do find it anoyying though when I can do it over the webcam in AMERICA which is like thousands of miles away, but I can't do it under a friggin container? grrrrrr. <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />

			with a glass container one eliminates statics, but the heat, the luck?. until the phenomenon is but intense (in my case) it is difficult to determine.
<br />
I need more practice...
