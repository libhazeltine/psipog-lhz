			Can someone give me some beginner constructs to expirement with?
<br />

<br />
And when 2 people have psi pets can the other person actually see their opponents?
<br />

<br />
Also can nyou actually see your own psi pet?  If so, how would I go about making one?
<br />

<br />
I cant see any psi at all but would love too.

			To see psi you have to flare it, look at the articles.

			A construct is any psi energy which has a purpose of any type. For example a simple construct could be in the shape of a sphere and it would be programed to have a certain type of feeling to it, like itchyness. Another construct type is a &quot;shield&quot; which is used to block out certain types of stimuli.
<br />

<br />
Basically if you are creative you can figure out a bunch of interesting ideas for simple constructs!
<br />

<br />
Alright, I don't know what you mean exactly about seeing your opponents Psi pets... Generally we don't play &quot;Pokemon&quot; with Psi hehe. And you don't see a construct physically unless it is flared. You Can however, feel them with your mind, if you put up some effort.
<br />

<br />
You have to work on making psi visible or &quot;flared&quot; in order to see it with your eyes. Otherwise you will have to rely on your mind.

			I do not know of anyone who can &quot;see&quot; unflared Psi, other than with their mind. It's the ability to sense energy. Not clairvoyance.

			Well, the way I see psi is kind of weird. I visualize a black space in front of me, and then kind of send out a shockwave, like radar. Whatever i feel is in the way, i can see as a bluish white figure in the null black space. Its kinda like a bat...except im not <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I know it's been a while since I shared much around here, but explaining this &quot;aura vision&quot; could be useful to several people.
<br />

<br />
For the most part, the experienced and &quot;professional&quot; psychics I have spoken with have a fairly well-attuned perception of psionic energy around them.  As far as I know, it has nothing to do with magnetics, except that some traditions work with manipulating or correcting your body's unseen energies with powerful magnets.  In general, the most common &quot;aura viewing&quot; of an individual is based on healing, where the viewer's subconcious breaks down the energy output of an individual into seven &quot;chakras&quot; of colored light that represent the individual's balance and health.
<br />

<br />
As far as answering your question, it depends what you define as &quot;see&quot;.  The majority of the time that I am &quot;looking&quot; at my psipet, I'm just mentally feeling it out to check up on it or direct it.  However, after a while it has a tendency to cause shimmers and flares of light as it builds up energy around itself, which are generally startling if I'm not expecting them, as I &quot;see&quot; them just like anything else around me.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Flaring&quot; is generally defined as creating a visual output that is detectable by the human eye.  A telepathic suggestion can simulate this, so the real question is whether you are actually creating <span style="font-style: italic">light</span>.  However, what really matters is whether you can consistantly &quot;watch&quot; your construct, which is more being aware of its energies.  This awareness of energy, creating a visualization if not necessarily and image for your eyes, is &quot;aura vision&quot; when you can extend this to &quot;looking&quot; at other energy around you.
<br />

<br />
So... yeah.  Nobody's really going to read that, are they?
