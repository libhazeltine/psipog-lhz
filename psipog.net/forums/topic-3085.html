			I have a new concept for me, and I think it works. Instead of connecting my heart to another person's heart to feel what they feel, I connect my third eye to their heart so I see what they feel. I close my eyes, and concentrate on what I see. Last time I tried, I was pretty accurate. Weather or not it was a fluke I don't know yet. Either way, I see colours. I sensed lots of yellow in a person once, which i believe is frustration/intendity. Blue is calm, while aqua is calm/happy. Black is Confusion and dark red is disappointment. I think it works.

I reckon different people would get different colours for different emotions, I reckon they should try it themselves though  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

I'll certainly give it a try sometime soon.

			Perhaps your mind is projecting the representation of a color that represents a certain emotion which your subconscious mind or deep conscious mind views as being the color associated with said emotion.
<br />
The emotions can easily be read correctly by discerning one's body movements and facial expressions, muscle spasms, etc. This is a process which I consider to be basic empathy, since it does require some kind of conscious realization of the subsconscious mind's ability to calculate the basic emotional status of an indivual based on their very subtle body movements. Your interpretation could well end up being a eyesight barrier in certain situations, or just some kind of a block altogether. Body language is a basic course in psycology (which i have not, nor will ever take), and i'm at an empathic point right now, where i rely completely on my subconscious mind to calculate any visible body movement in a person, and partially with facial expressions (difficult to explain, a little barrier of my own to get over) and it's relayed to my conscious mind at a very accurate (though not perfect) level. True empathy, though, is very close to telepathy itself. You feel one's emotion like they are your own. You can guess very closely a person's thoughts themselves during such an experience. This i can also do fairly well (though not perfectly. sometimes my mind will conjure emotions which i initally mistake as someone elses, and evetually can't decide whether or not they were. Or I decide they're mine. this happens rarely though).
<br />

<br />
The mind has countless levels. Countless planes of vibration. And every single one of them are above this physical plane. My opinion. Judge it for yourself.
<br />

<br />
Imagine a door in your mind. This door leads to countless doors, arranged in no particular order, each of which lead to a different level in  your mind. Everyone is a different person, and as such, their subconscious minds operate a bit differently, as well as their conscious minds operate considerably differently. When it comes to most people who get into the things we on psipog have gone into, for instance, all claim to do different things, excel in different things. We have all shared similar, yet different experiences. All of us have had at least some very unique experiences.
<br />

<br />
 All of these doors in one's mind, all lead to the same places. The doors are all the same in everyones mind, arrange in no particular, yet the same, order, in the same countless numbers. But, everyone being different, everyone is going to open different doors in different orders. Maybe a person has an extraordinary mind that knows which doors to open in what order in order to achieve extraordinary results quickly. Maybe a person has a cunning mind that examines each door before opening it, and then peeks inside before deciding whether or not to go inside, hoping to get lucky and open a nice combination of doors.
<br />
Maybe a person starts opening the wrong doors and going inside too quickly, and gets results they aren't ready for, misinterpreting them and allflicting their minds with deficiencies and/or discrepancies which end up affecting their lives. 
<br />

<br />
Then you have to bring one's personal experiences, and their <span style="font-style: italic">interpretation</span> of their experiences, into play. Obviously, surrounding evironment and interaction with it can effect the mind. Does it have to be permanent? No, I think not. but sometimes, in some cases, it ends up being so. The subconscious mind has made it's decision, and the lack of the conscious mind's (personality, ego, etc) ability to communicate with the subconscious results in a permanent alteration of mentality. Then there is the possibility of trauma to the actual physical vessel (the brain or body) which houses the mind, and the mind's reaction to it.
<br />

<br />
 I could pull up a hundred other examples off of the top of my head, but i'm sure you get the point by now. Wow, did i ever go on a rant there. I do not mean to imply that there is no third eye, azsxdc, or that the picture you use in your minds eye is wrong (if there's one (or some) that is completely right, i haven't found it yet). I'm just saying, it might be more than what you think. You might not even need colors (i know i don't, though i'm very happy they exist) to tell a person's emotions or feelings, though that could be a very viable technique. You certainly do not need to close your eyes. I don't need to close my eyes to project a very clear image in my mind's eye, you shouldn't either. That, to me, is like saying you need to plug your ears to hear yourself think. Ludicrous. though, I know with some people, they can see certain things, like minds eye pictures, more clearly when they're eyes are closed. maybe their surrounding are too distracting for them, i dunno. But you don't need to consciously acknowledge your surroundings at all times, anyway. Mulitasking, bro, goes both ways.
<br />

<br />
Consequently, i believe the colors of an &quot;aura&quot; are a reflection of a person's current body temperature/physical state, rather than mental state. However, mental states, such as emotions, can raise or decrease body temperature temporarily, and things such as being lazy and depressed, or being happy and energetic, would certainly cause two such people's &quot;auras&quot; (come on, it's energy fields people. That's the official scientific name). Love releases endorphins, which i'm sure affects the energy field. I believe, personally, that psi can and does affect it as well.
<br />
The energy field is a result of the body's chemical and physical <span style="font-style: italic">and</span>mental processes, not just one of them. The body needs to release used energy, or uneeded energy, in forms other than crapping and peeing. People who can see energy fields (which i believe, again, everyone is capable of doing, it's just a combination of those doors.) merely have, somehow, the capacity to visually perceive the energy emitting from objects and people. Ojects emit very little energy, and it's almost always translucent and not really of a color, just there (for me anyway). i'm guessing the only reason everything, and not just living things, emit energy fields, is that they need to in order to stay as matter. Perhaps the rotation of electrons around an atom, creates a field of energy slightly bigger than the atom itself. One that science has not discovered yet (or maybe they did and just haven't told us about it).
<br />

<br />
These are all just my opinions, and it is my opinion that they are true.

			I've tried this before, actually.
<br />
I do believe that the color interpretation varies from person to person.
<br />
For example, hot pink is usually an indicator of happiness for me.
<br />
Black would be calm.
<br />
Blue would be anxious.
<br />
Red is usually anger.
<br />
etc, etc.
<br />
I think that I basically put what Xiouslaidyn said into layman's terms.

			I await the results eagerly. I still haven't mastered empathy myself. I like to use this to &quot;see&quot; what they are feeling, and then if it's good, &quot;feel&quot; it myself. Here is an example so you know what you are looking for.
<br />
In the top-right half of my vision there was a dark red. This to me indicated a dissappointment of some description. The person wasn't feeling it at the time, but their subconcious was thinking it. Joined in the middle to the dark red was a colour like aqua. This to me indicated happyness and calmness. It appeared that the red and aqua were fighting over the middle. This I feel meant that the emotions inside the person were fighting for control. The rest was black, which indicates emptyness or confusion. Tell me how you go.
<br />
EDIT: It's hard to explain. If you just close your eyes, it's just black. You need to really concentrate. Some colours aren't very clear.
