			I just gave you the <span style="font-weight: bold">definition</span> of it. It's not somewhere you go in your mind, experience, then come back from. That's been explained already also.

&quot;...you rid yourself of these feelings and need for understanding. You rid yourself of really all ideas you hold dear. Like good and evil, morals, and these feelings you described. Your thought process becomes like that of the universe&quot;~Niushirra
<br />

<br />
And you think you've done this? Do you care for ANYTHING in this world?(your house, family, career, relationships, sex, pain, etc) Because if you view these as important (even the lives of your parents) you are not enlightened. Nothing matters. And just knowing this is BARELY a step towards enlightenment. You aren't enlightened (that would be putting yourself on the same level as Buhdda; some peoples God!) and I'm done responding to this thread. Everything needed to be said has been.

			Speaking of writing, im going to be an author. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Im already working on a book, and then i have to do another one for english class, so i might publish that too if it is long and any good.
<br />

<br />
My friend is a AWESOME artist. He can draw like you wouldnt believe. He can actually draw characters from comic books better than the actual comic book artist. So, we are gonna make some comic books and make our own little company and sell the books. Then, hopefully they become really popular and the company can grow. Who knows, if you have a really good idea for a comic book or book, PM it to me and maybe we can make it and give you a cut of the profit.
<br />

<br />
So, thats my plan.

Even if anyone had reaches enlightment around here none of us have the skills to see that enlighten person. You sort of have to be at that level to see others. I once thought that the greatest lenght of mind is one that does not have emotions. But now I find this to be really odd. I find that perhaps a enlightenment need the existence of emotions. Then I found a few quotes from a philophecer I like to share.

Normaly I question some of Aristotle logic, natureal because as I see myself as a astronmor in the future I sort of hate how he said the sun was perfect, the earth had to be the center (he wasnt the one who said we were at the center, some guy with name P in his name did that) and that the sun didnt have sun spots but rather mercury was passing through it. (donest explain why there be more then one spot)

I have done extensive research from all kind of angles examining the same phenomena and I can honestly say there are many souls that have found enlightenment. Yes Nirvana. While it is a difficult and tricky thing to attain, it is very well possible to reach it, even in short periods of time. I'm actually pretty sure I am going to reach it myself in this life-time. I can kind of feel it on a deeper level. Because I studied many paths and many forms of Self-Science in Depth, the path becomes very obvious, concrete and structured. I can now use that clear structure to verify where on the path I am now and what I need to do next. It is not impossible, many, many souls have done it and many are alive in this world right now as well.
<br />

@Psi_Ninja: Goodluck with writing man, I wish you all the inspiration you need to become a perfect writer. I have very recently finished my first ebook. It is nice to write. Goodluck.
