			whoa.....this is a lot to take in and it sounds like it's coming out straight from a sci-fi movie.
<br />

<br />
hmmmmm kinda reminds me of this book i read called a wrinkle in time. it was a good book and if you havent read it you should. (even though it's a book for a younger audience. its a classic kinda like narnia)
<br />

<br />
so you can make your own realm? does this have to do with physics? oh i can't remember which theory; i believe it's quantum mechanics but dont quote me on this, that predicts the existence of other universes or in this case we can call them realms. anyone know about this? 
<br />

<br />
you probably need to be really savy w/ psionics in order to make a realm dont you?

			I've personally never heard of making a realm.  You could divide off a section with security as the etheric residents have done, but not make one from scratch as far as I've discovered.
<br />

<br />
As for the etheric residents, they're supposed to be ascended humans and powerful spirits (angels and other beings), thus it's a realm full of powerful (deity-powerful) people.  Thus the ability to close off such a large section of what is technically the astral from other entities and APing humans.

			ok so you say there are beings, like angels and demons or whatever.
<br />

<br />
i just want this to be clarified. what do you mean by angels and demons? do you mean kind of straight out the bible or what? since i dont affiliate with a religion i dont necessarily believe in that stuff. so could you say they are ascended humans who happen to either be good or bad and have no link with a particular deity?

			The seperate planes are not different worlds as people misinterpret them. They are merely different layers of the same world. It's like 3D glasses. The astral stuff has always been here in the one universe, but then you put on 3D glasses (Astral Project) and you see all the Astral stuff that's been there the whole time
<br />

<br />
Spilling over can merely be astral stuff becoming briefly visible to the third eye without the middle man of astral projection.
<br />

<br />
As for the matter of making your own realms, I'm sure it's quite possible, and you probably don't have to be as powerful as people are implying. It might be as simple as willing it to be so while in the Astral Plane, causing a sort of Big Bang (or whatever) to take place.

			AP is the only part of psionics not scientificly proven...
<br />

<br />

<br />
I dont belive in it for one though in no way do I mean or imply that anyone who has done it its just claiming to... I belive them. Though I dont realy think its any &quot;astral projection&quot; Its an out of body experience (in my minds opinion) that just isnt in the usual etheric &quot;plane&quot;. Is it a difrent realm to me? It cvant be if it is our world... a diffrent plane might be more posible... but to me its the same realm, and most likely the same plane. Just maybe since things arent physical, at leat not in the same sence as us we breifly interact... or dont interact at all becuase what ere made of isnt on our the same level/frequency.
<br />

<br />
Also I dont realy find it easy to belive the form of AP that is still in our reality/realm/plane but just hundreds of solar sytems and posibly galexies and universes away from earth. Thats just to far for someone to reach with only one lifetime of practice with that ability.
<br />

<br />

<br />
QUESTION: Has anyone had an OBE to the 'Etheric' AND 'Astral Projected' to an 'Astral plane'...
<br />
