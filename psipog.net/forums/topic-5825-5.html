			fighting is bad, why dose everyone have to fight.
<br />

<br />
just post your opinion and back it up so people can understand, instead of rejecting everything without proper backup information.
<br />

<br />
if your going to flame other people personaly instead of providing a resonable agument, just pm the person. I dont think everyone else wants to hear the verbal sh*t that comes out of some people.

keep it mature <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

i use those only in formal stuff, like applications and exams..... not online..... 
<br />

<br />
going online is a form o relaxation..... but this is the MOST restricting forum ive ever been in..... 
<br />

<br />
most other forums understand shorthand, and use it like everything..... but i dunno why this forum is soooo special.... (i'm trying soooo extremly very hard to keep this grammatically correct, so dont sue me)

			In response to two earlier posters that mentioned that:
<br />

<br />
a) Putting a psiball in your face is like shoving a fist up your nose 
<br />

<br />
and 
<br />

<br />
b) it depends on the intention, on the person, how they perceive psi as, etc.
<br />

<br />
I'd like to throw in my theory that mixes those two up...sure, you can probably damage yourself with psi, but I'm willing to bet that it wouldn't be major damage...most people tend to 'pull back', so to speak. Try punching yourself hard enough to give yourself a nosebleed - I don't think it's a very easy thing to do. Hard enough to bruise, to hurt? I'm pretty sure most could do that.
<br />

<br />
Then again, your hand is something that's been with you for XXX years that you've been alive, and you know how hard you can hit, etc, etc. So it's possible that a newbie could accidentally charge up a psiball way too high and zap himself <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I'd also like to suggest that one takes into account the person's mental state of mind when making the psiball - someone who's just had a very bad day would probably damage him/herself a lot more than someone who had just got...uhh....an average mark of 100%? <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Just throwing in some ideas to the pot. Feel free to comment, etc, etc.
