Psions pick up on psychic energy more than the average person... so yes, we are more vulnerable - especially if we don't know what's going on or what we're doing.  I've always been aware of psi and etc. but had to go through some crap.  if you're aware, you can defend yourself - if you're not aware, you don't perceive anything as a threat.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />
Scary, but... I think I've never met a psion in my life, so far. Just wondering... Do you need to do psiballs to make shields? Because psiball is the basic construct, and shields are constructs, too, right? If things are this way, I want to start learning shielding first.

Its best to master the basics, if you can't make a good psi ball, chances are your sheild may not be good either. But no one is stopping you, you can still learn shielding first, but if this is completly new to you and you can't exactly feel pison energy yet its best to try the psiball first. Read the articles for more information. I see myself as a beinginer but I think my words are useful in some way.

			Ethics with psionics are the same as ethics without them. Don't do anything with telepathy/empathy that you wouldn't do with other means.
<br />
As far as suggestion goes, I think it's probably a good idea to refrain from it altogether, because it can easily become a power issue. But, if you're in a volatile situation that could quickly result in violence, I think it would be justified to telepathically suggest that everyone calms down. Suggestion for personal gain is probably not in the best taste.
<br />
This is gonna be kinda of cliched, but if you've ever played Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, you know there's a Dominate Mind force ability with which you can manipulate peoples' minds. Usually, the only time you can use that ability and get away without dark side points it is if you're trying to avoid a fight or save someone. The same should be taken to telepathic suggestion. Don't do it unless it's necessary.

Another post of sheer brilliance by Peebs. I see TPS as innately immoral, simply because it's manipulating another human being. If it's immoral to manipulate people normally, what makes you think it's OK to do it psychically?
<br />

<br />
I mean, it's fine doing simple stuff like making someone look over at you, but anything beyond that kind of scale is just manipulative.

			Exactly. I'll state again, anything that would be immoral without psionics would be immoral with psionics. A knowledge of psionics doesn't change what's right and wrong, it just lets you do right or wrong in different ways.
<br />
People should never be made to do something they would not normally do, suggestion or no. As Sgt_Psion said, anything beyond making someone look over at you is most likely in dangerous territory, unless you're in a situation where lives are at stake, and even then it would be wise to consider possible repercussions before you do anything hasty.

			Also, after reading a few other posts... There is a standard that we hold but most people do not speak of because we take it for granted. The sanctity of the mind is something that should never be violated. My mind is my fortress, my own world, where no one else has a place unless I give it to them. For someone to come into my mind, whether they seek information or wish to implant instructions within it, is like coming into my home, but on a much more personal and violating level. For someone to be able to read your innermost thoughts or to cause me to do something that I would not normally do is atrocious just to think about. TPS can be compared to mental rape on some levels, because you are forcing something on someone that they do not want, with them having no method to defend themselves.
<br />
With situations where people are about to make a decision that could harm them, such as taking drugs, there are other ways to stop them from making that decision that avoid violating that sanctity of their mind. If you are not safe within your mind, where are you safe? Let's keep the mind a haven for all people, both psions and non. There are certain zones that people were never meant to explore, and the minds of others are an instance of those zones. Never violate a person to that extent unless there is a life in immediate danger and there is no other way, for they will almost certainly never forgive you if they find out.

			Now you bring regular telepathic communication into the question, and thus increase the grey zone. 
<br />

<br />
I see telepathy as a form of E-mail (or &quot;P-mail&quot;, if that floats your boat). You can send a message for communication purposes, and you can revieve messages. But you really shouldn't try to hack someone's e-mail. If they give you the password and hence let you in, then they should be able to deal with what you do. Same goes for the mind. If they let you in, then you're fairly safe.
