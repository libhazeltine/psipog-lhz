			I am still not sure what the vibrations for OBE are. Early this morning my mom came into my room and woke me up to tell me to put another coat of paint on the ceiling in a room i was painting. <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />  Well after she left I decided that since I was already halfway awake and knew that I would be falling asleep again that I would try to have an OBE. I was laying on my bed when I felt my body go a lil numb. I then felt some strong vibrations go through my body. Now my question is are the vibrations supposed to be strong or are they small weaker type of vibrations?

			Strong, weak, whatever happens to you is how it is supposed to be.  Honestly, I think most of the time they are really strong.  Does that help?

			Vibrations differ for everyone. But if it feels just like a slight tingle somewhere in your body...thats not vibrations. People ask this all the time and the true answer to it is...you'll know when you get them. You really will. Its a very different feeling.

			They can be strong or weak, but I'm fairly sure people agree on they usually feel like electricity, like you're being fried alive. I know thats what it felt like for me, minus the pain, it just felt really odd. Like Reykia said, there is no doubt in your mind once you get them.
