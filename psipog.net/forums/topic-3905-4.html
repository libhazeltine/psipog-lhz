			&quot;I don't need to make a video to know that lighting matches and watching them go out is not paranormal.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Why don't you try it out for yourself? Or does mommy not let you play with matches?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Well, it's good to know you don't need to make a video to know that lighting matches and watching them go out is not paranormal. But that's not the point. The point is to show you lit matches in his room where it took place in order to prove him wrong, not prove him wrong that it can't happen in your room.
<br />

<br />
I would, but I don't have the conditions to do so. I don't need anyone to let me play around with matches, because my balls have dropped so I know better than to play around with matches.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Nope, they are the absolutely the same.&quot;
<br />

<br />
No, they are not absolutely the same. You do not live anywhere near where he is, and you know nothing about his location and geography. They are not absolutely the same. If you lived near him, some characteristics might be similar, but it is not anywhere near word-for-word the same.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Matches go out if lit and held just as maxus held them. There is nothing paranormal involved. You are just being retarded.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Again, you never tested with him or when <span style="font-style: italic">he</span> did it, so how would you know if anything paranormal was involved? You did not have any equipment to detect anything paranormal in nature. So neither you or I can determine if there were paranormal activities going on in his room at that time.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I don't need to. Your just being stupid.&quot;
<br />
No, I'm not being stupid, I'm being specific.
<br />

<br />
&quot;That wouldn't have anything to do with anything. You are insane if you seriously think so.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Hmm. Well, I guess I am insane. Along with the 1,310,000 plus articles on HOW ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AFFECT FIRE found in none other than Google. You do realize atmospheric pressure causes drafts, right? And sea level does influence fire, more importantly sea level pressure. This in turn  influences wind and in regards to sea level, a wind's speed is directly related to how closely pressure contours (isobars) are to each other. The closer the isobars are, increases the pressure gradient and results in stronger wind. Thus, atmospheric pressure combined with sea level pressure can influence fire. That too was in an article I found through Google.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Nope you don't have proof.&quot;
<br />

<br />
That was referring to the fact that you confirmed you knew stuff that could turn us white and such. I'll get to this in a moment.
<br />

<br />
&quot;All I, you, or anyone needs to do is lite just one match or 2 and see I am correct.&quot;
<br />

<br />
That would be true if there were no paranormal activities influencing the flames. If not, then yes, I'm sure most of us would recieve the same result as you. But if paranormal variables influence the match, then no, you aren't correct.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Well you could, but that's because you are a dumb troll who can't think or try something for yourself, you would rather live in delusion.&quot;
<br />

<br />
You're right; I could. I would actually rather live in a world where people would read and comprehend posts.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Besides, I'm God.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Wishful thinking.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I did test it in accurate conditions. You are fucking ludicrous.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
No, I am not fucking ludicrous. Let me repeat myself again; You lit matches in YOUR house. The video was about maxus' lighting matches in HIS room. So, to prove there were no paranormal phenomena in his room, you need to light matches in HIS room, not YOUR room. You're prooving there's no paranormal happenings in YOUR room. Plus you're missing a critical element; Maxus to perform pyrokinesis. So up to this point, you've lit matches in YOUR house without ANYONE performing pyrokinesis on a match. All you've proven is that matches go out normally when no one is performing pyrokinesis. But you haven't had someone use pyrokinesis on a match and observe for yourself. You've lit a match and watched it die out with no attempts of paranormal phenomena to influence your match. So no, you have not tested in accurate conditions.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I don't need to. I'm not making any claim towards paranormal phenomena here.&quot;
<br />

<br />
So then you don't know anything that could turn us white and make us want to quit this magic stuff?
<br />

<br />
&quot;I don't need to validate anything. Someone in that instance had asked what I had personally seen, they did not expect to be shown concrete evidence, nor was I interested in giving an anecdotal account of events transpired.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I'm talking about your reply &quot;Pretty much&quot; to a claim that you knew things that could turn us white and make us want to quit this magic stuff. Is this not true?

			keif obviously has some mental condition. i dont  care what i just know he has atleast one. he states things that are irrelevant and have no actual knowledge based towards them, he hasnt actually had all the conditions as EVERY little thing would affect this. mainly the  TEMPERATURE of the house, the room pressure, the brand as brands use different chemicals, the striking, the air content every little damn thing can affect it and if every possible thing isnt done to match the same conditions keif can never do a valid test to disprove this.
<br />

<br />
also he claims to know things paranormal yet does not say anything paranormal and that this is not paranormal even though the paranormal is the unknown, the strange, the actual normal, what happens in nature, nothing really is paranormal if its happening and has been happening as to its nature it is, it is only foreign to our nature as we do not know of it and do not understand it.
<br />

<br />
keif is simply thinking up random explanations for these things because he wants to be superior and think that nothing is unknown and that what he states must be what it is. merely using the simplest thing he can think of that could be the cause but he warps this could be into a it is.
<br />

<br />
i deal with people like this every day.
<br />

<br />
anyway now that im finished with him (i had to) the most ive done is raise the temperature of a thermometer by 3 degrees fahernheit and have raised ice cream temperature as it got softer.

			i completely agree, Kief still hasnt presented evidence passed 'Tk cant exist because it hasnt been proven', and i would still like to see what would 'scare the shit out of me', as mentioned by Kief. It would seem as if hes disappeared, but im sure hes just lurking in the shadows, waiting for the perfect time to strike.

			you know.. so far kief is the best &quot;skeptic&quot; that i've ever encountered.. no matter how much people here try to persuade him he always has something to answer back and never backs down..  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  anyways, kief i salute you for that..  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> you're very good, i gotta hand it to you..  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  it's been fun reading this argument about people's views, opinions, and etc on what's real or not..  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			I do not agree, he is in my opinion, the worst skeptic on <a href="http://www.psipogbb.net." target="_blank">www.psipogbb.net.</a> When presented evidence towards paranormal claims, Kief avoids tackling the issue, and starts blurting out words he doesnt know the meaning of. He laughs in the faces of psions, when we show evidence to support our claims, Kief shows absolutely fuck all evidence to show for his, he completely avoids the evidence, and still claims that 'he is right, and everyone else is wrong'. He focusses on the spelling errors, punctuation, and name calling, I.E.
<br />

<br />
maxus: Kief, you have overlooked the evidence and avoided it.
<br />
Kief: maxus, why do you start the sentence by saying my name.
<br />
maxus: If youre sure youre not an asshole, why dont you check out the videos, there are too many for them to be false.
<br />
Kief:Hahaha, you call me an asshole, what are you, 14? you dont know shit about anything, run along, you have been owned.
<br />

<br />
See what i mean?
<br />

<br />
Oh, and by the way Kief, im STILL waiting for a reply for my offer.

ummm... I was practicing pyrokinesis with a match just yesterday, trying to make it go out. I held it at a 90 degree angle and it burnt all the way down if I didn't use pyrokinesis. If I did use pyrokinesis, the flame got about halfway down the match and then died down. I don't see why it would be burning just fine and then die down as soon as I used pyrokinesis.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

Unfortunately he?s not a good skeptic but in fact one of the worst around, although highly motivated (which is what I think impresses you). A good skeptic pursues to gain knowledge and sets his perspective accordingly to unbiased once he steps on territory unknown to him, a bad skeptic merely puts energy into keeping his reality model set in stone (which we all know was throughout the course of history a very realiable way of gaining information).  I?m still not sure why he puts such an effort into finding ways how to -not- perform PK since I think 100% of the world population already know how to do it unsuccessfully, but none the less his findings can be very helpful when starting out with PK to get a sense at which point you are actually performing it, especially when it comes to easily &quot;distracted&quot; objects such as tinfoil psiwheels.

			Okay, I just tested this myself not more then five minutes ago.
<br />

<br />
A match struck and then held immediately upright, extinguished on its own almost instantly.
<br />

<br />
A match struck and held at an angle for a few moments and <span style="font-weight: bold">then</span> held upright, continued to burn clear down to the bottom of the match.
<br />

<br />
A match struck and held at a 90 degree angle burned much faster, but it still burned clear to the bottom of the match.
<br />

<br />
Conclusion, Maxus' video may or may not have been an actual supernatural act, depending on other environmental factors. When I first read Lasher's posts I thought he was just crazy, but my tests clearly show that in the right environment, a match may not go out by itself.
<br />

<br />
I for one appreciate Keif skepticism, the vast majority of claimed PK acts can probably be explained away as non-psychic. He definitely could have worded his posts better however, so as to be less offensive. Also, he's right about how matches generally tend to go out on their own (but not always).
<br />

<br />
[edit] Noting that Maxus held his match closer to a 45 degree angle, I did several tests at that angle.
<br />
I did it two ways. One was striking the match and immediately holding it at 45 degrees, all four from this group burned out by themselves after varying lengths of time (some were instant and some made it as far a halfway down the match), but none made it to the bottom.
<br />
The other way was striking the match and holding it sideways for a few seconds to let it get started, three of these made it all the way the bottom, and one of them stopped on it's own.
<br />

<br />
Now it stands to reason that the more &quot;upright&quot; the match is held, the harder time it will have burning (since fire tends to climb up). In the video we see that Maxus lights at about 45 degrees and then shifts it to about 20 degrees, this very strongly suggests that the match could indeed have burned itself out. It is my opinion then that Maxus did not do any pyrokinesis (but I don't have actual proof). Lit matches are just too unreliable to be considered as legitimate evidence of pyrokinesis. Lighting an unlit match however, would be quite a bit more impressive.
<br />

<br />
Note: this should not be taken offensively, or interpreted as a flame in any way. Like I said, it is my opinion that Maxus did not do any PK, but he may well have. 
<br />
The words Be Intelligent are written above my typing area, and I think that I am following them. Examining evidence and doing experiments is more intelligent than blindly believing. (It should be noted that I do believe in PK and stuff).
