			wassup yall all day ive been bored u kno jus sittin home all day watchin tv and youtube...i was watching criss angel stuff and saw a comment witch linked me to this site. Im not the kind of person at all that would be into this really cuz it seems sorta wierd u kno but i just couldnt help but look through it and check it out. None of the other stuff really caught my attention because i didnt think it was possible and it looked like it took to long to learn and u have to dedicate alot of ur time to it to get it right. But once i can across 'TK' that kinda caught my attention and i wondered if there was anything i could try u kno just to see if it was real or not. Well..i saw the psi wheel project thingy and read and watched alot of the posts and videos in this forum and started to get more and more interested.
<br />
           anyway let me get to the point. I was trying the lil psi wheel of and on for a while with my air and fan off. at first it felt kinda lame but i tryed and tried for about an hour and after reading how some of u guys experienced it on ur first time i got kinda jelous i guess u could say so i just kept goin. Then i came across of 'marcusT's' lil article he wrote about how to u kno just &quot;be 1 with the wheel&quot; or w/e lol. And that helped alot! i went to go get some orange juice and came back sat down with the tv on and did it just like marcust did it in 1 of his vids all of a sudden the mofucka just started to move back and forth and i was like SHIT! lol. it did that off and on for about 30 seconds and then it just stoped and i couldnt do it again. So i decided to join the forums and ask u guys a couple questions just so i dont get it twisted u kno? 
<br />

<br />
my 1st q is there is still a LITTLE TINY TINY breez that comes off and on but its so little its almost not noticable and i was wondering if that ,even tho i was covering the side of it with my hand,it could make it spin back and forth in 2 diff directions. and it seemed like evry time i got that shock feeling. Im sure u guys kno how it feels (when it makes ur heart beat faster) it seemd to slow down stop. so it made it seem like i was doing it. any way
<br />

<br />

<br />
2nd q. once you do make it spin once are you supposed to be able to do it again easyily cuz it wasnt like that for me.
<br />

<br />
but the main thing im just wondering overall is i wanna know if i did that or if somthing else coulda caused it. because i dont wanna get all happy over nothing (even tho its to late lol).
<br />

<br />
i really apretiate every post u guys leave to help me out.
<br />

			It sounds like you did move it yourself, frequently when I spin, i do get the feeling of static electricity arcing from me to it and vice versas, and as regarding to your second question, frequently a begginer will have what we call beginner's luck and have trouble spinning again for couple days or longer. It is something that takes quite a bit of practice but as regarding to first question I didn't really understand it.

			wel for me, my muscles in my hands seem to spasm quite a bit just before I manage to make the wheel wobble (i can't spin it yet <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />) but don't discourage yourself. I keep thinking the same thing &quot;was it a bit of wind?&quot; but if you think to yourself, &quot;yea that was me! I did that!&quot; then you will find that you will get better results.

but yes, i think it was you that did that..once you get better you'll see its easier to get objects to move..so far i can slide my social studies book....also, it will probably help you a ton if you would learn energy manipulation first...(psi balls, shieds, ect)
