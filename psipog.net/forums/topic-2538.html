			Before I joined PSIPOG, I was a member of the website <a href="http://www.bzpower.com" target="_blank" class="postlink">bzpower.com</a>.  If you look at the forums, you will see a bar that is partially filled in under the person's avatar, by the personal information.  
<br />
A full bar looks like this: <img src="http://www.bzpower.com/forum/html/karma/5.gif" border="0" />
<br />
A neutral bar looks like this: <img src="http://www.bzpower.com/forum/html/karma/0.gif" border="0" />
<br />
An empty bar looks like this: <img src="http://www.bzpower.com/forum/html/karma/-5.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Moderators can increase or decrease a user's &quot;proto energy,&quot; which here should be called &quot;anti-fluffy-ness&quot; or something, based on the user's actions.  Obviously flaming, and major spam will decrease proto energy, but also leaking false information, having huge sigs, creating multiple accounts to vote on things will decrease proto energy.  If you hit minus five energy (0 is neutral) then you automatically get suspended whlie mods review you to decide what happens next.  On this site, doing things like lying about skills, providing false information about the location of lost objects (though this is hard to prove), invoking religion, etc, would warrant a decrease.  Helping people out with information, techniques, and new theorires that make sense could boost your energy.  What does having a low bar do other than push you closer to suspension?  Well, nothing in reality, but I know from being a member there for a long time that those with low bars aren't believed as much, won't be helped as much, and you generally are less excited when a low bar person posts in your topic.  This obviously has its downsides, but it is sure a good way to keep the site less fluffy.  What do you think of this?

			That would work, but would have some bad problems.  Say a person starts spewing off about dreams, complete full bar goes to nothing, But they are REALLY RELALY good at PK.  They'd have no credibility cause they made mistakes on other sections.  Maybe it could be broken up, have a PK bar, Dream bar, psi minipulation bar. 
<br />

<br />
Other problem, I can see it easiy start a flame war, &quot;thats fluff, just look at your bar.&quot;
<br />

<br />
But it sounds like it would be an quick and simple way to &quot;disapline&quot; ppl breaking the rules.

			Yeah, but for breaking rules, that's just the 'points' thing. Where you recieve warnings (that show to everyone whenever you post), and when you get to 3, admins/moderators decide what happens from there.
<br />

<br />
Although, if you want to use this stlylish (and it is) bar, for rule-breaking ONLY, get it to start at full. I think full would be worth either 5 or 3 points.
<br />

<br />
As the bar decreases...well, you know from there.

			It would be a good idea for rule-breaking, but not for general fluffiness, simply because it's too hard to enforce (who's the judge of what's fluffy?), but we'd also be seeing lots of empty bars around here. And that would essentially defeat the purpose of the whole system.

			I think its too strict, too much &quot;The mods look at it and decide, the mods lower it, the mods raise it...&quot; I think you should have a bar, that raises as you make good posts, but whats a good post? This implies there is a voting system, you should have the option, on every post, to rate it... 1-5 or something, and then, you lower if you make a stupid remark, or break the rules, and raise if you make a very valid point, good points for being intelligent, bad ones for being stupid or ignorant(aka Fluff).

			I agree that it would make some people seem as if they are lying when they are not, just becasue they have a low bar. Doesn't seem fair. The fluffiness wouldn't work, simply becasue, like sgtpsion said, whos the judge of what is fluffy and what is not? 
<br />

<br />
Maybe we could all start at a low bar, and then get points for giving intelligent and constructive posts. Then people with very high bars can join in certain forums, like the staff one at the bottom of the index list, for example. It's sort of like a doggy treat system for being a good boy. (edit) or girl. lol. sorry.

The only problem with that is if a group of people dont like the idea and vote negatively but the people who like it dont vote.

1. Discrimination would occur according to bar. 
<br />
2. Too much work for mods.

It's just way too much work for someone to say: &quot;Oh, that's fluff&quot; or &quot;Oh, that's good.&quot; It's not like you could get a program to do it.

			Good suggestion, but I like PsiPogs forums without the bar idea. It sounds cool and all, but if people want to go around lying, then they should take it away from PsiPog and somewhere else, but it's unlikely because alot of people out there really get a kick out of lying for some reason.
