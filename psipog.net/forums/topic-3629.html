			I hope you know that the subconscious isn't an actual part of your brain, kind of like how an operating system isn't a physical part of a computer (like video cards and thigs).  Maybe PK doesn't come from just one part of the brain.  We don't know enough about it to say for certain, but if I had to take a guess, I'd say the prefrontal lobe, behind the center of your forehead, because thats what feels weird while I do PK.

			Etree8, if the concious part of our mind is physical so is the sub-conscious, After all, the Sub-conscious is mere emotion created in our minds. 
<br />

<br />
I believe that  the cortex, Spinal cord and cerebellum is the most active in our brain. Possibly a use of the Amygdala.
<br />

<br />
This is just what I think though, I don't know if there is a factual answer...

			Well, if it were to come from the brain, I would speculate that it would be from the pineal gland, as it is a most amazing part of us.

The brain/mind is merely a tool FOR observation. But I ask you, who is actually doing the OBSERVING. 
<br />

<br />
The observer is not only located in your brain, but in your body and all around you, and indeed, everywhere.
<br />

<br />
This is infinitely connected to All That Is, and when you have tapped into this unquenchable resource of information, or conciousness, it may be what allows you to move objects/whatever.

This might be the most accurate assumption.  It's not like one part of the brain has only one function.  With most activities, several parts of the brain activate in conjunction with one another.  Pinpointing a single location that is utilized during PK is doubtful.
<br />

<br />
To date, I'm unsure of any studies that have pinpointed any brain structure, let alone several brain structures, that are responsible for PK.  Maybe someone can find a research article in a paranormal or parapsychology publication that deals with this topic.

Also, if a &quot;ghost&quot; can move an object, it may be that the &quot;spiritual&quot; parts of a human system are either responsable-for -- or capable-of PK.

			IMO, ive always looked at the mind as a non physical thing. and that our brain is simply the &quot;reciever&quot; to the mind that allows the mind to function the physical body.

that being said i think Psi and such come directly from the mind, as it has an infinite supply of psi.

thats just what i think though.

   That is incorrect. Does the brain not handle all those basic things like heart beat, breathing, and so on? The subconscious is located in the brain. If you have something credible saying otherwise please post it for us to see.

   The operating system is a physical part of the computer. It is stored in the hard drive.

   I believe otherwise. I think that the mind is nothing more but the outcome of a number of simple structures coming together and becoming something more complex. Take an ant for example. One ant is fairly simple, but if you take thousands and they become a colony they'll start doing more complex things.

   eh. I don't think the pineal gland is the most amazing part of us. But to each his own.
<br />

<br />
   Anyway, like I said above. I believe that the mind is only a physical thing that is created by a bunch of simple &quot;structures&quot; working together. So to answer your question... it is YOU that is observing. Not someone outside of you. Not some creature/thing/whatever that is everywhere.
