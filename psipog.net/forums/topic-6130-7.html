I think He did use them a little.  Cause when Sylar was throwing the locker doors at him they weren't all hitting, and you'd think with it being super awesome TK, you shouldn't miss.  
<br />

<br />
And In this episode, it proved that Peter can hold on to the powers for a while even when the person is away from him (setting his broken foot when the cops found him).  Maybe he will utilize and hone(sp) this skill.

Sylar is going around stealing powers, thus he's using his ability to figure out things as complicated as the brain and the power-giving &quot;soul&quot; that exists within it.  That's why he killed the guy who had TK and then gained it himself, that's why he stole a person's brain and deep freezed their body, and that's why he stole another victim's brain and frame-broiled them.  This would also imply he got the ability to remember practically everything from the redheaded lady Hiro liked.  So he's a genius problem solver, a telekinetic, a pyrokinetic, can remember everything and can freeze things.  Sylar's powers are not exactly &quot;limited&quot;, except by his supposed deadness lol.  Personally since we just see him fall unconscious due to the Haitian's powers of telepathy, I would bet he's not dead.  We'll likely see him popping up, forgetting enough so that he works for Claire's dad under the influence of that girl with the suggestion powers.  Anyone else see a Professor X and the X-men vs Magneto and his lackies sort of rivalry in the making here?

All I can say for this episode tonight is Wow. Just wow. I never suspected it to be Peter that blew up NYC. Eden killed herself so that Sylar couldn't get her brain. Claire is obviously gonna remember her powers, but it makes me sad that her friend isn't her friend anymore. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> I liked him. I'm just glad that the Haitian isn't evil like I thought he was gonna be when he was stepping towards her. Perhaps Ted, the radioactive guy, is nearby peter when peter blows up, or maybe he's just overwhelmed by all the powers in his vicinity and combusts. Oh the possibilities!!

			Clair didn't forget.  The Hatian basically said &quot;your gonna have to pretend that I wiped ya&quot;
<br />

<br />
And refering to forshadowing in previous episode, I think the radioactive guys gonna get killed.  I think Peter just looked into the future or somthing.  Idk no idea, dont listen to me...

So cunfuzled...

I don't get why peter even had the premenition if he wasn't anywere near isaac at that time. Yeah i think he gets overwhelmed since they're all there. It seemed weird that his brother would get so close to him with those disapointed eyes at the last moment. I think his brother is gonna fly him 300 miles into the stratosphere or whatever.
<br />

<br />
Why wouldnt sylar be able to get her powers? Even though she's dead all the stuff is still there. Her DNA and everything in her brain unless she peirced whatever he needed with the bullet and i think theres very little chances of that happening.
<br />

<br />
I remember trying to go sneak a peak when they were filming spider man 3 on 24th in the summer but i never remember hearing them say anything about filming Heroes here. Maybe its because its not as anticipated?
<br />

<br />
I still think Jessica has some kind of super stength type of power notice how easily she shattered the glass on the door of the car or how she threw DL a couple feet away with one arm (3 times including previous episodes)
<br />

Happy Hollidays guys :]
