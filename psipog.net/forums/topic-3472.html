			I was practicing yesterday with Lucidess through msn, unfortunately my computer got frozen, but we got interesting results.
<br />

<br />
Since I am new at this, I don't know what I am supposed to see, but I am going to tell you a bit of the experience so you can guide me through:
<br />

<br />
We imagined we were in different rooms and there was a door in the middle, then to transmit the message we would open the door and let the image of the number show.
<br />

<br />
I imagined this, and got one right, what I saw in my mind was similar to when you close your eyes and see color lights, that are supposed to be caused by some bacteria, you can barely see those lights, and those lights formed the number but in a very blurry way. Thats what I saw but very mild, I don't know about you guys.
<br />

<br />
Also in this excersise I didn't do any energy manipulation, I just use imagination. Am I doing it right?
<br />

<br />
By the way I was feeling some warm on my forehead, because I was practicing awareness manthra OM before the excersise. I recomend this.

			yup, i use all imagination. i've been using imagination since young and began to use it as a control and separation of my thoughts and the evils i face and the messages i convey to others. i thought it was all fake since i made the images but it's real as long as you can create representations off all your life aspect the correct way. totally awesome!
