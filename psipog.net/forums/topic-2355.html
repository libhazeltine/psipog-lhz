			I have an idea but i am not sure if it will work i was thinking if two people do OBE at the same time could they swich bodies? or could you even enter the body of some one else even if there is a host in that body already 
<br />
(not sure if it is psi combat)

			well, you are technically still connected to your body via the silver cord thing. i dont think you'd be able to enter another body while you are still connected to yours.

			Your mind is still connected to your body since your subconscious is still functioning in your body, therefore no. If your mind, all aspects of it, completely left your body you'd die the moment you went OBE since the subconscious would stop regulating your heart, the heart would stop, then well, you'd die.

I'd have to disagree there.
<br />

<br />
Heartbeat, breathing, digestion, and all other involuntary processes are all controlled by the brain stem, spinal cord, and some other parts of the brain. The chemical reactions and electrical transmissions that cause the brain stem to cause the heart to beat, the lungs to breathe, the stomach to digest, etc. are not dependent upon either a conscious or a subconscious mind's presence - see Terri Schiavo or any other braindead person. They are a self-reproducing process, and while I'm not fully enlightened on the exact functioning of the system, it's my impression that as long as the heart provides oxygen and nutrients to the neurons in the brain stem, the brain stem does its thing, and as long as the nerves can transmit orders for the heart to beat, the lungs to breathe, the stomach to digest, etc., the heart continues to provide oxygen and nutrients to the brain stem.
<br />

<br />
It takes some sort of interruption in this system to kill a person, whether it is degrading nerves failing to transmit to the heart, the heart failing to beat when ordered to, the lungs failing to breathe or having an inability to extract oxygen, damage to the brain stem, or some other malady. OBEs do not interrupt any of the vital processes, or else we'd be hearing about a lot of people spontaneously dying while sleeping.
<br />

<br />
As to the original question posed, I'd have to guess no. Why don't you try it and tell us what happens?

			Robert Bruce claims that when we OBE, we are copying our consciousness.  So one consciousness stays in the body, just fine and dandy.  The other is floating around out of body.  This would mean no one could really &quot;enter&quot; your body, because it already has yourself inside of it.  It's an interesting theory, but I haven't been able to confirm it personally.

			That is sort of weird but it is starting to make sense to me. People can't enter into your brain by hacking because you always have two bodies. At least I think I get it. Can someone else post for me and for all? Im still not sure of Peebrain's post... <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />
