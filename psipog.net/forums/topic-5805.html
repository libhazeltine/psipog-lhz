			Alright, I'm not exactly sure what forum this is supposed to be in, and so yeah...

Well, my aunt and my uncle were two very loving people.  So, when my aunt was making some coffee as my uncle was laying on a couch reading the newspaper, my aunt came into the room where my uncle was, and instead of seeing his body, she saw something different.  My aunt instead saw an open coffin with my uncle's body inside.  She instantly saw a tree in their backyard and the coffin then was visualized there.  She was freaked out and just discarded it as her mind playing games on her.
<br />

<br />
So, a few weeks later, their neighbor gets a new satelite TV and had to cut down their tree.  Sure enough, my uncle had passed away.

This can't seriously be a coincidence.  I just thought if it might be possible to alter your future if you ever notice or have an experience such as this.  Would that be possible?

			Ya I think so but that might mean you have to do something every single time which turns into being paranoid. It's better to just let life happen.

			I think there's so little known about the topic/experiences to come to any kind of conclusion
