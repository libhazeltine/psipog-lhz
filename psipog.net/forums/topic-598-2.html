How can you be so sure that she was the one moving the covered psi-wheel?  Not only were you in the room with her, but some portion of your attention had to be focused on the covered psi-wheel, due to the fact that you saw it move with your own eyes.  The simple fact that you saw it move means that some portion of your attention, whether small or large, was directed towards the psi-wheel.  Also, with your years of psionic experimentation and your alleged (sp?) psychokinetic abilities (&quot;alleged&quot; hinging upon the validity of your videos) would it be safe to assume that at your &quot;level&quot; you could spin a simple covered psi-wheel?  This is not meant to call your abilities, videos, theories, or character into question, and is in no way an attack/insult to them.  I simply would like to know upon what you base your theory that covering a psi-wheel is a simple mental block, and should not create a problem for someone who could already spin it.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Hello Mindful,
<br />

<br />
Interesting question and I'm glad you asked. I was indeed looking at the psi-wheel however my main attention was not toward the wheel. My attention was mainly focused on Amanda and if she would see the glass. Your certainly correct about my attention toward the wheel would may have caused the wheel to move however in this case I'm sure I had no involvement in the motion of the wheel. 
<br />

<br />
I follow my own custom set of protocols when I practice or attempt PK. Although I can move objects without following the protocols, I know when I would have had even the slightest amount of involvement. In one of my PK articles I talk about connecting with objects. A connection with an object could simply be focusing my attention on the object however when I connect with an object there is a feeling of some sort that I have learned to feel when I know I'm connected with the object and I can manipulate it to move. When dealing with Amanda, I had no connection with the object nor did I feel the movement.
<br />

<br />
I also attempted this experiment more than once with Amanda (Same day, different time). Although your question does make make people go &quot;Ah, maybe Joe did it!&quot;, I certainly do not feel I had any involvement. In most cases I would focus my attention on something else (People coming through the library door, looking for people I know etc) and find Amanda spinning the wheel effortlessly. 
<br />

<br />
I don't know if you have any experience with practicing PK but If you ask any person &quot;Do you feel anything when you move an object?&quot; who does indeed practice and have experience with PK, they will indeed nod their head and reply &quot;Yes&quot;.

			Hi Joe .. where can I find your articles?
<br />
I don't see any of yours in the psipog articles psychokinesis section, so I assume you post them elsewhere?
<br />

Considering your level of skill and tutoring of others, I'd be interested in reading what you have to say <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Thank you for the response Joet.  Yes, i do indeed practice psychokinesis, and for most controlled experiments, i do indeed feel some connection and am aware of that connection.  However, I also seem to poltergeist a lot also, in which cases, i feel nothing.  This is the reason that i asked, since you seem to be a fairly experienced psychokinetic, and as such, i simply assumed you sometimes poltergeist without any feeling also.  Anyways, thanks for the response.

			Very interesting. I, too, had trouble moving the glass, and indeed felt it was partly due to intimidation. Moving it without the glass didn't give me the confidence that I was the one moving it. I don't have any control built up yet, so the psiwheel when it moves looks just as though a slight breeze is brushing it. That's why I try to only practice with it on, and had almost given up. Because the intimidation was so apparent, I wanted to move onto other things that were similar in challenge to a psiwheel, so it kept my mind stimulated with something new, and kept me generally more optimistic. But I couldn't think of anything. This experiment is good because it confirms what I was suspecting. However the feeling is still there that maybe I don't have any abilities at all. For some reason, I'm good at unclogging toilets (laugh if you will), but I even question that sometimes.
<br />

<br />
Confidence is, I know, the most important thing when performing telekinesis. Amanda was the perfect canidate in general for learning telekinesis, because she can't be distracted or discouraged by percieved progress or imtimidation. Discouragement is a major hurtle, and if you aren't optimistic or confident, you are blocking your abilities. It's something I struggle with alongside performing telekinesis itself, and unfortunately it can't just be ignored or set aside so easily a lot of times. I think this can be overcome by persistence and effort, but it's not at all easy.

			Thnx to this topic and the article from JoeT i can finally move the psiwheel under a glass <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> . You just have to relize that there is no glass. and you just have to know that you can move it when you want it.

Hello Reputator,
<br />

<br />
My advice to you is to keep your head held high and continue your practice. I'm thinking your bringing your personal feeling with other things into your practice. Which is not good. Your practice may not be bringing results in due to your head being bombarded by other thoughts and feelings. I suggest that before you practice PK that you first either meditate or relax before you jump into it.
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

			for a while i was trying to move the psiwheel under a cup and i experienced something that made me think it was negativley effecting its motion.
<br />

<br />
I had, at this point in my training, been using my hand alot to to pk on the wheel.  i would place my left hand on one side of the wheel and it would spin clockwise.  This was something i had developed.  i wanted to develope a situation were when ever i put my left hand near the wheel my subconscious would know that i ment to move it.  it started out slow.  it would only move sometimes in the right direction or at all etc.  after a long while i had developed the ability to the point were i could spin the wheel fast and fluently clockwise.  i could switch its direction if i focused but it was not as easy as clockwise and i found that remaining very passive and not reacting to movment would help the wheel move faster and smoother.  I had hard wired the response into my subconscious (i guess)
<br />
with this method i was able to spin the wheel continuously, (one day i did it for 40 minets without stoping before i got bored)
<br />

<br />
was this legitimate tk?  i certainly thought it was and still now think it is.  I considered the posibility that heat from my hand was moving the psi wheel because my hand was fairly close to the wheel (from 6 - .5 inches from my hand)  I thought that this did not reflect the behavior of the wheel in that the wheel moved difrently when i did difrent things with my mind.  if i focused hard on the weel and give it my full attention it would not move fluently and would stop and start.  if i diverted my a ttention and remained passive it would move fast and smooth.  I was basicly letting my subconscious do the work.  If heat was the cause of motion i wouldn't think it would behave like this.
<br />

<br />
secondly this was an ability that i had gradualy gotten better at and took a while to perfect, and in addition to that my right hand lacked this abbility.  If it was just heat from my hand this probly wouldn't have been true.
<br />

<br />
ok, so i concluded that it was tk, now on to my cup experiment.
<br />

<br />
I put a cup over the wheel and put my left hand near it. &gt; nothing happened
<br />
i left my hand near the wheel and took the cup off very slowly as to not disturb the air.  &gt; the wheel started to spin within a few seconds
<br />
i put the cup back on &gt; motion emediatly stoped
<br />
i tilted the cup up on an angle so that there was nothing between my hand and the wheel and the cup was still touching the table.  &gt;  the wheel began to spin
<br />
I continued to experiment seeing how far down i could put the cup before the wheel would stop spining.  
<br />
i could get the cup fairly close to the table (with the other edge on the table) before it stopped spinning.
<br />

<br />
now this perticular instance doesn't seem to me like a mental block.  If it was a mental block why did my mind just pick an arbitrary point to stop spinning the wheel?  this experience is the only thing stoping me from fully accepting the idea that glass has no effect on the wheels motion.
<br />

<br />
btw:  i have succeded in spining the wheel under a cup both with my hand near the cup and without any hands.

so tell me what you guys think..   is this a mental block?  is it something else about this method that is making it behave like this?  the behavior of the wheel just seemed so definate.  it would stop at the same point every time and just seemed like it was reacting tot he cup.  at the time i was not thinking, &quot;ohh here comes the edge of the cup, its almost down, its probly gona stop soon&quot; at the time of this experience.

			] I'm SOOO glad I came accross this! Just tonight, I had moved on to placing a glass over the wheel, only to find that it wasn't moving at all. I truly do believe that it is in my head, I Just can't make the REST of myself believe it.....it kinda sucks, and I guess I just have to get over it.
