			I have never believed in any sort of superhuman, psychic power. Most members of my family are very religious; in fact, my father is an evangelical pastor. It is a begrudgedly accepted part of family lore that our now-deceased batty old great-aunt had some sort of psychic connections, having predictive powers over things like the deaths of two of my cousins, in addition to some form of telepathic power she used to mentally communicate with her sisters. Although our family writes off psychic power, we have never bothered to explain old Aunt LaVerne.
<br />

<br />
She lived upwards of age ninety, and as she was already in her mid-eighties when I was born, I rarely met her. On one of the rare occasions that I did, at a family Christmas gathering at age six, she clasped my shoulders and stared ferociously into my eyes, telling me in a hollow, ghostly voice that I would have the most powerful mind our family had ever seen, putting a ten-year timetable on my &quot;awakening.&quot; The event was traumatic, but we wrote it off as old crazy LaVerne making up stories again.
<br />

<br />
I put the incident out of my mind, and had a fairly normal childhood; with a couple of minor exceptions, there were almost no unnatural experiences. All of that changed about a week ago. Last Monday was my sixteenth birthday. Ever since then, I've had a mindblowing array of experiences, all dealing with psychokinesis. I have moved a number of objects without touching them, such as cell phones, glasses, and on one occasion, a dictionary, and I seem to have very little control over these experiences. None of this makes any sense to me.
<br />

<br />
I did a little bit of research into my family history, mainly courtesy of the older &quot;family historian&quot; matriarchs, and found that a number of my long-dead relatives, a large clan of Chicago/St. Louis Swedes, have had psychic histories. Considering this, it seems that either many of the members of my family are insane, or my family genuinely has psychic capabilities.
<br />

<br />
It has been only a week, and I am already starting to feel more control over the objects that I move. Pardon me if I am somewhat ignorant of psychic terms; I have been a skeptic all my life. I want to know if there are any other cases like this; I want to know how to control these &quot;powers&quot;, if they exist; I want to know if I am really crazy. I am still very skeptical of this entire process- ideas like &quot;astral planes&quot; and &quot;constructs&quot; seem very far-fetched to me- but I would still like your help.
<br />

<br />
Thanks,
<br />

<br />
Assuming your story is true get a camera and try and record yourself moving the said objects. After you have done it, you can replay them and prove to yourself that you are &quot;Not insane&quot;.
<br />

<br />
I have not heard of anything like an old crazy aunt telling you that you where  going to become psychic and it happening. But, I suppose it's possible, given that Rasputin foretold the collapse and revolution of his country, and his own death <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.

			True, but people had tried to kill Rasputin many times before, he must have known he would die sometime or another. He also knew his revolution would collapse because it was showing signs of this.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I think this is the most healthy skeptic i've seen in a long time. a big welcome to psipog, and I hope you enjoy your stays.
<br />
As for your story in general, i'm here to say that yes it is real. Your aunt could be adept at what she claimed to have, and could have either forseen it, or you probably had it in ya the whole time and never really realized it. Maybe your aunt also gave your mind the impression that you are gifted and at a sub-concious level, your mind slowly built up that belief because it was one of those strong memories. Maybe she awakened it. Either way, out of all the possibilities you, or I, or anyone else thinks, I can see that you have performed psychokinesis. Everyone has the potential to be a psionic, I guess you are gifted, you lucky bugger.
<br />
(Maybe it's genetic?)

			Yes, I fully realize how fantastical and ridiculous my entire situation sounds. I only wanted to know how &quot;latency periods&quot; work, if they work at all. Thanks for your answer, Lucidess. Since I posted this on Sunday, I have seen substantial growth in my ability. The largest object I have moved so far is a baby grand piano at my church, though I only made it levitate about an inch. Easily the most significant thing about the lift was the fact that it was intentional- my control over these incidents keeps getting better.
<br />

<br />
To answer your question, maxus, yes, I do have a camera; I got a Cybershot as a birthday present. Unfortunately, it didn't come with any memory (ripoff!), but as soon as my memory card comes in I'll post pictures.
<br />

<br />
By the way, what's the official &quot;rule&quot; as to the control of objects? In my experiences, I haven't had to make stupid faces or contort my fingers or yell like a cast member on Dragonball Z, I only have to think about it. Is this unusual at all?
<br />

<br />
Thanks again for your help,
<br />

			That is really quite an accomplishment. Hard to beleive, as a matter of fact. But if it is true you may have what others train for years to attain. Consider yourself very fortunate.
<br />

<br />
As far as moving things, there are various techniques, but none of those things are neccesary. Many people like to use their hands, but hands are not required. All you need is thought. (Although some techniques use psi as well)

While this all seems too powerful to be true, I'm open to this being possible.

<br />
Hmm, reading this story made me think of something.  Do you think things would have turned out like this had your great-aunt not made that prediction in such a memorable way?  Suppose she had kept her mouth shut and made no imprint of the matter on you?  Perhaps in some ways despite your sceptisism you were expecting it, thus making it a self-fullfilling prophecy?
<br />

<br />
Bah, don't mind me.  Just a crazy theory... *goes to yell prophetic messages at her neices and nephews*

			Okay folks, here are a couple of the promised pictures. In my rush, I just grabbed a couple of things hanging around my bathroom and took pictures of them floating in the air. On a couple of these, I tried to take the picture with my left hand, so they didn't turn out quite as well. Still, enjoy!
<br />

<br />
Let's start with the small stuff; just a pencil, nothing fancy. Close up.
<br />
<img src="http://www.geocities.com/legallylatino/08.JPG" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Getting a little bigger. A package of bar soap.
<br />
<img src="http://www.geocities.com/legallylatino/04.JPG" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
How about a can of shaving cream?
<br />
<img src="http://www.geocities.com/legallylatino/05.JPG" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Maybe a lint roller?
<br />
<img src="http://www.geocities.com/legallylatino/09.JPG" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Ah ha, I also have hair gel:
<br />
<img src="http://www.geocities.com/legallylatino/01.JPG" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
How about something expensive and dangerous to drop? Like a DS?
<br />
<img src="http://www.geocities.com/legallylatino/02.JPG" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Maybe something heavier, like an old-fashioned grimoire-style book?
<br />
<img src="http://www.geocities.com/legallylatino/03.JPG" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Got anything even heavier? Maybe two big ol' gallons of detergent?
<br />
<img src="http://www.geocities.com/legallylatino/06.JPG" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
All right then, do you have any more complicated shapes? Say, an old dirty pair of pants?
<br />
<img src="http://www.geocities.com/legallylatino/07.JPG" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
And now, the coup de grace: take a picture of the camera levitating.
<br />
<img src="http://www.geocities.com/legallylatino/10.JPG" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
That last picture was incredibly difficult to capture, namely because of the concentration involved in the shutter button. I still have no idea how any of this works, and no, sadly, I don't have a video camera, but I hope to post some bigger, nicer, and more complex pictures in the near future. Thank you and good night!

Something along the lines of...'These stupid fuckers think they can fool us? It pisses me off when i see people lieing about Psionics, to make themselves feel special. As they have nothing else to do in their boring, unsociable lives', maxus also said  'that guy is fat'.
