			according to my sub-c
<br />

<br />
1.  a little both ... i think maybe you could elaborate on that question
<br />
2.  My sub-c is being a smartass, i think-    he says &quot;yourself&quot;  he also says that that wasn't complete sarcasm... he agrees it might be the nervous system ... he says, &quot;the nervous system might be part of it, yes&quot;
<br />
3.  hmm subconcious just says &quot;a lot&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
it is rather hard to get good answers out of subconciouses
<br />

<br />
*protests from sub-c*   he says i have to find stuff out for myself but he could help me since i already partly know the answers to these questions

			To my sub-c, psi is metaphysical. Of course, having no idea what that meant, I did a quick Google search, and discovered that metaphysics is...

It is the study of being or reality. It addresses questions such as: What is the nature of reality? Is there a God? What is man's place in the universe?

<br />
More recently, the term &quot;metaphysics&quot; has also been used to refer to &quot;subjects which are beyond the physical world&quot;. A &quot;metaphysical bookstore,&quot; for instance, is not one that sells books on ontology, but rather one that sells books on spirits, faith healing, crystal power, occultism, and other such topics.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Now THAT is awesome, I think it's the first instance of my sub-c knowing something my normal conscious didn't, and that I was able to get an answer to.

Psi comes &quot;from you.&quot; Helpful chap, isn't he? <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

Belief plays &quot;the utmost importance, for if there is no belief, there is no result.&quot;

<br />
1. Yes.
<br />
2. You; your mind, but not solely.
<br />
3. It's important to have faith when beginning. Once it becomes more natural to you you will not have to actively believe - you just will.
<br />

<br />
I'm not very good at translating into words.
