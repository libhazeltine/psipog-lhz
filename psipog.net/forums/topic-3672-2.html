			Regardless, I'm sure it's quite out of human ability to make an immortal soul. That goes into the realm of divinity, and thus, religion, which is too messy to mess with. Even if you make your construct physical, it will be a soulless body that's programmed to do a couple things, and then it'll probably be possessed by a demon
<br />

<br />
Even assuming EVERYTHING goes according to plan, are you really prepared to take care of a baby? Or the ramifications of doing something this big will have on the world?

Anyway, maybe if we put aside all that energy stuff and think, the genetics might make mothers, or females; more attentive to something of their own. Thats probably the only way I can think of it, is that the mother would be more attentive emotionally.. bah, even then I bet alot of disproof of this when people would say men can be more caring than women, just not as often.

Ofcourse M/F are made out of atoms, but does that make them each exactly the same thing? Hardly. </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

These two questions have nothing to do with what I said. So, I will not answer them. I'm done here.
