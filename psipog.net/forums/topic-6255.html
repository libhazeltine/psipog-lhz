			Ive been reading a few articles here and there, and i've come to this conclusion; people should be a little more open-minded.  Some skeptic may come along and stur up some trouble, then at least 7 people will pounce on him/her and force their beleifs on him/her, EVEN IN THE SKEPTIC SECTION.  Something to know; these skeptics do not hate you, they hate your beleifs as you hate theirs.  Obviously, their past experiences in life have led them to beleive whatever they are saying now.  What they are saying IS right, TO THEM.  Telling them something different isn't going to help because their current knowledge tells them not to beleive that.  And its the same for skeptics, don't come here and try to make everyone screw psionics. IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.  This is because they have done things, seen things, learned different things than you have, and whats 'up' for you may be 'down' for them.
<br />

<br />
Also... There was an article here asking what people thought about telepathy with trees.  He wanted peoples' OPINIONS, not 25 people trying to say that they are right.  (just a thought)
<br />

<br />
You can read this right now and think, &quot;Ugh, this kid is an idiot.&quot;  Fine, think of me as an idiot, leave mean messages, but I'm not going to change my mind because it's what I beleive.  Try to understand this about others before trying to force your thoughts onto them.  Obviously if you've read this far, you have to care the slightest bit...  The point of this forum is to SPREAD your ideas, if I am wrong, please tell me.

			Well, we &quot;pounce&quot; on skeptics who come on a forum dedicated to all of this...to say it's fake...To me, that shows the high amount of imaturity and disrespect. You, I respect because you see that people are fighting a useless war and we all need to just listen for once, which is good. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			okay, here's a (exaggerated) conversation between a psychic and a good skeptic:
<br />

<br />
              Good skeptic: Prove it.
<br />

<br />
              Psychic: okay. &quot;lifts good skeptic with TK.&quot;
<br />

<br />
              Good skeptic: YAY! IT'S REAL! TEACH ME!
<br />

<br />

<br />
but with many of the so-called skeptics on here it's like:
<br />

<br />
               Moron: ths r teh big poo
<br />
               
<br />
               Psychics: go away and leave us alone
<br />

<br />
               Moron: no til u prv it
<br />

<br />
               Psychics: not until you grow a brain.
<br />

<br />

<br />
many people on here don't believe, but they don't go around on every forum ranting about James Randi and all that nonsense, thus proving that not believing in psychic abilities does not require you to be a moronic jackass.

Here's the thing: If skeptics try to shove their beliefs down our throats.... I'm sure most of us are happy to return the favor.
<br />

<br />
I don't think anyone has a problem with HEALTHY skeptics(i.e. people who don't resort to ad homs, call us mentally unstable, etc.).   It annoys me to an extent, of course, but if the person is respectful of us, I know I'll be respectful of him.   
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, most skeptics aren't like that.    They'll attack us, say we're a bunch of 12 year olds with ADD, say that science has 'incontrivertible  proof'(I'm sorry, but neither side has complete proof either way; both sides have good evidence supporting their beliefs, but neither has proof), and that we're living in a fantasy world.   That makes this place a veritible mine field for skeptics; they say one thing wrong and.... *BOOM*  Someone will take it the wrong way, and things will get heated.   It's an unfortunate fact that both sides have their jackasses, and that each side is seen as one giant jackass by (most of) the other side.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
p.s. I don't think anyone will pounce you!  You seem to be one of the few good skeptics out there.  Keep up the good work!

There are many 14 year olds(including myself) and if you wait(if we get one before the archiving) then you will see what we mean by healthy skeptics and jackass skeptics...

Don't take it to heart. Just because a lot of younger people act like idiots doesn't mean you all are. The fact that you managed to successfully read the Be Intelligent thing, and that you were able to successfully use punctuation shows that you're not an idiot.

Yes, I'd say it's a branch of science too, and yes, unfortunately it is scarcely known.

I'm pretty sure almost every psion here has some doubt, even if they've lifted a brick telekinetically and thrown it. It's just some part of you that sits in the back of your mind and says &quot;There's no way it's real... I refuse to believe it, you're just delusional.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Also, by definition, skeptics are open minded, since the word refers to someone who doesn't quite believe what they're being told about whatever subject, but given reasonable proof, would change that belief. Unfortunately we get a lot of self-proclaimed skeptics here that don't believe anything we say and would refuse to believe it if you bent over and shot a lightning bolt out your ass and hit them in the face. You, fortunately, seem to fall into the actual definition of skeptic, rather than the more popular definition, which is 'an idiot.'

I'm sorry if you took that the wrong way, because it wasn't meant as an insult.   I was just giving an example of what pseudo-skeptics tend to do to discredit us(i.e. ad homs).   And, unfortunately, often times they do pull out the age card.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

<br />

<br />
Skeptic: Open to new ideas, if proof proves positive.
<br />

<br />
Cynic: Closed to ideas. 
<br />

<br />
There are people who are cynics who <span style="font-style: italic">think</span> they are skeptics. They are deluded.

              Good skeptic: Prove it.

              Psychic: okay. &quot;lifts good skeptic with TK.&quot;

              Good skeptic: YAY! IT'S REAL! TEACH ME!

He only is a 'good' sceptic because he gets proof - so there is no need for him to not believe in it. Sceptics over internet don't really get the prove so behave different from the person in this example. 'Good sceptic' isn't even a sceptic anymore the second time he says something.
<br />

<br />
I can't really blame most of the sceptics, but I do want to see some degree of open-mindedness and intelligent conversation between sceptics and believers.
