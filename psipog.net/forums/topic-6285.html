			Anyone else watch the TUF 4 finals last night? There was some good stuff...
<br />

<br />
especially the Scott Smith/Pete Sell fight.
<br />

<br />
Sell got him with a nice body shot to the floating rib(which I assume is the one at the bottom of the ribcage), probably got it cracked at minimum, started to fall back, and as Sell came in for the kill... Smith threw a very nice straight a KTFO'd Sell... then the both proceded to fall over- Sell from getting KO'd, Smith from what could be a very not good injury. Smith was down for awhile.
<br />

<br />
Then there was the Thales Leites/Martin Kampmann fight... WOW... just... WOW on this one.
<br />

<br />
Thales was 9-0 in MMA untill last night, when he became a 9-1 record. Anyway, the fight was amazing- at the end of round 3, I think EVERYONE was wondering how he was staying up- his legs were taking a beating from leg kicks, he was all wobbly and woozy, yet he still took a few pretty good shots and stayed up. Well, he lost the decision pretty badly there, but the guy has heart.
<br />

<br />
Great fights overall, but the Serra/Lytle fight... well, the judges had to be on crack to give Serra a 30-27 fight... at BEST, he made a 29-28 win, though, after watching the fight three times, Lytle MOST DEFINATELY had control in most of the fight, not Serra. Serra seemed to do very little as opposed to Lytle, though Serra attempted TD's more than Lytle, Lytle did more damage and actually did more- I think Lytle got screwed out of the $200K($100K fight contract/$100K Xyience contract)

Actually, MMA involves less brain cell loss than boxing, because the NSAC(for the USA) doesn't want anyone to die, so they have a different criteria for stopping fights.

			I dont like boxing either.  I think i'm more towards that violence is just pointless.  You dont gain anything accept money in this case.  Although it kills brain cells, more or less than boxing doesn't matter much.  Your still intentionally hurting yourself for money.

I just dont like it, feel free to ignore me.

Not gonna ignore you; you have valid points.
<br />

<br />
It's true, but these guys mostly start out in small shows making cash on the side, find out they're good, move up to bigger and bigger shows, get sponsers... the money from sponsers plus a fight purse is very appealing to alot of people. It's just not alot of people in this country want to put in the effort to get that good at MMA to make it. Then, if you're a top contender/big name/champ, you get paid ALOT more. That also lures hopefuls, thinking they will one day be champ and make that much and more.
<br />

<br />
It's two guys going at it, each knowing they COULD get hurt, and each believing they WON'T get hurt. It's about as good as it gets IMO, because both are willing participants.
