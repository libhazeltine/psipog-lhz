			I like nintendo for most of the same reasons, anyway look at microsoft, notice the complete lack of exclusive games? not good marketing, Microsoft is rather moronic. its worst idea was, of course, the registry. I must admit, though, monopolizing Fable was an excellent idea, Fable rocks, but it's about the only success microsoft has had, Nintendo, on the other hand, has Mario, Donkey kong, star fox, pokemon, and the best of all: Zelda. Even Fable can't beat Zelda, although it comes very close.

Actually in America nintendo is doing the worst at selling, but they are making the most money XD. Microsoft is burning money just because they want to be in a cool industry. I really like nintendo too. They are a smart company. They are not going to die without a fight. They actually keep a reserve of money to try out new ideas like the wii. So if it fails they can jump back with new a battle plan. I don't think the wii is going to fail anytime soon though.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

well see this is what i hate, ppl in america like nothing better than boring FPS that are all the same. that is why micosoft sells so much over here. but nintendo is not anywhere near dead. it is actually profiting from everything unlike micosoft and currently sony. but most microsoft fans think nintendo is going to die out in the next yr. and they are actually currently doing the best at selling with the DS. obviously they failed w/gamecube but that doesnt mean they dont sell anything and that doesnt mean they are a dead company. when nintendo 64 and the playstation battled it out nintendo 64 ruled over the playstation with a humiliating lead. but then sony came back in the next gen w/the PS2 to essentially dominate the next 5 yrs. so i dont want to hear anyone say anything about nintendo not selling or being dead!!!!

=| you ARE kidding right? Hello? HALO, HALO 2... 2 of the biggest successes in the video game industry.. not to mention the only consoles supporting the KOTOR games? Xbox. Also, who has the best graphics? Who makes the most money? Mr Bill Gates! not some old japanese dude selling outdated technology and little kid's games.

you shouldnt speculate on these things. i admit halo was big. but it wasnt the largest seller in video game history. im actually gonna bet my money on ocarina of time because it sold about 100 million copies in japan and maybe a little less over here. halo 2 sold about 100 million copies over here and about 4 million in japan. and halo as i said is one of those shooters that everybody loves for somereason. i own the game and have played less than 60 hrs on it. personally if i could get my money back i would do it in a second. and the KOTOR games i admit are very very good. but ya know those are some of the only RPG's on the xbox. (there are 2 others morrowind and fable).  and actually mr. bill gates' little company called &quot;microsoft&quot; is very much indebt from the xbox and the xbox 360. they dont make any good games or make a decent market in japan or europe for that matter. so it costs them more to produce everything then what they are making because they choose to continue making the same number of consoles for japan and europe as they do here. no one will buy them in europe and japan obviously because ppl over there like to use there brains. the statistics show. about 4 million xbox 360 consoles were reported to have been sold in japan in the first few months. sales have been depressingly stagnant since then. this might seem like a lot to you but think about it 4 million ppl out of 130 million ppl in japan have 360's. o and about the graphics gamecube, PS2, and xbox all had the same graphic capabilities they all had processors that ran at about 1.6 GHz. some games on xbox had good graphics. but actually the majority of good graphically powered games were on the PS2. and actually if you were moronic enough to bypass resident evil 4 for gamecube or PS2 then you wouldnt know that on gamecube it had the best graphics of any game of that generation of games. PS2 was a little worse just because the blocky textures that are usually associated with its games. and besides graphics dont make the game. i still go back to atari and NES because they had awesome games. and plz pay attention to the post that i made a little while ago. like i said earlier xbox put the game division of microsoft in debt. Nintendo DS is making more money than any handheld before it. not to mention it is obviously making more money then xbox did. so yes Satoru Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto are making more money than mr. gates. plz like the posting rules say, be intelligent. plz do some research before you post such an ignorant response.

			Well when i said Bill Gates made more money than whoever, i meant overall, not just gaming. As microsoft doesnt have a hand-held, and the Xbox/360 arent their main focus, as is Nintendo's gaming.

			well im srry for the mistake about halo/halo 2 thing. i guess i misread. but the official specs say that xbox, gamecube, and PS2 all have about the same processor speed. but like i said graphics dont make the game. if you ever played the original zelda, mario, or metroid prime you wouldnt care about graphics. (no one really should they just make things pretty not necissarily fun). and i was talking about the game division of microsoft obviously no other company in the world could stand up to the whole microsoft corporation. besides its not fair to compare nintendo to the whole microsoft corporation because they are completely different. microsoft makes computer software. computers are virtually in every household in the world. a lot of ppl dont play video games. about a third of america plays them and europe doesnt play a whole lot of them. and of course almost the entire population of japan plays them. so lets estimate europes population to be a third that plays video games. thats around 259 million. that is waaaaay over esitmating if anything. so lets add that together shall we? 80% of the worlds gaming population is around 489 million ppl. standing up to the billions of ppl in the world who have PCs that run microsoft software. fair? i would have to say no.

			Never said it had to be fair, just said thats what i said.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> Fair or not, i made the comparison that i did. Yes, Xbox/ps2/GC have about the same processor SPEED, but there are definetly other advantages. Also, i didnt say graphics did make the game, just that the Xbox's were better. Satisfied?

			well w/e im done w/this arguement it was kind of stupid of me to continue it everyone has opinions. but nintendo doesnt make little kid games. nobody should be ashamed to play nintendo games like pokemon or pikmin because they are really good games. well anyway im starting to rant again so i will leave it at that and say the ppl we should be mad at are the stupid political groups who are trying to take video games away from us.

PS3 is way too pricey and the way they set it up in features is ridiculous.

yeah they are up there, despite the fact that they suck ass, gotta go with eldibs on this one.

<br />
wow, 2 whole exclusive RPG's! wait, how many were also on pc? probably all of them, so that would bring it down to zero, oh halo and halo 2 were also on pc, and few people don't have a computer anymore.
