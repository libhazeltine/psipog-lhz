			It's nice to see it's working, PK_11. All I've got in 4 days were some slight (and i mean slight) bright difference. &quot;Unnoticeable&quot;, i would say. I got greyish tint near the pupils too, but... I think I already had them.
<br />

<br />
And for me it's not witchcraft nor &quot;changing the god's creation&quot;. Just because we want to change, that don't mean we are defying god (or everybody would stop using contact lens lol  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ). Think this way: if you can change yourself inside (your way of thinking)... why can't you change your appearance? Anyway, let's NOT take religion here (it's useless and against the rules).
<br />

<br />
Oh. Almost forgot. My methods:
<br />

<br />
-Tell my sub-c to make my eyes blue.
<br />
-Imagine a brush with &quot;blue eyes tint&quot;. Slowly paint your eyes. And wait for the tint to dry.
<br />
-Spam your mind with the word blue, thinking on every blue thing you know. Then put all these thoughts in your eyes, telling them that they'll become blue.
<br />
-Everytime you look into the mirror, tell yourself you have blue eyes. Try to &quot;see&quot; your blue eyes.
<br />

<br />
Good luck <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I've been trying to change my eye color from bluegreenish to light blue for...  4 days I think.
<br />
If I look in the mirror I can see some small changes, so I'll keep going at it!

			hmmm okay, my brown eye color has now become lighter compared to my parents and sis, although I still dont have my light grey color.
<br />
(yay semi-victory #1)
<br />

<br />
i still have the tint of grey near my pupils though, this leads me to wonder if that grey tint would creep up all the way around my iris.
<br />

<br />
hmmm i don't know.... I think aside from meditating before sleeping I'd say meditate after you wake up too....

			Yea I think this process is kinda slow, but it seems to work. I think I'll start meditating 3 times a day to speed it up. 
<br />

<br />
Last night i did the &quot;painting&quot; technique with opened eyes. I started to cry non-stop. It was pretty funny, I think I learned a useful way to cry lol
<br />

<br />
Again, I see some slight bright changes in my eyes. They are becoming a little lighter. However, it's still unnoticeable. You can only tell by looking very close in the mirror.
<br />

<br />
If any of you know another methods to do it, please share with us  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I've been trying to change my eyes from a blue blue to a ice blue for the past couple days, and now, I can see a noticable difference!
<br />

<br />
And there's a green ring right around my pupil! Which is kinda weird... in a sense.
<br />

<br />
But I'm a total novice! THIS IS GREAT! I wanna see far ice blue I can get... This'll be good!

			I think I've come up with something that you guys might be interested in. I tried to get my eyes to glow before, just to see if I could bend light or whatever you want to call it, and I noticed that I could briefly change their color, from the hazel they normally are to blue. At first I thought this to be merely the power of suggestion applied on my own perceptions, but then I had my girlfriend watchme as I did it, and she said that she noticed it as well. I say give it a shot guys, Maybe we can all learn the Little Nicky trick, huh?

			JW... Would it be possible to change your eye color to a color rather than the common colors among humans? As in a yellow eye color or such, or would that be directly changing your health as to have bad side-effects from a yellow eye color. (such as jaundice)

			Jaundice usually turns the whites of your eyes and your skin a pale yellow. I don't think it effects your iris.

You could just say you were wearing lenses on that photo  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Anywayz... I'm gonna try again ^-^ As soon as I get a conversation with my sub-c...
<br />
Is it possible to actually contact my sub-c by visualising 2 versions of me... one being transparent and having the word: &quot;sub-c&quot; above it's head? and the other one being my concious mind and seeing it talk to my transparent me?
<br />

<br />
I know that was confusing DX I didn't know how else to put it.
