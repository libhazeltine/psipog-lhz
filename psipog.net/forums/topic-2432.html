			First step is going over the consequences that you'll face. You may be harrassed, ostracized, called a fake, insulted. Then if you begin to get people to follow you may be bothered continualy to be peoples amusement &quot;move this&quot;...&quot;Ohhhh!! he did it!&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Past that the first would be telling and showing friends or doing it casually in a public place where people can see, dont create the image that your showing it off to people, like going up and asking them &quot;wanna' seem me do this?&quot; because they will think your a street magician. Just do it and keep doing it, like practicing in public, people will come ask, curiousity is a big part of humanity afterall.
<br />

<br />
After a while of doing that enough people will know.

			Go for it. If you think you have what it takes mentally and emotionally go for it. My suggestion is you get good first. Learn to do psionics under pressure too... that can only help.
<br />

<br />
What do you mean by going public anyway? Just showing friends and family? Or maybe you're applying for that JREF thing? More details please.

			well, what can you do in public? can you do it under pressure?

<br />
personally, I find a waste of time, It's showing thousands of people about it and only a few hundred of people would believe you and the rest just think you are a loon of some kind. waste of skill, unless, of course, you can blow up buildings with PK. haha.

I've already used pk inside of my family and friends. I'm not applying for the James Randi thing...maybe in time? I can't give you more details because I don't know what step I should take first. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />

In public, I can roll a pencil back and forth. I've done spoon bending under pressure but that's not what I'm going after.

			I think that if it's something you'd like to do, then go for it, but be prepared to have many things happen. 
<br />
Anything from disbelief to insults and even violance can result form people seeing something that goes against their beliefs or against what they view as possible in the world. It's sad, but it happens. 
<br />
You'll need to be careful of who you choose to show, even publically because people fear what they don't understand. Insulate yourself with 'safe' people that you know and have them around in the event you should need them.
<br />

<br />
Now, that's the sad part, on to the happy part.
<br />

<br />
You will, undoubtably have many people who believe and many more who will  want to be taught. You'll be making their world a magical place again, like when they were children. You'll make new friends and meet interesting people as well.
<br />

<br />
Overall, as long as you've prepared yourslef, and are sure this is something you're ready to do, then best of luck.

			Don't treat it like a big &quot;coming out&quot; thing.
<br />
Most people in my school sort of know, and sort of don't acknowledge it.
<br />
I don't make any effort to hide it, but I make no effort to talk about it. So they just get used to the things I do, like make little pieces of fluff have little fights, or telepathically scanning.
<br />

<br />
They'll just passively ask me for information like &quot;did whoever do whatever?&quot; even though I know nothing about it, or I wasn't there. It's a bad example.

			GO FOR IT!!!  Make sure you are good enough tho.  Alot of ppl wont be satisfied till you throw a car at them.  But really learn to be consistant and strong, which you are as for as i can see form your videos.
<br />

<br />
good luck.  If you really want to like go into labs and the such dont do the randi thing, it's all bull.  Go to the news ask to do a report on you.  They are usually not very busy, you can tell by the absolutly stupid things like, &quot;how to apply makeup&quot; and that bull.  But any way the randi thing is crap.  They Reject everyone, rules are rediculus, and it's been down sicne 2003, cause he's been &quot;sick.&quot;  Honestly, all he has do is watch some one do some paranormal thing.  I've survived school with the worst migrains possible...Randi 1 mill is crap.

			Update: Today I revealed the truth to my family. They knew about my spoon bending pk but this got them freaked out. They saw it and were speechless. My brother asked me how to do it. I think everything is cool now though. I'm in college so it's not like they can ground me. I see this as a stepping stone.

			no offense, but why the hell would your parents ground you?  i mean, if i showed my mom (which i plan on doing, since she already knows about me) she would just come home drunk with her friends and keep on making me doing it in front of them.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />   i don't see why they would ground you...
<br />

<br />
i say you should go somewhere public then make something close to you move. don't acknowledge YOU moved it, instead keep moving.  sooner or later someone will get curious and ask you &quot;what is happening?&quot;  that's when you stop moving it and say something like: &quot;oh this?  nothing, i was just practicing.&quot;  then continue to move it.
