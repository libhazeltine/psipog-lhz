			Let's say that a psion, Peebrain or rainsong's level, decided to psychically attack a normal person.  I would like to know to what extent they could hurt that person.  I'm not asking for battle techs, or anything like that.  I just want to to get a basic idea of how powerful a pretty good psion is.  Of just how powerful psions can get.  Could they hurt the person beyond repair, kill the person, or what?  I was just wondering what could happen if a psion decided to hurt someone.  
<br />
I don't want this turning into a psionic battle discusion or anything like that.  Just my question answered.

			i think if they were powerful enough they could stop their heart, but im not really sure...i've heard of being able to stop a frogs heart
<br />

<br />
then of course theres mental pain...im sure you could hurt them telepathically as well somehow.
<br />

<br />
...but thats not really what you should be using this stuff for <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			This will inevitably lead to combat talk. In fact, it already is.

			Do you not read the rules? 
<br />

<br />
I realize that you were trying to justify your post by saying you were not looking for techniques, but that is even combat.  Anything dealing with combat (prevention, information, techniques, practice) is all banned from these forums.  Please consult the rules.
