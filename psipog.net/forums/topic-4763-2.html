			IMO a psiball is not supposed to look like that.. especially when it looks more like a piece of hair than anything.
<br />
So far the common flare/psiball i've seen is, a blobby haze, probably sphere-like, color can be whatever. If it is real, then i've never seen one with such a sharp outline.

Since there does seem to be a debate on the validity of this picture. I'll tell you guys the long version of the story. 
<br />

<br />
Ok. Our group, Age, PazarX, Vedran, and myself were in #projection, we were just messing around, trying a game that PazarX wanted to try that none of us had done before. The game was pretty cool, it worked for all of us, our first ball that we sent to each other was hot, like hot enough you didn't want to hold it on yourself. This was all cool, but no offense to Vedran, he's a sensitive as a rock, so we decided we should try and get him to be more sensitive so we were throwing things at him, stuff like that. After a while I said that on AIM one of my friends should be getting on soon [he never did, lol], and that we should send a really cold ball to him and I would try and get his reaction, so we made the ball and passed it around. It finally got to Age. He had thrown something at my face earlier, so I was slightly annoyed with him, so I threw the psiball has hard as I could, I told him this before I did so. He put up a shield for himself. Anyways, I chuck this ball that is very cold directly at Age's face. It hits his shield and somehow becomes visable. We aren't really paying attention to it at this time. We thought it was some fluke with the shield or something, but after it was still visible for about 10 minutes, we figured we had something. I had the only camera in the group so as I got my room to complete darkness, or near enough not to see my hands infront of me. I snapped a picture. I really didn't have enough time to edit it, one I didn't have an editor at that time, I do now to so I could see if it was fake AFTER I sent it to peebs. Two the time between my taking of picture and posting the picture on the internet was very fast, too quickly to have even opened and uploaded a picture on my computer. Approx. 1 minute 45 seconds. I have a horrible computer <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Also, now that I have an editor, I'll try and recreate this hair theory you guys seem to be using.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Rather than recreate the hair theory, maybe you should recreate the conditions under which this happened.  Get the same group of guys together, go through the same procedure you did before, and take a picture with the same camera.  If you're unable to reproduce the effect, chances are it was a fluke and the light source can be something other than a psiball.
