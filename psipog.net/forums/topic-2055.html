			I use my third eye.  And my hands to when I really want to move somthing alot.  My hands usually are bias tho, as in, my left makes it spin clockwise and the opposite with my right.  trying to break that by just using my 3rd eye.  Only problem with usuing only my 3rd eye, is i seem to have no power, but ALOT of control.  I can just make it spin once or so when usuing only my 3rd eye.

			Well it is a Chakra.  Chakra is sanskrit for &quot;energy votrex.&quot;  There are 7 major Chakras in you body.  I'm pretty sure there are 21 minors, not sure... any way...The Root/1st which goes outward between your legs.  It's red.  Basic animal insticts, survive, eat and you conection to Mother Earth.  The second(doesn't have a cool name like root or third eye, heh, oh well), strarts by your genitals. It's orange. More animal insticts, sex, survive, continue the race/family.  The third is the solar plexues chakra by your....solar plexues, duh.  It's yellow. This is kinda your energy resevoir, this is where alot of ppl believe your psi comes from.  The 4th is your heart chakra by your....heart, again....duh. It's pink or green, the pink is a western belief b.e of Valentines day, but it's green really. This is the chakra that connect your higher chakras to your lower chakra.  This is where your compassion comes from.  It takes your Higher thinking and applies it to your animal insticts, and vice versa.  The 5th chakra is your throat chakra, it's around were your collar bones meet on your throat.  It's an indigo blueish color. This is how you communicate, vocally and through actions(like acting out when we're little, for attention and the such).  The 6th is the 3rd eye(dun dun dun DUNN!!).  It's purple and between your eyes.  It's you sight beyond sight-ish, area.  It's your pychic energy and thinking place.  The 7th chakra is is your crown chakra.  It's white.  It's the top of your head.  It's what connects all of us to each other and god/goddes(what ever you believe in).  It's also for higher thinking and spiritual contemplation.
<br />

<br />
This is mainly a Eastern belief, buddhism(ME!!), hinduism, toaism, confusionism and the such, but i know many chirstains and the what not that beleive in it too.  What i think is cool is that this was probably invented a thousand or more years before Jesus, and it so happens with today's technology we found that the nervouse system locations(clouds) line up exactly with were your chakras are!!!!! cool huh?  And it's lines up with the color spectum!!
<br />

<br />
Google search chakras.  You'll get alot of good info!!  And pictures.

			I see it not as an energy point, but an easy spot to focus in on. Its able to be felt quite strongly when focusing. I use it to direct my thought and focus, then project it. Like, ill focus the wheel spinning quickly, then &quot;throw&quot; that thought at the wheel, making it spin at a slower pace.

			I use the third eye for just about everything psionic.

<br />
When I finish a meditation, I'll use both my third eye and hands to form a large psiball. I charge psi energy using my third eye and transfer that energy to inbetween my hands, using my hands as a medium to form and contain a psiball... I've made some pretty friggin big ones too <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Everyone uses their third eye, its the chakra that allows perception of the metaphysical.  Kind of hard to NOT use it, regardless of whether you believe it.  Plus not believing in something that performs an obvious function (to anyone here at least) it like saying &quot;I don't use my spleen because I don't believe it exists&quot;.

what proof is there that the third eye exists? or even the other eyes? Oh, sure you say you can feel it, are you sure you aren't creating the feeling? making a construct with the exact physical feeling? It's possible. Maybe there is a biological happening inside the body that reacts to psi in a odd way, which would disprove the multiple hidden eyes, since it's not caused by eyes. personally, the Third Eye to me is just the feeling of the cortex growing.

			I have a hard time believing it's just the growing of a piece of your brain since the only things I know of that involve brain growth in already developed brains are fatal diseases and cancers.  Incephilitis isn't an everyday occurance so I doubt what you claim is the case.  Personally, I know the third eye is there because I've come to know myself and my body well enough to feel the energy flowing through it.  In doing so I can feel what parts of my body are more energetically active during certain activities, including psionics.  Plus, there's all that ancient Chinese medicine that involves chakras that's actually cured many ailments for me so I have some personal experience to support the claims made by certain metaphysical schools of thought.
<br />

<br />
Of course it's your right to believe whatever you like, what you think of my opinion is no business of mine.  It's simply my intention to express it and let others put the knowledge expressed to useful ends.
