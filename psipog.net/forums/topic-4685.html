			A couple days ago, I decided to sit down and practice making Psi Balls.  Well, as I started to form the energy, I was interrupted and had to get up to do something.
<br />

<br />
As I took a couple steps, my legs started to get very wobbly, I got very light-headed.  I thought I was going to pass out.  I had to sit back down and get a drink.  My hands we're shaking and I felt very weak afterwards.  I've been scared to practice ever since.

I really need some consultance before I attempt anything else.

That has never happened to me while practicing Psi. Perhaps it wasn't from practicing psi, but from sitting down and then getting up too fast? Sometimes that can make you dizzy/lightheaded/nauseaous.

			Sounds like hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or diabetes. Do you have diabetes? If not, had you eaten much that day? Been doing a lot of exercise?

Assuming that psi can be drawn directly from the body (sugar is burnt in order to create energy), it's possible that you were trying a tad too hard to make a psi ball. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Try it for about 5 min and then stop and get a drink or something and then get back into it again for another 5 min. Also try not to use your egergy, it'l just drain you. Use something else as a source.

*Sighs* No, But grammar does.
<br />
I'm just sure that is what you're experiencing, I might be wrong but that is what I think. I get it, alot. What you're feeling sounds exactly like it.
<br />
Sorry if that is not a &quot;satisfactory&quot; answer for you.

 So what the energy comes back. Even if you use your energy your energetic threshold remains the same and even breathing takes in energy.

the psi thing hasn't happened to me, but the getting up to fast has happened to me before...that would be the probable explanation...

just like what Mizz (Dejavu) said, if it is true, get a different source, just visualize, i usually use Earth as my source...

			dude....sounds lik a case of burnout to me.....try to pool in your psi (gather it from sources and storing it....storing helps to let your body get used to the &quot;foreign&quot; energy), b4 u start anything....eating would help too! lol!
