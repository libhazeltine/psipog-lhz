			Many have heard of the saying, or have been told, “if you believe in it enough, it will come true”. Well, this is true in many ways. The saying goes in two ways, if you believe that you are horrible at something, then, chances are, you are. But, if you believe that you are the best, then you are. It all has to do with the subconscious mind. The subconscious takes up 92% of your brain, leaving the conscious mind with only 8%. In other words, the subconscious mind dominates the conscious mind, but the conscious mind has the ability to reprogram the subconscious mind to it's liking. Some of the works of the subconscious are, but not limited to:
<br />

<br />
-Habits (good and bad)
<br />
-Involuntary actions (breathing and in some cases, walking etc.)
<br />
-The certain feeling you receive when you think of something in particular. 
<br />
   ~Example: When you think or hear the word 'mother' (or someone else close), you       receive a certain feeling.
<br />
-Dreams
<br />

<br />
The subconscious mind is a very powerful tool to have. As stated above, it takes what you say, and makes it possible in it's own way. When you say, “Aw, I can't pass this test!” and you really believe it, more than half of the time, you end up failing. Because you believed that you couldn't do it, so did your subconscious, and it found a way for you to fail. Same goes visa versa. 
<br />
	
<br />
Your subconscious is also responsible for habits. For example, a woman drives  to and from work everyday, she doesn't switch routes, just the same route. After a few months of driving to and from work, she begins to feel as though she is traveling in less time and doesn't remember the trip to or from. What's happening here is her subconscious has gotten her everyday route to and from work, and does it itself. When the conscious mind and the subconscious mind aren't battling for control, many things can be achieved. Another example, when you first start a sport, and you have no prior experience, getting into the swing of things can be a bit hard. After you practice for some time, it begins to get easier. Have you ever found yourself making the perfect touchdown, or making the perfect goal, and you weren't all there? This is the subconscious, once again taking over. 
<br />
	
<br />
When you are able to shut your conscious mind up and let your subconscious take control, you will be able to accomplish more than you can imagine. The point isn't to fully obey your subconscious and be it's slave. You should let your subconscious in and let it play it's role. When you are able to be on cue with your subconscious, things will be a lot easier, but when your conscious and subconscious are constantly battling for domination, the subconscious will win, no question, it can still be a headache. 
<br />
	
<br />
Some of the ways that the subconscious can help you out is, for example, weight loss. You can say all you want that you are going to loose that weight and you are going to do it now, but if you aren't really feeling that and believing in that then, nothing will change. You will still eat that cheesecake like its nothing, and not even think twice. This is because you haven't gotten through to your subconscious. Yeah you're talking the talk and looking at the right foods, but that doesn't make a difference if your not making the slightest effort. When you start believing that you can loose weight or whatever your situation is and you actually make an effort, you will see changes.
<br />
  
<br />

<br />
Ways to Reprogram Your Subconscious:
<br />

<br />
-Deep meditation.
<br />
-Try communicating with your subconscious directly. (Pendling or ask and receive)
<br />
-Do the Alpha State Routine (please take it upon yourself to Google it, don't make me do all the work) 
<br />

<br />
Note:
<br />
-When communicating with your subconscious, you may receive answers before you complete your question.
<br />
-The answers you receive won't always be in words, bit more like feelings or images. 
<br />
-There is an article on PsiPog on <a href="../art-pendling.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">Pendling</a>.  
<br />

			I don't beleive the sub-counious is all prefect. In the brain I believe the thulumn it is called sends small fragments of information based on sensory. Sends it to the amygdala...but I found is that the amygdala can react based on small amongs of evidence. Such as jumping up in the air when you thought you heard a familer scary sound.
<br />

<br />
The sub-c is all powerful, but itself can only react so much. But some of these feactures are what mades the difference from being pray and the hunter. Such as emotions reacting before logic.

Thanks for the input, I feel embarrased now  <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" /> I never really got around to stating that, I was worried about the amount of time I have to use the internet, and wanted to get it up ASAP.

			Don't get the wrong idea, when it comes to survival every second counts. The reason why it only based it off few evidence is because it turns out to be true then your dead. The only flaw is that when your wrong something serious may happen.
<br />

<br />
Like when your baby boy jumps out of the closet to scare you when you thought he was at a friends house. So your mind thought he was a bungler you shoot him with your gun. All because you found the front door open. This reaction in a way makes our minds more powerful, its not prefect. But it prove it usefulness.

THANK YOU. 
<br />

<br />
Yeah, I sound like a freak because I haven't explained a thing, but I don't care.
<br />

<br />
Basically, you've just established that I wasn't losing my mind. Over around the last year or so I thought I'd be the only child to develop Alzheimers <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> But it was things like I'd go do something I've done countless times, like make a cup of tea. If I had a lot on my mind at the time, according to what you've said there, my subconscious would take over because I'd have run through the back and forth motions of getting a cup, milk, tea, etc whilst thinking of something completely different. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Or I would be walking somewhere and daydream without realising it, paying no attention to where I was going. Yet, I went the right way, the fastest way, despite traffic and complex routes down alleyways, and then I'd sorta &quot;wake up&quot; and pay notice where I was. But when I had to get away from people etc I just let my mind drift off and it'd take me to where I wanted to go, even if I didnt know it yet.
<br />

<br />
So yeah, thanks for clarifying that lol[/i]

Is that pointed to me? The story I told was out of a book I read which I should have spoken of.

It just points out that even if the sub-c takes over... you are after all, only human. Mistakes can and will happen. We can only do so much.

			Yeah, I know, but it was just funny how you portrayed it. True...what is else is that book about? My time is fairly limited at the moment so I can only read books that have a lot to offer. 
<br />

<br />
Is it called this: Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ
<br />
and is by Daniel Goleman?

			Ya thats it, its a little old but I found it interesting. It just pretty much say why people with average IQ do so much better then people with high IQs because they try. Also how emotions are useful, it speaks of how people in a marriage needs to have empathy in order for a stable marriage.
<br />

<br />
I only got half way in it. In the first few chapters it speaks of how emotions work in the brain and body. Then it speaks of how emotions works on other people and babies.
<br />

<br />
It gets really boreding around the middle which is why I slowed down....
<br />

<br />
If you like a good audio book I think I could give you one. &quot;The Genius Formula (1995...I think)&quot; once again I forgot the 2 aruthers names but one of them had the highest creative IQ score (at that time). But it speaks how the human brain works some and about 10 of the worlds genius and about the IQ tests. Its a good improvement audio book.
<br />

<br />
As for this

As it says in emotional intelligence, it will tell you that peopel think so much better when there happy. True It may humiliate me....but it would be selfish to think about myself now wouldnt it?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			The Sub C is actually and extremely powerful part of the brain. If you desire something bad enough, the Sub C can make it happen. Not anything like getting lots of money or anything. Small stuff like losing weight or gaining muscle, even slowing the growth of hair!
