Somehow I doubt that's been scientifically proved. I have heard of those effects aiding dreaming, but you should mention the lack of proof, outside of people's personal (heavily influenced by belief/placebo) experience. 
<br />

<br />
Also:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Too much vitamin B6 can result in nerve damage to the arms and legs. This neuropathy is usually related to high intake of vitamin B6 from supplements, and is reversible when supplementation is stopped. According to the Institute of Medicine, several reports show sensory neuropathy at doses lower than 500 mg per day. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has established an upper tolerable intake level (UL) for vitamin B6 of 100 mg per day for all adults. As intake increases above the UL, the risk of adverse effects increases.&quot; - Medical college of Wisconsin website
<br />

<br />
So keep it under 100 mg, and keep in mind that is for adults.

			Woohooo!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  I feel so special in here!! I'm kinda like a natural Lucid Dreamer... I've been able to control my dreams as long as I can  remember ( and the surroundings in my dream). That's kind of why I never ever look it up. My first lucid dream was flying over a world... Just the normal world and just flying... Oh, the memories.. *sigh*  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  Is anyone else a natural lucid dreamer? My grandma said it might be the way I used to go to sleep *HAHA* when I was a baby. She said I used to lie there with my eyes open for hours then fall asleep...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			cthon98...if what you say is true about your mastery of lucid dreams I idol you...not in a blasphemous sort of way or anything lol...anyways I am desperately in need of a lucid dream and have not been successful for the longest time. I have only had 3 or 4 decently lengthed lucid dreams in my lifetime and I am hopeless now. just asking is there anyway you could dream walk or wake someone else in a lucid dream? think of it as the matrix concept...inducing lucidity into someone by dream-walking or dream sharing(whatever the correct term for it is). my time zone is pacific please send me a private message or reply on this...I need help
<br />

<br />
thank you,

			I've only been able to successfully dream walk to a few people I know really well, but the most a person could do would be to dream walk to someones dream, and say &quot;hey, you're dreaming!&quot;
<br />
I've made a habit of biting my bottom lip as soon as I wake up. Prevents false awakenings, since if I do so in a dream, there's no pain, and I realize I'm dreaming. I've also made a habit of doing similar in my dreams, and when you have a habit, and remind yourself to do something, often you will also do this thing in your dreams.

			I really had this lucid dream once. It was when I was falling through the sky towards a beautiful. I could feel the wind rippling my cheeks and a bunch of eagles were flying around me. I went through the clouds and I was about to hit the ground when I woke up. This is real. I can still remember this dream. I didn't even try to lucid dream. It just happened!

			I used to be able to lucid dream just fine, but then I got used to the effects of it (flying, psychokinesis, etc.) and now I take them for granted, leaving me unable to realize I'm dreaming.  I just prefer letting the dream go wherever it wants.
<br />

<br />
I enjoy it, though, I'm like a superhero in my dreams.
<br />

<br />
But yeah, I have the whole &quot;light sleeping&quot; problem too.  Even the presence of a cat in my room wakes me up, that's why I've started closing my bedroom door.
<br />

<br />
That, and they climb on my papers which I have strewn about, wrinkling them.
<br />

<br />
...And they get fur everywherrre.

Yup, I guess I should do that too...
<br />
I became lucid this... well it was morning already when i fell asleep again.
<br />
I cannot remember what made me lucid (it seems that my dream recall skill doesn't really matter: as soon as I'm lucid, my brain presses the red 'record' button on the eye-camera <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />)
<br />
Anyway, I became lucid, and got kind of excited and concentrated on not waking up. But I had the fixed idea of being in my bed, awake, that when the upcoming blackness faded, I was in my bed, and thought i woke up...
<br />

<br />
It was a false awakening :S
<br />
I went downstairs (and hey, in dreams I haven't EVER been in my room or my house...) and the blackness came back and i thought: Mhh.. i wanna get back into this dream now :S (&lt;- I wasn't fully lucid anymore and didn't realize that it's not normal that everything fades to black...)
<br />
and I kinda teleported to some other place, but about half a minute later i woke up - but this time, for real <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
It's kinda funny, that's the 3rd time I've been lucid now <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Anyway, it was a partly successful fight against waking up...
<br />
I watched my hands while I could see them, and when everything was black, I touched something in front of me (I couldn't see, but feel)
<br />
I put my hands around it, felt it, and rotated around it... It seemed quite effective hehe <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I too am envious of you &quot;natural lucid dreamers.&quot; I've been trying for the past two weeks straight to have a lucid dream! I read about it all the time and do reality checks, and repeat my intentions to myself and use the wake back to bed technique, but to no avail. I have to say that my dream recall, however, has quadropled. Every morning, I wake up, remember one dream I had durring the night, (I'm on Christmas break from college right now, so I have the luxury of sleeping 'till whenever I want for the moment), and tell myself that I will fall back asleep, dream, and become lucid. The hardest part is falling back asleep. But I usually do, and I dream, and as soon as I wake up I'm like &quot;Crap!! I was just dreaming, and I didn't realize it!&quot; So I remember that dream and then repeat the process. By the time I'm up for the day, I've remembered three dreams from one night, and haven't been able to get lucid. Very, very frustrating.
<br />

<br />
As another note, for those of you with trouble remembering to do reality checks, a technique I used to use in high school, especially since a lot of my dreams took place in my school, was to do a reality check every time the class-change bell rang. It was regular enough to come through in my dreams every once in a while and it's an easy reminder. However, at college, there is no bell, so I'm looking for another good reminder.
