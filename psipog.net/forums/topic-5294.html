			I'm still new to Psipog but yet im seeing things that I done, and some that I havent. I'm hopeing any of you will answer me &quot;what&quot; happen here. I sort of wish someone reply to my golden light dream..trance so I got this out.
<br />

<br />
I guess it started about half a year ago, I was having a nice dream (Well I think it was a nice dream I don't really remember it) till I woke up in my bed, the thought of going back to sleep enter my mind but then something happen. I felt a powerful pressure like feeling at the front part of my head. I forcus on it just a little untill I felt my body fill with some kind of energy in my chest and my head. I tried to move my body but it didnt reply to my request. I felt the powerful pressure feeling move deeper into my brain. Then I started to hear a crackling sound from inside my own head. This scared the hell out of me (pardon my language) for a moment I thought that I was having a serizure or something (I think anyone would have thought the same).
<br />

<br />
As soon that it came it was gone. I move around the room and check my temperature. I was slightly confused seeing I had no other effect, no headach or nothing. I was really scared by this because it really felt something was going into me. This of cource wasnt the first time it happen, this happen again a few weeks after. Same as before I woke up all of a sudden and my body couldnt move with the same dark feeling. But I didnt hear the crackling sound, just the dark pressure, it wasnt in the same parts of my brain..
<br />

<br />
This happen 1 more time but this time it was in the dream. In this dream I was talking to my brother, who was talking about a ghost that lived in our house. He said the ghost was getting restless, I don't remember what I said, but we end up going to my mothers bedroom door till my body frooze again, the dark energy I felt in my chest again and the fact i couldnt move my body told me exactly what was happening. As my body fell down as my brother reach for me I saw a name flash in front of my eyes and a really taunting voice in my head. I don't remember the name But I'm sure if I see again it pop back to me.
<br />

<br />
I do remember what the voice said, it was a womanly voice.
<br />
&quot;My name is ******* **** ******* and I'm good at chess and ***&quot;
<br />
I cross the last word because its a little...rude, ya I'll go with that. Annoys me that I can't remember the name..

			This is actually very common. It is called &quot;sleep paralysis&quot;. Look it up on Google or Wikipedia. Also look up &quot;Old Hag Syndrome&quot;.
