			i beleive that we would still have to learn binary code or at least have a computer translate it for us because we wouldn’t be able to understand it at all. We don’t need to understand physics to move the psi wheel because it’s all apart of the natural world but computers are not they are artificial so we don’t instinctively understand how they work. But we do understand how psi works on some instinctive level.  
<br />

<br />
The best analogy I have is that we learn to walk instinctively with just a little time but we have to learn how to operate a car because they are man made and so we have no intuition on how they work.

And I don't think you would NEED to have indepth knowledge of data transfer or binary or whatever to manipulate electronics. You don't need to know how an engine works to use it. But if you did you would be able to use your car more efficiently.

I know a little machine language, so I might just try fiddling with this using an old computer I have lying around somewhere. I've forgotten almost all of my machine language, but since I have a decent grasp of assembler and the official Intel manuals, I should be able to relearn the opcodes.

			To make sure I don't come off as a total ass I'm going to say well done on learn assembly! I never could. Just wasn't motivated. My point: assembly is the language, assembler is what converts it to an .exe file. How long you programming?

Telepathic Porn....eek. Paedo paradise if you ask me.

Yeah, we don't understand it consiously, but somehow our subconsious just &quot;knows&quot; how to PK a computer in a way that the result is what the consious mind wanted, no-one knows why, we all just have theories.
