			I believe it's generally agreed upon Psychokinesis requires an incredible amount of focus, most of your mental faculties. Unforunately, for your brain there's only so much to go around between your conscious and sub-conscious. Secondly, your sub-conscious mind is the cause of PK, your conscious mind can only instruct the sub-c. I know most of this is re-hashing, but please bare with me. 
<br />

<br />
Let me proceed into shared anecdote land. I often hear the best method for causing PK is the, &quot;just do it&quot;, or, &quot;don't think about it&quot;, methods. Why would less thinking result in better results? It's completely contradictory to common sense, at least at first glance.
<br />

<br />
Here's my take on the matter. The conscious mind is a huge resource hog on the brain. Specifically in generating things like self-awareness, higher level abstract thought processes, reasoning, and skepecticism. One could argue there exists a competing tipping scale between these two conscious's.
<br />

<br />
So, how can we lower the burden on the conscious mind and shift those valuable resources to your sub-c? It's simple, stop being so conscious! 
<br />

<br />
Why even bother holding notions like self-awareness in your mind or conscious attempts to force that wheel to spin. Your conscious mind cannot perform PK. Your conscious mind can't do much without it's better half.
<br />

<br />
While performing PK I do my damnedest to let the sub-c do all the work for me. Your conscious mind should only be reconciling what it wants to influence and how. From there it's a simple matter of letting go. Any more conscious input will always do more to stifle your PK than help. Kind of like the sub-c stealing the mental spotlight while your conscious sinks into the background.
<br />

<br />
However, I have observed some anomalies. After my practice sessions I have some difficulty of re-instating the previously dominant concious mind. It would seem as though the sub-c doesn't like to lose the spot light.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			I'm in controll of what I do, I'm the Master, I tell what my mind must, and it shall do what I say!
<br />

<br />
That's how I work with psyhokinesis, and it works.

Also, less is better, It's allowing your to get more within your mind to unlock poteintial and what not.

			i think it's like a computer: then less programs running, more resources to be used, so your pc will run faster then if it was with several programs running alredy.
