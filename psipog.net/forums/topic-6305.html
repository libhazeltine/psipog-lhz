			whenever i go into a meditation or trance and start to notice something new or different, like a vision or what not.  My eyes start to flutter and it's hard to keep them closed. does anyone have any good tips for keeping my eyes from fluttering or should i just get a blind fold?

It seems to happen most when i start to see a vision that i have never seen before.  A few days ago while my eyes were closed i started see this energy surrounding my whole body, it was coming at me in a wave form. I have never seen that before that and my eyes just started fluttering.  It's strange I think that i may try to focus on what is happening too much.  Like when you squint your eyes to see something thats far away. But I'm not sure exactly why this happens.

			oohh.  I get it.  Thats happened to me a few times.  For me it happened only randomly, so dont worry about it.  I think it's your body kinda freaking out to you losing your physical sences more.  Your body will get used to it.

			Hello,
<br />

<br />
I read about the details that you have mentioned -
<br />

<br />
One must never analyse anything that appears in meditation, that will again activate your mind and NS(central nervous system) which will not let your mind transcend into its pure realm.
<br />

<br />
The opening of eyes is usually stiffness in somebody parts only realised after meditating for a while, next time you get lights or waves just smile a bit and let them pass by .. keep the body loose but still.
<br />

<br />
you will see the stages in which the body relaxes, first you sit still but loose ,( the mind follows the body and the body follows the mind),try to keep the body movement minimum, and slowly you will see you eyes will relax move a bit and then become calm.
<br />

<br />
Impurities and stiffness will go away gradually.

good advice, that is the biggest problem that i have is that i do analyze whats going on too much.  Which is good in life but not good while trying to meditate.  I try not to analyze whats happening too much but sometimes i cant help it. But i am working hard to stop that.

			yes, it takes time , you should do the opposite of trying hard, just let it go .. just accept what is happening, if your eyes open let them and then very slowly close them again ..<img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> , if you see something in meditation just smile (internally) and let it pass by...  even the movement of eye lashes is a movement un-noticed, exhale and let it go , relax and leave body loose.. even in motion there is stillness , try to realise the stillness around you and slowly within your self.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

That really all depends on who your talking to or what your reading.  I've heard both dozens of times equally.
<br />

<br />
Personally, having my eyes open just gives me more destractions, such as cats running around.

			I personally think that you are acutally trying to keep your eyes closed, as in almost straining to keep them closed. So, your muscles in your eyes may flutter from this. The advice already given points to the solution, you should just relax your eyes and relax yourself to that matter.

			Also, dont obsess about it.  Thinking about a problem only gives it energy and it just strengthens.  So just forget it about it and relax.  Dont stress out about something as nominal as your eyes not closing, lol.
