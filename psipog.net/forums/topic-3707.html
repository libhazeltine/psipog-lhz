			I believe in psibut I hav my doubts Im hlf and half.  Which interfears sometimes.  When Im makinga  good psiball suddenly ill mess up.  I have a question How cann humans use there minds  to manipulate when we only use less than 50 percent of our brains according to study. The laws of gravity are beign denided all toegether.  Even though I can make psiballs my mind still wont believe it.  And after they said that one pictue was fake that totally messed up my brain.   I also wantto know how someone could  take energy from someone. We each have our own source it is just al impossible. 
<br />

<br />
Then again.. like I said im half and half i just dont know how to answer myself.   I just make s no ssense.

			Hmm....you fail to realize that science cannot prove everything. And that is exactly the flaw in your argument:: we use only about eight percent of our brains. Imagine what we can do with the rest? The brain, as you know, is the center of your nervous system, correct? Psionics is controlled by your nervous system. Therefore, using other, unexplored parts, of your brain, can cause other reactions in your nervous system. Psionics is one of them. The brain also controls your six (yeah, six) senses. Psi, Taste, touch, hearing, smelling, seeing. So, since Seeing and Psi are connected by your nervous system, they can be used together. You Visualize many aspects of psionics; Ie. Psi-balls, and even draining energy. Therefore, these two work together to reach a common goal. They are both part of your nervous system; They can both function together. If Psionics is one aspect of the brain many unexplore, how can science prove what is truly comprehensible with the human body? It cannot. Therefore, science cannot disprove psionics. 
<br />
regardless, they have already proved it. ;D

			psiwisher, if you can't tell already, science isn't always right.  I personally don't believe that we use less than 50% of our brains.  Science says that, but science also says that this stuff isn't real.  Also, how are the laws of gravity being broken?  If this were so, we wouldn't have to work so hard to move things.

			As pointed out above, it is important to realize science can't solve EVERYTHING(not at the moment it is discovered, at least).   Remember, that the idea of a black hole would have been laughed at only a century ago, let alone wormholes.
<br />

<br />

<br />
On the whole 10% of our brain thing, I think that is false.   I've heard that we use more like 99% of our brain.
<br />

<br />
So, while that argument goes down the hole, you do have to remember one arguement that stands up no matter what percentage of our brain we use.   It goes something like this:
<br />

<br />
&quot;If our brains were simple enough to understand, we would be too simple to understand them.&quot;

			Hey everybody. Do your research before you start a topic! Isn't it like a rule to BE INTELLIGENT! In fact, we use all of our brains but control very little of them. If we could control all of them we would have to think about moving our heart and breathing ALL THE TIME! I believe we don't use all our mental aspects of our brains but can never prove it since it isn't physical. I think psi comes from these mental regions.

			Thankfully for me, i'm too dumb and lazy to understand the human mind or any bio stuff, yet I can still move a psi wheel and alot of other things. You're thinking too hard XD!
<br />
As for your vamp question, i'd say visualize but I don't really believe in vamps anyway.
