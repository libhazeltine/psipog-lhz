			No, a feather does drop at the same rate as a pencil/bowling ball/anvil/&lt;insert random heavy object&gt;. The reason why they don't hit the ground at the same time if you go outside and test it is because of air resistance. If you were to go to the moon and drop them, they would hit the ground at the same time, because there is no air to slow down the feather.. This law applies to everything with mass in any area where there is gravity.

It was considered a fact at the time, yes. And now it has been disproven. Similarly, some of Newton's work was taken as fact when he came up with his theories, but now we know some of his theories to be false (not all of them, though). Besides, it was just an example.

How do you truly know that the world is round?  Have you seen it from far enough away?  For all we know, all those astronauts could be lying, or the roundness could be an illusion.

Just look far into the horizon of any ocean/lake. You can see the masts of ships, or &quot;peaks&quot; yet not the actual ship. If the world was flat you would be able to see the entire ship.

Hey Jake I like this one, but have a different version of it. I'm very confident it said &quot;There are only 2 things that are infinite. The universe, and music&quot; -Albert E.

I'm wondering where you got that from. Mabye I'm wrong, mabye there are a couple versions....but I'm sure I know another that was just like yours but it wasn't by einstein. &quot;Two things are infinite: Human stupidity, and the universe; and I'm not so sure of the former&quot;
