			Heres the skit type thing, I was hungry awhile ago so I poured a bowl of apple jacks then realized the milk was left out and'd gotten warm, but not bad; mind you i poured the milk in already. So I put my cereal and the gallon away, my cereal under a closed standing chocolate sauce bottle. I recall thinking about putting Chocolate on it for some ungodly known reason for a few seconds. Regardless I came back to the compy and remembered that Id cereal in the fridge to eat, I got up and realized that the bottle was open, tipped on its side and chocolate sauce was all over my cereal! XDD Choclate Apple Jacks are apparently very tasty....

			How appropriate for the Psychokinesis section of the forums.  I mean, when I think psychokinesis, I think about cereal since the two are so intertwined that to speak of one forces you to speak of the other!
<br />

<br />
Please make sure this sort of drivel is in General Discussion next time.

			Well since this topic includes Psychokinesis, it can be posted here. No big deal, just because Psychokineisis affected some chocolate and cereal doesn't mean it's un-related to Psychokinesis.  If I spin my psi-wheel, and tell people here about it, and ask how to move on, is that General Discussion? No.

You don't need to be rude to him about it.

Just putting in my thoughts.

Actually, I think my post was more funny than it was mean, but meh, I guess some people have thicker skins than others.  There's really not much validity to this  claim.  I think it was a pretty stupid post considering the other threads that are started in the psychokinesis section.  Well, compared to most....

Lmao. Roy is right.
<br />
The only people that whined about it, were the newer ones. They don't know other members personalities etc. Never take ANYTHING to heart, that Roy or DanielH come out with. Or you'll never make it out alive MUHAHAHA. Anyway.
<br />

Cereal and psyhokinesis. Interesting.
