			Hey Everyone, 
<br />

<br />
I am here because I need you're help with something. I swear it that I am NOT making any of this up, and it really worries me because I'm scared one day I'm gonna end up like Rainsong, except I won't be able to get out.
<br />
I haven't acutally passed through anything...at least I think I haven't. But I've been noticing that when I relax myself, everything solid starts to soften out and I can feel myself getting shorter...
<br />
The other day, I was sitting at my desk talking to someone (...or was it listening to music?) and I started to watch my desk get taller than me.
<br />
I got up and I looked at my chair, it hadn't gotten lower or anything...I did it again, and I felt my chair sorta getting soft and giving under me.
<br />
It was the same with the desk and my hand. 
<br />
It wasn't painful...and I'm not sure if I passed through, or what. It's just that...things get soft...and I feel SOMETHING passing...not sure what...
<br />
What is this? Is this phasing?

			This might be one of the 'siddhi's that Martial Artist has talked about in the meditation forum. It's just being able to change your size, basically.
<br />

<br />
Have you been able to do it at will? Has there been any instance where you've, seeminly, gotten larger?

Actually...yes. It does seem that I get larger or smaller at will. I didn't know that was an ability... <img src="images/smiles/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" border="0" /> I can do that little melting into the furniture thing at will...Sometimes I do feel larger, and sometimes measure an inch bigger than I did...sometimes I seem shorter, and measure off that way too...
<br />
That's the entire reason why I can't say if I'm 5'3 or 5'4. I float.

			Hmmm, very interesting indeed. Although I have no input towards this phenomena. 
<br />
Maybe MartialArtist can give his thoughts on this...
