			oh for f*** sakes - yes... it can happen - it's easy.  and it's easy to control.  it's also easy to go into another person and feel them having sex.  I've had a few minds poking me while I was having sex - trying to be invisible.

energy manipulation - whether you're a serial killer or a saint, you can do it.  The universe is a machine, nothing means anything.  Stop questioning yourself.  You know it was real.  One of the benefits of using people for energy - this kind of thing is figured out much more easily.

What do you mean by &quot;go into another person&quot; ? Telepathy?Empathy?..Be more specific..This doesn't seem that easy to me. Any documentation? Scientific reports?..If it's so easy there must be something.....Just asking?

I'm not embarassed (maybe a little) but the reason why I wanted to edit it out is because there are children about. So I wouldnt get in trouble if I traumitized any kids.

Also, I'm fairly sure astral sex refers to the unifying of two beings as one, out of their physical form, it's supposed to be a euphoria that physical sex can't hope to match. My opinion is she faked it, or that she felt what her mind wanted her to feel, but that's just what I think. If thats really how it went then more power to you.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I'm a guy....I guess you have to be a guy to get it so its why it didnt work on freakinrican626 because I thought she was a he. Mainly because I thought she was a he because of the avatar. &quot;Now&quot; that is something I need to be embarrsed about. 
<br />

<br />
How I fix the darn thing is somethnig I am also not proud of. All I did was simply masterbate.....I don't like masterbation is not because of religionish ideals is most likely most of you are thinking. But instead most of it goes agasint my own philophecy. Not only that repeating the same darn thing (trying not to curse) is unbelieveably annoying to me. But its the only thing that stops me from taking advancage in my luid dreams that comes up with the problem. 
<br />

<br />
I don't know why but I can never get my self to think to my max in my dreams (well I did once but it was only once and it was my first luid dream 7 years ago..and only for a moment) but it tends to come natureal to me to do it.
<br />

<br />
Something that comes natureal to me in my dreams is teleportation which I'm proud of. Most of the times I'm not even adware I'm dreaming but still do it. Sucks that I can't get myself to do it in real life  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
Awww, I thought your solution would be that. But that solution is not right for me, because I am trying to be celibent (sp?) for a spiritual reason.  So I must find a different solution....if there is one.

go into the subtle - between the astral and the physical, &quot;feel&quot; the person out, and know what they're doing.  eating [you can taste the food], sex, etc.  I used a focus on water and did it unintentionally then confirmed.   Just like you can &quot;find a person&quot; and where they are if you've established a link with them.
<br />

<br />
Experiment for yourself.  everyone works differently.  mine happened on accident when I was experimenting with something else -- then I recreated it.   As for close up, it's about moving the other person's energy - cycling it and knowing how to sustain a longer orgasm, where to touch, etc.

I kinda have found a new one.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  
<br />
I am not sure if it works extremely well though. Although I have been using it for 5 days or so. Well, before I go to bed I tell myself that I am not going to have a wet dream. I usually do it with an angry tone in my head. But wait theres more! 
<br />
Okay, wet dreams occur because you haven't had any sexual action right? Well, to solve it just think of some naughty thoughts but don't do anything. Then your mind should be content with that and then nothing will happen. I thought of that technique because whenever I wanted a lucid dream with a woman if you know what I mean,  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />   I never got one  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />  
<br />
If you think sexual you won't get sexual, if you don't think sexual you will get sexual. Does that make sense? You must train your mind, like a dog. 
<br />
Tell me if they work for you.

Awww, I thought your solution would be that. But that solution is not right for me, because I am trying to be celibent (sp?) for a spiritual reason.  So I must find a different solution....if there is one.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I kinda have found a new one.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  
<br />
I am not sure if it works extremely well though. Although I have been using it for 5 days or so. Well, before I go to bed I tell myself that I am not going to have a wet dream. I usually do it with an angry tone in my head. But wait theres more! 
<br />
Okay, wet dreams occur because you haven't had any sexual action right? Well, to solve it just think of some naughty thoughts but don't do anything. Then your mind should be content with that and then nothing will happen. I thought of that technique because whenever I wanted a lucid dream with a woman if you know what I mean,  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />   I never got one  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />  
<br />
If you think sexual you won't get sexual, if you don't think sexual you will get sexual. Does that make sense? You must train your mind, like a dog.

If you decipher your patterns, you won't have to resort to that.  Take a little time to know how your energy functions - you're just jumping in the air with &quot;ta da!&quot; - it takes a little more control and focus than that.  If you want a lucid dream teach yourself to be awake while sleeping, and induce it.  There's been plenty of research done on that - and many methods.

Ehh, well, it works so far. How much time should I put into it then? Should I meditate an hour over it?
