			Some of you may go to the Psion Guild website, and know this term:
<br />

<br />
Generator:
<br />
A term used to describe born-psis who have a tremendous capacity and generation ability, as well as facility with other psi-energy abilities. Also known as &quot;Phoenix Psychics&quot;, &quot;Phoenixes&quot;, &quot;Trex'ata&quot;, or &quot;Energizers&quot;.
<br />

<br />
I am not born with this ability. But I think it would be an interesting experiment if you could enhance your own psi capacity and generation. I figure this could work by constantly creating LOTS of psi in a steady flow? I've tried it once or twice, sort of fun. I visualize myself on fire, a purple fire (my representation of psi), and slowly the flames just dance around a bit. They also go upwards to show psi coming out of the body, and more flames coming up to replace them. I also visualize that my entire body is full of psi--glassy and see through, and absolutely surging with it.
<br />

<br />
The negative side may be accidentally exhausting yourself from overworking it.. so, I'd recommend you don't try it too often. Sort of like building endurance for track; run some one day, run for longer another day, and so on.
<br />

<br />

			Sounds like a site full of people with wild and imaginative fantasies.
<br />

<br />
The source of energy we utilize may as well be considered infinite. It is the strength of our connection to it, via the strength of our minds, and the type of mind each person has, that determines how well we can &quot;wield&quot; the energy, and for how long at a time.
<br />

<br />
You could use cool names like that if you wanna, but really, they mean nothing. Words, useless. Meaningless. Serving only to alter one's ego.
<br />

<br />
The connection is all the matters. Within the connection lies everything. Control, Power, Endurance. You think your body generates the power? that is an egotistical thought, and to me, it is wrong. But does that make it wrong? Not neccesarily. Here's how I see it:
<br />

<br />
Your body can merely collect the energy derived from the connection, and i'm not sure that it is even neccesary. In reality, no body can truly &quot;hold&quot; more at any given time, if the body is even needed at all. If the bodies do hold the energy, then all bodies can hold an amount that has no definitive limit, I truly believe.
<br />

<br />
The connection is what determines how much and for how long, for everyone. And the mind is what determines the connection.
<br />

<br />
As above, so below. The plane of mind is above the plane of matter. The plane of mind is above the plane of energy. Therefore, above, in mind, is where all determinants are factored. The mind controls the energy. The energy is above matter, and therefore controls matter.
<br />

<br />
This is only a rough, and as far as i'm concerned, barely intelligible understanding concerning what you speak of, but it is all I can muster.
<br />
Truly, even if I did understand it better than I do (and there is ALWAYS room for a greater knowledge) I'm not sure that I could put it to words more accurately than that.
<br />

<br />
Words, I've come to realize, are an incredibly crude medium, and over time I am becoming more annoyed with them. Impatient.
<br />

<br />
(had to edit this one up a bit)
<br />

<br />
Oh yeah, and about what you said regarding pooling psi regularly. You speak of practice. What we speak of, collection &quot;psi&quot; energy, is a skill. Practice any skill and you will get better. The connection improves with practice, and an intuitive understanding is gained over time.

Then it is impossible to overload? I think there are plenty of well experienced energy workers, myself included, who would tell you that not only is it possible to overload oneself, it's relatively painful to do so, and there <span style="font-style: italic">are</span> physiological consequences.

I am more than happy to listen to your thoughts at the conceptual level. This will not guarantee that they are understandable, because you don't seem to be able to support this relatively weak metaphysical definition very well.

Will you please cite a source? You always speak from some kind of authority but you never claim what it is. You speak of things as definite fact where in fact you have a poor understanding. The fact that you think we can control infinite amounts of energy, or process these things, demonstrates a general lack of experience.
<br />
[Edit: actually, sorry, your &quot;source&quot; probably is too good for those pesky &quot;words,&quot; which means that your argument is unfalsifiable because it's too correct for language. Pity, that.]
<br />

<br />

<br />
Now, what to say about Generators...
<br />

<br />
Generators are among the few &quot;Guild Classifications&quot; that I will accept. I am one of the directors of the Psion Guild, alongside WW. I don't buy the genetic classifications so much - I prefer the &quot;Natural&quot; &quot;Latent&quot; and &quot;Non&quot; classifications which Rainsong and I popularized here years ago.
<br />

<br />
However, Generators seem to be relatively distinct and clearly identifiable. The amount of energy they generate, as well as their distinctive energetic behaviors and unique fields, certainly allows them to be classified unto themselves. As far as mimicking the code, it's certainly possible, and can be done fairly easily. The problem is that while generators seem to have some kind of nervous system functional difference, most people don't. When the same amount of energy a generator may use is put into a normal person, it's usually too much, and results in an overload. From personal experience, I can say that the only way I've been able to maintain a generator-field full of energy has been to keep it circling well outside my system. They have overloaded me before.
<br />

<br />
Generators also seem to have a number of physiological problems which result from their state, but we don't have a large enough subject pool to generalize this properly. The few generators we have all seem to demonstrate a similar group of disorders, however, especially nervous system disorders. As a whole, the generator bit seems to be less fruitful than it initially seems.
<br />

<br />
Like many natural states, there is a blessing and a curse.

Not quite, it would appear that the generators we have seem to be heading for shorter lifespans. It burns out eventually. Don't tell them I said that, though. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Such a project is under research: The work is very difficult and potentially unsafe without proper controls, basically even if a successful way to do this is found its still going to be incredibly difficult, so I hope you weren't thinking of doing this a shortcut. As to the source of psionic energy both sides please not that there is inadequate data to wage this argument as both views can be backed by some experiences but each is unconclusive. And even if you wish to argue that it is not the point of this thread so take it to pm or another thread.

			There is a way of changing your own energy system to be a generator.  Now in the &quot;transmutates&quot; the generating capacity varies, but it is still a lot higher than joe smo. 
<br />

<br />
There are plenty of ways to enhance one's own energy system (but transmutation by yourself is, i believe, unheard of).  You must first be able to recognize your energy system to work on it and advance it.  There are lots of techniques out there, but you just must find someone who knows what they are doing or what not (which is not me on advancing energy systems...I have others for that).
<br />

<br />
Generators (I prefer the term &quot;Phoenix&quot;...much cooler) do produce a LOT more psi than &quot;an average psion&quot;.  Xiousladyn, the concept of infinite psi is true, but not from one's own generation of it.  Anyone can draw psi from the earth, etc.  That psi is infinite.  Yet the psi of yourself, the stuff that your own energy system and body creates, is limited.  Even the Phoenix's energy system is limited in its creations, granted though, the limitiations are much higher.  You have to believe researched documentation, or at least not shrug it off, because I know the Guild put a lot of time into research for things like that...
<br />

<br />
I am a phoenix (generator, w/e), btw.  I find that if I stretch my psionic muscles once a day by charging up and burning my emotional cache that the next day I can do it better.  Just like a muscle, you rip it up, and it heals and gets bigger.  Same idea here.  And anyone can do that....

That's the primary characteristic. There are others. It's the only &quot;birthswitch&quot; which I can't outright dismiss, simply because the differences are utterly obvious at first glance.

Exercising and using the energy system actively can result in it improving. Transmutation allegedly works by the transference of the complex energetic &quot;programming&quot; from a generator to another individual. The changes are complete and pervasive. What evidence we do have also seems to demonstrate that transmutates inherit the same slew of physiological disorders that generates eventually procure - primarily fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.

Depending on your definition of the term &quot;psi,&quot; it's arguable that that stuff is not psi at all. In my book, I discuss briefly my hypothesis of psi generation as part of the action of the nervous system. It is a somewhat well support hypothesis, but it is by no means solid. It does, however, find support in correlations such as the alignment of &quot;energy centers&quot; with ganglia and the fact that psi working drains the body of nutrients vital to nervous function. Should we adopt this definition (and it is the most frequently used today), then external energy not generated by living things with nervous systems is not psi at all, but something different.

Not as much as you'd like to think. It isn't worthy of being called a theory - there's a &quot;birthswitch hypothesis.&quot; And it's very poorly researched and documented. Of all the birthswitches, though, generators are the best documented and researched, if only because the founders of the hypothesis, ANKA and WingedWolf, are a generator and transmutate, respectively.

I don't &quot;do birthswitches,&quot; but this is getting a bit tiring. Until you talk to WW or someone who &quot;does birthswitches&quot; other than Miri or Genjo, I'm going to stick to saying you aren't. You don't feel like one, you aren't as big as one, you don't act like one, and you don't hurt my poor brain like one.

It should be noted with some care that &quot;ripping it up&quot; in this case can result in permanent damage - keep in mind that your energetic system is <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> a muscle. Seeing as it is heavily influenced by the nervous system, and the nervous system cannot regrow the way the skeletomuscular system can, it is important that people be careful. It's not difficult to cause some rather serious neurological damage by overdoing psionic work, especially by burning oneself out intentionally on a daily basis.

			Yes elliptic, I should have noted that burnouts can occur and that temporary/permanent loss of some psionic abilities can also occur if one over does it.
<br />

<br />
I still don't understand how you don't get that I am a generator, lmao.  Although some people have troubles finding me and scanning me effectively which has consistently been a problem....Every person that scans me (even people unaffiliated with me, such as random scanners) find that my field is large and psi production large as well...Beyond all that, my eyes: dark outer ring, blue/green middle area, and a hazel inside area <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  Also have dark hair.
<br />

<br />
And besides all that, I dont know what to tell you....
<br />

<br />
*Edit* I found something else to tell you, lol....I also have a lot of physical issues as well, Type 1 Diabetes, Coats disease in my right eye, ADD, and high cholesterol...

			Can someone explain what 'doing birthswitches' and 'transmutating' is to me? Also.. so.. Basically, I wouldn't want to become a generator, would I?
<br />

<br />
I was thinking of more expanding my own psionic abilities through practice, sort of like working out.

			Wait for Elliptic on this but as far as I can tell transmutating is when an generator does some sort of high power technique to radically change a person into a generator. This kind of systemic change all at once I'd think would be highly unsafe so you definetely don't want to do it that way.

			&quot;Birthswitches&quot; are Guild's terms for various psionic &quot;states&quot; in which people are born, including &quot;specialties,&quot; of which generators are one. I personally just stick to the more traditional distinctions of naturals, latents, and nons, but they do what they want, really.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Transmutation&quot; is basically the transference of a copy of the &quot;generator code&quot; (yes, the ability to move an energetic system from one person to another and achieve similar results does indicate that genetics don't factor, it's not my hypothesis, remember) from the generator to the target person to make permanent changes to the energy system. There are untold repercussions from doing this, and it's hardly wise.

			Well, as I have heard from round the way, generators have very distinctive eyes, such as the ones I described of myself.  
<br />

<br />
They also have other issues:  bad tempers, bad moods occasionally, aggressive, supposedly territorial (i d k about that one for me), and stubborn.  Except for the one I said I am not, I am all the others as well.
