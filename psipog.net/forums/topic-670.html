			I'm new to the web-site, but not the subject. And I think having to wait two weeks from account creation to chat priviledges is a little..... too out of the ordinary. Perhaps whatever need lies behind the cause could be approached in a different manner.

			The two-week wait keeps the chatroom from being flooded with fluff. Psipog isn't the only place that does it. On Myspace, you have to wait a week before you can use their forums.

			Well, fluff.  Thinking about fluff.  Now I've seen fluff. An example is the site-published chat lesson by Peebrain on creating psi balls. Not the instruction am I refering to, but rather to unstudious students. I can see the fluff, and I am subject, therefore aware of, your rule in reducing fluff.  I also know that I do not know if the fluff-reduction-rule was in place during the lesson.  So I can't argue confidently the effectiveness of the rule, or I might do-so.  That said.
<br />

<br />
I am assuming that &quot;cult&quot; and &quot;crazy&quot; were humorous terms, and I've done the practices here. And fried the chicken.
<br />

<br />
Well, I give up though, I'll wait the two-weeks.

			The two weeks is in place for two basic reasons:
<br />

<br />
1. It stops fluff.  And it does a wonderful job.  The basic pattern of fluff is: sign up, ignore all articles, enter chat and ask the same questions over and over again, then quit after a week.  Putting up a two week block gets rid of 80% of the fluff.
<br />

<br />
2. It gives experienced people time to read about how PsiPog does things.  I understand that there are experienced people out there, but the reality of the situation is that just because you have experience in psionics doesn't mean you know exactly how PsiPog functions.  A lot of times experienced people will come into the chat, and talk about New Age theories of talking to dead people through astral projection, or something like that.  If they can do that, it's wonderful, and they are experienced.  HOWEVER, they aren't aware that PsiPog doesn't allow those types of discussions (no religion).
<br />

<br />
Being experienced in psionics doesn't mean you know how to act in the PsiPog community.  Taking some time to read about how we do things, and what we like and don't like, gives you a good understanding of where WE are coming from.  That way, if you decide to chat, you can still talk about the things you want - but you are more aware of what we'll be willing to listen to.  (And if you say something off the wall, you won't be shocked when half the chat says &quot;bullshit&quot;).
<br />
