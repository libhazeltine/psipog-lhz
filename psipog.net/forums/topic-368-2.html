			I think it's ok if some people see psi as some sort of magic. Never heard anyone say:&quot;You create your own reality&quot; ?
<br />
If you think something is possible it is possible
<br />
If you think something isn't possible... then it isn't possible
<br />

<br />
In a sort of way you really create your own reality. It makes me feel more comfortable in some situations too. And it really does help me with a lot.
<br />

<br />
With the creating of your own reality they don't mean it only affects your mind. It affects everything around you.

			Ok this sounds a bit odd due to the different use of the word the second time, but reason is there for a reason. Remember that tk is the most well know and potentially one of the easier ways that you can kill yourself practicing psionics, hence why I like to at least know the strain and energy costs it can take.

			First off, we humans being three dimensional beings, it is impossible for us to &quot;defy&quot; gravity.  You see, according to Einstein?s theory of general relativity, gravity occurs when a three dimensional object occupies otherwise two dimensional space, thus warping it and giving it depth.  For example, a trampoline represents untouched empty space while a golf ball will represent the earth.  When pushed across, the ball will roll across unhindered.  Now, if we were to place a cinderblock at the center of the trampoline (which we will call the sun) it would &quot;warp&quot; the empty space.  If the earth were to roll past now it would slingshot around it.  When applied to outer space this concept is called orbit, seeing as how there is no friction or one directional gravity out there.  So the only way to neutralize this effect would be to somehow un-warp space leaving behind only a 2d matrix.  Now the bad thing about this is that in 2d space there is no up or down thus making levitation impossible.  So in reality gravity is the one thing that even makes levitation possible.
<br />
	In conclusion just believing that gravity doesn?t apply to you is about as effective as believing that you can breathe underwater.
<br />

<br />
Oh yeah, and psionics actually does qualify as magick.

			Pernety we don't mean it in that sense when we say confusing it with magic, we mean the person thinks &quot;this happens in a totally unknown way that defies everything we know about the world and couldn't possibly fit into our pool of current reason&quot;

And for the point of continuing said argument light also exerts some force, it's just so small we never notice it.  However, scientists have discovered that when placing a piece of very light metal inside a beam of light three times as bright as the sun in a vacuum, it will move noticeably.

			There are many stories and eye-whitness accounts about levitating people. So, yes it can be done. I'm not sure about this being the way to accomplish levitation. Torturing your body isn't really a smart thing to do.
<br />
It is just another state of mind, you have to get yourself into. Try it without the torture first, ok? <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Why not use psi's natural magnetic pull and push.  You know how psi balls tend to sometimes have that magnetic feel?  well why not try and create sheild with a magnetic feel.  If it is strong enough and programed to repel the magnetic forces that are produced by the elements in the ground.  Before anyone says it...Everything has a magnetic field.  It's basic chemistry not rocket science.
