			sounds like a strange question, but a good one in my opinion. 
<br />

<br />
if i concentrate hard enough, i can produce an effect like the &quot;see-saw&quot; effect with the same vibrations you get before an OBE. 
<br />

<br />
just for future study, do all OBE techniques involve sleep? because if it doesnt, then i can achieve an OBE without falling asleep, or have it take an hour to do so.
<br />

<br />
i'm not that hopeful on answers on this question, but no harm trying.
<br />

<br />
oh, and i have never had an obe but the vibrations exclaimed before one i can achieve easily.

			Very good question, yes, to a certain extent i have never heard of anyone having an OBE while not on the sleep/awake border, but it may be possible, who knows? All the techniques i have read involve the body being completly asleep and the mind being awake/half asleep.
<br />

<br />
Important thing with the vibrations: Learn to control them, move them to different parts of the body, then try to spread them out all over the body and up into your head, the way i leave my body is to push these vibrations out through my head.

			Just stay there wait for them, they will come. I think they come natraully for most people... you could try and induce them your self, visualise a part of your body vibrating really fast then if you start to feel it move it around and play with it.

			You can do a number of things, imagine yourself floating gently upwards, roll sidewards, or just sit up.

			Robert Peterson reported having OBEs in the waking state.  I think it's possible, just rare.  I personally have never done it.

			Hey MikeV great tip, im gonna try the floating up one first tho have a feeling that will be the one. And thats kinda wierd to have an OBE when waking up hmmmm, well im gonna start pondering about that and find a reason why that happens. Did he like wake up from a nightmare and he woke up so suddenly that his soul flew out? Well there can be many reasons, and ive never really thougth about that.
