Uh, yeah. I'm assuming you're a teenager in the 13-16 age range... which means naturally you want to &quot;get some&quot;, but if you haven't had success &quot;getting some&quot;, you'll &quot;get some&quot; in your dreams.
<br />

<br />
Those are the fun dreams. Try to go lucid in them. Remind yourself that you don't &quot;get any&quot;, so when you find yourself &quot;getting some&quot; you should ask &quot;is this a dream?&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Then control it and live out your wildest desires.

			it think it is a very legitimate question though. There will be times when someone tries to obe and either shifts into a sex dream, or isnt focusing due to hormones racing... People should know why, and how to stop it.

			I'm not sure about dreams literally predicting the future, but maybe taking a very good guess based on recent events? The sub-c can mostly do any problem much faster than the normal concious can ever do, so you might keep actively asking &quot;what will happen next?&quot;, so then your sub-c will maybe meet you one day in a dream, and say &quot;I'll show you what will probably happen next&quot;.

			My dreams come true much more often than I would like them to (NO, I'm not going to talk about my sex dreams thease really are sort of precog)
<br />
Actually that's how I got interested in parapsychology...
<br />
1. When I was about 10 I had a dream (in color) that ther was a hudge fire.. I've seen exactly where in the city the fire was and about a year later there was a hudge fire at that same place FOR REAL!!!! <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />
It turned out a bunch of bombs went off in a police storadge house but I eve &quot;knew&quot; it wold happen late at night (It was late and dark in a dream too)... <img src="images/smiles/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" border="0" /> 
<br />
2. About 6 months ago I had a dream in which a bunch of bug and spider attacked one of my classmates... I tought that was wierd so I told her. She starred at me for like half an hour and told me she had had the THAT same dream... I even &quot;guessed&quot; where it had &quot;happened&quot; (school)
<br />

<br />
The wierd thing is I never had any practice when those things happened, I've also dreamed other stuff I couldn't have posibly known but I feel weir enough telling you this.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />
My parents think I'm crazy and my friends freak out every time I tell them I had a dream about them...
