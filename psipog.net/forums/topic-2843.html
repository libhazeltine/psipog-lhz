Human evolution will take a long time so hell if i know.  Probably not anything to do with psionics.  We will probably all turn into walruses

Evolution is when a species change due to survival of the fittest.  If there is a white moth and a black moth in an evironment with white trees, the black one will get eaten the most.  Therefore, over time, the moths will be all white.  That is evolution.  What about the running out of oil we have?  What about the trees? (tree hugers are weird)  What about everything else?  Evolution will always happen no matter what.  It just is a matter of what will change.

Yeah... <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
And about main question of topic.......isn't there theory(maybe even on PsiPog.net) that we used Telekinesis, Aura Vision, and all other things in our past, and we forgot them becouse we don't need them anymore(for defence agains animals primary <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> )
<br />

<br />
In that case, this can't be next step in evolution right, its already there? <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
But anyway, I don't think I'll be there to see results of evolution, so whatever happens, it good <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I think, for starters we will all get taller, because that has been showing over the past generations. Secondly, I think that genetics does play a part in psionics, so our children will be much more successful with it. The mind is CONSTANTLY evolving, no matter what. It has a hunger that no other organism has. Humans have a thirst for knowledge that is useful to them and stuff they don't know, and so they always will, until the point that we know everything. It's in our nature. 
<br />
We will probably evolve to have better memories (e.g. savonts) to make knowledge easier to obtain. We are not built for combat, but to reason <span style="font-style: italic">around</span> combat. That's how we are designed.

			The theory that we used to have telepathy (not auric vision or TK) was Freud's.  He believed it was necessary to survive because grunts alone were not advanced enough to communicate all that was necessary.  So he believed before spoken language, TP was needed for our survival and was phased out as we began to speak.
<br />

<br />
As for our evolution, I also don't think our evolution will be greatly affected by psi or anything else.  To do so would mess up our rather delicate but potentially very useful meridian/chakra system.  With such a system's potential, I doubt that nature could top it's usefulness.  Perhaps that's why we were given brains to create inventions and institutions that countered the dictum of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; (like medicines that save the sick, houses that protect us from predators and the elements, supermarkets where food is acquired without hunting, etc.).

			Some of those inventions and institutions have done quite a bit of harm. How many people do you think were obese (so much so that it was life-threatening) when we had to hunt and forage for food. Not many.
<br />

<br />
Actually, I think it was the advent of the car and computer, paired with the arrival of ultra-fatty fast food, that's caused that problem.

We've still got a ways to go yet.
