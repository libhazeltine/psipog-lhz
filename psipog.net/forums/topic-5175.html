			well ...I found a website showing how it works...
<br />
they placed 5 cup of hot water around the wheel... guess what it sping like hell...  like with your hand why you think that it hard to make it spin the opther way ..  well try moving your hand a little bit and see it will spin the other way...
<br />

<br />
same thing about foil... or a straw...  its static...
<br />

<br />
sorry guys i wanted to believe too but i cant now ... i tried it without my hand... nothing would turn .. i tried it with my hand aside it .. woooo it turns.... 
<br />
Why do you think its harder to make it move under a glass... you have to make the warmt inside the glass... then it will work too ..
<br />

<br />
well i cant believe i was trying it without my hand.. 
<br />

<br />
well done !

			So, you think the psiwheel is due to heat from your hands, or static electricity.......  <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=4112" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4112</a>.

			This isn't entirely true. It is possible to move the pinwheel using only heat, but that doesn't explain moving it over large distances, such as across the room, or moving it without anything next to it. It also doesn't explain the moving larger objects, like pens, pencils, cell phones, watches, etc. Another question: What about those that are able to control the direction of the movement, the speed, or whether it is in fact moving or not? He says a change in position? What about those that don't change the position of their hands at all and it changes direction or stops? Heat, of course. Wait... that doesn't make sense, does it? Nothing is changed other than what they're concentrating on it doing... but it changes? 
<br />
I'm not saying he's wrong - the pinwheel can be moved with just heat, but it can also be moved without it.

Sorry to break it to you, but people in this community aren't going to bend over backwards to make you a &quot;believer&quot;.  Some are quite offensive about the whole &quot;impossible skeptic&quot; thing.  If you want to know if psi is real, try it yourself, as any video or picture can be faked in any number of ways, and even a live webcam demonstration by another could be falsified.

			well i know everything can be faked .. and all TKers seems to all have good explaination too ..but the thing is ... Why does PsiPogBB.net does a forum with skeptic section if no one is interested in answering about it ? 
<br />

<br />
last question ..  why people always try to move light things like a small paper on a needle ? y not a big piece of paper but not only big but also it has to be high in the air.. not down to the desk .. up high so it could be harder for the heat to make it turn ? 
<br />

<br />
if really you have tk then it wont be a problem for you ... lets say tie it up to a rope down the ceilling and then move it ?? 
<br />

<br />
but im pretty sure you'll think of a reason why you wont do this .. 
<br />
-lets say umm... i have to great powers to try it for you
<br />
-i wont do backwards for you
<br />
-i dont want the million dollars i rather stay poor with my great power .
<br />

<br />
thx anyway

			It is not that no one is interested in answering the questions posed in the Skeptics Forum, it is that many people feel that most skeptics are ignorant, and refuse to believe, regardless of how much proof is shoved in their faces.
<br />

<br />
It takes skill to manipulate larger objects.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">I</span>, personally, am not very good at PK, but there are many others on the site who are and could, easily.
<br />

<br />
Many feel that it would be a waste to show everyone their psionic powers.
<br />
The James Randi Educational Foundation's $1 Million Challenge has been the subject of much discussion on these forums.  Many claimants are turned down or are denied the right to participate in the challenge.  A full and complete article about Peebrain's (the site administrator) experiences with the organization can be found at <a href="../art-beware-pseudo-skepticism.html" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/show.php?cmd=wp&amp;id=14</a>

			You know WHY you never see everything? Because that would require multiple cameras. The fact is people don't care about convincing skeptics enough to go out and buy multiple cameras to capture the same thing from different angles. There would still be some other excuse. You can never prove something to someone who doesn't want to believe it. There is no such thing as absolute proof. 
<br />

<br />
For example: I don't want to believe in gravity, because we don't have an explanation of how it works right? Therefore gravity doesn't exist. It doesn't matter that I deal with it daily, I don't believe it exists. I can take any amount of proof and it still means nothing because my belief overrides anything you can show me. I can make up a crazy explanation for anything.
<br />

<br />
Note that this is an extreme example. The explanations you provided involving heat and static are plausible, and probably happen in many cases of perceived TK with beginners. The thing is, Apollo can move a stapler. How does static explain that? Oh wait it doesn't, so that means that video is fake right? 
<br />

<br />
This isn't to say you shouldn't question things. Just don't make a blanket statement when you haven't explained everything. The logic of &quot;The psiwheel is easily influenced by heat, and the straw by static, therefore TK is false&quot; isn't logic. It means that the psiwheel and straw can be influenced, and if you were to draw ANY conclusion, it should be that the psiwheel and straw are fake. Not all of PK.
<br />

<br />
Those videos are meant to be inspiration, not proof.
<br />

<br />
Also, the reason we have a skepticism forum is for things that may be real, or for valid arguments. That argument is invalidated by the lack of explanation for larger objects, besides the fall-back of &quot;its a faked video.&quot; This argument you have brought up has been brought up more times then I can count. Thats why people are so tired and flame prone.

when i was young... i used to watch David Coperfield .. and i thought wow this man can fly no wire nothing .. wow this man talk with the devil for sure wow he disappear... wow 
<br />

<br />
what a great magician ...
