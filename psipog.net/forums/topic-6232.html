			I want somone to try doing the shadow clone jutsu that naruto does. I think i know how to work it but i haven't managed to do it yet but i know i can do it. BELIEVE IT!!!
<br />

<br />
Try think of what you look like in full perspective then draw out multiple images of what you see yourself as beside you or whereever you want them to be. Imagine that the people u want to see the clones are shocked and in fear. that might help.
<br />

<br />
Tell me how it goes. Try to make a vid as back up.

			I don't think this'll work with a camera, because a camera doesn't have a mind to trick. It CAN be done with a camera, but you gotta flare an entire psi clone of yourself, which is VERY difficult.

			lol I want that as a tatto... I doubt I'd do that though...
<br />

<br />
anyway.. you're dumb lol get real.  If you came about this a different way I'd say tried it, would take to much energy.  You could try filling your body with energy then shell that form program that and move your phsyical body and hope your human construct stays so now you have an A.I. construct. Repeat now you have gay justu and can have a massive orgy.
<br />

<br />
no seriously, we have better things to do then fantasize being naruto.  If you want to post something so fantastical then make it sound possible.

			k I'm sorry guy, Jynx493 is right. I'm all for never stopping to believe the capacities of the human mind but this... you put it in such a childish form that I want nothing to do with it.

Though no one is stopping you from fantasizing and I say that once you've had practice with smaller things and gotten good at them, you should go for it yourself. Start off easy.

			there are so many things that ARENT real.....get on with it....the life that u live might be false too..... remember the &quot;matrix&quot;? yeah......thats just ONE possibility....and that might be false too......so why not give a little trust into everything?

and althought naruto is fake....(like duh that there were no such things as hokages....) the jutsu part WAS from traditional ninjutsu practice....but its just blown up into crazy moves like gyokakyo no jutsu......

			he is right about &quot;justu&quot; though.  And it is possible, but would take years to master it I suppose if you could even make one... it's like making human a.i. structures.  Don't doubt the validity, just the lame source.

I was under the impression that a Mongoloid was of the overlying race from which most Asian races are derived.  That's like calling someone a CAUCASOID, or a NEGROID.
<br />

<br />
By the way, if you're white, you're most likely a Caucasoid.  And if you're black, you're most likely a Negroid.
<br />

<br />
(Just in case someone starts throwing up their arms in disgust or anger, these are TECHNICAL TERMS, I'm not being racist here.)
<br />

<br />
Okay, now for the actual subject... yeah, saying Ninjas practicing ninjutsu has ANYTHING to do with Naruto is like saying Alchemy is close to how it is portrayed in Full Metal Alchemist.
<br />

<br />
Do I like Full Metal Alchemist?  Yes.  Do I wish I could do that?  Yes.  Will I TRY to do that?  No.
<br />

<br />
F-I-C-T-I-O-N.  Look that word up.
<br />

<br />
Real alchemy is pretty interesting to research already, I don't need to obsess about &quot;how to transmute by clapping your hands together.&quot;  I know it's not gonna work.  And drawing a circle won't allow me to turn something into something else.  It's a nice thought, but it's just not gonna happen.
<br />

<br />
By the way, I was thinking about constructs recently, and I was thinking... if you gave it a certain amount of intelligence, enough to become sentient, wouldn't that mean that no matter what, you would have to try and protect it from dissipating, or being destroyed, or something?  I mean, in some ways, it's ALIVE....
<br />

<br />
Just saying, you'd hafta be careful....
