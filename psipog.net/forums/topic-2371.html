			I was watching this documentary once and they were talking about &quot;superhuman powers&quot;  (oooooh....psionics maybe?). Okay well they were talking about how this one scientist figured out how to see what we would call the aura. Honestly, I couldn't give you the nuts and bolts on how he did exactly, but it was really interesting.
<br />

<br />
They hooked up this one man to the machine that would read his aura. this man was apart of a mystical sect of islam and he claimed he could enduce rapid healing. So after they hooked his up to the machine and got a reading of his aura, he began to puncture the inside of his cheek w/ a sharped pointed object. Eventually he punctured it right through his cheek and you could see the pointed edge. It was really interested to read the reading on the machine now because there was no aura around his right cheek where he had punctured himself. 
<br />

<br />
So i hope that brings some interesting thoughts. If anyone could verify that from your own experiences or realize that that actually happened to you aura during certain experiences in your life I would appreciate it if you shared. I'm interested to hear what you have to say.

<br />

<br />
that was really interesting.
<br />

<br />
the yogic flying was an interesting topic. i'm not saying i believe it off the back, but it's something ill definitely try to investigate for myself.
<br />

<br />
i just find those shows so interesting because they talk about <span style="font-style: italic">us</span> and that's when i feel so separated from the rest of the world. there were a few times in the post where i almost called the rest of the world muggles, not because i say what we do is magical, but to try and portray the same basic idea. though i have to say im a little disappointed to say that because i'm one of those people that see everyone as equals and when i start to think that way, i feel.......weird. i dont know...i dont like thinking that way, but ya.

			First, why were you cutting yourself &quot;really deep&quot; anyways???
<br />

<br />
Second, could you provide some substantial proof of this amazingly fast healing you claim? If you don't, you're liable to set off the bullshit detectors of most everyone on this forum. Plus, a video of this stuff would be freakin' cool!
<br />

<br />
Third, I also say the &quot;yogic flying&quot; thing is BS as well. A lot of the easten mysticism is. (not all, but a lot.)

			it's one things to be able to heal bones rapidly like breaks that normally take 8 weeks only take 2 weeks but a cut still normally takes a day at least even for the rapidly healing person.
