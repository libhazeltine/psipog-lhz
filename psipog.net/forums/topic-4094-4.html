I've been unable to do tons of things that I can easily do in dreams, and the stuff hardly ever works correctly. Lights turn half on or not at all, keyboards don't type or type the wrong letters, monitors are extremely dim, that sort of thing. </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Has noone realized you are talking about dreaming. You don't need to make a guitar for it to work. You can grab a branch from a tree in your dream and have it sound better than anything ever made in the waking state. Your comment about lights being dim is extremely common and <span style="font-style: italic">usually</span> is not able to be corrected. Also the part about typing and reading in dreams and how that doesn't work properly. That's because you are not using the logical, or &quot;normal&quot; comprehension, part of your brain when dreaming. I notice many people tend to try and make things in their dreams work as they do in their waking state. I ask, why bother?Your dreams are what you make of them and can be more enjoyable than <span style="font-style: italic">anything</span> in &quot;this world&quot;. Do whatever you please in them. People need to start trying to make their waking state more like their dreams.

			That is a good point. However: This still isn't a functioning guitar as I was debating over. Not saying you can't play a full orchestra by yourself on the kazoo in a dream, but creating exact things from waking life which also work is challenging.

I don't know about making real life more like the dream state. It wouldn't make your life go well in most areas. Although that statement is quite broad. I'm not sure if you mean a particular area or just in general. In general is probably not a great idea.

Don't let me bother you, If I was who you were referring to. I just like to point out a few things which I've read about and experienced.
