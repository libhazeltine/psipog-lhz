			I just looked at Archmond's 'Enegizer Shield' topic and it gave me an idea.
<br />

<br />
Has anybody tried making a shield, of any kind, and programmed it to leech off of other people/things to keep itself alive?

			It isnt the nicest thing to steal other peoples energy from them without them knowing, actually it can be quite rude.  Sure you can say &quot;well they aren't using it.&quot; but in fact if your taking it from someone who doesnt practice psi they already have a low storage and they use that for daily funtions, they need energy to stay awake so taking it isn't nice.

			Not another leeching topic!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> hmmmmm....it woud defintely be possible. But taking energy from other people is a topic that will rage on for ages. I, personally, would never do it. Perhaps program it to take energy from it's surroundings exept living things and you're golden. There are other ways to keep a shiled alive than just leeching you know.

			As it has already been said leeching is not a new topic.  That being said it is always good to shield against leechers because well...no one really likes them.
<br />

<br />
There are plenty of ways to power your shields, some more clever than others.  One way I prefer is instead of using all my own energy I use &quot;node&quot; constructs which simply reform the energy in your environment around you.  This way it takes much less energy to accomplish your goals.  There used to be an article about it titled something like &quot;psychoenergitic integration.&quot;  For me it requires at least a mild trance.
<br />

<br />
Personally with all these other options I don't see a valid reason to use other people's energy, especially since you would have to run it through a converting construct to make it &quot;your own&quot; first, or at least I have to.  More trouble than it's worth if you ask me.

Ha. One time a few days ago, my girlfriend was sick, so i tried healing her through our psi-link. Well, for one, she wasn't healed, and for two, i almost collapsed the next day.
<br />

<br />

<br />
And regarding the person who created this topic, 
<br />
That would sort of be pointless. Why not just create the shield and leech them yourself?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" />

			Leeching isn't always bad. Once, one of my chickens (don't ask. ever.) was sick or something, and another one was in her cage. So i leeched the healthy chicken and turned the energy into a psiball, then i gave it to the sick one. Next day, the chicken was fine.

I guess it is that time when we point out that it's a chicken.

			Ok, then what about taking energy from the environment? Like the earth or the grass or something?
<br />

<br />
And to whoever said ''Why not leech from yourself?&quot;. I'm not so good with psi yet, so I need all of my own energy. And, just for the record, I haven't tried this shield yet.

Well, that's kinda how everyone else became good at psiballs and the likes. All leeching and using other peoples energy is gonna do is just make you evolve less. Your body needs to open up it's energy reserve to be able to make psi balls well. If you don't do that, then you wil probably &quot;clog up&quot; a little. Of course, taking energy from the environment every once in a while can't hurt your development.
