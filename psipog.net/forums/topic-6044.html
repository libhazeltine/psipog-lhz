			OK, here's the thing. Communism is an economic system that in it's ideal form leads to a perfect economy. Capitalism is also an ecomomic system that in it's ideal form leads to a perfect economy. The imperfection and inability of humans to uphold these ideals( this goes for political systems like democracy, republicanism, facism, and socialism as well) is what makes these systems bad or corrupt. Therefore pure socialists, Marxists, or democrats(little d, guys, little d. It doesn't mean the political party.) all have an ideal and utopian society as their ultimate goal. The ideas and their followers aren't inherently flawed, which is why ever making rash generalizations is completely unfounded. One of the most awesome friends I have is a big proponent of the American Marxist party and his ideas on politics are fantastically well thought out.

			People suck, thus communism fails. If people did not suck, communism could work. But they do, so trying to implement communism, especially on a large scale, is bound to fail.
<br />
People would have to really, really change for it to work. I do not see that happening.

			I heard of some theories that subject the need for choas for a civilation to grow. Such that is there was nothing but peace and order the civilation would be at a &quot;machine&quot; state. While choas means more of a &quot;organic&quot; state. Even it choas creates.........well choas I tend to see that it is sometimes needed for a civilation to grow. Some levels of human behavior are needed even if they are bad as they are.

Or lest some people tend to think. Any thoughts on this?

Is it really? Proof? Sources? I always thought we were evolving no matter what. I understand we're pretty much as smart as the ancient romans in terms of evolution but is it really proven that we're done evolving? I'd like sources. I personally do not believe we are done. I believe the way society lives life and the beliefs systems we are put into is what &quot;stunted&quot; the evolution process, but I think we are slowly working through these barriers.

			I studied evolution. My prediction for the next step in evolution is either an evolution of soceity created by willpower or the stupid people who don't use condoms. If left to nature the world will slowly become stupider. That is evolution but evolution implies positive gain so to make it easier I call it &quot;de-evolution.&quot;

Sooooooooo your saying you don't have proof we're not evolving. I don't even want your proof I just want any proof because I don't believe it's true. You said we're DONE evolving. Anything??
