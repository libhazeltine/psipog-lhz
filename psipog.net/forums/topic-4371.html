			Hey i am new and been practicing some Psi balls after talking in the chat room last night. But i had a dream were i became self aware.
<br />

<br />
What i remember is that it was something about &quot;Peace day&quot; for good and evil it was were good and evil was no aloud to influence the world for that day. I was there as the angel of balance.... i was told to read from the true book of creation and the meaning of life but as was reading it the text kept changing ask i was trying to read it. I then remembered a article about lucid dreaming on this site that when you get close or in lucid dreaming things change and are created and deleted at a high speed was i close because i just went to sleep after resting and this happened i didn't even expect it.

			It's a good thing you had a lucid dream. I've been able to keep a few seconds of lucidity in two dreams... I suck at it...

Talking about reading. I'm such a nerd I can say I read even while dreaming, of course whathever I read it's IN the dream. Weird uh?
