Dude, Li and Chan are severe minor leaguers compared to what Lee was.  Lee created his own version of Kung Fu specifically for himself, and was incredibly in tune with his body's chi.  Towards his death (I believe at the age of 32), engineers were creating actual metal machines that he could train against because he was far too powerful for conventional means (he'd kick a 150 lb. kickboxing bag so hard it'd break apart upon impact).  Bruce Lee was far beyond any Shaolin Monk, because he let every culture influence his training, and picked and chose what worked and what didn't.  Shaolins live in a box of their own core set of beliefs.  This is why you'd never see a Shaolin Monk in UFC or Pride, they'd get destroyed.

			Yes I am aware of everything related to Bruce Lee and his incredible power, but see that you didn't contradict my point in your post; in fact, you reinforced it. Bruce Lee created JKD, which<span style="font-style: italic"> is not</span> kung fu. The skill of extinguishing the candle is a traditional shaolin training excercise, and is not included in any of Bruce Lee's essays or Arts. Believe me, I agree just as much as anyone that Lee was the coolest person ever (even cooler than Chuck Norris), I do not think he could punch out candle flames from thirty feet away. Why do that when you can send a man flying thirty feet from a foot away?
