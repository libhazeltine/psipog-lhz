			many and most dreams are metaphorical. wether they're precognitive or not. personally, i don't believe in precognition as i've never experienced it, but it seems that perhaps you're about to lose something close to you. not necesarily your friend, though.
<br />
but, don't take me by my word. i'm no expert <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Usually havung the knowledge causes you to act differently so it might not even come true...

			ok Hi yeah I'm new big deal anyway.
<br />

<br />
I do the same thing about haveing things turn up exactly emotions sound sight reasons behind what we're doing everytihng and that includes the blank stare I give afterwards. I KNOW that it is not jsut deja vu' because one itme i told a friend about one of the dreams I DID remeember it happened and i went to her for a refference and it was exact. When this happens for me I'm usually asleep or I pass out (if standing when I wake up im still standing but mainly because i can sleep standing up) anyway this happens randomly to me and it's rare I remember it until it happens. I'm wanting to know is there anyway to control when this happens and a better way to remember it.
<br />
(I had one a couple of nigths ago where I had my first cigarret and I felt everything I always do when i black out. Now that I know it I can change that right?) srry for my annoying little self being her ebut I wanna understand wat is going on.

			I have future dreams
<br />
But if you dreamt your friend dieing in a car accident, and it's a real futurist dream. Your friend is gone, you dreamt the future if it is the correct future your friend will die
<br />
Hopefully your friend lives on

how... encouraging. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

Hmm... I once dreamt that I was hit by a red, double-deck bus while I was walking through an underpass. I had emerged onto the street from some wild vegitation, and I had been walking on a rock trail.
<br />

<br />
I had a suitcase or something in my hand, and I'm pretty sure someone was with me. Then I look left, and bam.
<br />

<br />
I've got a gut feeling that the dream was a premonition, and I'm looking both ways before walking through underpasses from now on.
<br />

<br />
The point is, if you think they are premonitions, act on them instead of watching them come true.

			I don't believe in seeing the future. Your mind plays a trick on you using Deja Vu to make you believe you are seeing the future. WARNING OPINION AHEAD!!! Deja Vu is simply you remebering a dream un consciously and thinking your seeing the future. We dream everynight, 5 to 10 times a night even. You're not telling me it's not possible that you dream nearly a million dreams in your life time. There for you mind can remeber a dream without you remebering it, and putting it into a phonomenon called Deja Vu. In short, Deja Vu is just remebering your dreams and having the feeling you've done the exact same thing, but you really you haven't. The odds are suprisingly good. A million times, and you do millions of things in your life, so there for something is going to add up ya know? And make Deja Vu possible.
<br />

<br />
My opinions only, thank you.
