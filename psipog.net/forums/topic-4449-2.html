			The problem is, there's no proof of a flow or where it goes. All that human being has scientifically proven is that time is a constant transforming of the present into the past.
<br />

<br />
Even that isn't so easy to understand if we take in count time is a human idea, some agree time doesn't &quot;exist&quot; as it is.
<br />

<br />
So how can we altere a flow that never stops? Even if it can be considered as existent?
<br />

<br />
I disagree on &quot;time traveling&quot;, but an atomically exact guess from the brain while sleeping is something I still don't get. Even if it makes more sense to me.
<br />

<br />
Maybe it's some kind of distortion of how we sense time. If you take my paranoic idea, maybe we're retarded and sense time too slow so our thoughts get mixed up and we thought we remembered with some anticipation something that already happened to us, so we get the idea of percieving the future. Then again, it's just a paranoic matrix-like idea.

			An interesting idea.  If time is a construct of the mind, precognition may simply be a breaking down of the barrier imposed by the human mind.  Neato <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			That's a pretty good idea but I thought Mr. Einstein proved the universe existed as a space and time open area that allows movement in either one. Another thought related to this is that as soon as there is thought, there is time. Think about it. As soon as something can think about something it immedietly can think about a passage through time by just counting. If time and space are intertwined and exist if the other one exists and time exists as long as there is thought maybe as soon as space exists thought exists and then time exists. That would mean that all three of these things exist together and cannot exist without each other.

			Thanks for correcting me there. If we get into physics then we must say that, whathever goes back and forth in time has no wieght at all (like light), so it must be energy. 
<br />

<br />
Why? Because, according to my dear Einstein, anything that goes faster than light will reach point B before it starts from point A, meaning it will travel to the future. AND anything that reaches the speed of light will transform into energy or light (which is energy).
<br />

<br />
So that may explain part of the true nature of psi, and that would be a good explanation about precog too.
