			I wouldn't tell anyone about psi stuff. Everyone would just riducule me and tell me that I need to get back in the real world. Besides, at the current stage of my life. Everyone knows that i'm not into the unknown stuff (which ain't true <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />). If i'd really want to do some real damage (which is the reason I believe why a lot of people want to learn psi stuff or why they fear it), i'd use physical attacks with my body or weapons and/or guns... 
<br />

<br />
BTW, for me. There is totally no way a psychic can outdamage or beat a person who knows how to fight or uses guns. But in the other hand, there is no way a person who knows nothing about psychic, would be able to heal someone or affect temperature. That's why I pursue psychic stuff, again. I also want to eventually learn to help reduce block shockwaves from physical attacks using knowledge of energy from psychic.
<br />

<br />
BTW, I also love guns, military stuff, weapons, martial arts, fighting stuff, anything that can destroy.

			No I wouldn't. I myself am very open compared to most people I know that practice Psi. I frequently talk about it with peers and when talking with someone about something paranormal/psychic I can't help but step in and share my opinion. Other then my friends, my family knows about it and encourages me.

haha, i use to do that also, but i thought abt it, i mean, if my mom or dad comes in, i just keep scrolling the page up and down because its hard to read it while ur scrolling it, so just do that until she leaves. its better then closing the page because ur mom will get suspious of u and she will think u r doing something bad and everything will get twisted around, u know wht i mean?

			I told three of my friends about it, but I haven't showed my mom or dad yet.  I just fear the consequences of telling them.  One of my friends wants me to move bigger stuff.  He thinks its air currents...  I'm working on moving a plastic knex wheel across the floor (and besides, staying with the psi wheel for too long would make a subconscious idea that only the psi wheel can be telekinetically affected.)  I just got back to telekinetics after 2 months of not practicing, and I'm kind of surprised I can still move the psi wheel decently well.

			I have already shown both of my neighbors, as well as two of my friends.  They all watched me do it, and one of them was even able to get some results after seeing me do it.  I guess seeing really is believing for some people.
<br />

<br />
However, I would not tell some people.  I ahve a friend who si completely close minded.  I've learned how to deal with him, but a lot of people think he comes off as rude and holier-than-thou.  Lol, and he is but he's still my best friend.  Lol, I can't wait for the day when I do some really spectacular PK that proves him wrong.  The look on his face will be priceless.
<br />

<br />
My parents are about half and half.  My father I would never tell because he thinks anything falling under &quot;paranormal&quot; is crap.  My mom though is much more believing.  In fact she adn I are members of a local ghost tracking group that visits haunted locations such as the Hannah House in Indy.  She would believe me, but I need to be able to do more than move a psiwheel I think.  But then again maybe not, she did believe the crap some psychic at one of the hunts was putting out with his pendling. (he was obviously spinning it himself)
