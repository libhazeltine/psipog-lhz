			Hey i've been studying psionics on and off for a year now and i had an idea one night while building up a psiball. When i usually gather energy i visualize a bright white light and i just draw my energy from that but this night i couldn't visualize the light so i just tried to get the energy i wanted from the blackness. I felt the energy move down my body into my hands where the psiball was forming but then there was a pressure on my forehead and i couldn't move my head at all. I was just wondering if anyone else had experienced or has any thoughts or insights.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			I think i could have moved other parts of my body but for some reason i didn't want to and i tried to hold onto the feeling. Do you think this is normal/ safe?

			I had the same thing eu_citzen <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I don't think that it's a good thing actually...  When I was first starting out I felt that sort of pressure and when I felt it I could never seem to move the psi wheel, or feel any energy  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I don't have the feeling as I used to anymore but when it comes back once in a while I can sortta make it go away <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Jian83:

I think it's normal and safe but not exactly a good thing.  If you practice enough you can get rid of it.  I felt it as sort of a &quot;boundary&quot; keeping me away from moving psi and stuff 
<br />

<br />
Good luck  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			its funny you guys mention this. I had the exact same thing for about two weeks while i was still in my &quot;psi drains you like a muther&quot; phase. But when i got to realisation that it doesnt drain you unless you want it to, it subsided just a bit. Still get it, but i never thought it would be linked to good/bad performance. I always used it as a measure of how good i got. (meaning if i didnt feel it at all then i would have accomplished &quot;another skill level&quot;) Can someone correct me on this?
<br />

<br />

<br />
P.S. deffenatly gonna have to try to see if it affects my moving the wheel in a negetive way. And i cant get a full rotation out of it on a good day yet, if the headache is linked to that also, i would like some info on it. Thanks!

			One important thing is to be wary of the source that you gather energy from. Some sources contain evil energies, and some good energies. If you gathered your energy from blackness, well i usually associate blackness with evil, so if i were you, i wouldn't gather energy from a source like that again. There are good and evil forces all over the planet especially now, so we must be carefull when we train, evil is gathering in massive amounts due to the fact that the end of the world is coming soon. The final battle between good and evil is coming, and us humans are caught in the the middle of it. So please, be careful of the source where you get your energy. I'm not crazy, just look at everything thats happening around us: look at whats happening between Israel and Iran, not to be religious, but you cant deny that the end will probably happen in our lifetime for sure.

			well i'm looking at this from a light side dark side point of view first of all. What you were originally doing was drawing energy from a good side of this (sounds kinda like star wars huh) but what you did was draw energy from a dark force and trust me it ain't pretty when you do it with your eyes closed anyway the power of that side is incredible and that's why that pressure formed
