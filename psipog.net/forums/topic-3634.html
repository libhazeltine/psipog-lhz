			I've been kinda pissed about my results with psi wheel, I think mainly due to not being able to connect with it I guess. 
<br />

<br />
However, I was running my index finger approx 1/32nd of an inch away from the fold lines felt breeze running by my hands. Yet the air condition is not on, nor are there any windows open ect in my room and there is no air flow watso ever. I was just attempting to feel how the paper feels a short away and it was bobbing up and down even though my hand was steady, was not breathing on it, took my hand completely away recalled with the sensation felt like above the paper and it spin dang fast for about 20 rotations.
<br />

<br />
For those of you that have trouble connection with objects, this may be a key for you.

P.S. Hope this'll help some people <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

 That doesn't sound TOTALLY implausible, but I think there still may be some possibility that the first time was air drafts. The second time, sounds more like the real thing though. Congratulations. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Well I noticed it alot, and here is my theory.
<br />
I influence a part of energy that I want, the energy around it starts to move under the minds command.  In this case, my psi wheel has this air flow around it, not to be fooled with &quot;aero PK&quot; or whatever, it's not. It's moving the matter around.. in this case, the air, creating a wind feeling. Most of the time my psi wheel just wobbles when I don't direct any sort of command into it such as spin.  So summing it up, the energy we influence, we can move matter with it.
