			has anybody ever accidentally sent a headache to some one, what would that be under empathy or telepathy. I was also wondering If somebody could tell me how to do it or how to prevent sending a headache

			I think it falls under empathy (just guessing) and that you should try shielding if you dont mean to send anything. If you do want to send something, dont think about headaches. Focus on sending the message you mean to send.

			I'm pretty sure any pk or tk stuff that is going to do some &quot;wounds&quot; or fatalities to other(s) are forbidden here? But by curiousity I've been wondering similiar stuff, not wounding ones but for example to make someone happy, or to remove any pains etc. And I think, I've found a way, been practicing it for awhile, waiting for some results. I suggest that you start training empathy if you haven't yet, it's at least a good start.

			It may not be that youve sent a headache parsay but that your link strength is too strong for the other person. Not saying that you cant do that, just saying that maybe the cause of it instead. Next time imagine the link weaker but still as capable as it should be.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Healing&quot; is being used as a broader term in this case, and yes I do that too, just not with emotions. Thats not my strong suit, so I dont mess with it. Although small physical pains I can usually get rid of easily. Such as the sting of a scrape or bump or headache.

			i believe headaches are mostly associated with telepathy; only because empathy is emotions (hence the name).  like chiro said, your link could be too strong, or they could be getting exhausted from the work it takes to send and recieve.  unfortunantly, no one here can tell you how to send a headache since that is considered combat (it even has it's own special name!)  but to prevent it, i would say don't use such a strong link...are you &quot;jamming&quot; the link into the persons skull, or just connecting it to their field?  i'm not an expert at telepathy so i guess i should just wait and see what elliptic has to say...

			I always get a headache when I link. And now that I've been doing a lot of meditation I always feel a sensation in my third eye everywhere I go.

If you break a link to fast you give them a head ache.

if you make a link to fast you give them a headache.

This headache of course is usually centered around the brow chakra area.

			Lol... i was shocked actually to find such a topic... i guess some of you guys could remember that ive been posting las time about my recurrent headache sending to my targets...LOL I got a theory... i hope you'll hear me out, ive been observing my telepathy especially when I always give them headaches... reasons are:
<br />

<br />
1. First, because I've been producing a lot of energy that I cant gently scan or do of the kind which is why they get like a blast of massive link of energy thus giving them headaches.
<br />

<br />
2. Another is that, since you've been sending a lot of energy connected to their minds, the brain generates electrical impulses that are more than it usually do causing headaches (we do all know that the brain mainly works in nerve impulses generated by series of electrical like impulses as a result from the depolarization and repolarization of the action potentials)
<br />

<br />
That's my theory for now... and oh yeah by the way... I can purposely give headaches too... I know to some this may be viewed as a combat, but to me, I usually take it as an evualtion test if my Telepathy could indeed affect people... Just be careful not to go too far, espacially with people who are experienced with telepathy. Just an early warning... so to sum it all up, just enjoy your skill and do stuff that would go beyond your limits.. it'll be fun plus it'll help you advance more on your skill..
