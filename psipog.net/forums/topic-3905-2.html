			everybody chill, Kief....
<br />

<br />
im not going to argue and say how your full of shit. i think its decent that someone can look at this in a bigger perspective, and actually take into account natural phenomena.
<br />

<br />
i would also  very much like to make you believe in it. have you got any requests? i mean, im going to put up a video in the summer, i just bought a nice cam <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
either way, i would like to hear what you could ask us to do to make you beleive. im not asking you to try it.
<br />

<br />
i am very aware that paper and plastic can react very easily to static. static can be accumulatd just by walking. the friction on your clothes, the carpet friction etc.
<br />

<br />
the only thing is, i am asking that you would tone it down a little. you are the equivalent of going into a church and going &quot;haha god and jesus, all fake.&quot;
<br />

<br />
its our beleif, our knowledge we accept these ways, and if you could, allow us to continue in our beleifs and practices. we have chosen this path, so please respect our wishes. id prefer it if you PM'd me, as opposed to spamming up this topic.
<br />

<br />
thanks.
<br />

<br />

			&quot;your to god damn skeptical... report back when you have seen every damn video and have a silly explanation for it, otherwise I don't think any of us would like to hear your bull.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I have seen every video and do have an explanation for every single one. None of the videos here are impressive and are nothing but simple illusions or people deluding themselves. 
<br />

<br />
Too skeptical LoL. No such thing. I'm just being rational, reasonable, and thinking critically. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Anyway, I do, however, go with you on saying matches held upright will go out regardless of the action. Thats why when I practice it or when you (maxus) you should hold them down so the flame climbs or sideways.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Matches go out, even held sideways. There is nothing paranormal going on, you just want it to be. 
<br />

<br />
Until you can spontaneously MAKE fire from nothing, or ignite objects such as candles, ciggaretts, paper, clothing, hair, etc., then you cannot, and are not doing pyrokinesis.

			&quot;Meh, if youre posing some kind of ridiculous argument, why dont you take it to court, just an idea,&quot;
<br />

<br />
What the fuck did you smoke today?
<br />

<br />
What the hell are you babbling about? Next time, try to make some sense and not post videos that are total bullshit. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;and if i wanna believe that i made that match go out, well im gonna go right ahead an believe that,&quot;
<br />

<br />
Yea you can deceive and delude yourself all you want, and you'll still be a lying retard. 
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
&quot;nothing you say will deter anyone here from practicing Pk, gooday to you sir&quot;
<br />

<br />
You can't practice it, because you simply can't do it. You can't do squat, you can only try and delude yourself into such. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;i did a control match you ass, that match took 29 seconds to burn out, the match in my video only took 9 seconds,&quot;
<br />

<br />
You didn't do jack shit. 
<br />

<br />
I did 20 control matches and they all burn out within 5 to 30 seconds. Some were out in 4, some in 10 or 20, and some still were just a tiny bit lit by 30 seconds before going out. 10 matches had a paper stalk, and some had a wooden stalk like in your video. 
<br />
The ones with the wooden stalk go out much quicker, as the fire burning at the tip of the match cannot heat up and ignite the wood stem as it can a stem made from paper, which catches more easily and so will burn a little longer. 
<br />

<br />
Any retard with a pack of matches can test this out and see this for themself. 
<br />

<br />
You don't even try and act like your concentrating or doing anything in the video, its ludicrous that you would even try and claim that what you did was a paranormal feat. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;it actually took 4 seconds as i wasnt comfortable and had to readjust my self and my hand,&quot;
<br />

<br />
You held the match upright (which number one causes it to go out quickly) and then as your holding it upright you jerk your hand around, again, an action that obviously would affect the flame and cause it to go out. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;i actually started concentrating on the flame when i moved my hand so the matchstick was upright, you must have no sense of time if you think the match burnt for 30 seconds,&quot;
<br />

<br />
You didn't do squat. Stop lying, I saw the video, it's total bullshit. Your as bad as apollo and every other teenage faker out there. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;also, matches dont go out if you hold them upright,&quot;
<br />

<br />
UH, YEA THEY DO. Now you are just a dishonest liar. 
<br />

<br />
Like I asked before, you can't be serious with this garbage. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;but im sure you already knew that before you personally attacked me,&quot;
<br />

<br />
Yea, I knew you were full of it and now you are digging yourself an even deeper hole. 
<br />

<br />
If you think what you did was a paranormal act then why don't you go see james randi and go collect a million dollars. 
<br />

<br />
Because unlike what people say, the prize isn't bullshit, and if you do happen to get past the independent preliminary testing, you are immediately awarded a check for $10,000. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;why are people like you in the forums,&quot;
<br />

<br />
To try and find real people who really can do extraordinary things like I. 
<br />

<br />
Alas, it's just a bunch of kids who can't do nada, just tricks.  
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;youre just putting down people who believe they can do something extraordinary,&quot;
<br />

<br />
Because you can't do anything paranormal. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;oh and as Kieth Mayes boyfriend, please tell him his dildo is on its way.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Did you think that one up all by yourself or did mommy help?

			i think i might know why keif is so skeptical....well i have 3 reasons why he might be skeptical...
<br />

<br />
1: he used to practice, he got no results and he stopped and because he got no results he thouhgt it was fake
<br />

<br />

<br />
2: maybe he read the stuff and never tried it because he didnt understand how to do it...
<br />

<br />
3: he's just a dumbass and he didnt ever even TRY to do telekinesis...
<br />

<br />
heres what you, kief should do: practice psiballs for a few weeks, then practice telekinesis for about a month..i can almost ASSURE you trhat if you give it an honest effort for AT LEAST two months you will be able to do these things....i wont let you say its fake until you have done this...

Actually if you read the skepticism forums, and other threads in other forums, you would see that not eveyone is so accepting of your BS or deluding themselves into believing natural phenomena is paranormal.

&quot;You guys want to know what his notion on psionics are from what Ive gathered in his previous posts? In many of his post he claims to have seen way greater accomplishments in psionics.&quot;

There is nothing psionic about any paranormal event. Psionics is a bunch of nonsense on par with chi, which is actually where psionics gets most of its philosophy from. 
<br />

&quot;He said that hes seen stuff that would turn us white and make us not want to touch this magic stuff again.&quot;

Greater paranormal things. Not psionic.
