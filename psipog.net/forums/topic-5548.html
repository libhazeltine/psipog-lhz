			In the past 2 days I've been practicing Peebrain's tactile method on creating psiballs. Just yesterday I decided I should give it another go seeing as I didn't get any results the first 2 days. Once I tried to feel spiral finger movement, my fingers and the middle of my palm started to tingle alot. So I did it on the other hand too and put them together. after about a minute and a half, i stopped and felt pressure between my hands. I tried moving them together but I felt like there was a magnetic block between my hands. It felt kind of warm too. So do you think this is a genuine psi-ball?

It sounds like it, move on, cease the skeptic thoughts now, please.

apparently there's no such thing as a genuine psiball......no standard psiball.....it is always different
