Either that or you would become a dark void. Wouldn't light have to pass through you to make you invisible (like glass)?

			*sigh* Okay:
<br />

<br />
To make yourself invisible, you need shizit loads of psi and skill. You must bend the light around you, and then make it perfectly straight. If it's not perfect, than you'll look like the Predator. If you don't straighten them, than you'll end up even more visible because you'll be seen as a siriously ***ked up image of your imediate suroundings. Even than, if you make your self invisible, you will be unable to see anything because no light will reach your eyes. However, there is a way to get around this: leave your eyes visible. 
<br />
  For anti gravity, I don't feel like writing this, so go to <a href="http://www.psipalatium.com" target="_blank">www.psipalatium.com</a> under psychic&gt;advanced&gt;hybrid techniques. It's a pretty fluffy site at times, and they deal with that pure energy psi thing (hey: Pure Energy PSI - PEPSI! However some of they're beliefs are scientific facts, such as the fact that there realy is nothing but energy).

no. If the light bent around you, and it kept on its path that it was going before the shield, it would bounce off something behind you or whatever and reflect back. it would then bend around you and continue on the path to the viewer's eye. it would appear you weren't even there.

			An anti-gravity shield would  (pretty sure) require some really nifty skill in pk. And yeah that problem with not getting light to your eyes. You could just make a shield programmed to make people think you were a pencil or something rather than stopping light completely. Don't make it too complicated.

Oh yeah, totaly. I was going to write that, but forgot. Just go PsiPog or google or something, and an article on cloak shields. I think you need TPS, but I'm not sure.

I guess that makes sense in a way. It's just that I thought the absense of photons would create a complete dark spot. There is supposedly a certain kinesis (if you want to believe it) called umbrakinesis (like the umbra in an eclipse) which is the ability to REFLECT photons resulting in darkness.  But if the light bends around you it means it cannot pass through it (like glass which is why it is almost invisible) denoting the presense of an object. But if what you say is backed up by fact then I will agree with it whether it makes sense to me or not.

Bending light around you would technically make you invisible, right?
<br />
Haha thatd be awesome

I dont see why you couldn't</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Either that or you would become a dark void. Wouldn't light have to pass through you to make you invisible (like glass)?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

no. If the light bent around you, and it kept on its path that it was going before the shield, it would bounce off something behind you or whatever and reflect back. it would then bend around you and continue on the path to the viewer's eye. it would appear you weren't even there.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

*thinks of a giant pencil walking around* lmao!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

what about making the waves of light pass through your body instead of relfecting?  or just absorbing the light?  you could take your bodies natural electric field to attract the light (electromagnetic waves) and just absorb it into your body.  this would keep the light from reflecting into others eye's, and you can program a sheild to do this.  would that make you invisible, or just a shadowy figure?

this topic got me on an interesting idea.  when making a psi-ball, if you can somehow program it to have a reflective surface that reflects light, can you make it visible???
