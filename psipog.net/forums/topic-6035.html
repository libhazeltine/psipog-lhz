			I've been playing around with weaving different stuff together with my little loom construct, and have come up with a number of very interesting results.  However, the most significant discovery I have made does not pertain directly to the loom itself.  I'll get to that shortly.
<br />

<br />
Firstly, when you weave different energies together they start to acquire very interesting properties dissimilar to those belonging to the component energies used.  I don't know why this is, but you can make some pretty sweet stuff.  For example, I came up with a solid-state energy class I call a &quot;psiloid&quot; (psi-metalloid) which has some properties of matter and some of psi.  Namely, it can exert magnetic and gravitational force, though is malleable and controllable by forces which affect psi.  Theoretically you might be able to manufacture an ACTUALLY PHYSICAL material which can be manipulated by psi.  Damn, that would be sweet.  To make a psiloid, you need two looms with the same feeder thread.  Have one being fed general psi, and weaving it onto a strand of any &quot;hard&quot; energy.  On the other, have the same circular strand of hard energy, but weave any form of energy you might use to try to move something with mass.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, onto the real goods.  Using this basis of combinations, I am working on the design of a system to describe their interactions.  I doubt I will succeed.  Anyway, I have discovered that you can in fact combine energies in a number of different ways other than &quot;weaving&quot; such as melding them together by overlapping, fusing them, catalyzing them, welding them, or otherwise combining them.  And different energies that combine in different ways, but the products all have a certain...  similarity to them.  If it's ok with you guys I would like to call these combined energies &quot;magics&quot; because I'm damned if I'm deriving some latin word for this crap.  These are interesting because they have...  I don't know...  texture to them.  They also start to do even more interesting things when arrayed in shapes.  Weave two flat sheets of G, and press them together.  Then fold them over into a half-circle, and tear it in half.  Observe carefully.  It's freakin' awesome.  However, exactly what happens to yours differs widely with what exactly your purest G is, small variations dramatically affect the outcome.
<br />

<br />
Now the common element of combining energies is that they don't mix without an energy specifically forcing them together.  They coexist otherwise.  For example, I am currently experimenting with welding them together with a refined point of a magic I invented.  It acts like a blade, or welding torch, and cuts through a fabric or surface of magic or energy (by my definition an energy is a pure magic) and the energy of it forces it and the surface beneath to bind together.  I've currently manufactured a semipermanent standing shield of tough magic.  I have literally savaged it with titanic blasts of collected energy, and though it does give after several blasts, these blasts are a huge portion of my daily collection of energy each.  With all my harvesters I can only manage five or six.  I have almost a hundred parabolic collectors and ten torus generators (still prototypes).  So I make a LOT of energy in a day.

			Wow, that sounds like a lot of technobabble. Like when someone asks me what's wrong with their PC, and I say &quot;Well, you cross-patched the tri-lithium ionizers through the flux capacitors, when they should be patched separately through diode resistors.&quot; I'm as open minded as the next guy (well, to be technically correct, I'm as open minded as the next psion), but your use of the word magic kinda puts me off. Instead of calling the combined energies 'magics,' why not instead call them 'combined energies?' Also, the shape and source of psi should not affect its properties. Though it is true that giving it a certain shape, or pulling it from a different source could cause your subconscious to think it should have that property, and thus apply it. Also, it is impossbile to create energy, though it is possible to convert one energy type into another (i.e. chemical energy into heat, or matter, which is a form of energy, into explosive force). Correct me if I'm wrong here guys.
<br />

<br />
Also, some comments on your other topics...
<br />

<br />
Some of your ideas are good, and creative. However, they are a long and complex read, even for me (and I've got an IQ of 144-ish, give or take a few points, depending on my mental state). Also, they are filled with what sounds like technobabble and many of them are unnecessary. For example, your rune system. It sounds cool, and could have it's uses. However, many psions will simply prefer to program the construct manually, instead of going through the unnecessary trouble of reading/writing the sigils. It's a general rule of thumb: people are lazy. Any work they don't have to do, they don't want to do.

			I am aware of the... esoteric nature of what I write.  And there's a reason.  It's because I try to make it perfectly general, as in, able to be applied to any case whatsoever.  So that's why.
<br />

<br />
And I am also aware that, in some cases, it is easier to program the construct manually.  The rune system does not replace the conventional way of doing things.  It has a very specific purpose- when you want to make very very large and complex stuff.  If you can picture the entire construct in your head, there's really no reason to diagram it for your own use.  (still useful to show to someone else, but there are other ways to do that)  But when you want to make a 700-element construct with lots of interacting and, more importantly, <span style="font-style: italic">changing</span>, parts then good luck programming that sucker manually.

			Yeah that's true, but really, what practical use could making a construct that complex have (besides for practice in programming, of course)? I can think of nothing, though you might be able to, since you seem to put more thought into being creative than I do.
<br />

<br />
Though it is true that the sigil system could make it simpler to share ideas for constructs. Like &quot;I came up with a cool idea for a construct, but the construct is waiting in my room, so I wrote down what it does.&quot;

			My favorite example of such a fiendishly complex construct is one I have not yet finished.  It is supposed to duplicate any given &quot;lesser&quot; construct put into it.  Since you disagree with the term &quot;magic&quot; I'll instead call them &quot;fields&quot; because that makes sense as well.  Higher fields are created by fusing and combining already existing energies.  Two second order fields combined make a third order field.  Two third order fields create a fourth order... etc.
<br />

<br />
Higher order fields are more fixed in their nature, and harder to work with.  However they can manipulate lower order fields very easily, and cannot even interact with fields higher than themselves.  So a psi-machine which is given a first-order construct would need to be at least a second-order construct to manipulate it directly.  Other first-order constructs can change it as well, limitedly, but that's different.
<br />

<br />
My fiendishly complicated construct (of the third order) is given a first-order construct, and creates a second-order encapsulated version of it which can be dissolved to create an exact duplicate of the first-order construct in question.  The point is that this factory machine is an excellent use for a very large construct which would be patently impossible to create with only your head.  Nobody could picture the entire thing at once.  I hope to be able to produce expendable psionic constructs en masse.  For example, a bag of beads where each one has an identical construct to do something.  Perhaps a bunch of different kinds, color coded.  Whatever.  I've been working on this for a while though, and I'm not getting very far.
