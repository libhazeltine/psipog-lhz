You're right, there are no random numbers. And running it 100 times should indeed give you a 50/50 result if you're not concentrating - otherwise what baseline would you use to measure results?

meh... i have now arrived at the conclusion that you can't change a pre-set math equation with your mind, so that &quot;trainer&quot; doesn't really work. Neither will any other computer trainer, since there is no mathematical &quot;random&quot;.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

So you don't agree people can influence random number generators? That's the basis of PK as we know it that's been established for over 30 years.

Why not? Where's the proof? This loads a javascript applet onto your PC and runs it - LOCALLY. Meaning you're basically playing with a RNG on your PC. Except this one gives you a visual to concentrate on.
<br />
Besides that if you believe you can create a Psiball in china, why not influence a server there?
<br />

<br />
Seriously people, how can so many of you deny this? Is it because you thought it was being executed on a server somewhere far far away? It's not. It's running locally on your PC in Javascript. 
<br />

<br />
And yes all numbers on PCs are calculated, but lets step back even farther and look at how PCs work. 
<br />

<br />
Computers are a series of transistors - or better yet - switches. So what are we doing when we influence a RNG? We're changing which switches are opened or closed.
<br />
You can spin 2&quot; of tinfoil but you can't affect a microscopic switch in your computer?

<br />
Have you ever read about the random number generator trials that have been conducted? I'm guessing no by your comments because the idea is that they WON'T artificially try to 'level out' and auto correct themselves. There's no checks built in to do that.
<br />

<br />
If you want to be sure then by all means, pick the source code apart from the trainer I posted, please. I think you'll find that it's NOT auto correcting.
<br />

<br />
And did you even read what I posted? I said specifically that it is run LOCALLY on YOUR PC. The internet is only involved as a method of delivery.
<br />

<br />
But believe what you want, if you choose to believe that you can't affect the outcome on a PC by adjusting microscopic switches and voltages, but instead can influence a die toss that's an orde rof magnitude larger in the physical world, be my guest.

			autocorrecting would mean, save the results and do the oposite of what the random-number-generator is here for: make our result be what we expect...
<br />

<br />
but anyway, random numbers usually aren't random on computers, there's no way for a computer to create a really random number...
<br />
yea maybe by getting some bytes of the memory, so the number would be influenced by the programs you're running...
<br />

<br />
but generally you put a start point, in C with srand(number), and then you get the random numbers by random()
<br />
if you call srand with the same value again you will receive the same &quot;random&quot; numbers as before...
<br />

<br />
so influencing computer-generated random numbers <span style="font-weight: bold">seems</span> impossible...
<br />
but not because they're auto-corrected <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />
it usually depends on the way the random numbers are generated, because they're not really random numbers <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I really don't understand how anyone thinks this isn't possible.
<br />

<br />
If you can affect the outcome of a die or coin toss, why can't you affect th eoutcome of a calculation on a computer, when it's not being checked for consistency?
<br />

<br />
Another way you can commonly get random numbers is to base the calculation off of the milliseconds reading - that way it's unique and constantly changing. So why can you shift a 0 into a 1 (or vice versa) when that's being read?
<br />

<br />
Not to mention noone's addressed the fact that it's already been proven (and published) that humans can influence mechanical random number generators.
<br />

Edit: Blah, I need to chill the F*** out. Sorry for being so harsh all - everyone's entitled to their opinion and my recent posts have been nothing short of rediculous for not letting that be. Appologies to any I've offended.

But wouldn't that mean that the bell curve, pendulum(sp?) and clock face experiments on that other retropk site don't work either? They seemed as if I was definetely controlling them.
