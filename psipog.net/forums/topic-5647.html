			Ill start with apologize on my english... ( and ill take your apologize for your hebrew <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />). 
<br />

<br />
I'm in the lucid dream stuff for four years or something like that, and now i'm starting to get intersting in OBE.
<br />
I understand that when you having OBE you travel through our phsyiclly world, but i don't understand- you are viewing real time rieality or just speculations of your mind? 
<br />
and the other question- when your in OBE can you meet other pepole that in their OBE situation or not? i mean that if all of us will experience OBE in the same night and we will set to meet at the beach - will we see each other? 
<br />

if you read untilll here thanks <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			During an OBE, yes, you are viewing real time events. However, there have been no reported cases of two people meeting in an OBE. I'm not sure if any tests have even been done for such, but I think it's possible, albeit difficult (I'm thinking along the lines of transmitting yourself onto the same &quot;wavelength,&quot; if you will, of the other person).

			Yes, in an obe you are viewing things in real time. There have been studies which have worked to prove that theory, and so far, there looking positive.  Anyways, I have heard that when you astral project, you can go to &quot;astral temples&quot; or whatnot, to &quot;hangout&quot;.  Sounds a bit fluffy, and I don't really believe it, but it would be really cool if it was true.  Aside from that, however,  I don't believe that during an OBE you will meet someone.  Although, what Clover said, really sparked my mind.  It sounds like a great theory.  I'll have to look into it more.

			Don't you see regular people when you OBE?
<br />

<br />
example: Let's say you OBE one night. If you can go through walls and closed doors and what not to where your parents or your neighboors or whatever, would you see them sleeping?

			Normal people, yes. The &quot;spirits&quot; of other people having OBE's, most likely not.

			If you can, get your hands on a copy of Journeys out of the body by Robert Monroe, it sheds a lot of light on the subject of OBE's. I have to admit I think much of it is lucid dreaming on his part and that parts were exaggerated but there's a lot of information there that might help you on the subject. I've heard that you do see things in real-time because in a sense you are actually there and it is different than remote viewing, but I won't say that for certain since I have yet to experience it. I've also heard that an OBE is very lonely people-wise, I've read about people meeting other &quot;travellers&quot; but those times were few and far between.
