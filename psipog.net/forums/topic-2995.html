			Patience is a virtue people, always remember Rome wasn't built in a day, nor shall superb psionic skills. Even Aces start as rookies, even commando's as soldiers, dont expect to go from 1 to 100 in a matter of days, it will take practice, and don't slump on those practices.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, even though you posted this, Apollo, you'll probably still get spam emails about it...It's the sad truth.

			Seems to be human nature to be very hasty about everything, very few people will take the time to actually sit back and just think inward. Thus, we have societies that are full of criminal activities, maniacs and stressed out people. 
<br />
Little time used now for thinking inward, will save a ton on energy levels, stress factors and many other things on a regular basis and as a result will lead a healthier life!

			ahmed1,

   I would suggest, since it appears that you are ready to move on, work on practicing to roll/slide pens on a slick surface. Its what i've been doing myself, even though i don't get squat on movement the control increased a fair amount for the psiwheel <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			time, patience, drive, and discipline.  IMO, the four most important virtues of pk.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">time:</span> pk takes time to get results with, and more time to get good at.  even after getting results with your psi-wheel, it could be months before you &quot;master&quot; it.  also, don't expect to move onto larger objects without spending a good amount of time on the same &quot;small&quot; objects.  you have to start with the basics, and <span style="font-style: italic">gradually</span> move your way up.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">patience:</span> like i said, pk takes time.  you need to have the patience not to get frustrated by not getting results (or any better.)  frustration only makes pk harder, and more of a chore than an activity.  you have to be patient, and un-hasty (i think i made that word up lol)
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">drive:</span> even after spending time and having patience, you need to have some drive to get you going with pk.  you need to want it.  the more you want to accomplish pk, and the more your willing to practice and be patient, the easier and faster it will come.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">discipline:</span> even with the previous three virtues, you won't get anywhere without discipline.  i have met people that have practiced for years and cant even wiggle a psi-wheel.  when i asked them how they practice, they say they practice with the psi-wheel for a couple minutes then give up to watch their favorite show.  you need to discipline yourself to accomplish pk.  don't just do it for a little bit, then quit to do something else, make yourself practice until you can't practice anymore (a little bit exaggerated, but you get the point.)  and don't move onto harder projects until you master the basics.  the basics are fundamental, and without them, it will be pretty damn tough to accomplish the harder tasks.  for example:  don't try to move the psi-wheel under glass until you can move an uncovered psi-wheel at your will, and in both directions at will.  this will make the next step easier  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />   i know that the same old routines get boring, but this is how you get good.  
<br />

<br />
if you remember these virtues (and what they mean to you) and reasearch some techniques (such as NI's and Apollo's) you will get good.  pk takes time, patience, drive, and discipline.  remember that  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I've found that you don't even have to practice pk specifically to get better. As long as you practice SOMETHING psi-related each day, you will get better at pk. I stopped for about a month because I was frustrated with my progress (rookie mistake I know) but I kept meditating every day, along with practicing psi balls every now and then. I started back up again this week and I've been doing better that before I stopped.
<br />

<br />
I think this is because all psi-related activities are related. Practicing in one will help you out in another.

			Here's an article that I recently submitted describing the approach that should be taken when practicing energy manipulation.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">What's the Best Technique?</span></span>
<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">by Vileru
<br />
</span>
<br />
One of the most frequently asked questions is, &quot;What is the best technique?&quot; This is constantly being asked from people regarding every field of psionics. &quot;What's the best way to OBE?&quot;, &quot;What's the best method to move the psi wheel?&quot;, &quot;How should I remote view?&quot; Several people are stuck with the notion that one method is the universal and better than all others, which is far from the truth.
<br />

<br />
The best answer to this question is, experiment. Find what is best for you. Try various techniques and when you find one that &quot;feels right&quot;, then stick with it and build upon it. If this doesn't work after a day of practice, do not give up. Keep practicing. If you get no results whatsoever for several weeks and you have strong doubts that you're on the right track, then you can try a new technique and see if it works better for you. However, people often believe they're not getting results, when they actually are. A lot of times people will disregard their results because it's not the &quot;right&quot; result. If they see the psi wheel move, they'll immediately dismiss it as wind or if they begin feeling vibrations that hint towards an OBE, they'll dispel it as shivering. Do not disregard your results. If you experience any slight results, then you're probably on the right track.
<br />

<br />
There is no best method, there is no best method, there is no best method. Just like anything you do in life, you'll develop your own style and you will build upon it. An example of this is in music. Bands will usually follow a genre, but they'll begin to develop a style that sets them aside from all the other bands. Another quick example is martial arts. There are several different fighting styles. One style can specialize in defense and tiring your opponent, while another can focus on quick movement and confusing your opponent, but each are linked because their goal is to defeat your opponent. Energy training is similar. You'll begin to develop your own style and you'll discover what works best for you.
<br />

<br />
Asking other people about their methods is not bad though. You can gain insight on their technique and maybe try it out yourself and see how it works. Experimenting is a huge part in energy training. You have to find out what works for you and what does not. It's not a quick process either. People generally want things done right away and constantly demand, &quot;right here, right now.&quot; If you follow this attitude, you're hindering your progress. Patience is key. This is the true &quot;best&quot; method to energy manipulation: <span style="font-style: italic">Experiment, Patience, and Practice.</span>
<br />

<br />
The one phrase that sums this up is: self-discovery. <span style="font-style: italic">Discover yourself. . . Don't follow another's path, create your own.</span>
