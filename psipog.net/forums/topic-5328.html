			For the &quot;regulars&quot;:
<br />
One of the things that the members who have been on Psipog for quite a while is that they seem to have forgotten the mindset of a newbie. When I first stumbled along Psipog about 5 years ago, it was because I was Google searching on Telekinesis. Yeah, I watched a couple of movies and cartoons and wanted to see if I could actually do it. After looking through a bunch of sites and having no progress, (not to mention the bull-shit detector was on Red-Alert), I finally found Psipog on the search. The whole attitude of &quot;We're here to help you, and if you don't want our help or don't like the way we think, then get the f*ck out.&quot; really told me that this site was here to actually help you, and not scam you out of time and money. But I read the articles, got success from them, and still looked around in other sites to get information on other &quot;abilities&quot; that Psipog had relatively no information on. What my point is, is that most of the newbies are probably here because they want to learn to become &quot;psychic&quot; or what not. And this site is one of the very few sites that breaks the general rule of the internet, it actually frowns upon the &quot;1337 style&quot; of talking, you know something like, &quot;ZOMG I HAET PIZZA, IT R GROSS&quot;. 
<br />
And they only know the terminology they know about psychics are what they have either seen on TV or whatever they saw it on. Thusly, is it really that SUPRISING that they come on here or the chat and say something like, &quot;Lol, how do i read teh minds?&quot;?
<br />
 And when they say something like that and some &quot;regular&quot; is like, &quot;Get the f*ck out n00b&quot;, guess what they're probably going to do? Get the fuck out. 
<br />
So all I'm saying is that we should try and keep in mind what the name of this site is, &quot;P.S.I.P.O.G.&quot;, &quot;Psychic Students In Persuit Of <span style="font-weight: bold">Guidance</span>&quot; and show them in a more respectful manner what psi is instead of the regular ole &quot;Get out&quot;. Because they're coming here expecting help, and the anti-newb attitude might actually make them leave.

			great post, and i totally agree with you.  but i have one discord with the post.  that is that n00bs are encouraged to look at the main site first, and to read the articles before asking questions.  if they read the articles they should see how serious we really are and not go around saying things like:  &quot;zomgorz, i want 2 b a 1337 p$yc4ic!!!111oneone&quot;...you get the idea.  
<br />

<br />
i lurked on the main site for two years before i joined the forums, and for 6 years before i joined the forums at the psion guild.  that way i knew how to do almost everything (i <span style="font-style: italic">knew</span> how to do it, not neccessarily <span style="font-style: italic">could </span>do it.)  and i didn't ask a bunch of questions on the forums that were answered at the main site.  i know that we should be more understanding, but it gets annoying when the same n00b questions are asked at least twice a day.  is it really that hard to scroll down the page, and/or check the next page or two to see if your thread has been created yet???  is it really that hard to check the FAQ's and articles on the main site for your questions??? NO.  it isn't.  and if n00bs are going to be that lazy, i certainly don't want to help them with skills that are going to take weeks/months/years to develope.  if they took the time to look up their questions i would be more than happy to help.  i think that i share the same beliefs with at least 98% of the regulars here in that respect.  and the n00bs would recieve sooooo much more help if only they tried to help themselves out first, and stop with the @nnoy1ng 1337 1n73rn47 8ull$417!  (annoying 1337 internet bullshit)
<br />

<br />
but everything else in your post i agree with, and thought it was good input.

<br />
Well, as a &quot;regular&quot;, I will post a response:
<br />

<br />
Sure, we understand what the acronym Psipog stands for.  Yes, we understand the neophyte mentality, since, after all, Psipog is geared toward those who are new to psionics.  But we also get very sick and tired of people who don't read the articles on the website, nor the Q&amp;A section, nor the forum rules, or the forum stickies, and go straight to asking a question that has been asked a thousand times, or breaking a rule that has been explicitly cited thousands of times.
<br />

<br />
If someone wants to waste my time in this regard, I will refuse to give them any of my time to waste.  Therefore, a response of &quot;gtfo&quot; is deemed appropriate when the same fluff idiot asks the same fluff question about psiball sensations while high on marijuana under the guidance of a deity/spirit guide/goddess/demon/insert other occult fluff here.  It gets very tiresome.  Respect is exchanged, not just taken.  Surely you can see my point of view in this regard.
<br />

<br />
Peebrain through his webmaster and administrative genius, along with staff members and their contributions and suggestions, endeavor to put forward resources aimed at newbies, resources that help to prime said newbies for their involvement in the Psipog community with other newbies and regulars.  If these people willingly and blatantly bypass these resources, then maybe they should find somewhere else to dwell.

			Let me show you something.
<br />

<br />
<a href="../art-moderation-psipog-and-you.html" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/show.php?cmd=wp&amp;id=38</a>
<br />

<br />
See that article? That is the only thing I felt that I could contribute to this site. Why? I'm the epitome of novice. I'm the most unskilled moderator here. Easily. But I do my job.
<br />

<br />
That article explains alot of things. It explains what being a mod is like, how to become a mod, and more importantly, it gives <span style="font-weight: bold">guidance</span> to new people fresh to the site and <span style="font-weight: bold">guidance</span> to members who are having trouble. This article is very easy to get a hold of, because not only is it one of the newest articles on the main site, but it's also linked to within the rules thread.
<br />

<br />
Now, any person who has any damn sense at all will read the rules. You go to a new forum, you read the rules so you know what you can do and not do. You learn <span style="font-style: italic">why</span> we have posting limits. You learn <span style="font-style: italic">what</span> is expected of every member here. If you can't follow those rules, you don't need to post. You know what is going to happen.
<br />

<br />
The reason why noobs get attacked by members is because they don't follow simple rules. Use basic English, don't do run on sentences... just the combination of those two is enough for people to have good conversations. If there is a lack of both, NOBODY CAN UNDERSTAND A THING THAT WAS POSTED. Seriously, it's common sense. What the hell. Bad English should be confronted to encourage maturity in members.
<br />

<br />
As for the part about bad terminology, you're absolutely right. I personaly believe that terminology that is incorrect should be corrected, but not in a rude way. Unfortunately, alot of times, it's not just bad terminology bad a REALLY bad misinterpretation of what exactly the skill is. &quot;How can I do a ki blast?&quot; You can't, it doesn't exist, there is no such thing. Simple. It's frustrating when kids think they can immerse themselves in Dragonball Z and perform the &quot;super powers.&quot; I won't say it's impossible, but nobody's done it yet. Not one person on Earth. Because they'd be fucking famous as JESUS CHRIST if they did. You do the math.
<br />

<br />
I hope you see what's really behind some of the anger now. I agree with some of what you said, so don't feel like I'm arguining your every point. I just think there's alot more to it than &quot;being rude and attacking noobs because of bad english and incorrect terminology.&quot; Nobody understands excessively bad English (which seems to be the trend these days), and nobody appreciates the association with fictional bullshit.

3) Is the type of newbie I am completely willing and eager to help.

			uh... yeah, first off, a n00b is an idiot. a newb is a new guy. at least I think so...
<br />

<br />
anyway, you're confusing new people with new idiots. it's like confusing: 
<br />

<br />
&quot;OMGZORZ i'M A N00B HW DO i MK A PHI BLL&quot;
<br />

<br />
with:
<br />

<br />
&quot;hello, I can't make a psi ball, I've been trying for 3 weeks, can someone help?&quot;
<br />

<br />
as you can see, the second is a reasonable help request. the first is not.
<br />

<br />
by the way, why do so many spell &quot;psi&quot; &quot;phi&quot;? seriously, that annoys me to no end.
<br />

<br />
and the term &quot;psychic&quot; is okay. The term &quot;Super Saiyan 5&quot; is not okay. The term &quot;Rave Master&quot; is not okay. The term &quot;gemini lord&quot; is not okay.
<br />

<br />
also, telepathy is not an obscure word, just saying.
<br />

<br />
PIZZA AIN'T GROSS, IT R0XZ0RZ!
<br />

<br />
and english, yes please, you can fucking use proper english if it's your primary language, you've been taught it since kindergarten, and even people who speak other languages should know not to use run ons and put commas between multiple nouns. it's getting fucking ridiculous, anyone who says &quot;wiv&quot; for &quot;with&quot;, or &quot;u&quot; for &quot;you&quot; needs to have an anvil dropped on their genitalia, hell for &quot;with&quot; you can even put &quot;w/&quot; so stop the garbage english.
