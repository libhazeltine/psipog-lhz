			I said 9-10 because when they're younger they dont think about how it hurts someone or themselves before they do it, once they get around 10 the concet of consequences is solid for most. This age is still young enough to let them learn something and it will be with them for a while...most are energetic and all that other stuff

It depends on the age.
<br />

<br />
Kids aged 0-10 probably WON'T find psi on their own. I only found it last year, and no, I'm not telling you my age, because that's just going to give you a stereotype for me. 
<br />

<br />
(If somebody could give me an approx time (1 year, 1 year 2 months, etc), as to when I joined, that'd be helpful...I came about a month or so before the closing of the PsiPog Client (and then we moved to IRC))
<br />

<br />
As a parent, they would both do their best to restrain any crazy superhero imaginations (like they could fly, do DBZ stuff, shit like that). They would also discipline their kid to avoid conflicts, as I stated in the comments....but you'd have to be very careful.

that's not true, I discovered this energy around 6, I could sense it but I didn't know how to manipulate it untill I was 9 and made my first psiball then started to do Self-healing PK thinking more of useing the mind to surpass human weaknesses which is still consider mind over matter but I didn't treat it as I would now.

anyways - what a parent would do for the young child is that they would use simpler terms, ones that the child would understand, and if the child was curious, ...well it's the parents' decision from there - but I would say that they teach more! 
<br />

<br />
I also asked some people, they say an early age is good, because you learn it while you're young, and you develop it while you're older.
<br />

<br />
Then again - if your mind takes a more logical path during life (I was too late for that XD), then it gets harder and harder to start in psi (because you know that it isn't all too logical)
<br />

<br />
I'm just saying, in general...I mean, if you saw that age poll, most people here are between 14-18, or so (but don't count that as a fact, it's only as accurate as people view the thread)

			I think that 10 would be good because the kid would be old enough to understand most of it, but still young enough to learn it. Also, the kids will know better than to start fights with it because they would be mature enough to follow the rules. I started at 12 and its worked out OK for me.

			I voted 19+.  If kids are raised knowing about psionics without actually performing them, then they won't have nearly as many mental blocks.  The first 20 odd years of life are essential for kids to get to know themselves and understand themselves as well as others.  Start teaching them esoteric knowledge like psionics after they've dealt with their personal issues and then problems like violence, lack of social interaction, etc. will be a none issue.  Of course this is dependent on parenting and a general attitude that is quite a bit more evolved than many people today are capable of, but we're getting there.

			well, teens though going through puberty would be best to start, its still young enough that you can learn more easily, and you'd be less prone to trying harmful things (such as mimmicking energy junk off of a cartoon), if you are the right type of person. anybody can go and turn out wrong, if they learned young and took a wrong turn as a teen it'd be worse for others because the bad teen would have more experience.

			0-4 would be the best age for teaching from a scientific perspective.  It is speculated that psionic abilities are based on a subconscious part of the mind.  At such an early age, the child would be able to access these parts of the mind.  A child has a near photographic memory until language develops (They can't think in language if they don't know it).  Thinking in pictures grants access to these superior memory abilities.  Superior memory along with access to subconscious functions would allow the child to learn very quickly and have high control over psionic skills.  Of course, it would be hard to teach a toddler who has no idea what you are saying.  It would be optimal to teach the child in the first few months of linguistic development.  
<br />

<br />
Self control may be an issue, but one does not have to teach them everything at that time.  Just teach them psychokinesis and empathy.  The child should maintain the ability to access the important subconscious regions of the brain responsible for these skills later in life and easily master other skills without being able to harm anyone with these skills.  If psychokinesis becomes very powerful in the child, it can become dangerous, but it does not need to be taught to that extent.  As for social development, children at that age do not entirely know how the world works or why things happen.  They learn new things every day.  If a preschooler suddenly psychokinetically hovered a Lego brick, I think the only person that would be significantly surprised is the teacher of the class.  It would not affect their social development until later in life.  The other children would have this observation firmly logged in their mind and would also gain the ability to more easily accept the possibility of psionics.  By that time, the child would have probably learned to keep his unusual skills a secret.
