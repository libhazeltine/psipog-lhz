			i think my actully goals have shifted towards a more mastewrful side of the things to  come .
<br />
 i can't belive that no-one has caught on to my actully plan .
<br />

<br />
think about it logically,why i want to create a psionic human looking-robot.
<br />

<br />

<br />
for the development of  a robotic mental consciousness.
<br />

<br />
computer use 100% of total operation power to compelte one  or mulitplte task useing the least amount of time possible.
<br />

<br />
if i could pull it off i could use 100% towards any psionic action i proform,some fuctions could be preformed almost instandlly.
<br />

<br />
my ultimate goal is to create psion/humanoid cylon-hybrids to prefrom highly advanced psionic techniques that are deemed inpossible in the current day on earth,like copying and cloaking a few planets.

			and please, please tell me : WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT??????
<br />
HOW WOULD YOU DO SUCH THING????????
<br />
it's pretty difficult to be serious when someone says he want to clone the solar system, but much harder if he doesn't explain at all what is he actually planning to do...
<br />
so..  <img src="images/smiles/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" border="0" />  an idea... SPEAK LIKE A NORMAL PERSON, PLEASE....

			hey i can belive it some one that actully gets the frist part of my plan.
<br />

<br />
i guss i could share a bit of my finds with other people,other than myself
<br />

<br />
while it kind of simple i guess,the frist model i create was basically a robotic ghost of myself without any conscious or limiting factors, and this was done on 5/18/06
<br />

<br />
but this time i am going to expand the project as planed and work on the second model with deals with a little computer science and mimicing the human thouht process.
<br />

<br />
but the main thing i think that greatly makes me diffent is that i improveed my skills useing hyponosis and techknowlogy to inprove my psionic skills as well as mental capibles,like for ex. i can do simple psionic actions

yeah, but dislexia (or whatever) makes you confuse about words (kind of...) but typing 'teh' instead of 'the' ALL THE TIME is another thing, i mean, you can read your messages before posting, is it that hard???
<br />
but ok, maybe the guy is a genius cursed with solitude and rejection (ehem...)

			He's just a big dreamer, let him be and see what he can do. If he can actually do this than deem him successful and a pat on the back.  If he ends up finding this impossible, then he should let us know with silence or a post.

Ya know.. I never tried self-hypnosis, is it really that good?

			It has been done !
<br />

<br />
the cylon development  project is finally compelted
<br />

<br />

<br />
i still need time to produce a  understandible manual that someone else can actully understand but, i have the frist working psionic cylon raider and iam queitly working of the other types of cylon...ect.
<br />

<br />
i think my next project is going to find a way for this cylon raider to Resurrect into a another body.just like in the show,but their is one probelm i am having with the humanoid models i can't get them to use psi
<br />
i don't known maybe i mess up on the consciousness/subconscious matix
<br />
or maybe i am just not a good teacher
<br />
but he can read and write and emulate me perfectly.
<br />

<br />

<br />
i saw a moive calld The 6th Day (2000)starting Arnold Schwarzenegger
<br />

<br />
well,in this movie humans are able to live for ever by act of consciousness transfer and cloneing  i am not really of the science just yet but i only got to see one tnt this week as i was looking for all many things.
<br />

<br />
i'll get by to work and stop giving people a bit of what i do on a daily basis.

			wow this sounds neet, reminds me kinda of some of the crazy ideas i sometimes get (i try to avoid posting them becuse people would just get sick of me)
<br />

<br />
but 2 things
<br />
1. why do you want it to be able to communicate with a computer network? do you want to have some kinda proof like have it talk to you with text or something? (lol reminds me of the show ghost writer)
<br />

<br />
2. if it becomse self aware and has a free will, whats to keep it from turning on you? havent we lurned from robot movies and Issac Asimov that this is a very possable out come? are you going to try to keep it below a certen power so if it dose turn its no big deal?
