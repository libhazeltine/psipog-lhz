			OK, those of you who know me know that I adore OBE’s and can induce them with some ease, well I could any way. About a month ago, I stopped being able to go OOB.  No matter what technique I try (and I have many) whenever I would usually get to the vibration stage of inducing an OBE I instead seem to fall into a blank and empty frame of mind.  Whilst I’m in this frame of mind I don’t think or comprehend anything.  When I (for lack of a better term) wake up from this mind set (which I have been trapped in for hours at a time), I almost always do so into sleep paralysis and often have the feeling that I’m being attacked (which I hear is a common phenomenon when waking up while still in sleep paralysis).  My lucid dreams also seem to end this way (waking up into sleep paralysis), my ‘normal’ dreams seem to have stopped happening and I have woken up into sleep paralysis from normal (now dreamless) sleep a couple of times (prior to these strange happenings I can only ever remember waking up into sleep paralysis twice in my entire life).
<br />

<br />
I have no real idea why this has started to happen.  The only real change I have recently made to my psionic schedule is that I have stopped practicing energy manipulation, which I have been phasing out for a while any way and I doubt would have this affect.
<br />

<br />
So does anyone have any idea why this might be happening and how I may go about getting back to my usual dream occurrences?
<br />

<br />
Thanks for any advise you may give

			By the sounds of it you're more experienced in OBE's than most others here. You'd probably be the guy <span style="font-style: italic">we</span> would go to for help <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> ...Yes, I doubt the energy manipulation would have anything to do with it as well. My only suggestion; more meditation. That is, if you do not do it a lot now. Meditate without trying to OBE and just relax and clear your head before sleep. Got no idea if it'll help but worth a try...
<br />

<br />
Try to remember the very last time you OBE'd.....Anything different happen than the usual?

			That's normal, it's called lack of energy. You don't have enough energy to go OBE, so your mind wanders in the middle stage. Or it could just be a phase, which you will get over I'm sure. As derricktheone suggested, I also recommend meditation.

			Thanks for the advice, I have been trying meditation more the last couple of days, and I had a good (dream full) nights sleep last night.  No OBE’s yet, but I’m just happy I’m starting to (in lack of a better word) recover.
