			Ok, well I was recently the infamous psiball, and came across a few odd feelings, and I was wondering if anyone could help me figure them out.
<br />

<br />
First I guess we should consider what my goal was, very simple, it was to make a psiball that was as powerful as I could possibly make it.  I could feel power traveling throught my arms (I was focusing the ball into my one dominant hand), and It was growing amazingly powerful, to the point I could feel the magnetic pull it was creating all around my hand, not just in my palm.  As I kept powering it, a few strange things happened. 
<br />

<br />
First, my right hand, which was just transferring energy into the left arm and up to the ball, started to accumulate bits of the energy I was pushing through it, until it was feeling about as powerful as this huge force in my hand, and not shortly after, the psiball in my hand seemed to just disappear, even though my focus was still strongly upon it, and upon it keeping its shape.  It seemed kind of like i was pushing a barrier that wasn't normal or something.  I don't know what it's like to flare a psiball, as I never have before, but I was wondering what this might be...
<br />

<br />
The ball disappeared, and I walked outside, still focusing on it, and it seemed to be a different kind of energy than originally.  The psiball was definitely still there, but it felt weaker, and as the wind hit me, I could feel the wind being disrupted, and sometimes stopped when it hit the area of my psiball... Hoping for somethoughts, thanks

			I've experienced psiballs just..weaken out of no where, but never have any physical effects.

Interesting.

I find it odd that people think &quot;different energy&quot; then different program.

			hmm.. I did say different energy didn't I?  I guess it just felt different than my original intention, like it was leaning away from where my focus had originally been... I dunno, that was a good thing to point out, thanks
