			Reversion, I'm glad you explained that. Like I said, I wasn't doubtful that this could actually happen to someone (why would I be?) it's just that your thoughts were a bit segmented, and it came out as sounding... phony? But yeah, I believe you. I'll try to help you out, but the only thing I can move is a paper wheel at this point.

Honestly how common is this? It's a site regarding it, doesn't mean it's full of people.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Acually it's just as common as people having a brain. Everyone has the capabilities of PK, its just up to them if they choose to practice it or not. (though most people are still unaware that it even exists) Rule of thumb: Every human is capable to do PK

			if you can move a 10 pound object you will dedicate me to keep up with pk...I can only get a quarter turn right now but I will practice more than ever if you can do as you say...it's amazing......but this [art of the forum is meant for people who can do this or want to learn...and that warmth is most likely energy <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

btw moving water is hard because water doesn't have a definate shape so you have to give it one....

You should care how you present yourself if you care about what other people think about you.

<br />

I'm somewhat skeptical as well as to your abilities, purely because I have never seen or experienced the same thing.  I hope you prove me wrong <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Make a video or two, and take some pictures of your eye color change close up and far off.  If you don't have a video camera or digital camera I'm sure you can borrow one, and I believe web cams are pretty cheap.
<br />

<br />
Goodluck to you and I hope you find what you are looking for whatever it is.

			In this case seeing will be the closest I get to believing. But yeah if you could just make some videos of it that would be great, until then I'm just going to pass this off as a load of fluff  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />  Oh and make sure they are movies too becuause a photo could just be a load of photoshop...

			Some people are capable of PK from childhood, and just 'forget' how to perform it.

On the other hand, some people are able to perform PK from childhood and keep on doing it...
<br />

<br />
In the regard to &quot;he doesn't know what TK is&quot;...of course not.  What he has been experiencing is 'normal' to him...of course, I wont go on defending him, but one point is that if you think it is 'normal' then their would be no need to 'understand' it, it just is.  Some people dont have to read articles, most do  <img src="images/smiles/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" border="0" />
