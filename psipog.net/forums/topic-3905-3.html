Well..To be honest.
<br />
I think Keif IS being reasonable. Kudos to him for not totally losing it as some of the folk in here.
<br />
BUT he IS a hard ass skeptic..He's here for you to prove wrong.
<br />
Why don't you do it? And if it isn't acceptable enough for him then ignore him?

			indeed, i agree, but i dont understand why they have to be like they are, they could just say, 'im not certain about that video you made', instead of 'that tard thinks he can do pyrokinesis', or 'are you serious', those comments are unreasonable and not needed.

You are completely retarded and can't do shit.

Your lame attempt to make me just go away or censor me will so you can lie and post bullshit will never, ever work. 
<br />

<br />
You didn't address any of the points I made, you just ignored all the posts directed to you and others, and instead try to pull a duck and cover move saying I did not post a &quot;reasonable reply&quot;, whatever that's supposed to mean.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;they could just say, 'im not certain about that video you made',&quot;

<br />
Because the video you made is bogus, and any monkey with half a brain knows this.

You have been owned. Again!

You tell me to go away, rather I'd suggest you go away and stop posting garbage lest you make a further fool of yourself.

I want a video of you lighting 20 matches in maxus' room. Then I'll be satisfied. Because you know, of course, being a good skeptic means you need to test in accurate testing conditions, right? Or maybe you though you though testing variables in your conditions are the same in completely different house from yours? I'm sure you had the same brand of matches as him too? Maybe the sea level and atmospheric pressures were the same too, huh? Oh, oh, but this is great, because you go on to claim how predictable we are in not having proof and all. All you do is type you lit 20 matches. I could type here that I'm God and I'm going to smite you 5 seconds after you read this. Like I said; until I see you test in accurate conditions, you saying &quot;it's fake&quot; is meaningless to me. Oh but, continuing further, listen to this;

And you have yet to show any proof of this. Who are you to come bitching about not showing proof, and you not only accept you have such knowledge, but show none to validate this claim? If you have this said proof, then save us the time, and more importantly yours that you keep wasting and show us? I think it would be accepted if you presented it in this thread, no matter how off topic the proof is; it would be well worth it, both benefiting you and me and everyone here.

			&quot;I want a video of you lighting 20 matches in maxus' room. Then I'll be satisfied. Because you know, of course, being a good skeptic means you need to test in accurate testing conditions, right?&quot;
<br />

<br />
I don't need to make a video to know that lighting matches and watching them go out is not paranormal.
<br />

<br />
Why don't you try it out for yourself? Or does mommy not let you play with matches?
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Or maybe you though you though testing variables in your conditions are the same in completely different house from yours?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Nope, they are the absolutely the same. 
<br />

<br />
Matches go out if lit and held just as maxus held them. There is nothing paranormal involved. You are just being retarded.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;I'm sure you had the same brand of matches as him too?&quot;
<br />

<br />
I don't need to. Your just being stupid.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Maybe the sea level and atmospheric pressures were the same too, huh?&quot;
<br />

<br />
That wouldn't have anything to do with anything. You are insane if you seriously think so.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh, oh, but this is great, because you go on to claim how predictable we are in not having proof and all.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Nope you don't have proof.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;All you do is type you lit 20 matches.&quot;
<br />

<br />
All I, you, or anyone needs to do is lite just one match or 2 and see I am correct.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;I could type here that I'm God and I'm going to smite you 5 seconds after you read this.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Well you could, but that's because you are a dumb troll who can't think or try something for yourself, you would rather live in delusion.
<br />

<br />
Besides, I'm God. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Like I said; until I see you test in accurate conditions, you saying &quot;it's fake&quot; is meaningless to me.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I did test it in accurate conditions. You are fucking ludicrous. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;And you have yet to show any proof of this.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I don't need to. I'm not making any claim towards paranormal phenomena here. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Who are you to come bitching about not showing proof, and you not only accept you have such knowledge, but show none to validate this claim?&quot;
<br />

<br />
I don't need to validate anything. Someone in that instance had asked what I had personally seen, they did not expect to be shown concrete evidence, nor was I interested in giving an anecdotal account of events transpired.

None of them are correct in any way.

You cannot practice for a rain dance. If that was the case, then why bother with the rain dance in the first place. Need some rain, just call a practice.
