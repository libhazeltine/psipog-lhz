			Hello I am an OG (original gangster) member of this site and I used to come on a lot a few years ago. Was just wondering if anyone has seen Annie around. And annie, if you are reading this, this is Drew from So Cal just sending out my love. Phenomenon with John Travolta (great flick, eh?) was on tv and it urged me to come on here and find you.

These are the people who have dropped off the face of the earth:
<br />

<br />
Annie
<br />
Mazrim/Gome/Jespers
<br />
_NI_ for the most part
<br />

<br />
You'll also find that a lot of the &quot;oldies&quot; have left. Its pretty much Me, DanielH, the mods, Strata, Oneta, and Sawyer.  I'm sure I've left out a few but I'm tired, so if you think you need to be here, I'll edit this.

			Hello Fakiti,
<br />

<br />
She had her reasons which were obviously were personal so I won't discuss this any further. The point is that she's gone. She was a great person who helped this community out a lot and we'll always remember her. She left some of her material located on the website so you'll have to live with that. 
<br />

<br />
Let's be more focused on the future rather than the past. It's never good to dwell on past issues.
