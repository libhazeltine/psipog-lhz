			If spontaneous TP counts then I was born with partial psionic abilities. But I didn't know what it was at the time and I didn't learn about this stuff until years later. The first time I felt psi was when I did a tai ch'i exercise.

			It is seeming to spark uneeded contraversy and arguments, I'd say if it gets worst then lock it, the atmosphere is changing from a question to challenging others &quot;Are you REALLY&quot; sort of thing, as much as I know people would retaliate I can only guess the meaning of this post wasn't to be a &quot;pissing contest&quot;. I answered honestly, heck I didn't even know fully where to place myself, though others, out of spite or disbelief seem to want to turn this into more of a downer to the others.

			There are supposedly alot of psychics and healers in my family, only met one of them so idk if it's true.  
<br />

<br />
It's not if you are born with more psi, we're all pretty equal when we start off, it's what our parents let us believe.  When we're little and hear some thing is true, which it may or may not be, we'll believe it.  If our parents tell us Pk is real then it'll be easier to understand and accept when we try it.  So this really doesn't make alot of sense and is almost verging on religion.

			I think 'smartness' plays a role as well. I've noticed that the better psion you become, the more intelligent you become. (When I say intelligent I actually mean ability to learn; 'geniusness')
<br />
I know chris is an excellent psion and he takes all these advanced courses in high school. There are probably other examples that I just can't think of right now, but I hope you guys got what I'm trying to say.
<br />
When you explore psionics, you become more in tune with your subconscious, building stronger links that make it easier to access information. You also learn quicker because of this. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Soo..... to get on to my point. Many different people are born w/ different intellectual abilities. Take the geniuses, Einstein, Planck, Da Vinci and countless others. I bet one thousand dollars these people would have grasped psionics quicker than your average joe. 
<br />

<br />
So yes there are factors that determine how naturally you weild psi, but I just think each determining factor is individual. There is no one right answer.

			I would say I'm about as natural as you get.  You know, kind of like Jesus or Buddha <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.  But seriously, without the heresy, I'm definitely a natural.  My skills develop without practice and I was born able to perform: telempathy (including TPS), constructs making, TK, psionic control of electronics, precog, clairvoyance/RV, phasing, teleportation, astral (and etheric) projection and aura vision.  The whole shebang.  Of course, it came at a cost of being dyslexic, bipolar, having a mild case of OCD, and plenty of geisting/overloads of various kinds.  So it's a tradeoff.

			well i was watching another post called aura vision.
<br />

<br />
one person brought up a very interesting point that makes sense.
<br />

<br />
the poster said that they had been able to see auras from an early age, after a while they just sort of forgot aura vision and had to 'open up' (used cause lack of a better phrase) aura vision again.
<br />

<br />
so i think that everyone is not only born w/ the ability to perform psionic skills, but are actually capable of doing them. hmmmm do you get the difference in these to statements? as we grow up we 'forget' how to do them and what we are doing now is reconnecting.
<br />

<br />
so those who are the 'natural borners' just were able to somehow keep the connection. its just a theory though =)
<br />

<br />
oh and lightbringer, i sort of know how you feel. i'm dyslexic and i have ADD and i was able to do basic psi skills pretty descently but never realized until a while ago. 
<br />

<br />
it sort of stinks to have learning disabilities in some senses. as for me...it has affected my school work and concentration in general. it seems you've got some serious cases though, but at least there's medication to help them out a lil. (i dont know if you take meds, and don't take offense if i mentioned that. i only say that cause i know some people who are a little sensitive and i don't want you to get irritated or something.)

			Cool theory on the differences between naturals vs. nons.  It kind of reminds me of Freud's theory that we used to be telepathic and it evolved out of us as it became vistigial when we developed spoken language.  It would make sense such an ability would be needed to communicate per-spoken word so that you would be able to agree on what words actually meant.  If you extend that theory, it hardly seems unlikely that a baby's ability to learn spoken language in a matter of months would be anything but telepathically aided.
<br />

<br />
As for my disorders, I've actually overcome the bipolar and am slowly getting rid of my OCD.  I've never really found meds necessary so I've just used willpower and mental conditioning to deal with those problems.  It wasn't easy though.  I would bet you could do the same with ADD, but dyslexia isn't something that just goes away.  I need to figure out some strategies for dealing with it, kind of like how Dr. Nash in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; dealt with his schozophrenia.  It's not like such conditions will just go away...
