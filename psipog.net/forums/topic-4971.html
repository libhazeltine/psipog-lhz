			I'm new to this so bare with me ok. I'm just trying.

The book contains pictures that you and your friend wouldn't want anyone else to see. Now this friend you speak of, is it really your friend? Or is it just you?
<br />

<br />
As for the location of the book, it's placed flat somewhere. It's not upwards/vertical, it's flat. On the ground, maybe under a bed. Once again I'm not sure since I'm new to this and only trying. So let me know.

			my friend is a she... and the book is entitled DOH department of health.. she needs it for our upcoming midterm exam, and I'm just trying help her.. but since I can't RV, i asked help from you guys... please help.. thank you... and oh yeah i think you are right, there is a letter there inserted (not pictures) intended for her uncle... and she did say, she doesnt want anyone else to read it, so I guess yah that's one thing why she needed it to be found... she last saw it on our room after class and now it's not there.. she thinks that somehow someone might have get it accidentally as if it was his or hers OR the book was really left there until someone (not our classmate) took it.. please help us where to find it.. thank you.

			I'm still getting in flat on somewhere. I'm almost 100% sure it's not on any shelves. If it is, it's flat on a shelf. Maybe under a bed. I suddenly got something else. Do you or someone you know have a computer at the foot of their bed. Like where the foot of the bed is, there's a computer desk nearby. Look under the desk and/or around the desk.
<br />

Once again I'm just a newbie at this, but I'm trying.
