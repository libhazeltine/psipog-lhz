(i bolded what is important ^^.)  Where do skeptics come from?  If i went up to someone (i have to one of my friends), they would either think i was insane, really cool, or walk away and never talk to me again.   It wouldnt help much.  I dont think people would be willing to just accept it because it goes against everything they believe.  Anyway, it excited me to see a topic with my name on it (literally <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />).

			There are some thing wrong with showing the scientific community what we can do. 
<br />

<br />
1) They wouldn't believe it and would search for ways to show how we do it without using as they call. &quot;An unreal force.&quot; Which would cause WAY too much af a media wave, finallly, maybe expanding to a splitting of communities right down the middle. (People pick sides.)
<br />

<br />
2) They do believe and the goverment and private grou[s want to use us as tools and wont treat us as humans. Like use us as weapons, spys or even fortune tellers. Eventuly this will lead to HUGE Psi Wars, because you know scientist would find a way to enhance abilities. Resulting in mass destruction.
<br />

<br />
3) They believe us and think we would be corrupted by power and want to start a secret, maybe public witchhunt. Resulting in thousands, or millions of deaths.
<br />

<br />
Thats just a few, and the reasons I wont be a lab rat to some four eyed skeptic with governemt backing. I tried before to subit my abilites to those people, but they shoved me away. I told a couple friends at school and that resulted in alination from my student body and from my parents. I don't want anyone else to go through that. If you want to subject your powers then I will back you up all the way, ill even go with you if you want me to. Just PM me and ill give you a number to call me. I just don't want stuff to go down, like it does on &quot;X-Men&quot;. I know that might be a little extreme, but with the goverment and the amount of effect the media has on us today, it is very well possible.

Thanks for reading, but please don't thing im perinoid (Sp?). -Salem

			umm... just wondering.. since we are talknig about good telekinetics and I do respect Rainsong to the highest degree. Why hasn't anyone mentioned her. She is by far the most advanced I've heard or seen comment on anything.

			Absolute power corrupts absolutely, I believe the saying goes?
<br />

<br />
We're in a state now where things are neutral, possibly more tipped for good. If psionics was accepted by the masses, obviously there are those who would use it for their own destructive purposes, and also those who disagree with the use of it and will violently oppose it.
<br />

<br />
Both of which would potentially lead to something right out of X-men.
<br />

<br />
So it all comes down to how *public* these things become, and who it's presented to.
<br />

<br />
-just my two cents

			I think that in future, some andvanced Psions must take this step and make all this public and form Universities of Psi
<br />

<br />
I will take that step if I ever get chance for it
<br />
One who do that might end up screwed and everything, but it would be for greater good, for future of mankind

People who get enough courage to bring Psi to everyone will be in history books.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />
