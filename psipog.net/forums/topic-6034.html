			According to Rainsong:
<br />
Once your preparations are complete, visualize a grey mist closing in around you; warm and fluffy and comfortable and increasingly dense. Allow it to blot out all other sensations, then mentally 'swim' through it with a nice leisurely breast stroke. Each stroke will push away any thoughts that might distract you. 'Swim' toward your target person, knowing that your focused intent will lead you to the right one ~ if your focused intent is not sufficient to this task, dreamwalking is beyond your current skill. 
<br />

<br />
How does one develop sufficient... mentality... to perform this task?

.......to first learn how to swim in the first place?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
ok ok ok I'm serious.....I no expert on forcus like everyone else here, but what I try to do is by putting myself in a self mediated trance you may have more direct thoughts. But that is just my opinion.

			The technique described by Rainsong is just his personal technique and maybe one that works for some other people too, though you can try to do it in your own way. Dreamwalking is definately a very difficult. I mean you'd see the hidden fantasies and fears of other persons and know exactly how they think, so i guess it is very good, that it is this hard. Without this strong mental presence you'd probably not know how to handle with it or maybe do it in a bad way.  Apart of this apparently you're not able to do it at all.

			I have on occasion attempted to &quot;dreamwalk&quot; into another's dream. Though I do so from the comfort of one of my frequent Lucid Dreams. I would go to a door. ANY door. Could be the door to a house I come across in my dream, could be the door to my own bathroom. Then I tell myself, &quot;This door will lead me to *insert person here*'s dream.&quot;  I open the door, and enter.
<br />
My first attempt at this placed me in a house Im certain I had never seen before. I wound up talking with a friend (though I suspect they weren't lucid, and thought me to be part of their dream.) for a while. The following day, I described to the best of my ability, how the house appeared, though I didn't mention why I had this description. Apparently it was their house (this is someone I know online, and have never met) and they were surprised I knew of it, but surmised I had been talking with someone they know in person.
<br />
Further attempts yielded similar results, though as I've found not everyone dreams of being in their house. I also hit a few snags, which I believe to be attempting to &quot;connect&quot; to someone who wasnt in REM sleep at the time, as the door I opened yielded nothingness, but a re-attempt later on in the same dream yielded a short visit.
<br />

<br />
I seem to be able to do this easily and casually, much like my lucid dreams. It just seems to be a natural talent, I guess. Anyone who can is welcome to try and visit my dreams, though I must warn you: as a powerful lucid dreamer, I will make sure you regret any hostile attempts.
