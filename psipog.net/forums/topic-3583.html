			Well my psi wheel wasn't working and I figured it might be because it was cut very bad and not that proportional.  I got a decent sized paper one and it worked great.  I put the paper ( Pretty flatted out because I used it to trace on tinfoil ) aside and got the tin foil out.  I was spinning that til I got a weird headache and nothing seemed real.  I thought &quot; Woah I'm losing it, I'm getting some food and taking a long break &quot; Still woozy I look over and my flattened out psiwheel is sliding/spinning slowly ( Only moved about 3 inches ) and kind of moving where I looked. 
<br />

<br />
Now I totally believe and I can't wait to feel better.
<br />

<br />
Edit - Do you see weird strings from the corners of the spinning psiwheel only when your hand is near it?

I never see strings, and my hands are always near it. Good job on moving the psiwheel.

			huh.  The seeing strings thing is interesting.  Do you see them coming from your hands when you're practicing?  I've read reports on nina kulagina where the people observing her said that they could see spider-web like strings coming from her hands when she was doing telekinesis

			Strings... Sounds like the connection between your evergy and the psiwheel's - like a vandergraph.  Also, the arcs need more energy to jump further...  I sometimes see a connection between my fingers and the psiwheel, and once, when doing it without hands I saw a 'beam' which looked like it was coming from my solar-plexus, and aimed at the psiwheel.

			A friend of mine sees string-like things he calls 'threads'. Don't know if it's the same thing. Perhaps.
<br />
Also, go read up on quantum mechanics and string theory.

Hold your hands up to a blank wall and point your two pointerfingers at each other.  You'll prolly see them really good.  It's aura sight.  Your just seeing the energy your using to move the object.

			lol practicing my psi wheel and finally got somewhat connected sensation, was trying to spin clockwise and feel the connection with my hand. However, strange sensation on one finger and ultra fast white ball blip opposite side of what I was aiming for pushing straight down, if psi looks like that one hell of strange looking stuff. 
<br />

<br />
P.S my energies when I do psi balls tend to look more like a pale flourescent electricity glow that takes most of the time aura sight to spot and it sorta goes up in waves really strange.

			I dont see strings, just a faint blue light. Very faint blue light. When I put my fingers close together no strings, just the same faint light I see when I perform TK. I have flared before.

I hope it's aura sight... that seems very useful.  If it is mine isn't very developed because when I do the pointerfinger thing I see a clear clound thing emit from both hands and it's about 1 cm big.

			Welp, now I know telekinesis for me cant be off.. I do have this odd feeling of connection but I guess that due to mixed frequencies i have (explained in my latest topic) theres little to no force behind it/ available for me to use to move it. Thanks for unknowingly helping me clear the air with that.

			@joed12: that good.  I didn't see anything besides taht for a while.  The reason you see it easily because your really looking at the wall.  Thats how you look at ppl's aura's, you look past them.

			I see the strings also but I thought that it was just visulation.... do you immagine them pulling the corners? that is what I do. I also se the lines sometimes when I make psi balls and constructs. 
<br />
As for string theory.... it has almost nothing to do with this....
