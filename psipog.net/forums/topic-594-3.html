			Nice post, I'll try out the relaxation technique and connection techniques tonight =)

A question:  The whole idea of TK  from what I've read is to not try to move it.  I get that, and it definitely works for making a psiwheel spin, but how can you control direction/speed if you aren't supposed to actually *try* to move it?

			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
I've updated this article late last night. I mostly fixed minor grammar errors and added small parts to extend the article. I thank you all for your comments and I'm looking forward to reading more <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. 
<br />

Sheep, learning to control the wheel is something that can be learned in time. As long as you keep up your practice you'll soon find that moving the psi-wheel will become more easier and you'll gain more control.  
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />
- JoeT

			Hi, I'm a bit on the newbish side (I've practiced macro-TK all of one night, ive been Microing for 2 days before that, with good results), but if eveything goes well, you should see alot me around soon.  
<br />

<br />
I meditated for around a half hour last night then sat with one hand next to a tinfoil scrap on a pin for another half hour trying to contemplate the mysteries of the universe, and I decided that NI's method was probably a bit above me.  Ironically enough, I got better results (one quarter turn) before meditation and when I was using a technique of my own, that seems to not be very good (imagined magnets).  I hope that your method will show some better results.  I plan on trying it out tonight after some more meditation.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I was wondering, Is there any expected timeframe? Like, you say there will be results IN TIME, but what does that mean? If I meditate for a half hour and practice for a half hour every night, about how quickly would you assume results?
<br />

<br />
Thanks
<br />

<br />
(Edit: Me and my friend tried it this evening, and we got 6 or 7 good twitches out of the wheel.)

			When I did TK on the psi-wheel, after a while, I could 'feel' the connection. Without the connection, these is no hope. The connection is the single most important factor for it to work, as well as determination, perserverance, and most importantly practice. I had my eyes open. Eventually, my vision was like a tunnel to the object, and that seemed to signify the connection to my sub-c.
<br />
After being next to it, just watching TV, it never moved at all, so I moved it alot more than I thought, before watching TV. I moved it about 180 degrees a couple of times, and it moved very slowly and steadily, with no wobble. I even stopped it and made it change direction, but I got too exited and lost the connection. It became hard to re-establish the connection, so that's about when I quit.
<br />
It was my first time with the psi-wheel. I guess it helps that I am ridiculously open-minded and I am able to truly understand what JoeT and NI have said in their articles. I read all of the articles on TK on psipog.net and that helped immensely. Of course, It seemed as if I forgot some of it so I'm gonna have to read them constantly for consistent results.
<br />
One thing though... I did get a slight pressure between my eyebrows when I performed TK. Not pain or anything significant, so I thought it was okay. My heartrate didn't jump, no sweating, no being hot, I just felt 'focused'. Do you think that's okay to feel the slight pressure? Do you feel it JoeT? What about others that have performed TK?
