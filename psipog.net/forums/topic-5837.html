			At times, when I make a connection, I can read thoughts. I can make suggestions in person's heads. I can read memories and images. I can walk in dreams, and in minds. I can sometimes create images for people to see, but that is sketchy. I can make links with more than one person. I can do other things too. 
<br />
I can do micro-pk too....
<br />
I can do lots of things that deal with telepathy. I can sometimes make people feel things.

			I don't like where this thread is going. There aren't levels- you can have an aptitude for something or not, you can be trained in something or not, telepathy isn't measured in levels. Calling someone 'advanced' is a very arbitrary term, subjective to each individuals perception of the word. What would probably be better would be to post your most crowning achievement in telepathy and let that speak for your ability. For myself, I'm more of an empath, but because the two do go together a good deal, I'm very intuitive and have on a a number of occasions found myself answering people's questions before they ask me <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> Kinda creeps them out sometimes.

			There are times where people DO set levels of telepathy. When you are a telepath, and able to do it well to a degree, you begin to feel the 'levels' people are at. It's not obvious to others, because it's somethign that is felt within the mind. 
<br />
Psi powers is simply an open door in the mind. There are strengths this door is open or not open. It changes the way the light in the brain goes, and how far it goes also how fast and smooth. 
<br />
Being a telepath is interesting, because you feel these things in people's heads. 
<br />
As for telepathy, there are no such things as bad telepaths. There are only unskilled telepaths. 
<br />
I am just asking for an estimate of where I am on the telepath scale. Low, Middle or High? I just want to know how far my own education has gone. It's more of a teaching tool for me. I just need a set path. Something to follow.
