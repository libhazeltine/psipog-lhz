			I once made an AI construct with all my current psionic skills, and made it orbit me. I made it scan a shield and store the information in a seperate construct, then I scanned that construct for the information, and it appeared to be correct. Might sound like a bothersome way of doing it, but it was fun.

			I once made a cat. In typical cat-like fashion, it proceeded to go bother my dogs.
<br />
Friend of mine made a &quot;wragamuffin&quot; a creature of his own design. If he sees this thread he can tell you more about it.

			Hehe, I'm that friend.
<br />

<br />
I made it sit on my shoulder, and bite me. <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I just really formed the shape of the creature, then programmed it with its behaviour, then stuck it on my shoulder. It had no use, but it was fun.

			I've made a &quot;few&quot; pets before. They were actually just told to walk on my desk before I got bored of them and destroyed them. I never made a complicated construct that I kept around for very long.
<br />

<br />
Programming them will vary from construct to construct. If you want a cat just make it walk around on your desk and be a pest. Is that enough cat for you? Some people may want more than that... perhaps they want it to react to their mood. There is an entire different program. How would you add something to it after it's already made?
<br />

<br />
Well, you can always make a new one, but why waste time and energy on that (other than practice)? Maybe you can program it beforehand to accept new &quot;code&quot; and just run with that. Or will adding a new construct to function as a different part of the brain work just as well?
<br />

<br />
Go out and try different things, it'll be fun. Perhaps you can make a midgit or a mountain and trees. Yay for constructs and creativity! Just make sure it's not all in your imagination. Oh, and be careful for a flying monster made of Italian food. I hear he hunts down constructs now that there are less Pirates in the world.

			I actually had a &quot;psi-pet&quot; for a week or so, before it bacame a more permanent construct.  It had a number of purposes.
<br />
Primary - follow me, and gather energy from surrounding areas to stay charged, shelled
<br />
secondary - precog 5 seconds into the future constantly, and alert (telepathically) to any items/energy passing into my field at that time
<br />
 - look for any unusual sources of energy (TP alert)
<br />
 - use gathered energy to help with telepathic bursts (simply relay TP info through the construct, making it function as an amplifier)
<br />

<br />
good times, too many commands eventually turned it to mush, but the prcog thing was later made into a more durable construct (after I was significantly better at shelling too).

i'm not confident enough to make an AI construct like that. i'd end up losing it anyway cause i dont have aura vision or any of those sencing abilities developed. XD

			Unfortunately, I could never get it to be very specific (or, rather, I could spend time analyzing what the dangerous event in the future was, but it would take on the magnitude of 10 seconds, by which the event had already come and gone).  Used in a physical combat situation, it turned out better to ignore (oh look, danger....and um, still danger....).  Never knew when the punches were coming, just that they would be coming...  It has it's uses (beginning of a fight or hazardous situation), but continuity wasn't one of them.
