			Hi everyone i am posting in this thread because i need some personal teqniques on you guys to PK...and i also have a few questions
<br />

<br />
first some backround info-
<br />

<br />
i have been practicing on and off for about a year now...in the beginning it to me only a week to become good at the psiwheel...then i moved on and was very succsessful...told some friends and they discouraged me so i quit...i started up again in september and was able to do what i left off with practicing (sliding chunks of wood)...anyway i slowly began to get worse and worse at my PK to the point of not being able to move anything even the slightest bit (nothing major is happening in my life that is changing my thoughts and abilities {at least nothing i know of})
<br />

<br />
my questions are...
<br />

<br />
1. Why am i all of the sudden bad at PK?
<br />

<br />
2. Is there anyway to fix it?
<br />

<br />
3. Have any of you expierenced this before?
<br />

<br />
4. If you answered yes to question 4... did you ever get back on track with your practice

a1) could be boredom. i found that if i just practice because i have to, i start losing concentration, because i know i can do it. eventually, i get to the point where i dont really care about it and lose interest.
<br />

<br />
my advice: do your practice like you did when you first started, when you were excited and this was all fresh to your mind!
<br />

<br />
a2) yes. it could be linked with enthusiasm, like i said above. set yourself a new challenge....
<br />

<br />
a3) yep. i started pk before xmas, got good, then fell ill for like 6 weeks. so no pk. when i started back up again i was back at novice level. also i wasnt to bothered about moving objects....
<br />

<br />
a4) yes, over the past month i have been practicing alot more. reason being is that i taught alot of people how to do it, and it encouraged me to be one step ahead lol (<span style="font-weight: bold">competition</span>)
<br />

<br />
also i got alot of questions about it, and in order to get an answer, i would use their method of practice etc.
<br />

<br />
ANOTHER thing is that i set myself new goals. i could move the psi-wheel, it is a piece of piss...to the stage where it became boring. now iv moved onto bigger objects, i strive to move them. even if im unsuccessful, its that ambition, that strive that keeps me going <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
hope this has helped.
