			Isn't too real looking a good thing rofl?  Thats like saying you saw a guy get hit by a car, but his guts flying everywhere was so real to you that it was fake.
<br />

<br />
I for one am neutral on the video.  I mean, it was posted by that muslim guy (Idk if hes muslim, or Russian, or what, but hes allways posting his videos of tk, which seem pretty real.) so thats a source of some trust in the video.  Its also some random old man, in what looks to be a foreign country...who doesn't trust old men?
<br />

<br />
And to levitate something, you're going to have to have some sort of mental proof and belief that it's possible, and I think this is a good one.

			I'm pretty sure there was already a discussion about Jack. He uses invisible string.  I'm also a magician and I did this effect just like him, with string, not TK.  Tk is jerky since you often hit the right wavelength then &quot;fall&quot; off of it.  I don't believe it's real, but that's just my opinion.

			erm...did you not see him move his hands everywhere, AS WELL AS MOVE IT WITH OUT HIS HANDS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GLASS?  If he's using invisible string, I guess he's using tk to control said string, seeing as how he sure as hell isn't using his hands half the time.

what do you mean? he has his hands behind his back. he can still be holding the string. what u can do is either put the string over your finger and throw it over your head to have leverage (and the reverse effect) or you can just loop the string around an ear ring.

			No thanks, but please give me some proof that this real.  Also, when he movd it when his hands were behind his back, it was a very small movement.... this is because your range of movement is much smaller behine  your back.... He used Invisible string, or atleast that's my story and I'm sticken to it.

			K, he used invisible string, so everyone who has done a psi-wheel is using invisible string too I suppose <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
You can move a psi-wheel with invisible string just as easy. 
<br />

<br />
Do you want to explain to me in thorough detail how he could put it in the glass.  Have his hands clear from the glass.  And then levitate it out without it hanging off of a side?  Please elaborate on that.

			wow i really don't know what to say about that one...it does look too perfect to be true but i really don't see anyway a string could have been used....mabye the hands behind the back didn't work as good because they never seem to...it's &quot;harder&quot; for you to do PK without your hands isn't it?...But i'm also not saying it's 100% real...How about it's just a great video

I can't complain with that!  It looks like an amazing video.  All I am saying is that unless you become amazingly good with PK, the movements of object will usually come in bursts.  Also, if you are levitating something, I doubt it would stay in the air that long.  
<br />

<br />
Just my thoughts, but it could be real if he has been practicing his whole life seeing as he's not the youngest person?

			F****** n00bs piss me off. Please give real evidence that it is real, or give real evidence that it is not. Hmmm, were any of you guys on this board there when it was recording? NO, so STFU, you have absolutely NO ARGUMENT EITHER WAY. 
<br />

<br />
If you post something that ways it is not real, the wookie dude (workinonit) will post a nonsensical rebuttal. But, Workinonit, you also have no evidence that it is real so just stfu and use you time more wizely than this. I don't know why you seem to defend this vid so badly, either you made it, or if gives you inspiration to practice psionics and if it were disproven, you would have no more motivation, or something else. But be intelligent, try to prove the phenomenon to yourself, just believe you can and you will get it.
<br />

<br />

<br />
P.S. There should be a system, some menubar or something where you can vote to lock threads, if you get 5-10 or more votes, then the thread gets locked. And make it so a person can only vote once (obviously)

Not if someone else keep string above him, when he keeps his hands above the ball, he can have string between fingers, not so big deal

			Id take more consideration of your critisising if it didn't sound like you were a 12 year old.  I'm not defending it, as I said, I'm neutral on it, It could be real, it could be fake, there is no proof to say it is or isn't here.

Lol, who in their right minds would do that? It would be kind of obvoius because all the voters would have no posts. and it is also possible to tell what IP address members are at, so you would see that they were all from the same IP. I still think the vote to close the thread thing is a good idea though; It makes less work for the mods.
