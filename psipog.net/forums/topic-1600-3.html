			I find it interesting that you imply that those of us who do not care if we are believed by random strangers on the internet also refuse to engage in any activity which might advance the acceptance and/or study of psionics &quot;in the real world&quot;.  
<br />

<br />
For example...I've stated publically on this site that I will not generally make any attempt to &quot;prove psionics&quot; online.  Videos are too easily faked to be worth the effort, for example, and I have better things to do with my time than conduct endless demonstrations of minor effects, as is true of most people.   All that said, I have participated in formal studies of psionic effects conducted by various organizations in the United States and Canada.  
<br />

<br />
On a smaller scale....let's see....I was discussing psionic healing with a co-worker, as we were leaving the office on Friday.  My boss purchased a book on the same topic, as a result of my advice, the week before.  I've been asked to teach at one of the local energy-working schools, and I have published articles on the topic of psionics.  I _still_ don't care whether you believe in psionics, gravity and sea-water, though.

I really do not think that physical demonstrations are the best way to reveal.  You must get on their own level and explain it to them.  On the other hand, you can't just tell random people.  You have to find the right people.  Those who are ambitious; those who think not about how things work, but why they work; those who have the attitude of &quot;I am missing something in this life&quot; (that's totally how I was); those who desire power; those who have had past unexplainable experiences; those who are eccentric, or are &quot;outcasts;&quot; and, of course, those who are slightly insane seem to do better.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			*steps up on dust free soapbox* well I have tried to just get into conversations with people about the paranormal with a line like, &quot;i heard about this thing called psionics.&quot; I say that before I reveal that im a psion, about 3 sentences into the conversation they call me a satan worshipper or a psychotic freak.....and if psionics was introduced what would happen?...utter chaos..people would hack each other and the one who didnt know how to shield would be killed by the advanced telepaths, love and hate would be induced instead of naturally occuring, people would be shockng, burning, freezing and pushing each ther with PK......i would go on but i think the soapbox has an appointment with another ranter....

This is a good point... But think about it: when machine guns, or even muskets were invented, people didn't go around shouting each other up just because they could... and I don't think the same thing will happen if psionics becomes common knowlegde.

By the way, love and hate are just chemical reactions.  Inducing them only involves using one's own system against him/herself  We can't control our emotions, just affect what their results are.  So does it really matter if a person is contolling it or if our programmed personality is?  It's kind of a weird point, but it makes sense.  That's why I don't get it when people say, &quot;true love.&quot;  What's that?  It just means that our biological programming has decided that this person is more attractive than anyone else.

I disagree, emotions are more than just chemicals, when you go to a wartorn battlefield, even 50 years into the future, you can still feel the anger, the sadness, the devastation, emotions are energy, simply because certain chemicals trigger emotional responses does not mean that the chemicals are the emotions themselves.

there's something called love at first sight, it happens, even when one person is ugly. I've seen it. at any rate, chemical reaction or not, these feelings are real, and they are a part of what makes us real.

			What you have to realize though, is that there will always be skeptics, and there will always be believers. What does it matter to prove to the world it is true, if you know so yourself? Realize that to the average person, none of this DOES seem very logical. I can understand why they might not believe it. As for bringing proof that it isn't true, that isn't such an easy task. How do you go about proving that psi isn't there and that you can't manipulate, or that people really can't communicate through their minds?
<br />
For instance &quot;Innocent until proven guilty&quot;. Until proven guilty, the people remain in innocence. So until actually proven to them validly, they have reason to have doubts.

This is only because certain emotions have been &quot;asigned&quot; to these memories.
<br />

<br />
Emotions are obviously not a entirely physical thing.  To humans, they are only a mental thing.  I can't explain very well, but I don't think anybody could.  Emotions are not a very well-known topic.  You can't exactly research the feelings from emotions.  Yes, emotions are what make us human, so it might be best for them to remain a mystery, anyway.  I am getting very confused here.

This made more sense in context.  All I meant here is that we would not feel the emotion any different if it was created by personality or by DMILS.  I did not mean that people wouldn't care if they were being deluded or not.  Everybody would.
<br />

<br />
Also, by &quot;attractive,&quot; I did not mean appearence, but any facet of a person that one might find appealing.

Sorry if I'm being dogmatic here, but I'm going to try to get back on topic.

So far I haven't heard one good reason why I should stop. Anti-revealers should stop posting unless they have something new and incredible. What's that? I hear what's your arguement? Well my arguement is that it's the next step in human evolution. Actually, that might not be right. This trait never appeared by natural selection it just is there. If I am going by Lamarck then it would work but not Darwin. It's more like people should know because it could solve so many problems. I heard somewhere that some wars start over a misunderstanding or mistranslation. What if we could telepathically do this. It would undo that. Plus we could use imprinting to keep records. Just imprint a telepathic message on a rock and keep rocks in a bige vault with all our history. Even better is we could imprint things for school and every day writing would be obsolete. Phones would die off, strong Tkers could move heavy things (it's all will based), empaths and telepaths could help cure mental diseases, healers could heal people, and remote veiwers could communicate with people even better and look at disastors and such. These just name a few of the many advantages when humans learn to accept psionics. This won't happen in my life time probably and will take atleast 100 years but we should start now. Lemme see one reason that counteracts all of that.

Edit: Please keep that philosophy out of this. It dosen't have a lot to do with anything. PM me or PK for more info. on it. We have mostly similiar veiws about that crap known as emotion.

			Emotion...
<br />

<br />
say wha?
<br />

<br />
Niushirra, you're letting your imagination get ahead of you.
<br />

<br />
personally, I believe in probable outcomes, rather than chance, luck, or fate.
<br />

<br />
or, in the terms of the future...a 'multiverse'.
<br />

<br />
every nanosecond (shortest timeframe I can think of right now...I think femosecond is smaller.), a huge amount of 'universes' are created, as possibilities appear. Your 'entity' follows one path of the universes.
<br />

<br />
For example, in this universe, you're reading this. In an 'alternate' (but very similar, it only broke of a few seconds ago) universe, you're reading something completely and totally different. In an 'alternate' (very different, broke of hundreds of years ago) universe, the world is in total chaos.
<br />

<br />
At least, that's what I like to crazily believe.

I have actually made a group of people that will help prove psionics to skepitcs. Its in the general discussion area and is call &quot;Psi_Ninja's anti-skeptic group&quot; Join if you want, just post your AIM adress and if you are really good at a certain type of psionic skill. Go to the tread if you are interested.
<br />

<br />
But I do think that if the media find out about psionics, it would be chaos. Devil Worshpper... i mean bladeslinger... might be right. There could be a horrible fight and maybe a war. People would probablly get killed.
<br />

<br />
My anti-skeptic group is for more of proving it to people who are sort of skeptic and wont shut up about it. Like i said in my thread... i have already lost some abilites due to skeptics and their big mouths.
