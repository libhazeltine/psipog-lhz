From Forgotten Realms books... The Dark Elf trilogy, The Icewind Dale trilogy, the Legacy of the Drow, Paths of Darkness, and the Hunter's Blades trilogy. There are a lot of books about him. Drizzt was created by the same person who wrote the Cleric Quintet, R.A. Salvatore.

			Spike from Cowboy Bebop...the only anime character that isn't stupidly cliche, immature and poorly developed.  Well, I guess Tetsuo was really well developed, but that movie was too weird for me to really like it or any of it's characters.
<br />

<br />
As far as video game characters, definitely Dagoth Ur from Morrowind.  Such amazing character depth, he was one of the few villians I actually kind of liked because by the end of the game you knew him so well that you could understand him and almost relate.  Plus he was just so frickin epic and hardcore, but not in the classically anime way where huge blasts of energy are always flying from him, nor was his visual appearance marred by endless amounts of flare and little &quot;cool&quot; tidbits.  He just radiated royalty and power.
<br />

<br />
As you can probably tell by now, I have a hate on for anime characters because they lack any sense of subtlety, nuance or deep meaning.  They just look and act &quot;cool&quot;, which in itself shows their creators are making them try too hard which makes them far from lasting, interesting characters to me.
<br />

<br />
For movie characters, I'd probably go with a couple: Kulikov from Enemy at the Gates for his jaded, disillusioned state.  And of course, James-frickin-Bond!  Especially the newest Bond, more modern than Sean Connery, and just all-around waaaay better than Pearce Brosnan.

			James Bond is a horrible character in general. He is a chauvanistic bastard with no respect for anyone. You want a good spy character, Ethan Hunt, of Mission Impossible fame, is a good one. He has respect for others and isn't a chauvanistic git. Ugh. James Bond. It doesn't matter who plays him, he's always a jack.
