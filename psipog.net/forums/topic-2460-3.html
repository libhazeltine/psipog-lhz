The terms &quot;Ori&quot; and &quot;The Ancients&quot; are only related to ascension because the sci-fi show Stargate SG-1 (and it's spinoff) involves ascension in it's storyline and lore.  The Ancients are the &quot;good&quot; ascended beings (humans that ascended to a higher plane like the etheric) and Ori are the &quot;bad&quot; humans that didn't so much ascend as just gained tremendous power through perverted means and became like stronger malevolent entities in the astral plane.  Stargate does have some interestingly accurate lore relating to occult practices and things, but anything that is deliberately fiction obviously isn't a source of real information since it's been twisted and digested by a writer for the show lol.

			OBE refers to all experiences where your perception is separate from your physical body.  Astral projection is when your perception is shifted from your physical body to your astral body.  Etheric projection is when you perceive from your etheric body.  3 very separate terms, although there is some overlap.

are you saying that only good people can ascend? because if so I will have to kick you in the nads. Or at least wish that I could do so over the internet. I have seen nothing to suggest that one's morality has anything to do with power. Incidentally, morality isn't even natural. you don't see animals or trees walking around being moral, do you?
<br />

<br />
as for the astral spilling onto the earth, since lightbringer never bothered explaining... changes made in the astral are reflected in the physical, though not always in the same way. if the astral equivalent of your house turned into gold, for instance, your house's value might go up, or you might make more cash, or something. it so happens that thoughts leave an impression in the astral. that why religions usually get followers so easily, it sends energy to the deity, defines it, shapes it. But I'm starting to get into religion and I might have already said too much, so I'm going to end this here.

I just described fictional lore.  How are you getting confrontational over my description of something that I stated repeatedly DOES NOT EXIST?  It's a TV show! I expressed no views of my own, I simply gave the source for some of the fluff out there about ascension. Go kick yourself in the nads for jumping the gun and not bothering to even read my post correctly.

the way you state it here implies that you think it's taking from real life. not to mention that you have been known to say worse things... xiousliden or however it's spelled is the same way, sometimes I think the 2 of you are really the same person, especially as you 2 agree with each other A LOT on very stupid things, for instance, I believe you've both called Criss Angel the next messiah  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />  and I'm not certain, but I think I've read posts from you saying similar things about how only good people can ascend before.
<br />

<br />
I've been rather tired lately, so I may be wrong, I think I'll try to find posts where you and... that one person agree on something stupid in case you deny that you two agree. I still hate you, but I will apologize if I misunderstood anything, I restate that I have been tired lately so my brain isn't working as well as normally. Just yesterday I woke up thinking I was king of tibequador, which does not exist.

Okay, I'll answer this with a quote from the SAME POST as the one you quoted:

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Lightbringer wrote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">The terms &quot;Ori&quot; and &quot;The Ancients&quot; are only related to ascension because the sci-fi show Stargate SG-1 (and it's spinoff) involves ascension in it's storyline and lore.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
It's in the same paragraph.  Congratulations on your ground breaking attempts at selective reading.
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>WhiteRaven wrote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">I believe you've both called Criss Angel the next messiah  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Well good luck finding that post because I've only ever made one comment regarding Criss Angel on these forums, which outlined that he was a TV illusionist and thus, with total control of what we see, everything he does/claims should be taken with a grain of salt.  So basically I had the exact opposite viewpoint that you claimed I had.

I'd be inclined to believe your problem is a more...persistent one.
