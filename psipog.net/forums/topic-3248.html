			I thought it would be interesting to see what layers everyone uses on a daily and emergency basis to their sheild network.  Personally I always try to keep up a solid telepathic tower shield that I can regulate how much information comes in or out.  Over that I have a 1-way mirror shield.  Sometimes between the two I'll put up a marshmellow shield.
<br />

<br />
Most other temporary shields go between the tower and mirror unless it is a hedge or &quot;cloaking&quot; shield and you can probably guess that that goes on the outside.  I also keep one or two &quot;expanders&quot; around in my field which are basically the size of psiballs but are designed to expand to the size of a shield when activated and providing a &quot;sweeping&quot; motion that clears out my field and gives me a few minutes to construct a new shield should any of my critical ones fail.  Quite handy incase of a major failure.  One other cool shield is actually an extension of the tower shield.  I call it an antenna sheild as it basically enhances certian types of energy perception.  I find it to be pretty useful <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Also if you don't have any shields post that anyway and give a reason as to why you don't shield on a regular basis.  I used to not shield, but the reason for me was only laziness and that I thought it didn't do much.  But I found out that a good tower shield is very very quiet, and much more enjoyable to have at all times.  Sensitivity comes with a price I suppose.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
If anyone is unclear of any of the shield names I posted I'd be happy to explain just post to ask, though I think most are in an article somewhere around here.

			wow you have like....98million shields.
<br />
i have a sorta &quot;condom&quot; shield...its the only thing i can think of, like rubber, it streches to fit me <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
erm and i have this weird mind block thing. its like a giant chamber for my mind, so that nothing gets in or out, telepathically that is.
<br />

<br />
and sometimes i put up a PK type shield, which is where i conjure up the feeling of PK, make sure i can do PK on something, then sorta skin-charge with it.
<br />

<br />
in emergencies, i just accelerate my energy flow, but lock it in to build up pressure, and release it outwards in a sort of spiralliing hurricane expanding motion. seems to wipe everything psionically.

			Haha, yeah I remember annie used to have literally an arsenal of shields that she kept up.  I find that I just use the necessary shields to keep out noise so I'm not bombarded with info from everything.
<br />

<br />
What sort of programming do you use on your shield?...like &quot;keep out empathic or telepathic noise?&quot; etc.
<br />

<br />
My tower shield uses something like &quot;stay rock solid like a tower, and filter out telepathic and empathic noise, and ping me with any link connects&quot;.  What this means to me is to keep out everything that is just extra &quot;stuff&quot;, and it asks me via a ping if I want to accept an incomming connection.

			Well since i've started constructing, I've a a cloak shield on the outside that to keep me hidden, and a bubble shield to filter out the emotions, and then an ultra strong mirror shield in case my cloak should fail.

Bubble, marshmellow, force, marshmellow, brick (umm, visualizing a brick wall when creating it), marshmellow, bubble.  Gotta love the marshmellow shield!  I also have a construct that used to help me out on making it but now i have it anchored (thanks for the article on that, oneta!)

			I have a modified mirror shield that has kind of spike constructs that attack the person trying to get past the shield(untested) then a reg mirror shield under the untested one...and I sometimes put up a marshmallow if I'm in large groups of people to stop any comedians...

			The humble, bubble shield when I feel the need. Or I just charge my skin if I'm feeling lazy. I'd have thought more than 2 layers would have made any extra shield about as protective as being wrapped in toilet paper. Why do some of you feel the need for so many?

I like doing something similar where I gather energy from the air around myself  into my solar plexus and then throw it outwards (keeping it in a sphere shape so it goes through my whole body) Nice little energetic exercise.

			Each shield is programmed to do something specific.  Programming a single shield to do everything is very difficult in my experience.  Also adding an order to your shields gives them a &quot;logical priority&quot;.  Such as there is no use to have a cloaking shield on the inside because it would not cloak your other shields.
<br />

<br />
Personally I also use a psionic &quot;brush&quot; that is pretty much just a construct that I use to brush or clean out my energy field.  Not only does it feel really good (somewhat like a real hair brush), but I guess I just like the idea of having a clean and groomed field.  I also find that built up energies tend to work like knots in your muscles.  They build up slow over time and you almost don't notice the difference until they are gone, or until you get a massage.
<br />

<br />
Anyway I hope that explanation helps <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Yes it does thanks  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I do something similar to your brushing technique but on the inside. I find if I've got any sluggish areas where energy isn't moving properly its internal. 
<br />
Are you sensitive enough to feel the knots on your external energy field then? Or are you just assuming things build up over time?

			Bladeslinger, why do you have so many shields? I dont think any other Psion is out to get you. As far as you know, someone could accidently break your shield without them wanting to then your defense shield will attack them. And if your good at making shields, that could cause serious damage, if they are real...
<br />

<br />
The only reason I dont believe in shields is because I honestly dont believe that they help any. I believe in Psionics, but something about shields just doesnt seem likely to me. I can do TK, I have rolled and slid objects. I have never shielded in my whole life and I have done fine. Even when someone was trying to attack me. But if it works for you guys go ahead. Maybe I just need to learn more about it.

			I've developped a new shield for protection against leechers. It's like a force bubble that is sperical and is very simple to make, just command no energy transfer and doesn't require squat on energy to use either.
