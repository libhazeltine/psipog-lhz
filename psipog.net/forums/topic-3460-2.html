Oh I'm sorry I thought maybe I had the right to post my opinion about a topic that arose between Terrancecoleman and another avatar picture... besides (no offence Terrencecoleman) what did Terrence's post about Kiandys avatar have to do with the activity either?

And btw that above does show a PG-13 level of decency?

			I believe that as an obligation to the other members you are reguired to post things that are not of mature content. There are 10 years olds in these forums and I don't think it would be fair less right to show them that kind of stuff. So therefore please change your avatar.

Because this probably won't get locked for awhile until things get worse... That avatar of his is not of mature content what so ever. If it was a male and female hugging no one would have a problem but when something out of the ordinary comes into play then it's always such a big deal. Sure psionics are out of the ordinary and people make fun of us for it but how do you feel when that happens? Same thing as in this situation. He's not changing his avatar because he has done nothing wrong to do so. The picture expresses no        or mature conten at all. Besides homosexual content litters the television that children watch and we're not making a huge deal out of that and I'm sure more children watch TV then view the Psipog forums. Now can we just forget this whole occurance, leave it be, and get back to the topic which some of you seem to have forgotten about... Xious' PK acheivement. Again Xious good job and keep up the awesome work.

			At this point, it is only matter of opinion on what is and what isn't mature content.  My avatar doesn't show any sexually explicit image, nor excessive violence, nor cuss words.....I guess its ok then.  Besides, I guarantee you my avatar isn't going to make someone gay <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Got a problem?  Then talk to a moderator and/or administrator.

Read Rule: BE RESPECTFULL
<br />

<br />
If someone wants an avatar with a man holding another man, and he likes that its ok.
<br />
If some girl is kissing a man in someones avatar no-one is going to say its offensive, so the same can be with two men or two women.
<br />
I think 10year old kids get more garbage through TV than an avatar of two gays.
