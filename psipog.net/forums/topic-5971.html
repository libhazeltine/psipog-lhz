			Hey everyone,
<br />

<br />
I hope your day is going well <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
I'd just like to inform everyone, officially, that I have decided to stop posting on the forums, and visiting them. I have been gone for a month now, if you noticed <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />, as a test to myself to see if I could do it. It turned into more than that. I don't see a need to visit the forums anymore. 
<br />

<br />
In my time here, I enjoyed my interaction with many people. And I learned a lot about myself, and others. Thus leading me to my current state of thought.
<br />

<br />
I'm going down a different path now. A path that involves change. Hopefully everything treats you well.
<br />

<br />
~SheepKing
<br />

<br />
P.S. I suggest you take a look at your life now, too. See what you have been having trouble with, and then fix it. If you do not act, you do not grow. If you don't grow... Your creativity and life die.

i've had a realisation like this. and it realy helped me figure out my current life situation and realy get in touch with myself.
<br />
honestly. if anyone lives near a big hill. just walk up it. sit in a nice secluded spot and just relax.
<br />
 i did that and afterwards i felt completely refreshed and went exploring on the hills. it felt like i was a kid again. totally changed my outlook on life. i finally knew who i was. (sidebar: while messing around with constructs that night. my psi felt cool and pure. as opposed to the warm feeling i used to get before)
<br />

<br />
you're a great dude, sheepking. and i wish you a world of happiness.

			Hello mighty King of the Sheeps <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I find it nice that you made that decision. You're very right. If you deny change, you will one day find yourself dead. I wish you also good Luck for whatever you do.
<br />

<br />
To you and everyone else i wanna just say one thing more: Just do whatever you want, what is fun for you or what makes sense to you.
<br />
And do it right! Everything else leads to a deadend! 
<br />

<br />
So it's time to kick ass and chew bubblegum, right? <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

I'm an evil &lt;DO WHAT YOU WANT CUZ A PIRATE IS FREE&gt; person. I play on the server Eurobattle, but I wouldn't mind setting up a Hamachi LAN game with you at some point. I'm better at DotA than I am at melee/PG/normal WC maps.
