			Snipes, thank you for asking politely.  There are many reasons why i do not wish to do these challenges.  Let me list them out for you:
<br />

<br />
1) The Randi challege has had many respectable people go through it but Randi, whenever actually challenged, starts personally attacking the person (verbally), and makes fun of them.  This is, actually, normal because we are threatening their beliefs.  A lot of people believe that telekinesis, telepathy, etc is all sci-fi.  If you think about it, it does sound like a sci-fi movie.  (we make balls of energy, read minds, move things with our minds, etc.)  He wants to prove to people that psionics is fake and so when he is threatened, he fights.
<br />

<br />
2) If the abilities were revealed in someone, science, the media, the public, and everything would be all over them.  That is not a great idea.  You will be treated differently, the media would give away all your secrets (kind of like celebreties today; &quot;Angelina Jollie and Brad Pitt?!?!?  Will they get married and have a baby?&quot;; &quot;Singer declares that he is gay&quot;.)  No one likes that, let alone WANTS that.  You will be constantly surrounded by people saying, &quot;Hey, pass me the salt telekinetically&quot;.  It might sound good to have all that attention and fame, but it would get old and annoying really fast.  There would also be people who absolutely hate you.  Such as religious fanatics who claim psionics is Satanistic, people who believe psionics is fake and wants to prove it, and just regular hooligans who thinks its funny.  I get, on average, 450 emails per day JUST by psions who want me to teach them how to do things.  If i was to go public, i would have millions daily (some hate emails even now).
<br />

<br />
3) This is perhaps the easiest one to understand.  I dont want people's money.  I would feel as if i was robbing the person.  Yes, $1,000,000 is a lot but i would take it just to show people that i can do something?  Why not give me money to brush my teeth?
<br />

<br />
I hope this helps.

			snipes, I don't think it's that people spit on the million $...
<br />
but think about what happens afterwards?
<br />
You get the million, and then he'll give you another million $ if you show it to his friends, and then you'll be pushed around in the public...

that's not worth 2 mills...

Randi is NOT going to let you win.
<br />

<br />
I know, because I am from Spain, a country where we suffer summer draughts (in the south), so we need wells and we have a long tradition of dowsing for water. We studied in school that the most logical explanation for dowsing &quot;powers&quot; was that the dowser had special sensibility towards the magnetic fields of underwater currents. In my country, water dowsing is considered natural and normal: the magnetic field explanation is not the most common one, but everyone thinks about it the same psipog thinks about psi: don't know what it exactly is, but I know I can use it. In my little slot of land, we have a well. I saw the dowser detect it. 
<br />

<br />
Randi is not only against telekinesis, psichokinesis, telepathy and other stuff... He says that DOWSING does not exists. Honestly, guys, I don't know about people in more humid countries, but in mine, dowsing is accepted as normal and existing. It is even studied at school, and was given an physical explanation (the magnetic stuff). Randi says the well in my house is paranormal. If he wants to, OK, but that makes me think more skeptically of him than of the things he criticises... When he is blatantly claiming the inexistance of something that has been proven during centuries, I can't trust him.
<br />

<br />
Besides, Randi has lost at least two lawsuits against Uri Geller. Geller sued Randi on libel, and has always won, to the point that Randi had to get an economical agreement with Geller, so Randi would shut up and Geller would stop suing him. Because, I remind you, Geller has always won at the courts. That doesn't prove that Geller is a psion, but it does prove that Randi lies to prove his points. I'm all for skepticism, but when you have to lie to defend your point of view, you've lost the north.
<br />

<br />
So, being skeptical is good. I am. But Randi is not skeptical. He is as fanatic in his anti-beliefs as the Inquisition or Bin Laden may be in theirs. He lies to prove his points, he's lost lawsuits for libel, and he says that dowsing is paranormal (honestly! It's damn common in the countryside in Spain! It's as paranormal as cooking!)  So, if you go for Randi's challenge... He's NOT letting you win. That is, in case he has the million dollars, because Peebrain asked them and they just didn't answer. They CLAIM they have a million dollars, in bonds. But we don't know where the bonds are, so they may well have 10 dollars. Which would be another reason for not letting anyone win. If I wanted to enter the challenge, I'd have to pay my expenses from Spain to the USA, hotels and planes and all. And if he lied to the point of libel, why shouldn't he lie to avoid anyone from winning? I'm not trying. If I had powers to win that one, I'd try at a casino.
