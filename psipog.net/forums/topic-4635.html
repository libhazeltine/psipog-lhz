			Is it possible? I saw a thread talking about it, but people didnt say if it was possible or not.
<br />

<br />
So can you actually Lucid Dream and pull someone else that is dreaming into your dream?
<br />

<br />
If so, how?

			I second that question.
<br />
But as far as yours:
<br />
1. Yes
<br />
2. No. As far as I know, you have to go and find the person in question. So basically, you have to be lucid in order to have a shared dream, unless somebody comes to get you. I think that you must also be dreaming at the same time.

			So like if I taught my friend how to LD, and we both achieved the Lucid state while both dreaming I could go get him and pull him into my dream?  But wouldn't I be in control of what he does since it is my dream?
<br />

<br />
Also I have heard about the Lucid Crossroads, this is a place where people go when they are lucid dreaming if they feel like meeting other people right? 
<br />
How would I go there?  Does it look the same to all people?  Like I would need to immagine the same place?

			What's to stop you imagining the person there? you could go an entire LD with your friend. only to discover it was something YOU'd created.
<br />
but i don't see how a lucid dream. something internal (OBEs being external because apparently you leave your body) can affect other people.
<br />

<br />
but, whatever floats your boat <img src="images/smiles/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" border="0" /> .

			Sharing dreams is pretty cool, I've done it on a few occassions, unintentionally <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

Usually they aren't LD's, infact, none of mine where. Everything seemed random, in a sense, like a normal dream, just the other person was there... Really there and experience everything you did, except from their perspective.

			Really, you must be lucky then. Did you verify these with the people though? I'm just asking because you can just create dream characters that look like people you know.

You'd have to take him there with you, there wouldn't be any pulling involved, as far as I know.

The lucid crossroads has more uses then simply meeting people, but that is one of its functions. It should look the same to everybody... You would need to imagine the same place in order to get there. A good way is to find a door and expect the lucid crossroads to be on the other end. It doesn't have to make sense.

Some might argue with that. Quite a few people beleive dreaming is just another version of astral projection, aka OOBEs.
