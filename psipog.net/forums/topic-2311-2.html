			people are so fixed on the eyes and eye candy. They wont beleive it until you can make a large rock explode with lots of &quot;l337 flshin lites an coolers!!!1111shift11&quot; dont let those people get you down. The smart audience knows that if they are seeing an ability this awesome with its limitless potential, will know that it will be very very subtle.

			I've showed 5 friends PK. 2 pretended it didn't happen, and never talked about it since (we are still good friends though) 1 seemed interested, but stopped talking to me after a while (he was not a very close friend anyways), 1 has bad experiences with 'paranormal' stuff and does by no means want to involve herself with anything she considers 'paranormal', and the last one was interested at first, then she stopped mentioning it, then when I talked to her again and told her about telepathy and RV, she became interested again.
<br />

<br />
I don't think she will try it for herself, she doesn't see the point in going through that much practice to be able to do it. She thinks it's exciting though.

			Well, if you become good enough, you could make some money off of it as a side job. Just charge each person watching a dollar for every time you move a pencil. Maybe they'll get addicted to the thrill of seeing you do it and then you'll rake in some big bucks.

			Definitely. Close friends are more likely to try to understand you.. But it's worse losing them if they think you're a wacko for doing psionics.

Also, some people are simply more dragged towards paranormal stuff than others.
