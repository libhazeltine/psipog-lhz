			I wouldnot try to traspost me untill i have tried other stuff first. I would transport stuff like a flash drive, or a hard drive, and then work up to bigger objects, and then, a volenteer (not I, said the Lancefighter)(at least untill i know i can)

			I personally don't think that disassembling oneself is required for teleportation.  There's got to be a simpler way, especially since we're made of 11 dimensional string vibrations.  By vibrating the strings right next to you in the same way as the ones vibrating to create you, the &quot;new you&quot; could be light years away due to the strings' 11 dimensional nature.  Look at a Calabi-Yau shapes and you will see the craziness of 6 dimensional shapes when perceived in 3D.  Notice how planes are folding in on and around each other, so a distance of an inch along a plane of the Calabi-Yau shape may be perceived by us as a few feet, a mile or a micron depending on the size of the shape.
<br />

<br />
Thus, &quot;copy and paste&quot; your vibration along strings that run within you and you can move yourself to wherever you want.

			Teleportation has been done using a single photon. 
<br />

<br />
This is made possible by the properties of two particles that are entagled. If a scientist were to change the properties of a particle, it's entagled cousin (no matter how far away) would instantly undergo the same change.
<br />

<br />
Currently, teleporting a single photon is not terribly hard. However scientist working on the subject claim that the technology required to teleport a larger object may never be developed.
<br />

<br />
I do think that teleportation by some psionic meens is most likely possible <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			In my humble opinion, teleportation is not complicated at all. I am not saying that everyone can do it right now, but how it works, is not complicated at all. I read most of these posts in this thread, and I always see the same things when it is about teleporting your body. People say thinks like: &quot;I think it is impossible to do or very very complicated, because you will have to dissassemble every single atom, and then put it into the correct place again at your new destination.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I really believe this is nonsense. Do you consciously change every particle in the EM-field of an object when you move it? nope. You see, energy itself, is more intelligent that we consciously are. When one wants to teleport, in theory, you would only have to focus and have the intention to teleport. You will only need a clear destination, the proper focus and belief, and then the intelligent energy will do the thing for you.
<br />

<br />
Though I personally believe one must raise his consciousness to a high level before one can feel confident about teleporting. Only then will it be safe and will it be possible. But it is possible.
<br />

			I agree with martial artist.  Because probably the most powerful quality of psi is it is precognitive.  That is to say that it can sense what to do.  Like if you had the TK skill to say push something firmly wedged then you could pick a lock just by telling the energy to do so.  Because it would sense what would work and what wouldn't.  I believe it's possible with the right amount of TK skill.

			Martial artist raises a good point, and a valid one, anyways i reckon that your scientific approaches are abit lateral, asides from that one suggestion around dimensional whatsits.
<br />

<br />
Don't look at it on a molecular level, thats too complicated, think of it as a model of reality. the truth is that one object exists here, and not there, you want it to exist there. Think about whats stopping it from existing there? no not movement, you don't want it to move, you want it to be there. whats stopping it? merely the fact that at this point in the space time continuum it is THERE. And develop the theory from there, you could delve quite heavily into the quantum and what not but seeingas i have to go to the wonderous 6th form centre of marlwood and am barely dressed i think ill stick to covering my own quantums with some form of clothing....

			My take on teleportation (tunneling) is like this. 
<br />

<br />
I agree that trying to dissassemble and reassemble and all that hoo ha is nonsense. 
<br />

<br />
Do you think about all that when you make a psiball? Or move a psiwheel? 
<br />

<br />
My opinion is if you are thinking that much, what you are doing or say you are doing isn't really working. 
<br />

<br />
Scientists have shown that particles have the ability to &quot;tunnel&quot;. I'm not backchecking on the specifics, I'm going to go on memory how it works, but it's simple really what they found. A particle, instead of hitting a lazer sensor in front of a wall while within a particle accelerator, instead vanished right before the sensor and reappeard on the other side of the wall instanteously. 
<br />

<br />
If one particle can do it, then billions and billions can all at once.
<br />

<br />
Is it safe? Is it this and that and the other thing? Will you blow up the universe? If you can really do it, you can do it, and you will do it, and everything will be fine, just like if you can move a pencil or make a psiball. Did reality come crashing apart then? Did you die from directly contravening all known laws of physics? No. So if you can really teleport, then you will and you will be fine, enjoy the ride, because it's probably an instantenous journey and you won't go far. But still weird!

			I believe it is possible.  I once read a book about Uri Geller called The Geller Phenomenon.  It described that Uri was teleported to a friend's house miles and miles away.  He ended up flying through the air and crashed through a window or something.  Another time a husband and wife who were going to visit him were driving and suddenly they were teleported 30 miles closer to him.  I'm pretty sure these incidents were proven to be true.  As for how it works I was thinking that perhaps it has something to do with black holes, passing through another dimension that takes you to any point in space, or possibly just being moved at light speed.  I believe it has something to do with the super string theory.  If everything in the universe is connected why shouldn't it be able to move instantly?

			if this is old topic, sorry for bumping, but i believe this might be very possible, for as there is a power to walk through walls. Combine this with rapid speed (kekeke) and you got &quot;teleportation&quot; which is actually you walking through everything at an intense speed, which seems instant.
