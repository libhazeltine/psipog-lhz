			Second day of tk practice.
<br />
After short session of micro-tk (20 times rolled dice) i have a serious headache.
<br />
Is it normal at start f practice?
<br />
Is it because Ive made psiballs some hours before and I got just tired?
<br />
Is it because I shouldnt practice when I caught a little(rly little) cold
<br />
Is it because Ive just translated a long article and my mind is tired of this? (translating is bit exhausting)
<br />

Please answer those and other questions

			Have you ever got a headache just thinking  and learning in class?
<br />

<br />
That's basicly what you are doing, Using your brain in such a demanding way that it starts to hurt. Just take it easy, if you get a headache, drink some water and take a rest until tomorrow or when the headache is gone.

			Well, I was focused but relaxed, I dont think its enough to cause a headache.
<br />
Im not the one whos going to get results for all cost...
<br />
by the way Ive just tried to have an obe or eventually have some sleep, my cat made a terrible scream and Ive fallen down from bed   <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I dont think Ive ever had such strong headahe from learning in school, and I learned rly hard that year, but it may be true ...
<br />
Well, I hope such headache is something normal for someone who starts training

			I too have had, what I call, the PK Hangover. 
<br />
When I first started I spent over an hour at the Psi wheel, and getting results too, but developed a minor headache. I didn't stop.
<br />

<br />
Stupid of me, really.
<br />

<br />
After the end of the session my minr headache had become a thick throbbing. I went to bed and figured I'd sleep it off. Boy was I wrong.
<br />

<br />
All through the next day my head felt like it was splitting open. I was also unable to do any PK becuase I couldn't focus. Again, stupid of me to try.
<br />

<br />
The moral of the story?
<br />
Don't overdo it. If you feel a headache coming on, STOP!
<br />
It may be due to overexersion, or a rise in blood pressure (brought on my the added brain activity), or even just a random 'my hear hurts' headache. Whatever it is though, if you feel it coming on you need to stop until it's completely gone.
<br />

<br />
And no taking an aspirin is not a good way to keep going.
<br />

i have barely started the basics of psi balls (i can conjure them, thats about it. takes about 2~5 mins to make a dense one) and i can easily make my psi wheel roll. It all depends on how well you believe, and how well your method's work.

Actually I did TK before I even attempted a Psi ball.
<br />
Don't know if that had any effect but I think each person should start where they're comforatble (within reason).

			Well, I dont say psi balls are neccesary for making tk, its just like a gymnastics, a warm up for my mind

Same as with physical training, if I start too hard, I'll reach nothing more then injury.
