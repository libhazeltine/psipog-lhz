			Here are some exercises that I thought of to practice your psi skills. 
<br />

<br />
Key =
<br />
1 - Newbi
<br />
2 - Advanced
<br />
3 - Are you human?
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal">Level 1</span>
<br />

<br />
(These are for people still practicing psiballs and moving toothpicks.)
<br />

<br />
Vibrating a guitar string
<br />

<br />
Set off a mouse trap. (Quite simply, put psipressure on the trigger mechanism.)
<br />

<br />
Moving a cat toy. (One of the wool mouses.)
<br />

<br />
Flicking a lightswitch
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal">Level 2</span>
<br />

<br />
(For those who have completed those above.)
<br />

<br />
Opening a pair of scissors
<br />

<br />
Open to a random page in the dictionary, put your finger on a random spot, then guess the word.
<br />

<br />
Trace a bottlecap on a piece of paper, then practice moving it to the tracing. You could do this with eyes closed, but that's a level 3 type thing.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal">Level 3</span>
<br />

<br />
Open a window or door
<br />

<br />
Type letter on Microsoft word without using hands or keyboard
<br />

<br />
***For bonus points make me lunch lol
<br />

<br />
I'm not even at level 2 yet, I'm still on psiballs and psiwheels. I am more of an intuative psychic then a telekinetic one. (But those lovely gut feelings got me interested.) I haven't seen any &quot;energy&quot; from the psyball, but I can feel it. I've been into this stuff for about a year and a half, but w/e.
<br />

<br />
Compliments and ideas are welcome <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Thanks to Psipog for making a good site!!!!
<br />

EXTRA CREDIT: What's it called when someone goes into a trace and writes random stuff on a piece of paper that means something? And (of course) I wanna try it, any &quot;tuts&quot;? Thanks

Now worship me
<br />
hahaha
<br />

<br />
those are some pretty nifty ideas.  but, what do you do if you don't have a mouse to move.  (I'm on a laptop)  LOL
<br />

<br />
I've tried the light switch before.  I'm not really sure why because the light switches in my room take an act of congress to move (their really old).
<br />

<br />
Dude did you change that so I you wouldn't have to worship me???.
<br />

<br />
By they way ham or turkey, wheat or wry,  mustard or mayonaise,  american or swiss??

You say random stuff comes at the paper that means nothing. Well it does mean alot most of the times. But if you mean where somebody just writes and writes without consciously thinking about what he is writing or what he wants to write. That is called channeling, or channeled writing. It is a pretty nice experience, you actually think at the end of your article: Damn.. how do I know all this stuff?? If you write like this, you are sort of recieving the information form your inner, or higher self. This kind of information is very pure and can be considered as truth. Some articles that I write are written for approximately 80% this way, some 50-50%. And I really learn alot from my own articles. Sounds strange, but While writing, I recieve new insights myself.
<br />

<br />
But if you mean that somebody has to go into deep trance, and then for example he or she askes a question to his subconscious, and then wants an answer through writing, I am not sure how that is called. Subconscious, or unconscious writing perhaps.. Though I have no experience with that myself.
