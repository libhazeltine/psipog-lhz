As for the subject of bringing back the dead, I'd advise against it. Whether there's a God or not, I think everything happens for a reason. A person dies for a greater good, and if you bring them back, you're taking them away from eternal paradise, or the chance to start over with a clean slate, or whatever you believe.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

You're talking about forceful ressurection, I was talking about empowering the &quot;dead&quot;, thus giving them more options/abilities.

This depends on how skilled the OBE practicer is, and how accessable the passed-away-person is.
<br />

<br />
If you are interested in this subject, it may be possible to study a specific esoteric practice of Tibet, having to do with conditioning yourself before sleep -- so that you astrally project and do a certain task as you sleep.

I've only heard about it, and cannot source the info.

Even still, that's kind've crossing a line that even psionics shouldn't play around by.

In cases like these you have to consider every possibility. I don't believe in Hell but when we're referencing the Dead, we have to consider it as an option. As for the fire thing, it could be spiritual fire that tortures the mind or something. Negative energy, basically. But I digress.

<br />
Sure you can, if you know what you're doing. The Astral Plane is usually inhabited by the recently dead, and some theorize it's like a middle road between this life and the next. I'm sure you can find a way to visit them.

Of course, if you are able to do it, and do it, then that is also for the &quot;greater good&quot;, the moment you perform such an act, according to your philosophy.
<br />

<br />
You can heal the body, of course, but then you must realize that it is necessary to return the conciousness back to that body. There have been several hypothesized means of doing this, mostly outside of the context of psionics for most people.

			i'm sorry about your loss josh. it was must be very hard to deal with. i wouldnt mourn her death though. like some have implied, she is progressing to a different kind of existence (if it really is existence. i wouldn't know since i have never died before). 
<br />

<br />
yes you cannot see her physically here and now, but i would keep hope since she is still apart of this world. i do not know exactly how i could explain this, but her 'spirit' (i use this term loosely) has become apart of the 'universe'. &lt;--(i was this term cause lack of a better one; realm, existence, that kind of idea.)
<br />

josh, just breathe in. relax. concentrate but empty your mind. feel the world around you. it's not over yet.

does sound a little fluffy, bringing back the dead, i can see the movie now, DAWN OF THE ANTS........but on a serious note, you would have to be quite advanced i should think, ive never heard of a construct that could bring things back to life.

			Well with Psi isnt anything possible when programmed right? We ourselves only limit its potential, I wont go screwin' with it but I believe it is possible to resurect someone/thing by reempowering their Aura and Psi production locations, like a zoll defribualtor (spelling) to your heart, but thatd have to be a very immeadate thing. Or perhaps before they entireley leave, is there a way to induce Astral Projection in them, then you could power them with your own Chakras i guess, but thatd weaken you to almost nothing. Wow an effective way to be the grim reaper.. XD

			people die and things die because theres something wrong with them, could be cancer, they could have gotten shot. But if you were to somehow make a psi ball to resurrect them, the psi ball would have to be programmed to fix the problem, i.e, kill the cancer, or heal the bullet wound. You would have to program a psi ball to do so many things it would be almost impossible, let alone, you would have to summon enough energy to make such a psi ball, but sure, go ahead and let us know of the outcome....

MY philosophy? What, are you reading my mind? Because no. If a person dies, it's probably their turn to go. Bringing back a person is playing God, and things always go wrong when you do that, regardless of what you believe.

on a side note. i think you cannot truly experience life without experiencing death. we live to die (eventually). it's apart of life. it's nature. a dual nature at that. i think that by the time we have died, most might not want to go back to the physical world. but i wouldnt worry about death or bringing people back from the dead. it seems to me as a sort of injustice to them just so you can feel satisfied with the return of their presence. that to me seems a bit selfish in some aspects.

			I think the whole idea of &quot;giving life&quot; is based off of a misunderstanding of what life is.  It's not something that's ever lost, just changed.  Everything's alive.  And no, this isn't some new-agey BS I decided to spew, it's true enough that I was able to easily deal with the loss of 2 brothers.  Too bad people are so trapped by this illusion and fear of death...
