			My friend and I were trying out some self-hypnosis and well somehow he passed out (or became fully hypnotised) and I well just stoped after a while and started doing a psi ball. But... When I finished it felt like something was pushing on my feet trying to lift me and it felt like I had 2 more knees about 2-3 inches below my knees. Why is this? Anyone got an idea?

Are you 5 years old?  &quot;Ocward&quot;?  Such disrespect toward this forum when you present an awfully fragmented and hard to read question.

<br />
Hypnosis is designed to bring about an altered state of consciousness.  You may pass out during an altered state of consciousness.  If you're going to continue to use self-hypnosis or anything of the sort, I'd suggest you do more research into it.  As for your odd tactile sensations...who knows?  Sometimes when I try to OBE, it feels like someone is hitting my bones with a hammer in certain spots, but without any pain.  You're pushing your nervous system to produce an effect that it normally does not produce (at least not on a large or noticeable scale).  There's bound to be some odd feelings.
