			Since 1964 no one convinced that guy and won the prize. Do you know anybody who tried? If yes, is it THAT difficult? Why is nobody interested? Why are all the tests proven false? Couldn't someone skilled enough win easy $1,000,000? And, wouldn't psychokinesis be the easiest way to impress him? I think moving pencils and levitating paper would do the trick.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
There's something strange. 42 years and no one won the f****** prize (no one have even passed through the preliminary test). I don't want to get into this, but lots of people say we 'psipogers' have mental disorders or something (I'm not judging anyone, i know you are all &quot;normal&quot; people, and have no interest of dealing with bad skepticals). But... one million is too much. I ask again... why is no one interested???
<br />

EDIT: ok I read the replies thanks and sorry. I missed the damn search button ._.

			No one won that prize because the guy is making fun of all those people that enter the contest.Someone should prove (help to finish the study of proving the telekinesis) telekinesis with the help of scientists and then sue the bastard out of him.

			and not only that, the whole damn thing is a hoax...christ..you really think he just has 1 million dollars laying around to give away..and you really think this &quot;James Randi&quot; guy would actually give up the 1 million dollars he supposibly has laying around, when someone proves him wrong????  It's all a bunch of BS, dont waste your time..if you want to prove something, prove it scientfically

			It's rigged.   Somewhere on here is Peebrain's post about it.   But to make a long story short, he can manipulate the rules anyway he wants, you have to give up any legal rights to the research(i.e. if you DO prove it real, they can destroy the evidence and proclaim you a fraud), he asks for a 100% rate of sucess(hell, even COMPUTERS don't get everything right 100% of the time), he either ignores people who sign up for the contest or twists their words around, and the reality of the money is questionable.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Not to mention that if you do prove psionics real, any celebrity you can think of will have NOTHING on you in the papparazzi(sp?) and stalker(/religious nuts) department.

			Yargh, how many more &quot;1 million dollar challenge&quot; posts are we going to have? Maybe we should make a new rule about them or something. Because, unless Randi does a 180 and makes a <span style="font-style: italic">legitimate</span> challenge, this topic just takes up space.
