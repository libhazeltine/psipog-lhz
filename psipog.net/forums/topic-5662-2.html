			To be honest the only good part about it is the psionic aspect...we've seen every other part of that story 1000 times over again...way to much coincedence and holes in it....there just happens to be a monk picking flowers after a small boy somehow escapes 2 expert ninjas...be serious..and if the ninjas sensed him behind the tree the 1st time how could they not sense him in a log...and thats assuming a child outran and escaped 2 people specifically trained in hunting/killing people. And again there just happens to be another old man sitting on a stump when oomusha, whatever, runs away(as we've another 1000 times before-the self tortured hero with a bad past)...ok and then the 1-man-revenge-mission thing..that's original..and when he's at his best and completed his 1st mission he runs into his parents &quot;killers&quot;, how convienent....and he then travels with a couple companions kicking ass......The entire thing isn't one bit original...you simply substituted learning actual ninja skills with learning psionic ones.....<span style="font-weight: bold">Psionic abilities=good...everything else you got needs to be redone sorry</span>

I'm sorry for bringing this thread back to the top. I just want to keep it on the front page so I can post some scanned manga drawings for some people who would like to see them. I'll keep posting to keep it up until I get the time to scan a picture or two (I'll probably scan tomorrow).

			When I make a story I like to use latin words. I often find the words of this ancient languae perfect for the magical feel in them. But thats not my point. What I saw over and over is that people were saying psi were orngial in the ninja arts. But I heard rumoners of ninjas praticeing Clairvoyance in finding there targets in real life. I do think its wonderful that he is putting it in still. I however agree with derricktheone, none of the rest was orngail at all...
<br />

<br />
The main problem I saw is that it all been pretty much done before. Like derricktheone and other people said. But its still good for you to try don't give up! I think we all can help you  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

 <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />/ <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />! Damn, that was funny and sad at the same time! (hence the emoticons.) I just didn't think it would actually ALMOST translate into something. Especially something so disgraceful to such an awesome and dynamic character (of course, I barely mentioned anything about his personality and the quirks that go with it). But as for help, I will gladly accept some from you. I don't want to create other names that translate to something ridiculous like crouching barnacle or running tree.
<br />

<br />
TO TANK DOWN: 
<br />

<br />
Yes, you and derricktheone (but he didn't put it as politely as you did <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />) are right about the story line. It is unoriginal, but recently I've come up with more ideas and twists that should at least compensate or make it APPEAR unoriginal at first but original later. Then again I don't know much about what is original because I'm not to knowledgable about all the stereotypical story lines out there. This is why I'll probably have to rely on people like Lawrence_of_Arabia to help me with fixing the big holes in the story line.
<br />

<br />
TO ANYONE INTERESTED:
<br />

<br />
Today (fri. Sept. 8 ) I should have one amateur and low quality (<img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />) picture on here within the next half hour or so (check time on my post). If it is'n on there within about a half hour of my post time expect one on Monday or never (that would mean the scanner didn't work or something)!

			Sorry everyone. I failed with flying colors. My brother doesn't know (he's a lot more advanced than me when it comes to computers.) how to get a scanned picture on the internet. Can anyone tell us how? BTW, the picture isn't great anyway so by the time I get it on here (providing someone helps us) which would most likely be on Monday (since privacy is a big issue with us going on here) I may have a better picture drawn for display. This thread is quickly becoming the &quot;help me make my manga&quot; thread.

			Sorry to be so harsh but you did say to not let your feelings get in the way, and I believe to &quot;let er rip&quot;  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ...but it's good to have ambitions and getting critisized on your way is only going to make your story better....My advice is try to make it as realistic as possible...I believe this is what people are looking for nowadays..none (or very little) of those coincedences and a lot of originality ofcourse...Mabye he discovers his powers on his own when something traumatic happens to him (an OBE when seeing his dead parents?..something powerful involving PK or Pyro/Cryo?..him instantly freezing running water after being traumatized would be cool...or something along those lines?..)..really take time and think about what hasn't been done(I know that will be hard but think about what may happen if you really DO come up with something real cool AND original)...Although I thought your 1st one was crap I think you can still do a great job trying again..as long as you don't quit...A lot of great stories have been revised dozens..mabye even hundreds of times  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  ....You want more ideas let me know...I have quite an imagination  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

			Is the scanner working? (&quot;yes&quot; see one, &quot;no&quot; see two)
<br />

<br />
1) ok then scan it make sure it is a JPG!!!!  Easiest way to get it up on the internet. Is it a JPG? (&quot;yes&quot; see three, &quot;no&quot; see four)
<br />

<br />
2) your screwed...
<br />

<br />
3) Go to <a href="http://www.photobucket.com" target="_blank">http://www.photobucket.com</a> , make account, upload, yadda yadda, link it to here
<br />

<br />
4) there are a few ways to do this.  Easiest way: 'Save as' it and name it and put &quot;.jpg&quot; after it.  It'll prolly say &quot;are you sure you want it to be a JPG?&quot; say yes and see # three.

I'll talk for him. Okay, good advice, I will see if I can make it into JPG. I hope I can reach photobucket.com while at school, because that is where the scanner is. Oh wait, I could just put it on a Floppy or Flashdrive whatever. Thank you, and I will tell him your idea derricktheone, I like it.
