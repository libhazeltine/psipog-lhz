			well when I watched his show I only found 1 thing to be fake the teleportation because as soon as he teleports the other guy he covers the camera such BS!!!.. but yea your probably right,, I find it 50%real 50% fake.. the real part would be him moving objects around with psi..  
<br />
here i found 1 site of him he has many sites i found one on levitation but i forgot that one

			I saw it too. Sorry to say, but it's fake. You can tell he's on wires, because he lifts his hands up before going in the air, signaling to the guy working the device to pull him up, and then motions downward to be put back on the ground.

<br />
I may seem like a huge skeptic, but I was really into magic(cards and bunnies magic, not witches and spells magic) before getting into psi, so I'm not one of those perpetual skeptics. Most of the magic from that show comes from the cinematography. There are a lot of cuts to different angles instead of a continuous feed, and the camera will move almost all of the way around Criss, except a little bit, and you can bet that's where the trick is happening. To see through any of the things he does, you just need to keep an eye out for small details, and think outside the box.

i'm not going to say if i believe it or not, cause i havent seen the show in question, but the hand movement could also be a dramatic movement for the viewers or he might require it for visualization purposes. so just a hand movement wouldnt be enough to condenm it. though i personally believe 90% of people who are payed to show off psychic abilities are fake, or start real, and exagerate into fakeness.

interesting side note, does anyone else think it's wierd that most people don't believe in psionics, but when they see David Copperfield or Siegfreid(sp?) and Roy, they flip out? maybe more people would believe if we got a few white tigers and some really bad tans? XP

			It is the difference of having a &quot;logical&quot; fallback point. Magicians can amaze us yes but if people start to get distrubed by it they can always rationalize it as a trick (and granted it almost always is). Psionics has no &quot;logical&quot; fallback point. It works, we don't know why.

yah, probrably, with todays technology, it really would not be hard to just edit over the film to produce whatever effect they want. so i really would not use any tv show as proof for anything.

			About the David Blaine levitating or whatever : <a href="http://www.free-card-tricks.net/blainelev1.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.free-card-tricks.net/blainelev1.html</a> Plus on the TV shows they cut out the countless number of times where he screws the trick up. Both David Blaine and Chris Angel are complete fakes. Their tricks are all slight of hand and illusions with some accomplices and good camera men/editors.

and yah, i remmember one trick that a guy said he could make an island dissapear, he put a large curtan up then a machine rotates the platform they are standing on slowly untill they are facing an entirely different direction and the island is out of view (they restricted vision so the audience didnt see the island as they rotated.)

			Honestly I don't know if it's possible..
<br />
I DO know that as long as you keep telling yourself that it's impossible you'll never ever do it.
<br />
It's what's written almost everywhere on this site: As long as you don't really believe in it yourself, you'll never do it.
<br />

<br />
Since I can only make psiballs for now I'm far from trying levitation..
<br />
But I believe it should be possible for some..

			I can not levitate, but I believe it is possible, and not just through TK/PK. Monks in tibet have levitated for thousands of years (even buddha), and european monks and nuns have as well. I am willing to bet that with 1 year's practice, I could levitate, and with just a few more, I could master it. You could too.

			Ok,  If you're going to just argue about stupid stuff like whether or not it's possible to levitate; just think about this.  YOU CAN MAKE A BALL OUT OF YOUR BODIES NATURAL ENERGY!!!!  
<br />
On a simple, realistic note....you can make a psi ball that is magnetic, right?  well then, sence everything has some kind of magnetic force (and I mean everything),  why not just make a sheild that has the same magnetic pulse as the ground your standing.  That would be a positive against positive force, and everybody (hopefully) knows that it is impossible to force two like magnets together.    
<br />
I'm sorry if anyone has already said this.  I got tired of the retarded arguments about validity.

			Someone did, shields are ineffective because they have less of an availible pool of energy than you do, it'd be like saying it would be easier to lift a two ton object with one arm instead of both. Also, gravity is not a magnetic force in the sense of those metallic things that stick to your freezer, its a molecular force of attraction. We don't even know how to cancel out gravity artificially, good luck trying to figure out how to do that then how to do it with psionics.
<br />

<br />
Theres a difference between not believing and being unrealistic, like it or not psionics takes time to develop. Thinking you can do seriously advanced stuff within a short amount of time is usually stupid and shows how little thought you have put into things. There are shortcuts yes, but even with that most advanced stuff are to be obtained on a time table measured in years, not months or days, and even with that most of the so-called shortcuts I've seen are dangerous and need to be in the hands of a somewhat patient person anyways so you're still going to *gasp* have to take some time to do things.

			I'm saying that gravity is magnetic.  I'm saying that the force of the magnetic repulsion is strong enough to overcome gravity.   
<br />
Sence a shield is to weak, then why not try to create a concentrated disc of psi.  With it being in contact with your body,  wouldn't you be able to maintain a good hold on the amount of psi you put into it?  And to keep yourself from running out of psi, you could use peebrain's idea for channeling psi from somewhere else.

			Most agree that that idea is a visualization technique to trigger a creation of psi in your own body. Energy use and consumption is one of the hardest things for newbies to comprehend, to keep the argument short you have to be developed to a certain level to even have a hope of being able to fork enough energy to do the bigger stuff.
