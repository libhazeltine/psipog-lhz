			I dont think i have been to the astral plane, i have definatly been to the Etheric plane, imo if my astral body walks on it then its an astral plane, well whatever plane i went to, it was very much simular to the physical world except for a few odd thing here and there, like objects being there when the wernt in the physical world, but i think this is just fragments of your concious mind coming out. &lt;excuse my rambling on im hyper <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

Ill find the link now.... right there <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			oh ok interesting. i was a little hesitant lookin on the net since it could be complete mumbo jumbo and i dont trust the internet all the time w/ subjects like this. 
<br />

<br />
since you said you visited this plane, ill take your word for it. it makes me kind of curious at the same time. i've never ventured into another plane nor do i even know how to get there. im gonna look on the regular site for info, but in the meantime i wanna hear your experiences about it and how you get there.

			I just ignore other sites and decided for myself what works and what dont.
<br />

<br />
Ok, well the very first OBE i had (self induced one anyway) i thought to myself i WILL come out tonight then as i lay down i thought about how cool it would be to be flying around out of my body, and how i would do it. the next thing you know i felt the vibrations, i imeadeatly began to clear my mind of all thoughts my heart was racing the sounds were coming into my head, i thought of one thing, exiting my body. I lifted my arm out of my body then my legs, (i had a play around with this and started to kick my legs in a bicycle motion) then i pushed the vibrations up to my chest and into my head. Then i thought this is it... 
<br />

<br />
I sat up and felt a sharp sting on the back of my neck it wasnt painful or anything. the world looked exactly the same, i thought to my &quot;self damn i didnt do it&quot; then i looked behind my and there i was lying in bed i thought YESSSSS!!!! i did it, i got out of bed and thought of something i could do, i decided to have a feel around, the walls felt like jelly when i tryed to pass my hand through them, the windows were like air.  I looked outside the world was exactly the same as the physical world so i thought this must be the astral plane. 
<br />

<br />
Then i saw something really weird, my door handle was on the wrong way, my picture looked tilted, there was a square shaped object on my TV. I didnt waste any time thinking about what they were i wanted to fly!! so i thought hmmm itd be cool if i just jumped out of my window....bad idea i took a running jump and dived out of my window....i fell to the floor i returned to my body just before i hit the floor. I spent three hours awake that night.

			To become rhetorical, what <span style="font-weight: bold">doesn't</span> the astral plane look like?
<br />

<br />

<br />
It is a place that you see without eyes, hear without ears, and feel without your mortal body. It looks like you want it to, or like someone else wants it to. Or it looks like it is.

			MikeV, you should really read Journey's Out Of The Body by Monroe, if you haven't already. He gives quite a few ways to control your &quot;second body&quot;.
<br />
But that sounds awsome, farther then I've gotten after 7 months...

I had OBE's before then, its just they werent controlled, when i was about 5 i used to randomly come out of body when going to sleep, i used to think i was dead/dying i used to wake screaming, my parents and the doctors thought i was nuts... then i learned about OBE's so i guess i have gotten used to coming out of body, i didnt want to waste any time, i just wanted to fly!!!
