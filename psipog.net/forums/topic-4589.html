			(Sorry if there's an article like this in psipog I haven't been on the site in a while.)
<br />

<br />
A few months ago my boyfriend complained about pain in a specific area of his body (I think his hand). Although I had never tried to heal before I decided to help him feel better. So I drew energy from the earth and began to pass that energy through my hands and to the area. I concentrated on the energy using repetitive thoughts that the energy would be healing/positive and that the area would be healthy. It worked and since then I have helped him, used this process on myself, and my mother (a fellow psion and the only one I know of besides my boyfriend). It works for various applications like making bruises or cuts heal faster using the same basic technique. 
<br />

<br />
Here's an outline of the basic pattern I use:
<br />

<br />
1. Find energy source yourself, a tree, etc.
<br />

<br />
2. Channel the energy to your hand if the area can be directly touched by it. If you can't hover your hand over the area then just focus the energy to the afflicted area. I find it easier to use my hand but technically it makes no difference.
<br />

<br />
3. Program the energy like a construct to heal or perform whatever biological task. The difference is that I make the energy flow like a river slowly into the source and keep track of it. 
<br />

<br />
I hope this information helps people.

			you must be very careful when you are healing!  if you do things wrong then you can do damage very easy.
<br />

<br />
One thing that is important to remember is that people work best with their own energy.  So it is very useful to try to find out what frequency is your patient's energy and then make whatever energy you put in them the same frequency.  It is a little complicated to do and I would be very happy to explain if you want it.

			ummmm...I know this isn't my thread but I wouldn't mind an explanation. one of the things I've got a kick out of most was healing myself. I would love to be able to heal other people and I would love to know the best way to do this (without going to med school lol)

			TY.  This should help with my Osgoode Schlatter (I think with spelling).  Basically my knees will hurt every once and a while for the rest of my life, all 60-70 years of it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			Yeah, healing is awesome.  When I was doing aerobics my legs would hurt, and sometimes they would hurt like hell! <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I would heal my legs and they would either almost instantly be healed or they would be slightly sore, but they would be completely healed after a nap.

			Heh I've been doing this since my first week of training (btw: I was a psion for 6 months before I joined Psipog), I didnt think anyone else did the excact same thing though. The whole wavelength thing may explain why my healing works better on some more than others, thanks for the unintentional FAQ answer on that.
