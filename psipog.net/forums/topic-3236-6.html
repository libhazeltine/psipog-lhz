Yes that's  right, now you go to your television set that was on teletubbies and be a good boy now. lol. 
<br />

<br />
anyway people who think he can really levitate are blind. Honestly, what about that episode where he was in a filled barrel of water and he had to untie himself before it fell on the ground. If he could fly then why was he scared?
<br />

<br />
Some people are very naive and easily fooled.

			Did you guys see Angel walking on water????
<br />
OMG how he doing that????
<br />
That clip is realy awesome.
<br />
What i think is that he can levitate, that he knows the tric but he cover it under the word illusionist.
<br />
He shows some tricks how to made it done, to give the people the belive that all what he do is being a artist.
<br />
And he makes hes money also with it.
<br />
Its just a smart and wise guy..... <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			He is a magician...an illusionist - nothing more, nothing less. I thought some of David Blaine's tricks were impossible until I found some &quot;how to's&quot; on the net, and then I was banging my head thinking 'of course!' how clever. In fact, Criss Angels 'passing though glass' is the same as Blaine's trick where he reaches through a shop window and picks a watch from the display. 
<br />

<br />
That's all it is...being clever, and deceptive.

			I dont know how he did that walking on water trick, it looks cool.
<br />
But still he is NOT USING PK. There is some kind of glass plate where he walks on, or he is hold up by cables.
<br />
I dont know how he does it, but thats his job, creating ILLUSIONS.

			Yeah. Walking on water is pretty lame. Oooo! He's walking on water! There can't POSSIBLY be anything that he, an illusionist, would use to accomplish that amazing feat.
<br />

<br />
Seriously, a few of you need to open your eyes. Criss Angel is no psion. As for the whole ''He told people what he was doing is real in the second season'' thing, that's for people like you to believe so he gets credit. People that believe that stuff are some of the most gulible people in the world.
<br />

<br />
As for the reaching through glass trick, I wanna learn it. lol

<br />
it is getting really annoying
<br />
i used to believe in chriss angel as doing everything for real and that is what led me to search on the internet and find this site but serriously...how long would it take to learn to levitate with psionics and how old is he?...it is impossible to walk down a wall...the people that a &quot;spectators&quot; are really bad actors...he sells his crap on the internet...he says it is illusions and stunts...if he was a real psion he would be teaching everyone how to do that stuff...and if he was psycic he would go to one of those scientists places that will pay you one million dollars if you can show them real proof checked if you are bugged or w/e and wearing cloths they supply...SO SHUT UP ALREADY

			Ok everybody, I think we need to just relax... Cleansing breaths, picture your third eye, everyone in the lotus position. Ok. Better?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> I'm really not sure what compelled me to give my equally &quot;important&quot; view on all this, but here goes: I enjoy what Criss Angel does, I even watch his show on a weekly basis. He's very good at whatever it is he is doing. Is real or is it an illusion. Frankly, I neither know nor care. It's for ENTERTAINMENT purposes. Criss Angel is not trying to do anything other than entertain and make a living. He's not some horrible person who's faking being some world class psion, and he's not a deity searching for disciples. I think the best way to describe him is a quote from one of his earlier shows &quot;it is what it is&quot;. That can mean alot of things. That gives his performances an aura of mystique and doesn't lump him into the mundane &quot;magician-in-cheesy-vegas-nightclub&quot; category. Maybe everything he does is an elaborate illusion, maybe he's Yoda's very attractive descendent gifted with other-worldly power, maybe he's in the gray area, I don't think it matters, really. Please, just enjoy his show, don't kill each other over it. It's fun, it has a couple of &quot;holy crap!&quot; moments, it's TELEVISION. There's no mandatory thinking, just entertainment. And I'll close by saying, I'm not a part of this argument(meaning I DON'T have a &quot;side&quot;), I'm just here to ask everyone to calm down a second. Keep going like you are and a mods gonna get fed up and lock what could be a potentially fun thread. Let's take this topic in a less violent direction, ok everyone?

			I don't see why people think he is so amazing. He isn't even that good. Most of his tricks are either revamps of other magician's illusions, or else really hyped up parlour tricks. I have yet to see ONE of the major illusions Criss Angel did that was his own invention.

			yeah, im pretty sure that other japanese magician was on this site somewhere before, that guy had a lot of stuff I've never seen before, I use to do a lot of magic tricks myself, I know a lot of David Blaine's tricks too. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

I have to admit though, that walking on water is really spectacular

			how about sawing himself in half without being in a box, the saws came down, and cut him in half, blood spurted everywhere, and he managed to not be dead afterward, yes I terribly want to know how he did that, I do not think it was real, which proves you can want to know how something is done, without jumping to retarded conclusions.
