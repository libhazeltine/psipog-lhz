			Hey recently I've been practising telekinesis, for about two weeks. I've only been practising briefly. But lately I've been having some werid things happen.
<br />

<br />
2 days ago, I took used the washroom and took a shower. Whilest in the shower I was just thinking of an article that I read, claiming that some people created a ghost and the ghost levitated tables and such if the people asked him to. So as I was thinking of that the fan turned on. It's located inside the bathroom and I always lock the door when I use it. 
<br />

<br />
So I'm thinking 'that's strange, maybe it's a form of telekinesis?'. So when I get out of the shower I was thinking 'maybe something else happened that I didn't see'. And I came out to find that the bathroom faucet is on. I remembered that I washed my hands after I was done (It seems pretty useless when you're taking a shower right away huh?), and I could have sworn that I turned off the faucet. 
<br />

<br />
I'm new to this site and TK/PK. 
<br />

<br />
Here's the thing though. Since I have a lot of things to do, like move into a new apartment and get a new job, I've barely had a straight practise schedule with Telekinesis.  So since I want to develope this skill, I practise trying to move things with my mind. They don't move at all though. Which I'm not surprised  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> . 
<br />

<br />
I'm just wondering if my &quot;practise schedule&quot; actually did manage to turn on the fan and faucet.
<br />

<br />
And another question, how long did it take for you to develop your telekinetic abilities? I'm pretty sure it varies for people though.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: I forgot to tell you guys how I practise. Basically I did the card trick. The one where you have 1 card in mind and try to pick it last. You can find it on this site.  I only did that twice for 15 mins. Once again I'm just guessing that this isn't nearly amount of practise that I should be doing.
<br />

<br />
I also practised today for 20 mins. And as I was putting the cards away, I started to get a soft headache. I've heard of people getting headaches from not doing TK practise a lot.........

			Most people create psiballs before they can actually do tk. I was able to move the psiwheel the first day albeit wobbly but a week for a surefire psiball, had a few that thought were psiballs and even now thinking back i'm still not sure. Some people try for weeks before they get even a movement so yea there's a large variance there.
<br />

<br />
as to the other stuff, it could have been you could've been something else, I just can't tell for sure. With me it's power outages lol

			Also keep in mind, if you have been practice pk recently this could just be random PK.  Not necessarily a ghost? you created.  I've never really heard of creating a ghost, as most dictionarys(sp?) define a ghost as a former living being.

			Today was my first day trying it and I made a little psiwheel move a little bit <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> I still can't do psiballs and have a headache so I'm taking a break.

This is actually micro-PK which involves random generators, dice, cards or anything that leaves things to &quot;chance.&quot;  If you want to have more skill in macro-PK, or psychokinesis involving the movement of objects you should practice that.

			I think the term you're thinking of is &quot;poltergeisting&quot; or simply &quot;geisting&quot;. It's when your powers just sort of go off without you intending them to.

I'm going to have to agree with you there. When my schedule gets less hectic, I'll start upping the intensity of my psychokinesis training. I'll get the clear cup, since I''m so self concious of wind/breath blowing it.
<br />

<br />
Poltergeisting, is what is most likely happening.
