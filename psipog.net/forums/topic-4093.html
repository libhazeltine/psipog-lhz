well, i like nintendo because they're revolutionising the way we play games, not to mention the GB micro is the Greatest portable handheld around, offering TRUE pocket sized gaming. it's great, In my opinion, but not everyone here's a 'tendo fan <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Soz about the typo, I'll fix it after this post.
<br />
I never said that everybody here likes Nintendo, what I mean is that there is a surprisingly high amount of Nintendo fans into Psionics compared to anything else. Theories anybody?

			The only theory that I can offer...
<br />

<br />
You are basing the thought of &quot;Many Psychics&quot; being nintendo fans on the premise that everyone online who hangs around here is actually psychic <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
The premise, I think, is incorrect. If you look at it this way... There are lots of people who do not go online for Psychic information. And even those who do look for psychic information, may not be psychic so to speak. 
<br />

<br />
If you're wondering why so many people around HERE or online like nintendo, then I may be able to answer that. Many people are very Young around here, lots of young people play video games. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

The wii looks pretty awesome.  I love how it's going to be backwards compatible with every nintendo game made.  I'll get to relive my younger days playing SMB3 and contra.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

I donno.. maybe it has a relation to the fact that psionics are unique(in the way that most people don't do it), as is the wiimote XD. We love exploring right?

			I see the most logical solution being that Nintendo use the theme &quot;Psychic Powers&quot; a lot in their games. Such examples are Earthbound, Pokemon and even brief mentions in Metroid. (Eg: It's said that some beings use astral projection to find new homeworlds.)

			I think it might have the fact that Nintendo's fans look at things from a different perspective than sony and mircosoft fans. Who cars about graphics? I want it to be more real in this way, rather than more compressed polygons. Physical ways of playing games are the way forward. That's why simulators are really cool. I think that makes sense.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> 
<br />
So, taking from that, the psions that looked up this stuff in the first place are the different ones who looked for alternate stuff, rebels I suppose you could call them. Sony and Microsoft are the galactic empire. lol 
<br />

<br />
But of course there are the few acceptions, actually lots of them. I mean if you make the name of a topic &quot;Nintendo fans&quot; then mostly nintendo fans are gonna reply to it, but the console wr one we had a while ago had replys and voted on the polls from all types of fans. So it's most probably an illusion.

			I like nintendo. They have given me many hours of enjoyment. But the reason there are so many nintendo fans are because of the age bracket we have here. Many of our users are 16 and under so they were growing up when nintendo 64 was like the only system out. So they grew up with it so it shall be forever. The reason nintendo fans dont speak out in their forums is because all the ps3 and 360 fans would flame them.

I am! Definetely. It's gonna be so invovative and alternative to the normal little crappy controller that you keep stationary in your sweaty hands.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
