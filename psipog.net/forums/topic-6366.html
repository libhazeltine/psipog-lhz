			ok this is for those of us who dont like to sleep but h8 the effects of sleep deprivation.
<br />

<br />
what you do, find a nice comfy spot somewhere,lie there close your eyes and relax, think in your mind,
<br />

<br />
I am sleeping but still retaining conciousness, i will fall into a sleep like state a refresh my mind with every second i meditate as if i were asleep and feel rejuvinated when i revive from this state.
<br />

<br />
now im going to count back from 20 very slowly, after each number counted you will breath in deeply and slowly, but not to allow yourself to hear yourself breathing but on every other breath, and when i reach one you shall awaken and feel refreshed, rejuvinated and re-energized, now begin the counting.
<br />

<br />
20......19..........18...............17....................
<br />
16........................15...................14........................
<br />
13..........................12......................11....................
<br />
10..........................9...........................8.......................
<br />
7...........................6.......................5.........................
<br />
4.............................3.....................2..................................1
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
so how do you like it? i just tried it for 5 minutes and i feel better, and im bad at meditation lol imagine what you could do if you managed it for a good half hour.
<br />

<br />
i designed it so that you would be focused on the numbers to enable yourself to become tired,kinda like counting sheep, but you had to also focus on your breathing therefore keeping you concious and still functional.
<br />

<br />
any comments?

			no but for those of us who pull all nighters this REALLY helps, i do it in school now. but if you as high a metabolism as mine(which i doubt not many do) you better eat more than 2 slices of buttered toast or you will pay for it...god it hurt! but thats not the point its for when you like have to stay awake like for school or if somehow were time warped back into veitnam  or something where the circumstances require your conciouisness, and so this will definately help you if you try it. you feel un-tired and almost completely refreshed. try it the next time you pull a all nighter from doin hw during some class (just set your head down or something when theyre busy) and youll thank me. 
<br />

<br />
but then theres its application in people who are like me and just love the computer to the point of carapal tunnel(probably didnt spell right) and will stay up days doing a bunch of things, only me i think i have ADD because i cant play the same game for more than a hour, or really anything else, unlike my friends who supposedly back to the meditation if you find yoursellf for any reason up all night and you HAVE to stay up for any reason, thanksgiving, christmas, school, w/e just try this, and atleast it will help temporarily

That's funny you say that. I bet I do. Are you referring to the cramps you get in the middle of the night because your stomach is so empty? Yes I sure do get them. I had to go to the doctor's when I was younger because we didn't know what the problem was, because the cramps were so bad (Anyone with the same problem knows what I mean). The doctor didn't even know at first. I work out and am in pretty good shape and it turned out I had about 4%-5% body fat and the doc thought I was malnurished at home lol. Although it's somewhat true it's just that I didn't eat enough, even though I already ate more than everyone. Isn't it fun getting to eat so much now though  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .

P.S All nighters are fine for doing work and assignments and stuff, but don't bother pulling all-nighters to study. You'll barely remember a thing. 7-8 pm is the optimal time for studying/memory. We recently learned about it in psyc. class  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			lol actually i get stomach cramps from eating nothing over several hours and because of other things. i have a really high metabolism 7% body fat, 125 lbs and 5'9 or s, so yea im in pretty good shape, and if i dont eat something every 4 or 5 or so hours my stomach will begin to cramp and i become in pain, also that one day it was extreme pain, like buncha knives in you pain, but anyway yea im different, c its 7-8 if u sleep at the most at 11 pm, i get to sleep around midnight 1 o clock usually afterwards kinda depends. but anyway today i decided to eat, a slice of pizza, two cans of coke, and half a box of apple jacks, and i was almost neasous so no pains today <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> so apparently lesson in life, if ur going to take an insomniacs life, EAT, becuase sleep deprivation really takes alot outta ya
