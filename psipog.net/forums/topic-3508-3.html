The psiball that I believe &quot;bent&quot; light looked like you were looking through something hot that warps light sort of like that, but it was not that hot.

<br />
All of you are trying to tell me that it is the hardest thing in the world to move light because it is so fast and small and shit.  But the facts are that those are true, but that I don't see how it pertains to our subject of it being affected by psionics.  The truth is that I have had experience making visible constructs and so have others that have written articles on it, and a few people I used to practice with.
<br />

<br />
Please link your arguments to psionic experience somehow rather than saying something is &quot;really fast&quot; so that it must mean that its really hard to move or something.

<br />
Actually, that's kind of out of the question. Invisible constructs are standard. It's just what you program them to do, and since flaring them is programming, then it kind of shows that  the construct can only do that because we are visible. 
<br />
Furthermore, constructs can go through walls, now, this is just word, but people have claimed to be able to phase, so maybe because the construct can, we can also. However, I am positive that we cannot bend light, unless we become semi-invisible and then somehow bend it then...I dunno. If it is true that constructs can only do what we are capable of, then we can do a ton of shit!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
The thing about this is that psi balls can go through walls when you can't phase, but they can't use tp without you needing to use it. But I guess that phasing thing comes from the fact that psi balls are supposedly of another dimension...

You have made one? I would like to see proof of what light looks like when you bend it. Make a video. Theoretically, you shouldn't have seen it since it bent the light; the light may not have reached your eyes.

			As I have posted many times yes, and that is what the construct looked like.  I have also received one of the &quot;distorted&quot; looking constructs from a person I used to practice with in a mIRC chat room.
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately I don't have a video camera, and I'm not going to buy one just to &quot;prove&quot; to you something you don't want to admit.  Videos are not proof, proof is in you doing it yourself.

If all light is bent in a spherical shape you end up seeing other reflected light rather than light that passes straight through it.

You did not read correctly sorry.  I did not say that because your constructs have a certian property that the same property can be transferred to your physical body.  (I.E. made from particles that reflect light rather than allow it to pass through)  The properties are not due to your programming...sorry.
<br />

<br />
My original post was &quot;You can't make a construct to do something that you wouldn't be able to do without it. It just makes it much easier to maintain something so that you don't have to concentrate on it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
In other words:  if you are unable to perform PK or a skill psionically, you cannot PROGRAM a construct to perform the same task that you are unable to do.  In your example of the invisibility you did not program your construct to make anything inside of it invisible (else you could in theory make yourself invisible)  you just programmed it to do something that it already can do.  So how about this, try programming yourself with the ability to look like a person, I think you may succeed.  That would be a parallel experiment.

			Good job, you convinced me that something I did wasn't real.  And no I haven't ever made a black hole or any retarded fluffy shit like that.  But next time you make an argument please base it on experience and logic.  Without those two there is not much to talk about here.  I base my arguments on both, you based yours on none.

			Theres no reason to take critism so personally.  What do you care what I think about you?  All I ask is that you be intelligent and formulate responses based on logic rather than just proving me or anyone else wrong.  I have no fear of the truth, if you can present to me a well formulated argument I will gladly listen, and possibly even change my position, but I will not listen to suggestions that don't make sense to me if they are not based on logic or pure facts or scientific research.
<br />

<br />
Life is about learning, and I continuously learn everyday.  Whether on the subject of psionics, my degree, my businesses or investing I continuously learn something new and it reforms who I am today.  If you close yourself off to reason theres is no point in reasoning with you, likewise if you listen to anyone or everyone and don't run what they say through a logic filter again there is no point in discussion.
<br />

<br />
I appologize if I come across strongly, and there is much I don't know about so I usually don't comment in those cases.  But the ones I do and where I smell bullshit I most certianly point it out.

Actually, if you are good enough and make a strong enough construct, then you can do that. All it would need is to effect physical matter enough to be able to much on an apple, although it can't digest it since it's way too complicated to program, let alone visualize.

I agree with that. It's not fair to say that when clearly his spelling is fine accept for that particular word. I'm sure that you, droshi, can't spell some words, as I cannot either. Also, keep in mind that some people on these forums are foriegn.
<br />
Frostbitten, why not tone down on the insults here, and double posting can be ok, but triple posting is just plain dumb when there's an edit button right above the post to use. 
<br />

<br />
Droshi, I don't mind if you can't get a video camera, I don't have one myself, only my phone. Perhaps, though, you could make an image on photoshop or another program of what it looked like while saying underneath the image that it is fake, just so people know. I'm interested to see what light looks likke when it's bent. Note also that when I made a previous post, I mentioned that what I said may not apply to what we can do psionically. You can't bend light scientifically to my opinion, (I invite someone to prove me wrong) but psionically must be quite easy to think about it. Constructs can do alot of stuff. So visualizing light bend would be rather easy I suppose.

Well, I don't think a magnetic field would affect light at all. Think about it, if you shine a bright torch into the night sky, and then all of the earth's gravity suddenly collapsed, what would happen to the light? It would stay the same. Even if you could create a magnetic field around you that's strong enough, it would take more than years, possibly decades, but I'm just approximating. 
<br />
hehe, half of this topic belongs in the modern sciences section.

			everything is affected by magnatism, light is bent when it passes the earth so if a person could make the same magnetic field it should act the same, but yes i agree it would take more than a few years, i was being to optimistic on that.
