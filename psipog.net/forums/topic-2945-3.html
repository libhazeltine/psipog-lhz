			i made a psi scorpion he kills any other constructs that are lying around im kind of unorganized so thats why i have it also becuase i forget to put kill commands i also have a psiball that i can splatter against the wall and it reconstructs like molten metal pretty cool stuff psionics <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			wow its a wonder what happens when your gone... anyway if you guys ares still interested in me and all of this ill answer these questions which are possibly old.
<br />

<br />
also zac is asking a valid question. heres my answer. i have no idea, i shape it myself simply by getting the shape and visualizing im feeling its shape  i dont actually shape it i just feel it.
<br />

<br />
flaring is when a psi construct of any kind flashes into a visible color,
<br />

<br />
im not sure if i still have the pet i wouldnt know ive lost track of it i have made one recently its probably floating around i dont know it might be and when it flares its like only on spots of its body like a tiny tiny camera flash in a breif second and i do sorta see it in the sense as you see the after image of a tv in the dark once you close your eyes only i see that image with open eyes. and its moving. poorly shaped i might add as it was a 3 minute make about yesterday.
<br />

<br />
i cant get a pic of it simply because i have NO CAMERA or money
<br />

<br />
my first one was very well done on my second day of training with psi. i stopped psi after a week of severe headaches which stopped after i learned leeching, but after that i had to stop leaching or i would get headaches from too much energy as i do now that theres another dragon contributing energy to me which is another sign its still thriving. it probably ate the older one or vice versa. i didnt teach it that btw. my sub-c prob did. damn brain i told it not to think...always gets me in trouble lol.
<br />

<br />
but anway i seem to be pretty sucky now and will answer any questions about anything based off of my previous experiences or ill just do it and figure it out. 
<br />

<br />
also i got a webcam recently... my comp cant seem to use it because its missing service pack 2 cd. damn computer.
<br />

<br />
anyway if your new to making pets do a simple one, the mosquito, trust me you dont want to blast a bunch of energy into something complex especially on your first try. start out small work your way up in the evolutionary chain of psi. also the mosquitos do seem to irritate others. mainly you tho.
<br />

<br />
also it seems when i remember the psi thing i made they magically pop back up and torment me for locking them up in my head i guess.

			Why not program it to only give you energy when you want/need it, and have it 'stock' the extra energy so that it can flare and stuff?
<br />

<br />
I'm not into psiballs yet, but this will definantly be on the the top of my To-Do list when I get good at it.

			I'm gonna make a happy face that draws a small amount of electrical energy from nearby appliances and uses it to power itself.  Any extra power, it converts it into psionic energy and gives it to me during my next use of energy.  It will also flare when it gets enough energy.  The only things it will do is float around me, divert energy to me, and POKE PEOPLE MUAHAHAHA!

			well, i suck at this kinda stuff so far...i think i can make a psi ball, but im not really sure, and i dont understand programming at all...do you just lecture to the psiball what you want it to do in your head or something <img src="images/smiles/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" border="0" /> 
<br />

for those of you who can do this, i think it would be fun to make a psi cat, then make psi mice for it to eat, or something along those lines. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
