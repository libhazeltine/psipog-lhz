			Thnx Vladamir, that is uber interesting. Telepathy with animals is technically the ultimate measure of their level of intellect. WEll they've proven their brighter than humans by simply knowning and accepting psi, while most of us deny it and are ignorant of it. But i mean th likes of dolphins and whales which have long since believed to possess a more advanced level of &quot;intelligence&quot; etc. God i would love to talk to a cat, figure why the hell they're so confident all the time.

			Well, animals aren't more intelligent that humans, they just have more accute senses (including the &quot;6th sense&quot; I'd assume) so it's harder to ignore and eventually repress abilities.

			Thats arguably an intelligence of its own though isn't it? They're aware of something thats so blatant and everyday, whereas we are virtually blind to it for most of our lives (most of us anyway, not this lot obviously). It takes a unique kind of intelligence to shape the world to fit in our model, and a more profound kind to see the world for what it it.

So as animals become aware of unusal psionic activity around a human how do they behave?

Just because an animal, in your opinion, can perceive psionics at a higher level than humans doesnt make it more intelligent. Get back to me when theyve put things into outer space, created  flying machine, been capable of intracate legal systems, or maybe even when they can hold their own on the top of the food chain.

I just tend to feel depressed when around other people. I'm happy when I'm away from people though, and that's what confuses me. Even if I'm talking to people on MSN, using forums, etc, I'm fine. But when I'm near people...yeah.

I mean, a psi-vamp would have the exact opposite effect - they'd practically exchange moods with the people they're around.

And no, there's no chance in hell that it could be their body heat.

			Okay I'm going to pull this on topic again and give my opinion on the original subject.
<br />

<br />
Do I believe in Psi-Vampires? Yes.
<br />
Do I believe in Blood-Vampires? Yes (but thats a whole different thing that I'm not going into right now).
<br />

<br />
I very much believe in Psi-Vampires, actually I think my stepsister is an unconscious one. So what is a Vampire?
<br />

<br />
A Vampire who's body doesn't produce enough energy, so the person in question must get this energy from another source (namely other humans). Psi-Vampires get their energy by sucking it from others as Blood-Vampires absorb the energy they get from the blood.
<br />

<br />
Yes humans can suck the energy out of other humans. But the thing that makes a Vampire a Vampire is the fact that without the extra sustenance provided by other humans or creatures. When they don't feed they get stomach cramps or migraines or something similar to that, no they do not die from it.
<br />

<br />
But this is just my opinion, I don;t know everything so feel free to respond and/or disagree.
<br />

<br />
ps: mattz1010, wouldn't that be some kind of empathy, feeling other people's warmth?

			Example, walking home today.
<br />

<br />
I go home with two of my friends, both of which have similar routes to mine, so we go along the same general path, then split up.
<br />

<br />
Usually takes about 20 minutes.
<br />

<br />
It's really windy today, and there's snow everywhere. So, I joke to my friends that I'm going to take off my coat (I feel fine with it on).
<br />
I take my coat off, and I'm not cold. We walk for the next 20 minutes or so, until the bus station, then we all split up. 
<br />
One of my friends also takes his coat off, about 15 minutes in...
<br />
I feel totally fine without my coat for the whole 20 minutes, and feel no incentive to put it back on, minding the temperature is...well, below 0.
<br />
Once we get to the bus station, both of us put our coats back on, and head our respective ways.
<br />

<br />
Once I go by the police station and the last streets to my house, and split up from my friends (The bus station is practically across from the police station...), I start walking back, but suddenly I feel extremely cold again, and shiver inside my coat.
<br />

<br />
Not until I get back home and the warmth from the home keeps me warm, am I in any way, warm...
<br />

<br />
It's really weird.
<br />

<br />
And the depressed thing when near people, happens alot. To be honest, I'm kinda hyper now ^_^

			I find a continuing trend in this thread: the promoting of the idea that psivamps are somehow more &quot;lost&quot; in trying to deal with their psionic abilities and that the people here are better/more capable than that.  Both of which I can say are totally false.
<br />

<br />
Now first off, psivamps don't exist, no one needs to take other people's energy to sustain themselves in any way.  They develop that &quot;need&quot; (really just a desire) by lacking self-esteem, feeling they have little self-worth, and generally being insecure.  This results in &quot;psychic leaning&quot; where you impose yourself (sometimes subtly, sometimes not) onto others in an attempt to get some of their energy.  Such action is obviously selfish, although not a terrible crime, just symptom of an unhappy, unfulfilled person.
<br />

<br />
Now, here's the thing no one wants to here, you've all psi vamped frequently for years (I can think of maybe 2 people who are exceptions to this at psipog).  By deligating your own decisions to someone else, drawing attention to yourself unnecessarily, arguing with someone and trying always to act how you think others want you to act you're perpetuating the state of mind that feels a need for energy.  Obviously there are some serious parallels between wanting a person's approval and wanting their energy, to be their focus.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Normal&quot; human interactions are mutual exchanges of energy, but once you are even the slightest bit selfish, you're trying to tilt the balance of who receives more energy.  Thus, for a example appropriate to these forums, long arguments that have long lost any meaing continue on.  However normal human interactions are rare currently, the generally accepted state of mind is a selfish one and so everyone battles for who gets the most energy from each other.
<br />

<br />
Now, I don't want anyone to think I'm trying to be holier-than-thou, I've done a bit of psychic leaning today hard as I try not to.  It's difficult to stop, always leaning but that conscious effort is worth it eventually.
<br />

<br />
Oh, and to all of you who say &quot;What?  I don't lean psychically because I'm completely secure and don't look for others' approval&quot;  I can safely call bullshit on you.  Denial is the only reason you don't try to stop vamping.

I have to disagree with you on the existing of Vampires, I really do believe they exist. I know a girl who is a Psi-Vampire and she is in no way insecure or whatever. What you describe however I believe to be true, humans exchange energy and they can &quot;vamp&quot; more then they need. But that doesn't make them vampires, it makes them humans who (temporarilly, or however you spell it) suck energy from others for their own purpose. Thats the distinct difference between a feeding Vampire (who need the energy because his or her own supply is insuffiscient) and a feeding Human (who is waaaay less dependant on others because their bodies usually produce more then enough energy). Many humans &quot;vamp-out&quot; when they are sick, but that doesn't make you a Vampire, they do however tend to suck the energy from healthy peeople.

			I agree, the act of vamping doesn't make a person a vamp.  But I've seen thousands of people vamp over my lifetime, all driven by psychological issues rather than physical ones and it's become pretty obvious that there are no vamps.  I think it comes down to people in the OEC want to describe some of their more complex feelings with metaphysics, when in fact the issue is less esoteric than that.  People want to explain their feelings of alienation by calling themselves Otherkin, people want to explain their insecurities (or rather the energetic results of those insecurities) by claiming they have a case of psychic vampirism.
<br />

<br />
As for this particular girl you refer to as being a vamp but not insecure, I'd say you're definition of a truly self-confident person is lacking simply due to the rarity of such people.   People who don't EVER psychically lean are very hard to find, look at how insecure and unstable people in our society are in general (the average person vamps chronically).  So relatively she may not be insecure but compared to one's potential to be completely self-sufficient (as far as confidence and self-esteem go), she would be.
<br />

<br />
You ever meet one of those people that are just completely radiant and magnetic?  Those people that are undescribably appealing to others and not just due to physical looks or material wealth?  Well maybe 1 in 10 of those people are truly free from vamping while a few others may do so infrequently.

Most of them belive in an &quot;awakening&quot; or something like that, it's supposed to be when their vampirism kicks in, I don't know If any of it's true but that's the general explanation for vamps not having to feed as a child.
