     Unless you watch little kiddy shows, I suspect different. But the show does take after tai chi, xingyi and baguazhang arts pertaining to body mechanics and domineering of the external arts by focusing on the internal. And in baguazhang there's circle walking which were taken from Taoist energy practitioners which was originally called circular heaven walking; always in search of balance in the progress of the walking in a circle. 
<br />

<br />
    And I say, they cannot do telekinesis in the show. Only a limited form of it in elemental control consisting of earth, fire, wind, and water which takes from baguazhang also. (I decided to dl a few episodes after you mentioned it and I've heard of it before but never watched it).
<br />

<br />
   Water fighting takes after chen tai chi, air after baguazhang, earth after xing yi and I believe fire is a combination in liu he ba fa. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
    Imagine future psions better in telekinesis then us able to combine martial arts I've mentioned above. (oh gosh, effin' A; now it just sounds like george lucas' universe of dorkdom.)

   Then again, Star Wars is nothing without Jedi Knights which take after Chinese WuXia stories as far as I'm concerned. They're the space aged WuXia Chivalry in deep space and stuff. WuXia is fun even though faked and exaggerated. DBZ and all that other anime crap from Japan take after it (gundams, robots and stupid puppets/animals don't count (i.e. pokemon, digimon, and anything like it.)).
