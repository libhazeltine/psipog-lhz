			Yeah my last question was unspecific. So here it is agian (Hopefully a little clearer).
<br />

<br />
When i have read fantasy books, there are sometimes witches or wizards in them. And the witches and wizards have a crystal ball (Usually). And they just have to say a couple magic words, and they can see therre victim in the crystalball, and where they are and what they are doing(This would be scrying).
<br />

<br />
Now I have heard about how much you can do with psi. So I was thinking, 'why couldnt you scry with psi?'.  It would be like have a vision except you would be projecting it on a mirror (or a crystalball). Now I figured this would be the best catagory to put this in.
<br />

<br />
So I here are my questions.
<br />

<br />
Are there psi abilities that let you do things similar to this?
<br />

<br />
If so, do you think you could progect what you are seeing onto a mirror or something like that?
<br />

<br />
Ok tell me if these questions are not specific enough.

I don't see the point in this, unless to show others what's going on. 
<br />
You could just do that verbally. 
<br />
The only way I could think of (and I doubt this'd even be possible) is to connect with said object and be like haxorz into it...
<br />
What I mean is RV yourself and also use your link thingy to project? I don't know. I have no idea what I'm talking about. I doubt it's possible...

			ohhh ok. That's a much better explanation. Well first off, the term &quot;psi&quot; is a highly controversial word. It's properties or even existence are not proven yet. With that said, being able to use psi for scrying? is an unanswerable question. (However, I highly doubt that it's possible to project an image in a mirror or crystal ball. It's not as easy as just &quot;projecting&quot; the image there.) Your question raises many more variables, which make answering the question that much harder. What is sight? Would that image actually be projected infront of you for all to see, or is it actually just being visualized in your mind? If it is projected for all to see, what would it be made of? Images in mirrors are just reflections of matter. Are you creating some kind of matter? If not, then what is the image made of? A crystal ball seems even harder to explain, because there is no reflection in it. So would you be creating some kind of holographic image with your mind? How? Using psi to create matter, and manipulate the particles to form a scene? Highly doubtful. Noone can answer your question with certainty because noone knows how it would work.
<br />

<br />
HOWEVER, to answer your question about things possible which are related to this, yes, as it has been said, RVing is very similar. (Without physical images infront of you) There is a lot of info about it on this site so check it out.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			No.* Fantasy is not even close to the real world.
<br />

<br />
*Unless you used this theoretical mirror or &quot;crystal ball&quot; as a focus for an eyes-open trance state from which you RV'd or RP'd something. Two caveats here: you could theoretically do this on anything, from a flame to a blank wall to Jeff Goldblum, and doing it on a reflective surface would most likely prove distracting, as any small motion that you make would be reflected and your eyes would catch onto it, thus tending to disrupt the trance. If you were going to do this, better to use a blank, evenly-lit white or off-white wall.
