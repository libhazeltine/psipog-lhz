			It's funny i'm in 2006 and in 2007 at the same time. And at the same time in all other times. It's really really really funny!!!!!!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I am not joking. But i'm joking. Read below.
<br />

<br />
Sounds strange, but it isn't. Because there is no time and so there can be no new year. It's new year in every single moment. And still it's not. Because years are just the measurement when the earth surrounds the sun one time completely. So when the earth arrives at the same place that it was a year before the same things happen like the year before, but accumulated with the events from the cycle of the earth around the sun in that year. But years are not equally long. Every 4 Years is a year with one day more in February. That means that the way the earth takes around the sun isn't the same. 
<br />

<br />
If the earth would continue that path it would in long long times be drawn to the sun by its gravitation. 
<br />

<br />
But it doesn't because the earth doesn't follow that way. It can be influenced by connecting to the magnetic field of the earth which contains all information about it and is in constant change because there is new information added by the sun and stars and other galaxies. The sun gives the earth life. Light brings colors. Colors are the energetic levels of light so without light there is no energy. Without energy there is no life. 
<br />

What i wrote above is an explanation of space and time. Two variables!?
<br />
That's right. Think about your eyes. They are globes. Two round balls. With them you can see three dimensions in space. You can see more if you want but it's not so easy because the consciousness screen is in two dimensions ( Two eyes). You can see with your ears too (Two ears). Which means two dimensions more. You can smell i don't know how many dimensions more that is. You can .....
<br />

<br />
I don't want to write more now. I could go on forever. One thing i can tell you is that  everything that doesn't change from one moment to another is destined to die and still things that don't change and stay the same forever can't die either.
<br />

<br />

			First off, the reason there's an extra day in February every four years is because a year is really 365.25 days. But that's too complicated to factor into each year, so we just add the four .25's together into 1 and tack it to the fourth year. That's the extra day in February. It's added to February because February has the fewest days. 
<br />

<br />
But I like your point on that each moment is the start of a new year, depending on where you measure your year from. See the Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year" target="_blank" class="postlink">New Year's in different calendars</a>. 2008 will have two New Year's in the same calendar! The Muslim New Year happens twice in 2008. Which is really cool.
