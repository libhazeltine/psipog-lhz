I'm glad you are on the &quot;sleeping side.&quot;  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  
<br />
Yeah, you kids need to lay off the TV and video games and just damn well sleep. 
<br />
I am not a professional in the sleeping field or anything. But with my experiences in life I don't believe in that sleeping disorder called: &quot;Insomnia&quot; or whatever. 
<br />
In my past I have had plenty of sleeping problems. But I didn't let it stop me from sleeping! I hanged in there, for hours. And eventually your mind will learn that it can actually sleep. I just think most are highly negative about there sleep and therefore the brain follows them. 
<br />
If not sleep, you should just meditate which isn't as good as sleep, but it is better than no sleep.

teenage brains, as my psych teacher explains, are busy emitting horomones into your body, that the natural process of sleep kicking in comes at a later date. this doesn't apply for children and adults.

I've never heard of that. I think it has to do with how you are raised.

I do know that children and teens are the one's who need sleep the most though.

Anyways I think noone gets that much sleep because of the type of people you are asking. Everyone's 12-22 give or take. Ask people who are 35-50 and you'll get different results. However it is proven that people overall, are getting less sleep nowadays. A lot of survey's say it's because of the current lifestyle and &quot;they're aren't enough hours in the day&quot;.

There are exceptions to every rule. The case you're describing is very rare. I doubt this girl had the same problem with sleep aid addictions, <span style="font-style: italic">which would be a drug problem</span>. <span style="font-weight: bold">As I said could be the case in my 1st post.</span> But thanks for the useless story  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />...Also I bet if your friend didn't sleep for 5 days straight, he'd be sleeping on the 6th. You said it was just to get him to sleep at <span style="font-style: italic">good intervals</span>. Not to just be able to sleep. Your body won't function after a set number of days without sleep.

Sorry if I sounded too harsh but I took your &quot;if you would actually look into it&quot; comment as an insult. But you weren't just mentioning an experience, you were trying to cut up my statement or something.

I've got a friend whose an insomniac. He says he sleeps about twenty minutes each night. It explains his sluggish, lazy, and stoned-like behavior! I'm surprised SFG doesn't believe in insomnia. When I didn't get sleep on certain nights I tried being positive but it didn't work. It drove me crazy and I started coming up with ridiculous scientific theories that seemed perfectly rational at the time <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />. I guess that would make me the mad scientist type of insomniac <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. (if I were an insomniac that is)

Same here <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. In fact, I pretty much have to. Not much choice since I have to get up at 5:15 on school days. I get my sleep back on the weekends. But really everybody, it is best to get as much sleep as you can. The recommended amount of sleep for maximum brain performance for teenagers is 9 hours and 45 minutes (Of course, I could only get that much sleep on weekends sadly.). Simply getting a few hours more sleep each day may help you in school. I saw tests performed on two teenagers on the discovery channel. The results were scary. The girl who got maybe two or three more hours of sleep did way better on the activities that were part of the experiment. I hope this information may have inspired someone to get more sleep. That is all I have to offer on this thread so far. Farewell...
