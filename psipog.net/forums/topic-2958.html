			Hi people,
<br />

<br />
Glad to join the psipog.net forums. What's funny is that I used to be interested in Telekinesis, but could never quite do it. However, a few days ago, I was bored, and decided to practice it properly. I heard about the &quot;Psi-wheel&quot;, made one, and tried it out. Nothing happened for the first two days (I was practicing 2-3 hours a day), but last night, managed to make the wheel turn in an anti-clockwise motion at a moderate speed (No windows or doors were open, and the wheel didn't move at all for five mins beforehand, so I knew there was nothing else that could make it move). I did it three more times to make sure I could do it, and it rotated anti-clockwise all three times. Since my head started hurting a little, and I got tired, I went to sleep (Worked on my third session, a half hour before going to sleep) - I have a couple of questions for anyone who wants to help:
<br />

<br />
1. Is it normal for the head to feel numb when trying Psychokinesis? I'm expecting it would be because of the stress put on the mind whilst trying out something new and challenging.
<br />

<br />
2. To make the Psi-wheel turn, my eyes become a little blurred while looking at the object. Only then can I move the Psi-wheel. Is it the same for some of you? Maybe that's just the way my mind can attain maximum concentration on the object or something. Also, while the wheel was moving, I kept concentrating on the wheel, but used my conscious mind to feel which parts of the brain felt like they were working to &quot;ask&quot; the wheel to spin - It felt as though the back of my brain (Just above the back of the neck), the &quot;third eye&quot; position, and the right side of the temporal lobe were most active.
<br />

<br />
I'm going to try and &quot;ask&quot; the wheel to move in a clockwise direction later on (Since anti-clockwise seems to have become relatively easy). How long would you recommend for me to continue practicing with the wheel, and what should I try after this?
<br />

<br />
Thanks!

			First of all: Congratulations with your success!!
<br />

<br />
1. Is it normal for the head to feel numb when trying Psychokinesis? I'm expecting it would be because of the stress put on the mind whilst trying out something new and challenging. 
<br />

<br />
- That depends on how much you concentrate and for how long you practice, I had pressure on my third eye area the first times I practiced, I think its the mind finding the right &quot;muscle&quot; to do PK.
<br />

<br />
2. To make the Psi-wheel turn, my eyes become a little blurred while looking at the object. Only then can I move the Psi-wheel. Is it the same for some of you? Maybe that's just the way my mind can attain maximum concentration on the object or something. Also, while the wheel was moving, I kept concentrating on the wheel, but used my conscious mind to feel which parts of the brain felt like they were working to &quot;ask&quot; the wheel to spin - It felt as though the back of my brain (Just above the back of the neck), the &quot;third eye&quot; position, and the right side of the temporal lobe were most active. 
<br />

<br />
- Blurry vision can have many causes, for me its when I don't blink my eyes for a long time, or concentrating very hard. Its not neccesary to have a blurred vision to do PK, just blink your eyes regulary.
<br />
The back side in your brain is the place where you experience the world.
<br />
The frontal lobes are your concious mind that are making it happen so its &quot;normal&quot; to feel those places most active.
<br />

<br />
3. I'm going to try and &quot;ask&quot; the wheel to move in a clockwise direction later on (Since anti-clockwise seems to have become relatively easy). How long would you recommend for me to continue practicing with the wheel, and what should I try after this? 
<br />

<br />
- First get control over the wheel, keep at it, spinning in one direction is what happens to a lot of people, its not bad but it can be frustration not to be able to spin it the other way. Control comes with practice, what time it takes depends on your mind and how much you practice.
<br />
When you are able to control different movements go on to:
<br />
- spinning tinfoil or papers on a desk instead of a needle.
<br />
- rolling pens or plastic cups.
<br />

<br />
I recommend you not to focus on a psiwheel only because a lot of people get stuck on it because they only think they can move that.
<br />

<br />
so the next steps to take:
<br />
1. Practice Psiwheel until you can control it,
<br />
2. Practice other objects even when they don't move, you will increase your power even when nothing seems to happen
<br />
3. Practice more...
<br />
and even more...
<br />
4. Dont overdo, if you feel a headache coming, STOP!
<br />

<br />
Good Luck!

			1. Sometimes, I'll get a numb/tingly feeling, but that's the feeling I get when I focus psi somewhere in my body, so I assume that's energy leaving the body and going towards the wheel. However, I haven't felt this since I actually became able to move it, which was... Earlier today. Maybe last night.
<br />

<br />
2. It doesn't really affect me either way. Sometimes, I'll let my eyes go out of focus. Others, they'll be kept crystal clear, all the time. I also don't really pay attention to which parts of the brain are most active. I'm usually really just thinking about something and looking at the wheel. Sometimes not even anything related to psionics. I've found that I need a degree of focus mixed with a degree of distraction.

			1.  i agree with gonzo on this one.  i also think that it's from all the concentration (unless you use NI's technique), and focus you are putting into such a small object.
<br />

<br />
2.  i agree with gonzo on this one too.  i also think that it can be from the concentration.  when you are fixated on any one object, your eyes tend to blur naturally.  you may also forget to blink since you are so focused on the object.  it isn't necessary to let your eyes blur, but what works for you may be different for other people.  go with what works.
<br />

<br />
3.  i would say keep practicing with the psi-wheel until you can move it 2-3 (360) spins in one direction, STOP IT, then move it 2-3 (360) spins in the other direction.  that's my routine at least.  after that try rolling pens, toothpicks, caps and other small objects.  after that i would try moving the psi-wheel again, but underneath glass.  after that, do what you want.  by then you should be comfortable and confident enough to try anything  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
also, do what gonzo said and don't obsess over the psi-wheel too much.  many a psion have gotten stuck on the psi-wheel because they didn't know when to move on.  when you feel you are ready to move on, then move on.  and congrats on your accomplishment! <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
