Yeah, most likely.  I could've swore I saw something somewhere...
<br />

<br />
Generally, I try to clear my mind and ask myself questions.  The tricky part is differentiating between answers from my subconscious and answers from my conscious.  I have been unable to find a difference in how they &quot;sound&quot; yet.
<br />

Damn my overactive imagination.

			Many people believe that, but to my knowledge, it hasn't been verified (correct me if I'm wrong). It would make sense, though. If you're the type of person that believes that (I am), look into dream interpretation. Especially if you've had a dream that &quot;sticks out.&quot;

In my experience, when my subconscious speaks up, it's usually a sudden flash of emotion across my mind. Usually, it's either something to do with &quot;Make sure you do/don't do &lt;insert action here&gt;&quot; or &quot;I told you so,&quot; though sometimes it's a new take on something I'm thinking about.

For the most part, yes.  I've been struggling lately for control, but it usually causes me to wake up.

That, coupled with my allergies acting up, as well as the neighbors' dogs barking, and the people building a house right across the yard from us.

<br />
That is indeed the tricky part. I have noticed with myself that there are some ways to differentiate between them on a rational level. Some characteristics to can use to check your answers.
<br />

<br />
One thing that I noticed is that the subconsconscious's answers are much subtler in nature than your conscious chatter. Its like two people are talking, one with the use of his own voice, and one standing right next to him, with the use of his voice <span style="font-style: italic">and </span>a megaphone. The sound vibrations produced by the one without is much subtler than those produced by the one with a megaphone. Because of that, you need to focus alot more, or rather: you need more alertness of consciousness to hear the subtler one instead of getting distracted and pulled in by the grosser, louder one. So you need more consciousness, more direct, alert focus to hear the subconscious. It is almost as if you have to dig beyond your actual thoughts in order to hear your subconscious. It's like the subconscious is always there, but underneath something louder and more concrete.
<br />

<br />
What I noticed also, is that conscious thoughts come later than the subconscious answers. Imagine you ask yourself a question,. After finishing the question, you start to automatically will your mind to come up with an answer. This takes perhaps a fraction of a second and then you hear a thought with an illusional answer in it. As brief as this may seem, the subconscious is much quicker in answering your questions. <span style="font-weight: bold">Even before you started asking yourself a question; at the exact moment you got the intention of asking a question, the answer is there. </span>
<br />

<br />
Try to notice the answer by staying focussed at any answer that might pop up. If you do this, you will notice that the answer does not really pop up, it is always there. What pops up, are the conscious thoughts. Something subtle does not &quot;pop up&quot; but just lies there all the time: before the illusional answer pops up, and after it dissapeared. The problem is that after the illusional answer has popped up, we loose our focus and are lost in our own thinking about the answer/thought that just popped up. So the best time to &quot;hear&quot;your subconscious's answer, is at the moment the question arrives in your mind. Just before you start to think about it. You can only hear it when you are intensely focussed, as if trying to hear a familiar voice fomr a distance when standing in a big croud of talking people. You need to tune in.
<br />

<br />
If you think you missed the opportunity of hearing this direct impuls immediately and feel like you are already lost in your own thinking, try to stay alert and go back in your mind to the moment you were feeling a question mark about some subject arise in the mind. Go back to that moment and observe what happened underneath your own surface at that time. Observe if you felt anything, or thought anything on a very subtle level, beyond the loud chattering of the mind. If you think you have found that something, it is probably your answer. Practice, however, to recieve the answer at the instant you feel the question, because right at the moment a serious question arrive sin your mind, you have a moment of one-pointed, undisturbed focus because the mind if so interested in that question, or rather the answer to that question, that it is absorbed by it and therefore very clear for a moment or two. Use that time to sense beneath the surface. When you hear something, look even deeper.; penetrate that level and go beyond and you'll find the answer I'm sure.
