			I would rather practice something like psi manipulation, telepathy, micro-PK or DMILS. I meant that I'm stopping practicing physical object manipulation. And I see what you guys mean, but I really don't have the time to become 'advanced'.

			lol, sorry.  If you think rolling and what not is 'advanced' then , hm, looking at our community you'd have to be right. Though that should not be considered advanced.  I'm sorry I just don't think that if you don't have time to get good at pk then well you'll be a novice at any other given skill aswell.

I consider 'advanced' as <span style="font-style: italic">useful</span>, things such as being able to bring a pencil to your hand from across the room. I don't have time to practice that much though, so I can just do other skills.
<br />

<br />
As for your second point, you are wrong. Psionics varies very, very greatly. One of my friends is a great telepath and he's never even considered PK. So don't go assuming that just because I don't want to do PK I can't do anything else either.

			There are other aspects to PK, such as pyro-PK (i believe that's what we're supposed to call it).  You can start fires and therefore will never need a lighter or to rub two sticks together again.
<br />

<br />
Though, the fact is that PK isn't just about tripping people and a little extra reach; it's more cerebral than that.  PK is about breaking the barriers about what we can and can't do.  It's encouragement that if we are able to do something that is refuted by the world as &quot;impossible&quot; that we are able to surpass even the largest barriers.
<br />

<br />
At least that's my opinion.

			To clarify and to end this, I said that because you said earlier that you don't have time to become advanced... I'm sure you now understand where I drew my conclusion from and this can be ended.

			I never got into pk much exxcept for DMILS, Pyro pk and manipulating electricity......and magicdood234, I've been on your site and I've spoken to you many times and neveza has much more experience than you......anyways, I find tk to have little use other than once you get advanced where you can slide things easily.....I prefer the perceptive abilities myself. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

Personally, I think it is a waste of time and energy. I'm not going to go into detail as I'm tired, but I just want to let everyone know that if you think PK will be useful to you in your life, go for it. If not, it's best you focus on another aspect of psionics, as I am about to do, and not spend so much time on a near-useless skill.

I agree to a degree that its usefullness is limited, but try to keep the bigger picture in mind. I'll use an example that fits in perfectly with this. I took an art class not too long ago for college credit. I'd done art in kindergarten, and that's about it. But the art instructor in my recent course told me that, &quot;You may not think you are good in art, or maybe you don't like art at all. But remember that other aspects in life open up avenues in others. Many artists were also good poets, because painting created new insights and abilities in writing creativity. Anything you do gives you another perception and view in another.&quot; Granted art has its uses, but this isn't that different. PK may be limited, but it is not completely useless.

			I've the same problem, Cheese.
<br />
Really, I spent most of my time this summer in understanding psionic and learning PK as it has been my first interest by far.
<br />
But I figured out that too much time is needed to master this ability.
<br />
The problem is that I'd like to spend some time (really little, actually) in some other psionic aspects, but I really dont know which fits best for people like &quot;us&quot; who have not so much time to practice.
<br />

<br />
This maybe shouldn't be asked here but, any suggestion to me (&quot;us&quot;) would be appreciated.
<br />

<br />
Btw, my best wishes for your future in psionic Cheese <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
