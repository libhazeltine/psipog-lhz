			JoeT, you may have guess, but in case you havn't, this is Bcodes from IRC. Well, I have a few questions about RV, not questions like &quot;can you tell me how to do it&quot;
<br />
Anyways, here I go:
<br />

<br />
1)  How long have you been practicing Remote Viewing?
<br />
2) About how accurate would you say your viewing is?
<br />
3) About how long does it take you to get information you're looking for?
<br />
4) And finally, what kept you motivated to keep on practicing?
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your time.

			Hello BarCode,
<br />

<br />
1) I've been a working with remote viewing for around two years now. I've always been interested in remote viewing and I've had my fair share of practice back in the day. However, it wasn't until around two years ago until I became serious with remote viewing.
<br />

<br />
2) My accuracy varies from time to time. My accuracy has reached to around 93% accuracy however I've had my fair share of bad sessions. My accuracy usually ranges around 75-90%. However, please keep in mind that I've trained hard and put in the time for practice to get to my level of accuracy. 
<br />

<br />
3) My sessions usually range from 40 minutes to an hour. If I would like to obtain more information on a target then I would do more than one session. I've viewed targets five times to get the necessary information that I need. 
<br />

<br />
4) Knowing that I'm learning how to access an ability that knows nothing but truth always kept me interested and inspired to keep working on it. Remote viewing is one of those skills that can be applied in everyday life. Remote viewing in my opinion is one of the best psionic related abilities to learn and practice. There is no known limits with remote viewing. If you wish to learn about anything regardless of distance, time or space you can. Anything you can imagine can be viewed an accessed. 
<br />

<br />
I hope my response was the answers you were looking for. If you have anymore questions please feel free to ask. Also, if any member would like to ask questions please feel free to ask as well. 
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />
