			It might seem like there are a lot of rules but there is a reason we have those.  We have those &quot;Dont talk about&quot; rules to stop flaming before they start and we pretty much say the same rules over and over to emphisize it.  However, many people still break them repeatedly.

			This was one of the things I was trying to avoid.  Hence why I tried to attatch and categorize the rules to seven basic ideals.  I think the ideals are good guides, and easy to digest quickly.  Be a Good Leader, Respect Others, Be a Good Author, Be a Good Skeptic, Be Credible, Be Responsible, and Keep Things Fun.  If something is unclear in those ideals, then you can look at the rules below them for more clairification.

			Do religious signatures break the rules, or are they OK?
<br />

<br />
Because I'm thinking of putting in a religious line in my siggy, but I don't want to get flamed to hell (pardon the pun) for mentioning my faith in my signature.
<br />

<br />
So am I safe on this, or is a religious sig still in that forbidden zone?

If you mean that religious sigs are gonna get me flamed faster than a jug of Naptha on a camp stove, then I'll just leave the line I was gonna put in there out.

			To elaborate on Apollo's post

<br />
I understand the whole &quot;PG-13&quot; thing as applying to content, not language. People swear openly here, the only forum I've seen where one can vent in completeness.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
You can swear as much as you feel neccecary, as long as you're not talking about extremely gory or raunchy stuff. But be a bit conservative wiht the swearing and you'll have few problems. (Basically, don't go saying stuff like &quot;Fuck the fucking fuckers&quot; for most of your posts.)
<br />

<br />
Hope I helped to clear up a bit of confusion.

			Systems succeed where people fail. Establishing timeless principles to live by when it comes to this community and then creating a stand alone complex of advocating them has always been a good idea. That is, when the principles advocated where just. These principles are just so I see no problem with them.
<br />

<br />
Also it helps limit crap threads. In most forum communities it is fact that their  are more crap threads than good threads. With these principles even the crap threads can be carried out in a respectful mannor.
<br />

<br />
You guys are doing right with these rules and all but remember not to put too much emphasis on such things. Even in psychology forums with scientists or in NLP forums their is trash. I see forums as the 80/20 rules. 80% of the posts are gonna be normal or garbage and only 20% of them are gonna be good.
<br />

<br />
People ARE gonna post redundent topics, stupid questoin, kn3wb question, question they could get from reading the manual, flames, and stupid comments. That just is going to happen. 
<br />

<br />
Trying to decresae that is good, but make sure that it's not to such an extent thta you ignore th 20% or get to worked over the 80% existance. It's just a fact of life. Focus on governing it, and don't peeved when you can't increaes the ratio.
