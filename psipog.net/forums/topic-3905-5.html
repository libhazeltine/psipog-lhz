			maxus, how 'bout trying a candle? it would decrease the skepticism 'bout the match extinguishing on it's own..  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
ok, ok, i used the wrong choice of words when i described kief as a skeptic.. when i say best it wasn't in terms with him being a &quot;healthy skeptic&quot;, how he acted or how he was reasonable.. i meant he was  giving the situation a little humor (for me that is  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> ).. since he's always being a smartass even if you try to be meaningful or reasonable with him..

That is probably one of the best posts ive seen in a while. Yes, i will attempt to light a match using pyrokinesis and/or attempt to extinguish a candle flame.

			I have to agree, Although I havent been very succesful in PK, I still think its possible. I have researched it for months and there is no explination that disproves it besides Newtons first law.

After watching that video of that guy setting a newspaper on fire, and giving people electric shocks, it really inspired me to practice igniting things using pyrokinesis, as i can already extinguish and control flames, why not create them.
<br />
So anyway, for the last few days ive been doing some indepth meditation, filling my hands with energy, then dispersing it onto a specific point. I usually lay on my bed whilst meditating, after about an hour of practice today, i felt my hand get incredibly hot, so i decided to release the energy, andi burnt my bed sheet. Very scary moment though. This is great progress though.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

I think Keif IS being reasonable. Kudos to him for not totally losing it as some of the folk in here.

			Obviously, you have never attempted Psi, and therefore do not know what people are capable of when they put their minds to it. Pyrokinesis is a valid term, it is clearly stated in the valid terms of kinesis'.
<br />
I thought i already posted a video, oh well, must be my forgetful memory. I will make another video, when i have succeeded in igniting a newspaper, and not before. I sense another Kief.

			It is quite true though, any one go get a match and try flames burn up not down once the fuel runs out the match goes out.  Fellow psions nor I are doubting any ones abilities, but a candle would say much more than a match thats going out.  Although people on psipog support psions in training and give the benefit of the doubt they are not here to indulge people, so keep that in mind. (I'm not trying to be an ass or anything but you must understand the circumstances)

			As i have said many, many, many times, i will make a video of me doing something really impressive using pyrokinesis, like igniting a ball of paper. Practice takes time you know, dont expect anyone to be able to project blue flames from their hands that can boil the sea, Dragon Ball Z style within minutes of trying. It really annoys me when people want proof of Psi, when they cant be assed to do it themselves, why should i put huge amounts of effort and time into doing something, just for it to be blown down by a bunch of people who have no experience in the manipulation of Psi at all. Im angry because i went to the doctors about my stomach being painful, as many of you know ive got IBS, well, its not IBS, its colon cancer.
<br />

<br />
But now ive had my rant, i welcome skepticism, but i do not welcome assholes, before you write a skeptical comment, ask yourself, 'am i an asshole?'
