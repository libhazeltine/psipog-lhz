			well I've seen the posts considering changing physical appearance and same things , But Have You considered that it might also boost your PSI,
<br />
The Only risk is that you might become having a lack of control on your psi ,maybe because you aren't used to such great psi amount ,anyway I haven't tried it yet but, for all those who want to try it here are some things i thought of :
<br />

<br />
First : You may meditate before it just to have a clear mind (eventhough any other techniques could be used to relax your mind ) and think of any fictional character with PSI (maybe the telekinetic gurl in X-men Jean grey if you know the movie ) and imagin yourself getting it's psi energy ,don't imagin her figure to take or anything like that I'm not responsible for such an imagination  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> , imagin yourself able to do anything with her powers, IMAGIN and convince yourself it's real, IMAGINE and feel the psi powers growing inside you, IMAGIN a huge psi energy ball giving you the power,IMAGINE whatever you want just concentrate on the final result which is ME WITH HUGE PSI THAT I'M <span style="font-weight: bold">CAPABLE OF CONTROLLING IT</span> THE WAY I WANT.
<br />

<br />
second: ofcourse whatever begining is right for you do it (meditation,centering,grounding,whatever) after doing that imagin your body as a 3d hollow container with green little PSI particles (as small as sand particles) spread allover your body, then Imagin them piling and getting more denser and take less place down your hollow body till they become so dense as they not appear green particles but appear like green solid or liquid doesn't matter below the level of your knees, then imagin your body drawing energy from allover the place (or whatever source that's convinient for you)and getting your body filled with PSI with the same dense the thick one but <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GET YOUR BODY FULL TO TOP</span></span> as I read before ALOT of PSI isn't cool but it also may lead to damage,after doing this Imagin (with Imagin here I mean <span style="font-weight: bold">PROGRAM</span> Your Sub-con) that when you use your PSI energy it doesnt run out,but instead of that it automatically draws energy again with the same previous way.
<br />

<br />
I hope If Anyone read this and has a comment Please tell me as i may be wrong everybody may be wrong.
<br />

<br />
and thats for all now i guess
<br />
when i finish exams I'll use all my time to try this and to BOOST my PSI and by the way if you tried it ,and if any results are found just post a reply
<br />

<br />

<br />
I'm looking forward to hearing from you all and Trying it myself you must practice this for a while in order to get results (if there any ,who knows ??),but beware advantages are always followed by disadvantages  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> 
<br />
 (anything I'll acheive will be posted here propably after 28/6 my last exams day)
<br />
GOOD LUCK  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />
If Some People Changed Their Eyes Colour Already ,Why It Would Be Hard To Increase PSI Energy ?? ....think of it...... <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			i have my own technique for drawing more energy, it works wonders for me, but thats probably just me. I visualise stuff like steam being drawn from everything and everywhere and being absorbed into me, it really gives a good feeling, but if i try and move something or connect to someone right afterwards, the link is much much stronger. Hope this helped someone

			Ahmed this is where kundalini energy can come into play, when you awaken it, you can feel power beyond your wildest dreams. However, if you are not spiritially or physically ready for such power, it tends to not be a very pleasant experience. I'm like my 4th day on this and the amount of difference that it makes is unbelievable. It's like I can keep going, and going and I do not drain very easily now. Just a thought you'd might like to keep in mind.

			im not sure if i believe in kundalini energy, but your first technique seems to be based on the concept of the self fufiling prophecy. your imagining that you are a person (fictional or not) who does poses extreme abilities and your subconcious believes it. for me it helps just to read about psionics and subconciously it start to believe it more therefore i have greater success. your 2nd technicque seems to be based on visualization, one of the minds greatest tools.

			lol vlad, 
<br />
 I didn't believe in kundalini energy myself, but I figgured, what the hell try it anyway. I did so and boy was I surprised. It supposedly stays dormant until you are ready and then when you do specific meditation practices that it begins to waken, however I started the awakening process with the brain wave generator. 
<br />

<br />
It's thrilling, and yet terrifying as well because you don't know what to expect and can be a bit painful and it's like holding onto a tiger by it's tail with no control at times. Also I believe to become more advance in psionics, it will eventually need to be awakened, I have gotten much better control in regards to manipulating, pk ect. 
<br />
Levitation is one of the things that I am working on now, have gotten a little bit of success with it, using a very light piece of cat hair.

			meditation is realy good thing to do relax and clearing the mind and after that come slow and easy imagination and try to sense and feel everything you do , that is good way in healing or make the place that need to be healed become faster in getting better and it is good to recharge your body with energy and ofcourse meditation help in tk and psi balls .... and so on .
<br />

<br />
with meditation you can sense energy , chakras , herns and you can blow your mind too  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  like i was going to do before without i know .
<br />

<br />
so i wonder if i imagin while meditation that i become stronger in psi energy or become better in tk ..... and so on , that will work???
<br />

<br />
hmm cant tell you , need to experience it first to say  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
okey what you read was my own experience , so im sure of them 100% .
