I was in a bathroom singing, and I looked in the mirror and saw a green cloud surrounding me. So, yeah. It came naturally to me like 1 and a half-2 years ago... At my cousin's wedding.

			Auric sight is easy to pick up, only takes a few minutes to an hour.  Frankly I think it's gateway psi.  Though, one thing I disagree about what they say about auras is that you need to have two eyes to see them.  I can see auras with one eye, well two eyes one closed if that matters.  But yeah auras are awesome almost like telepathy and empathy rolled into one, except you tell what a person is like.

			I've read two varying reports.  One, that everyone has the same basic shades in their aura but a few colours spiking here and there indicate emotions.  The other, that everybody has a different colour aura that more has to do with their personality.  The second one sounds more fluffy to me, but I just thought I'd ask what peopel here think and make sure.

			Most people agree that the colours are up to the individual. What does blue mean to you? Blue is my favourite colour so I usually feel safe and calm around blue things. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Blue: Balanced existence, sustaining life, eased nerve system, transmitting forces and energy. People with blue strong point in their Aura are relaxed, balanced and feel ready to live in a cave and survive. They are born survivors. Blue thought is a thought about relaxing the nerve system to achieve the balance of the mind or a thought about surviving. Electric blue can override any other color in the Aura, when the person is receiving and/or transmitting information in a telepathic communication. For example Michel Desmarquet, author of &quot;Thiaoouba Prophecy&quot;, frequently glows with the electric blue during his lectures, especially when he answers questions from the public.&quot;

That's a fairly good site. Good excercises, despite the whole chakra idea which I find a bit ridiculous....hmm I'm so tired.

			I don't know really, I just do. It seems more religious based from what I've seen, and it's usually surrounded by people who are either frauds or revolve the traditional psychic ideas; tarot cards, higher powers, guardian angels, things like that. Things which aren't logical and seem very blind-belief orientated. Like I said, I've never had a positive experience so if you had any strong interesting theories (or better, proof  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> ) I'd love to hear them.

			I'm not particularly decided either way, but I find a lot of traditionalist stuff works out - chakras included, to some extent. I wouldn't swear by them, but there do seem to be some main energy points around where chakras should be in a lot of places. Try crown, third eye, heart, solar plexus...
<br />

<br />
Also, I'd like to know why you instantly dismiss &quot;tarot cards, higher powers, guardian angels, things like that.&quot; It seems like you have some reason to be opposed to all these things - any reason? Or are you just the type to reject religion in favour of things scientifically proven?
