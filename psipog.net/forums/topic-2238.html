			Last night I dreamt that I was in my son's dream helping him. I cannot remember what I did in the dream but I DO remember being in it.  Well my wife calls me up today at work and tells me that my 5yr old was telling her how he was being hurt by two men in his dream but that Daddy showed up and started helping him.   My wife is freaked.  I am not, I am wanting to know how to do this stuff intentionally, and more often.  Anyone have experiences like this?

			Well i've maked &quot;parties&quot; at dreams with some friends, it's cool cause my friends remember more or less what we did, this can be achieved with an OBE and practising obe techniques. But i've never tried to get into someones dream... But maybe it can be possible. Read around here, its full of articles.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Well I'm the only one that can produce an OBE so I went to their homes and take their &quot;souls&quot; out of his body, or simply i call them and they come or they appear in front of me (I always ask them in real life to take them out of their bodies).
<br />
Sometimes they don't remember anything when they awake the next morning but sometimes they remember little things of what we have done in the OBE  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />
