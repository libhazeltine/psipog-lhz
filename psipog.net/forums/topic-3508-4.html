Perhaps, though, you could make an image on photoshop or another program of what it looked like while saying underneath the image that it is fake, just so people know. I'm interested to see what light looks likke when it's bent. Note also that when I made a previous post, I mentioned that what I said may not apply to what we can do psionically. You can't bend light scientifically to my opinion, (I invite someone to prove me wrong) but psionically must be quite easy to think about it. Constructs can do alot of stuff. So visualizing light bend would be rather easy I suppose.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I wouldn't mind describing it again, it looked very much like the distortion that you see above a fire when the flames are high.  Like heat distorting the image behind it, only it was in a ball shape.  I don't think it takes all that much to mess up light patterns, but creating light (flaring) is considerably harder for me.  Also it may be difficult to make yourself invisible or something like that because you have to flawlessly reproduce the image behind you from all angles, and personally I don't understand how that would work, but just to interrupt the flow of the wave/particle is actually not that hard (at least for me)...then again it doesn't look like anything special, my only point is that it is possible to affect light in some way with psionics.

I really don't see how this supports your claim against my statement.  Being angry also only serves to discredit yourself.  People get angry when their beliefs are challenged because they fear that the other person may be right.  Is it possible that you are wrong?  Is it possible that I am wrong?  Of course, both are possible, which is why we give supporting claims that make sense rather than getting defensive.  My reasoning behind my statement that I cannot do anything psionically with a construct that I can't do myself without the aid of the construct has been true for me, and I have tested it many times.  The programming just doesn't work because it doesn't make sense to my subconscious I would guess.  In your example you have the exact opposite (despite the example not being a psionic one), it should say something like...I can make a construct that does ______, but when I try to do it without the aid of a construct I do not have the skill....where _____ is a psionic ability.
<br />

<br />
I'm willing to admit that I am wrong, and that maybe a construct helps concentration that you would not have had without it, but technically you still had the skill.  Either way provide examples that you have personally done, or some logic that actually makes sense and I will gladly listen and put your previous ignorance aside.

When you look at a magnet it doesn't seem to distort light.  How much magnetic force are you talking about here?

			i admit it would take a very large amount of magnetic energy to distort light but i remembered that some one made a hologaric projector that could bend light by using heat to alter light. i can't beleive i forgot though.

Light is not bent when it passes the earth is it? So if I were to shine a torch pass the left side of earth, it wouldn't come out the other side? It would follow round the earth and never end? Don't think so. If that were true, then how would we see stars from millions and millions of light years away? The light would not reach us without curving round another planet or star. Gravity or magnetism doens't effect light. 
<br />
Light travels in straight lines, that has been proven. Shine a torch into the sky, the light goes in a straight line, shine it horizontal, light doesn't bend round the surface of the earth, it would go out into space. And how would anyone go about proving whether it did bend round the earth anyway? Light doesn't have a mass to be affected except reflecting and refracting.

Sorry, but I'd like to disagree with nearly everything in that paragraph...
<br />

<br />
Without going into relativity, gravity (but not electro-magnetism) does bend light because light does have mass - it's been proven. (Don't believe everything you're told in Primary School).  Black-holes bend light so much that it can't escape, but a ray of light traveling past the Earth or sun would be very slightly bent.  Like if you roll a marble across a table cloth, which is suspended at each corner, and allowed to dip in the middle, you put a tennis ball in the middle and roll the marble around it, even if you roll it really fast, the marble's path will be slightly bent (try making it travel straight with PK!)
<br />

<br />
What you really need is to make a psiball which acts like the gravity-gun in Half-Life 2.

			i understand that light is bent by gravity but electro-magnetism is what makes gravity and holds everything together.

			guengo its impossiple to bend light..... u just cant the most theyve gotten was making it speed up slow down or go backwards not bend.
<br />
but i think i can make lightbulbs dim but only by accident all of a sudden theyll just dim but i live in an old house sooo.well i hope u figure out how

			Why bend light there is no purpose and light is not an actual substance that can be contained it is either there or not... also what would you use that skill for making some sort of night light?
