			So, my friends and I were running around the town in the wee hours of the morning. We were in a wooded area right next to this orphanage and we decided &quot;Hey, let's make a psi-ball!&quot; We were standing right next to this like, hole, with some random things in it. My friend, Mike, and I start up. It's a small one, but after like 5 minutes it's roughly the size of a 30&quot;...I dunno, bass drum. This was sweet progress for us, cause that was around when we first started doing any of this. At that point, it was a noticably warmer inside the psi-ball and it was pulling our hands in. It was pretty sweet.
<br />

<br />
But that was a while ago. Has anybody made any really big psi-balls?

			You could probably intensify the heat and other effects of the psi ball if you compressed it.
<br />
I personally haven't made any particularly large or concentrated psi balls...
<br />
But then again, I haven't had many friends to help me make them, either. Most of my research is done solo.

			I had a long saracastic rant in my head, but whatever. Just ask them some non offending questions: &quot;What do you think of the paranormal?&quot; is a nice opener. Like, if they're REAL friends it shouldn't bother them and if it does, and they fuck off, meh. Over 6 billion people in this world, I'm not too worried.
<br />

<br />
But just start off small and innocent and progress to psi to get an idea of what their opinion is on this area. You don't even have to tell them. Your life is your business.

			Ive only been able to do this once, but it seems like some people here have done the same thing. Way before I started psi, I was into chi mainly because I was in martial arts. So I guess you could say ive been making psi balls for bout 7 or 8 years. Well long story short, Ive burnt my hands on psi balls and have also broken things. Never tried to max out size. Hmmm maybe I should try....
