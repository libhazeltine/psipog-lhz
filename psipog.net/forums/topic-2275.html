			How many of you practice psionics until failure ? To be clear, I don't mean &quot;OMG I feel like my head's going to explode because I've trained too hard&quot; failure. I just mean failure to the point when you can no longer move the resistance, recieve information, ect. 
<br />

When you reach failure, do you stop training for the day or do you rest for a few minutes and go back at it again ?

If you train until failure, how often ?

			If you strain yourself, it's really not a healthy thing for psionics. Don't practice hard, let go, relax, personally don't practice past 30 minutes of PK or whatever (per day) until you feel you are strong enough to take on a longer period of time.

Pardon me, but that's crap. It's also the fastest way to burn out. Been there, done that. Starting to recover. Don't teach people things that could harm them, or at least let them know that it could happen.

			Ever stretched until you pulled a muscle? did so many situps until you couldn't do them anymore; Sure you did alot, but you're so friggin sore for the next week.. It's all the same when it comes to your mental muscle ^_^ don't strain yourself, hardcore training may seem nice but your mind isn't something we can do that to. Personally, the mind should be relaxed, free, but focused on one thing.  Maybe a few years down the road your mind will become used to training everyday for those 30 minutes or so, and it has the endurance for another 30 minutes, and so forth, but don't expect good results from 6 hour psi training.

Its really a bad idea for the above reasons, in most cases the gain does not outweigh the risk of permanent damage.

Then again, if psionics is anything like physical training, if you don't strain yourself you make no gain. If you can run a mile in 8 minutes comfortably, and then keep running the mile in 8 minutes, don't expect any further results, because you aren't straining yourself. Likewise, if spinning the psiwheel for 10 seconds at a time for 5 minutes is your current no-sweat comfort area, then expect no gains if you continue to do the same routine for months. Move on to something more difficult.
<br />

<br />
However, as in physical training, injury can and will result if you overstrain yourself. It's the difference between putting 5 more pounds than usual on the barbell and putting 25 more on.
<br />

<br />
Use common sense.

			well, I agree with all of most of the points on here.
<br />

<br />
Pushing yourself psionicly isn't bad, but going to far is.
<br />

<br />
It's like pushing yourself to run a mile, by the time you've done a mile, you feel like shit, but if you went to run 5 miles and you can't even handle 1 mile, then you would die. But, if you do it right, a mile a day, eventually you can do 2 miles a day, then 3...ect., without getting yourself killed.
<br />

<br />
What I'm saying, Psionics needs logic and commen sense if you are going to be good at it, if you just going all &quot;Hardcore&quot; you'll kill yourself or injure yourself mentally..possibly physically and if you are all prissy about it and take it easy, it'll be a slow process in getting better, but the chances of you hurting yourself is low.
<br />

<br />
now, there are other things to help with mental power, then psionics. Reading, memory training, anything that makes you think.

by going &quot;hardcore&quot; i achieved what would have taken me ages in such a short time. after i gain what i want, i go on a month or 2 chill period, where i get comfortable at that level. then do harcore....
<br />

<br />
basically, after 5 odd hours it starts to strain, therefore i stop.
<br />

<br />
yes, it may seem unorthodox, but its kinda routine now.

			Like said above, that is a bad idea. Also not only could you hurt yourself but its just not useful. Continuing to do somthing after you're already exahusted isn't helping you get better at psionics. Psionics isn't somthing that you can force to get better fast, it takes lots of time to learn.
