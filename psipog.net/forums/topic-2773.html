It's not easy... this won't be something some technique will fix ( idon't work with shields.. if i do it's purely incedental, or i call them something else)... dealing with a constant flow of depression is something I've had to do myself... It has effects on you just from being around it... let alone being empathic and caring even more about the fealings you're recieving... I've found if I redirect the energy recieved into something positive it can help... for example... writing... painting... any artistic outlet... any time you can go outside and breathe in fresh air take advantage of it... you'll find natural healers in the outside world.. the sun.. sky... grass... you can be healed just by being around them....  You could try seeing both of you from outside yourself... try visualizing her and the emmotion comming torward you... now see yourself and the emmotions you'll allow yourself to recieve... you don't have to receive the emmotions she's sending if you see both of you from a third view prospective ( but still be aware of yourself and everything around you too)... know what you want to feel... know what you are inside... and don't allow unwanted emmotions to deconstruct you... Try some good reading material.. anything that has to do with recognizing your inner power... healing begins from the inside out ... and it sounds like you might want to focus on healing and protection practices... this is all I can offer for now... Stay strong.. through our struggles we are made... it is through our struggles we live... ~Peace to all~

			Shield.  (Anything that blocks incoming signals would be classified as a shield.)
<br />

<br />
As an empath, I have found shielding more than crucial in being able to function normally.  Now, as an empath, I like to 'know/feel' what's going on around me.  This can result in a conflict of instructions for the subconscious.  The way I personally work around this is to create a shield using imagery that is strong and stable, yet still allows me to 'see/feel' through if I decide to (similar to looking out a window - you can look if you want to, but you don't have to).  The imagery that works for me will be different from what imagery works for others, so experiement and see what works best for you.  I spent about a week or two trying different imagery and/or instructions each day to find one that was consistent.
<br />

<br />
For example, soulofstrings uses this imagery.  While this seems odd to me and therfore would not be effective for me, since s/he suggested it, I'm guessing that it works for them as a protection.  Therefore, more power to them.
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody"> You could try seeing both of you from outside yourself... try visualizing her and the emmotion comming torward you... now see yourself and the emmotions you'll allow yourself to recieve... you don't have to receive the emmotions she's sending if you see both of you from a third view prospective ( but still be aware of yourself and everything around you too)... know what you want to feel... know what you are inside... and don't allow unwanted emmotions to deconstruct you... 
<br />
</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
One of the bits included in the instructions for my subconscious is a 'reminder' that I can be more effective at helping those around me if I am able to clearly see what is going on, rather than having everything clouded by other people's emotions.  When I do want to feel more of what they are feeling, I reach out and just feel a bit, then re-block.  A word of caution with this!  I have had to mentally break a more than passing connection, because often it's not just me reaching towards them.  They can be reaching towards me too. This can set up a stronger connection than you might expect.
<br />

<br />
Something else that might help in your particular circumstance is to 'create' a statue of yourself using psi.  I have used this successfully when someone was upset at me.  I put a little construct of psi outside my window and added a layer of shielding that hid me (Rainsong talks about this in her article).  I was surprised at how well it worked.  This might help as your mum might be finding comfort by your presence.  While this is a good thing generally, any good thing can be taken to an extreme.  If she has a 'construct you' around, perhaps that will ease the pressure from the 'non-construct you'.
<br />

<br />
If you need additional help or ideas with shielding, I encourage you to read some of the articles in the rest of the site (<a href="../articles.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">cat-shields.html</a>).
<br />

<br />
Good luck, and best wishes to your mum.

Adjusting someone else's field is NOT something to do lightly or without training.
<br />

<br />
I strongly suggest leaving your mum's field alone at this point.  Besides being considered an attack unless your mum knows about it, it might do more harm than good to attempt to remove you from her field in regards to the depression itself.
<br />

<br />
Adjusting a connectin/link is one thing (almost all parents and children have links to each other and like all bits of life, they need adjustments), but adjusting someone else's field is something else entirely.  Depending on the situation and severity of the depression, intrepidus6's mum might feel like s/he's abandoned her if that removal was done.  Even lessening a link might do that to a point, but that is far less traumatic than actual field adjustments.

			Don?t overestimate the simplicity of it.  For a beginner the most they could figure out would be to ground then say

As I breath in all of my energy in mom's aura is returning to my aura
<br />

<br />
As I breathe out all of moms energy in me returns to her

I would recommend this to people without training.  Recycling energy is a natural safe part of life, however many parents have trouble letting go.

I would like to use the sheild you described that was sort of like a &quot;window&quot;.  However, I have never tried working with constructs before.  Exactly how do you make this kind of shield?

			I just put together a shield, and it seems to be working fair.  The odd thing is that it seems like there is this force trying to penetrait it... almost like my mum is porpusly trying to send out negative feelings... but she dosen't belive in psi, so it would have to be sub-counsince.
