Back to queir_weir; If you're going to try it or practice, go for it! It's never been done before, so there's always a first for everything. But since it's never been done before, I can only guess and make suggestions as to where to start, but then it's up to you to test them. I would say the prequisites would be; The ability for everyone participating to establish connection without difficulty and maintain it with easily. The main thing I think would be to take it easy at first, meaning extremely low amounts of energy transfer, depending on how many people are doing it. Safety is paramount. Try having the most adept out the group be the so-called channeler (Most control over psi, conentration, focus, etc). But remember to take it slow and easy. The main thing is to experiment around and see what works and what doesn't, record it, go over it, and study it. But do so safely and don't overdo anything.

			Just use common sense. I mean just because you believe you can do it doesnt mean you can do it. Most people here can only move the psiwheel. We wouldnt be able to help in any noticable way. Why dont you just go over there and help with the cleanup if your so interested in helping? My business is willing to fly me down there and pay me more to help with the cleanup, and im thinking about it. Try to find out ways to help besides practicing psionics for a couple years.

			Ahh what ever Apollo sry for my rude comment.  Yah your more relistic and i knew that but, i just wanted i guess, positive suggestions i guess lol.  Neveza right it is different to control weather than it is to control psi, but it can be done, or at least on a small scale.  You just have to use the psi to control the weather.

Oh, of course, It's so realistic, How can I be such a fool on how you ,of all people, know the mighty truth of what is harder or more advance.
<br />

<br />
It's not truth, you're just using logic, logic can fail at times. You don't know if making a psiball is harder then controlling weather, unless you know the mechanics of psi or how psychokinesis works. Therefore it's not realistic idea.

			yes well i will definatly be carefull when practicing.  And unfortunatly i do not have the resourses to fly down and help so sorry.  Unfortunaly i will have to do most of it by my self becasue there is only one other psionic that i know in my area.  I also find that i am better at telepathy rather then telekenisis (which i think i would require to try this seriously).

you've failed once you don't believe. yes it would take a lot of work but what i think is the improbability is the fact that many just won't have enough willpower to get pass the magnitude of trying to stop a huricane. not that the hurricane is improbable to stop; it's starting the training thats improbable.

			i agree with you when you say monks reach meditation peaks. the monks that pop into my head immediately are buddhist or zen buddhist monks. 
<br />

<br />
a zen buddhist monk wouldn't try to effect nature in supernatural ways depending on how the situation is built. since he's mastered meditation he's most likely mastered the ideology of zen buddhism, which would not necessarily call for helping others in that sort of way. I say again it does depend on how the situation is built.
<br />

<br />
Tibetan Buddhists or Mahayanna buddhists I can see doing something like that, but (i say again) since they've master mediation they've also mastered their ideologies and those ideologies say they must be humble. So lets say they do stop a hurricane, they wouldn't tell anyone because to them that would be considered braggin, aka not being humble. 
<br />

<br />
I don't think you'd be able to google and find an answer since they probably know that telling someone outside of their community, that person would not believe them. (when i say outside of their community I mean those who don't understand their way of life and/or live a way of life that is near or completely opposite to theirs and would not be able to graps this kind of achievement and truly believe it occured)
