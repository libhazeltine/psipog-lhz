			Ok, I have a rant on what i think psionics might be.  Please read the whole thing before responding.
<br />

<br />
While I was in chemistry, the conversation about psi came up.  No, not the manipulation of things like we do.  Here is the definition that was given:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Definition:  The amplitude or height of an electon wave at various points in space.&quot;
<br />

<br />
When people create a psiball, they say if feels like one of two things.  Either it is hot or it feels like a magnetic push. 
<br />

<br />
Heat:
<br />

<br />
Lone electrons move quickly around in space.  When atoms are moving quickly, they warm up.  Hence the heat.
<br />

<br />
Pressure:
<br />

<br />
Electrons have a negative charge.  When they move around in the air in your hands, you would feel the magnetic push from electron against electron.  Ta da.
<br />

<br />
PK:
<br />

<br />
You visualize the psi hitting the object and the object moves in the opposite direction.  The electrons pushing off one another to create a negative-negative force.  Therefore pushing it.
<br />

<br />
Telepathy:
<br />

<br />
A completely different force tyed in with remote viewing.  Some way to retrieve information.
<br />

<br />

			Okay first off....There are lots of things you could compare psi to, because it could be a number of things. Secondly in all your theories, you omit the fact that any other particles exist. You are assuming that the psi you are pooling into your hands has an overall negative charge. Until you can prove this, or prove that psi even contains electrons, you have no basis for your theory. Then thirdly. You are trying to make it like Psi is its own energy, but yet is still made of Electrons...a physical particle. This would in turn make it a form of matter, rather than energy.

			Well I think the theory is not bad, but it donest really explain where the source of energy came from charge the electrons.
<br />

<br />
I think of my own thoughts of psi when reading it. I thought about that &quot;negative&quot; word you used. Tachyon paritlces are all about the &quot;negative&quot; of cource...that be silly to think the two are alike see the photon are both postive and negative. But its rather a nice theory, unlike all other theories this one is rather simple, WHICH IS GRAND! Einstein tried to make things simple while makeing the speical theory of relativily. 
<br />

<br />
Of cource general relativity tend to bend a long way from that....
<br />

Wonderful theory Apollo, there is a gift within you yet.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

It's a very interesting theory Apollo. It would explain some of the bodily sensations created from psi, but so far I see two flaws (they're at least flaws in my opinion) in your reasoning. Judging from what you posted, you're implying that the cold feeling that is sometimes produced (my psi normally feels like this) is caused by electrons slowing down, but wouldn't that mean you'd be lowering your body temperature to dangerously low levels? When I produce psi it feels like icy water coursing through my veins. Now, if the temperatures were ACTUALLY that low I'd probably die from hypothermia very quickly. The same goes for psi that feels hot. I can feel hot psi too, but it usually requires me to visualize another kind of energy. This part is interesting: sometimes my subconscious seems to confuse the two &quot;kinds&quot; of psi and it can alternate (the cold psi is the most dominate and usually takes over during hot psi visualization) almost instantly. So if my body temperatures were actually changing that fast I don't think the outcome would be so good not to mention this means that the electrons would be doing a lot of work! All I'm saying is that your explanation seems a bit out of place in these scenarios. If you'd like my opinion on why I think psi can feel the way(s) it does, here it is: I think its just a programmed sensory response from the subconscious. On to the second flaw in your reasoning. (The following was mentioned but I'd like to go into more detail and provide my theory) The second flaw is the fact that you're basically saying that psi is moving electrons. In theory, that would mean that if you somehow slowed down electricity you'd get, guess what, psi <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. And it would mean that if you were to absorb psi you'd be taking electrons from other atoms (unless electrons just float through the air and go about their own business; not sure about that one actually <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />) producing ions (you might just be able to create a mini thunder storm if the ions line up correctly <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />). Now wouldn't all that be a little strange? I don't believe that psi could be electrons, or at least not AT FIRST. If psi consists of electrons at any time it would have to be because it was just raw energy (simple vibrations; so simple and small that they make up matter and subatomic particles) that is aligned and condensed enough to form electrons capable of producing psi phenomena. But my own theory is that psi is just raw energy that probably adopts some kind of form, wavelength or density (probably density) to produce psi associated phenomena. But that's just my little theory. With current technology we probably couldn't prove what it really is. But I don't think we should be worrying about what it really is. I think we should be worrying about what we can do with it; and we should be grateful for it too. 
<br />

<br />
NOTE: Some of my scientific &quot;support&quot; may be wrong because I'm just GUESSING those things would happen based off of what I've learned from books, chemistry, physics, and other related science classes I've ever taken. If my &quot;scientific reasoning&quot; is wrong please let me know.
<br />

<br />
P.S.  It's a nice theory Apollo. I just hope my theories and explanations make sense to you.

			A few serious issues with your theory...
<br />

<br />
How are you ripping electrons from yourself or your surroundings to use as &quot;psi&quot;?  You'd literally be Plasma-Man (dun dun da dun!!) is a world of plasma and so somehow, without the use of the very mechanism you call psi, you're using Megajoules of energy in a sun-like reaction on the world around you.  Sounds unlikely.
<br />

<br />
Second, how are you not getting electricuted then?  Your description of psi is exactly the description of electricity (measured in voltage and amperes).  Now those huge transformer lines that they have in the countryside that are conducting a TON of electricity, how are they not pushing cars off the bloody highway with their sheer magnetism since you claim a handful of electrons not high energy enough to even spark are able to push your hands around.  Those power lines are also conducting <span style="font-weight: bold">moving</span> electrons which is key because magnetic fields are the result of electrons in motion as opposed to the electric fields they give off when they're static.  In your hands, electrons certainly around moving around that much or you'd be seeing a globe of lightning in your hands if you were using electrons.
<br />

<br />
Thirdly and finally, my issue is with heat.  Electrons moving no matter how quickly don't produce much heat.  They're tiny particles!  It's when a tidal wave of electrons hit much larger particles that you get heating and burning of objects.  This is why wires and other things that have a current passed through them warm up, not because of inherent heat in the electrons but the friction of tons of electrons hitting particles in the conductor.

Yeah, I agree...But, like someone said before me (don't feel like finding out whom) psi can be compared to just about anything.  It's good to see that you are thinking, and creating links between psi and other known forms of matter.  And you know, if that theory was correct, telepathy could be viewed as the broadcasting of radio waves from your 'mind' (which we still don't know what the mind is).  These waves could somehow generate sound, much like a radio tower.  But I'm sure that if that was the case, we would radioactivate our heads, and fry our brains.  It's nice to see you're thinking though <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

heat cannot be made on their own. they must have some other substance to create heat. such as fire, it needs fuel like oil to continue burning. if your thinking of rubbing your hands together to create heat, that is simply synthesizing what happens for example when one end of a metal rod &quot;heats up&quot;, then the motion of the atoms of the metal rod moves up the rod. your just making the atoms of your hand vibrate with eachother faster and faster causing heat. and because there are close-by atoms, this means that they all stay in place, with nowhere to go, creating small vibrations. but if they are alone, they cannot vibrate, they can only move in a single direction. which makes them lose their possibility of generating heat.
<br />

<br />
pressure: your theory is incorrect, pressure is actually in this sense more of a build-up of compounds (oxygen, and other stuff in our atmosphere) which causes the area in your hands to become denser, and as you place your hand into this denser area, you feel a force pressing against you because your hand has to force its way through this dense air.

Theorist's Theory on psi:
<br />

<br />
actually, i took qi for granted and did not bother to &quot;design&quot; a theory for it.....
<br />

<br />
hmm, lets see.... qi is a form of energy that can be easily modified by organisms but not objects...... so.... qi is a bionic energy...
<br />

<br />
also, qi can be modified to produce any and every different kind of reaction desired.... so... qi is a highly modal form of bionic energy
<br />

<br />
eh.... thats about it.... but i dont think that is falls under photons, gluons, x-y-z- particles, or gravition.... so it has to have a different carrier other than the proven 4.... lets call it qi
<br />

<br />
so.... qi is a highy modal form of bionic energy with &quot;qi&quot; as its energy carrier....
<br />

<br />
tada! 
<br />

<br />

<br />
would someone debug it for me? appreciated
