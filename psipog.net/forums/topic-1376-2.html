Thing is, they're not your thoughts, so how do you control them? Shielding seems like the logical answer.

			Look at it this way, you are strengthening your ability to create shields by making them strong enough to block overloads. So isn't that mental strength? Using your mind to make the shield strong enough would also help improve your ability to shield, making you stronger.

			The more you do it, the better you get at it. I do it often. I'm good at it. If you shield from it, you don't get to build up tollerance to it, it's like a firewall, sure they protect you, but they are a pain in the ass. Why not just have a computer that eats viruses?

			Not at all. It doesn't reduce sensitivity. It increases control in your mind over what effects you. I can block it out willfully, and then I can open myself up with ease. I don't have to shield at all. Although I do relize I should, because large groups of people does overload me a bit too much sometimes, I don't subject myself to large crowds enough for it to become a problem.

			Scorch, you should know that you are deliberately antagonizing the extremely sensitive empaths here.  By definition, overload is a set of empathic sensations that have <span style="font-style: italic">overwhelmed your personal emotions</span> to the point that you are no longer &quot;in control&quot;.  If you are in the middle of an overload, it's not like you can just decide to &quot;crush it&quot; with your manly mentality.
<br />

<br />
I doubt you've impressed anyone, and your advice does little to help someone who is dealing with excessive sensitivity.  As far as deliberately subjecting yourself to overloads to build up tolerance?  I would suggest that your definition of &quot;overload&quot; is flawed.  Leaving your shields down in smaller groups is a way to practice automatically reinforcing your own emotional stability... but overloading the way I have experienced it can be little more than a learning experience, and then only if you've never had it before.
<br />

<br />
Beating your children to make them tougher doesn't make them any safer.  Teach them judo.
<br />

<br />
I've had empathic overloads that brought me close to blacking out.  I learned to focus on one specific emotion and impersonalize it, which helps for emotions.  Pretend you are a therapist talking to yourself, asking why you feel this way, etc.  Part of escaping an overload can be seperating the foreign emotions from your own concious thought.
<br />

<br />
However, I've also received physical pain from other individuals I was close to.  Excruciating stomach pains (she had an ulcer) or crippling sensitivity in my knee joints (he had just injured his playing tennis) are probably beyond what you have experienced Scorch, if I may judge by your proclamations of &quot;off and on&quot; practice and chatroom involvement.  Some people don't have the ability to keep themselves out of large groups (school cafeterias can even present an issue for some of us) so your suggestions are really quite irrelevant.  Please try and be considerate of the inquirer when answering a question.  &quot;Shielding is for bitches&quot; isn't a constructive comment.
<br />

<br />
Why don't we all get together and stab ourselves in non-vital areas, just so we can handle wounds from a knife-fight on the street sometime... sounds like a good idea, eh?

			Just because you can mentally block out the pain, doesnt mean it isnt still doing damage. Even if you were actually doing something useful.. like constantly grounding out the excess input, the truth is, the input is still going through you.

			Loud cough. Settle down class. Overloads happen because you let them happen. Some cases dig so deep into negativity that the only way to crawl up from the ashes is to fight feelings with programming. Calm down because a few sentences are enough to find a foot hole. 
<br />
ie
<br />
 destruction diffuse recycle energy calm confidences 
<br />

<br />
This would be said every time an overload happened.  
<br />

<br />
Advance advice would be to program invincibility from (sounds/ideas) into your (shield/mind). To do that figure out what invisible feels like then apply that to feelings. Makes me feel like im walking through hell with a smile.

			Overloads don't happen because people let them, overloads happen because people don't shield, or they have a crap shield, or they're just extremely sensitive and can't maintain enough shields to block overload.
