I ask because I remember reading somewhere that overextending yourself could cause death. I figured cause of death would be for stupid reason like not being smart about, say for example, phasing and they were just being totally stupid didn't know what they were getting themselves into and phased into a wall and died or something. 
<br />

<br />
I know there have been incidents where people spontaneously combust and die. Why they caught on fire was never officially explained by the fire department because they had no idea how it happened. I figured it would be not being smart when dabbling into pyrokinesis.
<br />

<br />
I'm talking about incidents like that where the cause of death was unexplainable and strange.

Nina Kulagina died because psychic energy is taxing on the nervous system. That's why you see naturals in history later in life catching sickness and certain diseases. 
<br />

<br />
Let me explain. Your nervous system has two things that it needs. Sodium, and potassium. According to russia psi is &quot;Bio-plasma&quot; that is emitted from your nervous system. When used it uses up alot of sodium and potassium. Which is the key ingredient for sending messages throughout your nervous system. Over a period of time the use of psychic energy will tax your nervous systsem so much you will catch those diseases <span style="font-weight: bold">WHICH ARE ALL SYMPTOMS AND EFFECTS OF NERVOUS SYSTEM DEFINCICIES.</span>
<br />

<br />
How do you combat this?
<br />

<br />
Eat more salt than normal people do, eat more potassium than normal people do. Although I don't say do that now, for I'm not a doctor and I cannot tell you what to do and eat. If any of you ever get so powerful that starts happening to you. Know that a change and diet cna solve the problem easily and quickly.

The fact is no one is sure of what psi is. It is not a scientific fact. no one knows what it is or what it does exactly. It is stupid to speculate on whether or not nina kulagina was killed by over training of psionics. especially because she did have a past history of health problems.

Like honorable_psion said, we have no idea what psi is, we just have guesses..   It's way too early to speculate on what health effects practicing Psionics will have, if any; let alone give it a specific cause.
<br />

<br />
If she had a history of health problems, ten to one she died of causes not related to psi.

			well if she had natural psi abilities, then going along with telepath, it makes sense in Nina's case. 
<br />

<br />
It kind of surprises me how people have found how psi affecs the nervous system. I'm skeptical and I want to research the Russian experiments before I go either way on the issue. Scientists have been known to muffle the results of experiments because the results make them look stupid because of their hypothesis. I'm not saying all scientists do that and all experiments have been fudged, but I have a bio professor that has been in the science field for a very long time and has seen scientists do that, so I don't take everything for what it is. I like to research first.

			I don't buy the whole &quot;nobody knows what psi is&quot; paradigm that peebrain spreads.  For science and metaphysics to me are just paradigms that explain something from different view points. If science can't explain it yet that means their paradigm is making it invisible to them until they get enough information and not that people don't know about it.
<br />

<br />
That is because I believe power brings about truth. Sure you can read books all day about religion but if you gain the power to see ghosts and ascend to the 7th level of the astral plane your power will answer your own questions. You can research the maysons all day or you could become a powerful business man and the answers will come to you. One can research the truths of the universe all they want or they could reach enlightenment and instantly know it. The more powerful you become, the more truths become obvious. A psion must have existed in time thta was so powerful with godly aura vision, supreme telepathy, and powerful pk. From such a being, the workings of psi would become obvious due to his ability to observe and see and his past experiences.
<br />

<br />
To say taht nobody knows what psi is just because theirs no moderation of it is to underestimate human intelligence in the past. 
<br />

<br />
Even now, their are beings that exist who &quot;know what psi&quot; is that exist beyond our grasps and communication. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
But that's just how I see the situation, no need to argue about it. I get your point anyway. But if you read keith miller's book you'd have the same attitude as I do. He explained it quite well.

			I understand what you are saying and going by that, I guess no one on psipog is advanced enough to come to know what psi is.
<br />

<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if there were people who do know what psi is, but answer me this, why wouldn't they just tell us what psi is then? So, in the end since they don't tell us (or at least on a grand scale) psi is much more complex than what it seems to be. What I mean is, there might be people that don't want others to know what psi is because of some sort of complex 'conspiracy-like' reason. 
<br />

<br />
I know that's kind of extreme, but that's what it appears to be for me. It seems this whole psi subject in general is secretive and it feels like some sort of cover-up. I know I don't have any evidence to back up my case, but that's just what it seems like if you look at it face value.

Not extreme at all. Ignorance is one of the many keys to control. 
<br />

<br />
You have to understand how power works. For example lets take thie hierachy of this forum for example. We are all relatively low level telepaths. Because of the 80/20 rule, only 20 percent of us is really gonna take this seriously and even a lower percentage of that is gonna reach a certain level of height.
<br />

<br />
But once that level is reached one no longer needs to reside at this site.
<br />

<br />
So either three things happen.
<br />

<br />
They leave this site for good and go out and use thier powers to do as they please. 
<br />
Leave this site caues it cna no longer teach them anything and do independent study.
<br />
Or they stick around to teach us all (peebrian, JoeT, annie).
<br />

<br />
That's because this community is not set up for super high level psychics. Because setting a community like that is hard cause the numbers are so low. 
<br />

<br />
In such a way, this site maintains balance.
<br />

<br />
The same thing with lucid dreaming. I know for a fact htat i stop going to dreamviews.com once lucid dreams become habitual. 
<br />

<br />
These high level people know that guidance is unneccessary because those who deserve the power shall attain it. That's how the system works.
