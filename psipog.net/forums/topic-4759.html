			In Kabbalah we are taught that the purpose of existance is to elevate the physical to the level of the spiritual by bringing the spiritual into the physical.  All things that you do are supposed to be spiritual actions in a physical world.
<br />

<br />
One of the ways that are important is in eating.  It is very important that you feed yourself well and feed yourself at all levels.  The best way of feeding yourself deeply is by elevating the food that you eat.
<br />

<br />
I know you people don't like talking about G-D, but He is the Grandest Spiritual Concept and so it puzzles me that you are not willing to discuss Him.  But anyways, the way we elevate our food is by saying a blessing in HaSheM's Name with special intentions.  Basically what it does is bring the light of HaSheM into the food (supercharging it with the highest energy).  which does three things.
<br />

<br />
First thing is it starts breaking down the food, making it easier to digest because it is started before it even gets into your mouth.  The second thing is that it lets you eat energy too.  You can sustain your energy body in other ways, but imbuing your food helps to energize you deeply because while you digest your food your body is already in energizing mode and so it is more ready to accept the energizing food.  The third thing is that it makes it so you get more full on less food.  Because the energy also elevates the nourishing potential of your food by nourishing higher parts more directly, you can eat less while being fed more.
<br />

<br />
So, how do you do it?  Like any meditation there are three steps:  First is getting into the heighened state, second is performing the actions and third is coming back down.  In our tradition the first and third are done through prayer.  The first prayer has the intent of calling down the blessing of HaSheM (aka - bringing down light from the highest source and imbuing the food with that light) and the last prayer has the intent of thanking HaSheM and attaching the light in you to Him, giving a purpose to the energy you are digesting, refining it more.
<br />

<br />
The second step is easy.  Just eat.  It helps if you pay attention to your eating and try to enjoy your food because that opens up your spirit to accept the energy.
<br />

<br />
And that's it!  Enjoy and eat well.
