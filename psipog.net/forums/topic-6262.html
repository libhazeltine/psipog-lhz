			i am unsure where to put this but in the past months actually a month past my birthday it seems as if my hands have a weight on them like a constant psiball but i am unsure what it is? and i have been practicing psionics on and off for about a year now but no major changes but when i first turned 16 ( a year ago ) i had a feeling that something weird was going to happen and now that i am 17 i have this weird energy pressure on my hands do you know what i might be or what it might be from or has any one have the same problem. and it is not a time to time think its a constant thing

			Energy blockage. At some point everyone (only psions) goes through this. I got over mine by forcing the energy out of my hands, which was not a good idea because my hands bled from time to time. Now they're healed and I can control my energy very well. I'm able to improve my skills whenever I have time.

<br />

<br />
or maybe a big psi blast ?

Not me. I don't understand what's this energy blocking that these people have talked about it.

Your hands bled from pushing energy out of them? I smell fluffiness. Why do you say only psions? Everyone's a &quot;psion&quot;. We're not some special breed.

			I've actually heard of hands bleeding or callacing(sp?) from psi, although the one time was from some one who claims to fight psions with the abilities of God on a daily basis to the brink of death...and he's serious, as in needs to be institutionalized serious...

My definition of a psion is someone who practices psi. And the bleeding thing, Mabye I'm a hemophiliac. My hands did bleed though. And every other psi praticer I've known had a problem with blockage. Blockage is really mental thing. Your hands are not really blocked off (though to some people its easier to percieve it that way). The doubt in your mind blocks your ability.

so its like a sudden weakness in psi ability? sort of a numbness is psi? i'd say too much or too little training/practicing....... your mind is getting stressed! relax! lol.....
<br />

<br />
if it is such a blockage, why would pumping huge amounts of psi to the area help in clearing it?? :S
