			First of, I'm glad you're here to read my new, and first thread.
<br />
My name is Alex, I got to this forum when I searched the net for PK. And boy, am I glad I did. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I want to share some thoughts with you. Now that I got to practice for some two weeks, not that I'm an immediate success or anything, in fact I'm pretty sure all I got going on is some wind, and some hallucinations... but I do believe. And maybe some of my fellow newbies, and even some of you vets and pros, would want to know what drives me on now.
<br />

<br />
It was this morning (it's now 23:25 Israel time) that I saw some PK movies. Got to tell you, I wanted to believe, but it was hard. And as we all know that movies aren't for making people believe, I didn't truly believe any of them. Until came up this link for a video, I can't remember who gave it so sorry I give no credit, of this Jack fellow, at <a href="http://www.freesailing.com" target="_blank">http://www.freesailing.com</a> .
<br />
As my conspiracy seeking head was coming to notice a pattern, which is every time the guy wants to levitate he brings the ball over a cretin area of the table. I came to the last video, and noticed, my theory just bites the dust, as he levitates far away from 'his spot'. That was what broke me (the song lyrics &quot;then I saw her face... now I'm a believer.&quot; coming from the back of my mind).
<br />

<br />
This got me thinking of none other then my great physics teacher who for the purpose of this thread we will call Dr. Mark. &quot;How'd he like that?&quot; I asked my self, thinking for the first time with no fear that PK is real, and then I remembered something he told us, when we were going threw the gravity chapter.
<br />
The conversation between Mark and our class tent to religion, one of the kids in class made a remark about the Jewish (for lack of a better word) fanatics, which spend all their life in prayer ? not working ? living off the government. Our teacher immediately stopped the discussion, got us all quiet, and told us a couple of things, first that under no circumstances should a person insult another person or group of people due to their beliefs.
<br />
The second thing he told us is that he would never, though he is a Dr. of physics, and studied all his life (he's close to 80), he will never defy god whiles there are things that mankind cannot explain.
<br />

<br />
That had a great effect on me then, and intensified now.
<br />
TRY UNTIL YOU SUCSEED.
<br />

<br />
Sorry I couldn't keep it short,
<br />
Hope you had the energy to read it all,
<br />

<br />
I will be happy to hear from you ? my newly acquired psionic friends.

idk anyone from Isreal! er wait no cousins' cousins live there.  Well I never talked to them...  So i'll count you as the first one!!
<br />

<br />
But welcome!!! This, in my opinion, is teh best Pk and psionics forum!!
<br />

What have you acheived, so far, &quot;hullucinations&quot; or not??

			Well rahmid, I can get the psiwheel spinning - and I can get a feeling of the psiwheel - a very strong feeling. Only it doesn't happen at the same time...
<br />
When I feal like I should be moving it. It looks at me as if I was pathetic?
<br />
and when it spins a bit, I don't think it's me spinning it- though the wind factor have been taken care of and I do not use my hands at all I just sit a couple of feet away..
<br />

<br />
When it's under a cover I'm hopeless... though some times I see just a little twig - then I dismiss it as a hallucination

<br />

<br />
Well, thats good so far!!  Read the Experiment by JoeT i think.  Idk It's a sticky at the top of this page.  I cant do it coverd.  Havent seriously tried many times.  maybe 5 or 6 times for only a short period.  And when you think you saw it move.  You probably did.  And even if it were a hallucination, some ppl try and go &quot;OHHH OHHH I DID IT LOOK&quot; and lie to ther sub-c to convince them that you can do it.  It may help.

hey, practice makes perfect. im onto rolling cans now(sort of), yay, but my point is: it took me 25 odd hours to actually get a continous spin on the psi-wheel... it just takes determination and i found out that if you really want it to spin, then it will. heres the method i use to teach people (over 25 success, only one not so sucessful) { they all managed to do it within 15 minutes ;-;}
<br />

<br />
place your right hand near the wheel, about 3 inches away. just one hand. now think of it in physics terms:
<br />

<br />
we have alot of bio-electric/magnetic fields all around our body. all we are doing is concentrating our field to affect another objects field, via electromagnetism (bores down to electtorns and atoms, bt not needed here)
<br />

<br />
now imagine you can see this energy field surrounding your body, and that you can see your field completely engulfind the wheel
<br />

<br />
now think that the field part that surrounds your hand starts rotating, as if you have a mini tornado in your hand... now visualize it making the wheel spin. you should have success rather quickly. if not keep trying!!! 
<br />

<br />
i think that looking at it from a wannabe scientific point of view helps beleif, it sure did for me!

your MO is nice, when i kind of think about it... I'll definitely give it a go.
<br />
your field theory makes me uneasy only about the doing PK from a distance.. cause fields have that tendency to fade at distance..
<br />

<br />
but that'll be cool enough for now...gonna try it out when my headache's gone.
<br />

<br />
i've got a heck of a cam... cannon S1 IS, when i'll get any good. i'll make a freaking documentary.

			A documentary on PK ppl would be....FREAKING....AMAZING!!!  And if it could be put on an accual movie theartors, like he little ones that Brokeback started out on.

			Hey, first off, WELCOME!!! About the glass thing, the glass doesn't matter. It just becomes a blocade for you mind. As Rahmid said, read the &quot;Experiment by JoeT&quot;. It's on the physcokinesis page. Its is very helpful.

Thats a nice technique. I'm gonna try that. I was wondering, do you close your eyes for that or you leave them open???

			@walla: when it comes to long distance you change your perception of the field. you can either extend a portion of the field or just increase the radius of it: i think of it that every time you use psi or anything of th sort, it flares the field. chargeyour body and the field will grow <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
@fury: erm the majority of the time i kinda go into a daydream like trance, where you can basically visualize it with your eyes open. usually i start off by getting a good look at the visualization in my head first, then open my eyes and do the visualization without the need to close them <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
