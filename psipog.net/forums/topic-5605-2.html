Supposing I wanted to send a square to Nightshade, I would just imagine Nightshade standing in front of me (whatever (s)he may look like doesn't matter) and then I would imagine lots and lots of squares flying out towards Nightshade.
<br />

<br />
So you can see, I haven't created a link out of psi or felt around for a psi-signature.  All I do is imagine the person there and send.  There is no feeling of being attatched to the other person in any way.
<br />

<br />
I doubt I'm a &quot;natural&quot; (as far as I know I've never accidentally picked up people's thoughts) although my receiving seems to be better than sending, but even so I'm not that good.  I had to practise to get it to work at all.  Does this help? <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Ok, that works.  When you were imaging me standing in front of you, that was all you needed to create a link.  The only time you need to find a signature, is if you can't create the link, or are having trouble creating one (I think, someone with more experience can reiterate).  So, I guess in some cases you don't need the sig...but from what I have been studying, you do.  I guess it works differently for different people.  I don't want to go into the guild's genetics theory, but it is possible that you, Woodpecker, are what they call a partial (that's what I think I am).  I will have to look it up again.  But that would explain your answer...If you need elaboration, feel free to PM me  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
