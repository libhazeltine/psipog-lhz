			I saw an infomercial about this weight loss program some weeks ago and was quite intrigued by it. I, as I'm sure you've all figured out, made this poll in order to find out whether anyone's tried and had success with this program because I can't be 100% sure that it works. I heard there is a money back guarantee, is this true? Anyway, here's a description for those who haven't heard of it:
<br />

<br />
They said that it's a diet program that figures out (through a series of dieting questions) what food(s) your body needs to ingest in order to lose weight rapidly and be able to keep it off by just eating that/those food(s). They said that you even have to eat MORE to make it work. That part is convincing because I heard that this technique tricks the metabolism into speeding up basically by scaring it. There are dozens of meal combinations listed that you can eat with the designated food(s). And there is an exercise part of the program too. They are chord tension exercises that supposedly target problem areas in the body. I think it said 20 minutes 3 days a week! Not much considering I used to spend close to an hour working out 5 or 6 days a week and thats without the cardiovascular workout. The people who supposedly succeeded at the program seemed somewhat convincing in authenticity since some cried. I can't be sure about that part so I prefer having faith in the scientific angle. I think the program costs about $150 now. They said it originally costed more than $1000 but made it cheaper so that &quot;every American can afford it&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Okay, now for the questions to those who have tried it (if there are any):
<br />

<br />

<br />
1. Did the program make you lose weight in just a few weeks?
<br />

<br />
2. Did you lose the amount of weight that you wanted to lose?
<br />

<br />
3. Did you end up looking pretty much like you wanted to?
<br />

<br />
4. Did you lose weight in the areas you intended to lose it in?
<br />

<br />
5. Did you even lose weight from this program?
<br />

<br />
6. Did your stomach get smaller?
<br />

<br />
7. Did you at least like the required food somewhat?
<br />

<br />
8. Were the food options (for your body type) so bad that you didn't even do the program?
<br />

<br />
9. As a customer, were you satisfied with this product overall?
<br />

<br />

<br />
I would be most grateful if anyone who may have tried the program could answer those questions.

			It's like all the other diets coming out every week. It will work for some and not for others and the people on the infomercial are the ones it worked best for and/or are &quot;good&quot; actors. If you worked out in the past and know anything about it, you must know everyone's body responds differently to exercise/diets.
<br />

<br />
P.S Eating too much will not necassarily speed your metabolism (If at all). I <span style="font-style: italic">think</span> the amount of food you eat <span style="font-style: italic">may</span> not have <span style="font-style: italic">anything</span> to do with your metabolism. It's the amount of cardiovascular fitness you've attained and also muscle mass/type, in comparison with your % of body fat, which determines your metabolism. Fat people=result of eating too much. Even &quot;healthy&quot; foods aren't good for you in too much quantity.

			It's actually your eating pattern. If you eat regular meals whenever you are hungry then you don't get fat. If you only eat one huge dinner a day you will get fat.

Not true. If it was, I'd be 500 lbs (I'm 150). 
<br />

<br />
However, metabolism rate is a taught response that may be flucuated by various dietary methods. ~Wiki
<br />

<br />
So I was previously incorrect, although, muscle mass/type still have a large affect on metabolism. I'm becoming a police officer and learned about it in health class just last week.

			Damn it. I was hoping somebody tried it <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />. I appreciate the info. you both provided, but the only reason that I want to try this thing out is because of the fact that my attempts with diet and exercise in the past have failed. There was always a stabilizing point where my body just refused to shed any more pounds. Or perhaps I would just lose weight incredibly slowly and it would take many months maybe close to a year. Do either of you know anything about that? Anyway, if there is a money back guarantee with no loop holes I will try it. And perhaps I will be one of the people that it works for. Although, this diet plan is supposedly layed out with so many options that it does work for EVERYBODY. It may actually be based off of that body fat-muscle ratio that derricktheone was talking about but I'm not sure.
