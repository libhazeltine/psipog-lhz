			Yes, it could.

I will make another post explaining why when I have the time.
<br />

<br />
Edit:  OK TinMan, removing someone’s memory of something such as a phone number may seem trivial and without too large consequences, but research into how the brain accesses memories and on the effects of amnesia has shown that this may not be the case.
<br />

<br />
I don’t want to go into it all in super detail, but, recent research suggests that the brain mainly accesses memories through links with other memories, and that once the brain has developed to a certain level, new memories can only be accessed through links with pre existing ones.  Now the part that relates more to my point.  Research with amnesia victims has shown that if single memories can be restored through various therapy, it can lead to a cascade of various memories returning to the patient (I’ll search for the URL that shows the results for this experiment and post it later if anyone wants to see it).
<br />

<br />
Considering this, if someone were to erase a part of someone’s memories, they could potentially also remove that persons ability to access a number of other memories as well, which could possibly lead to changes in behaviour and personality (effects I think I should note are often observed in victims of even mild amnesia).
<br />

<br />
I hope this makes sense, as I typed it quite quickly, and that it better backs up my point.

Yes, I've experienced it. And it's only gonna get a lot bigger! Like when erase a whole event (I've found that giving the person an extremely small amount of an alcholic beverage helps amplify the effect) your hand will grow cold and your head is gonna feel as if it got a weak prolonged static shock from the carpet or something. 
<br />

<br />
No theory on what it is. Not enough people willing to do or try it to have conversations about it. I still can think normally so I just chalk it up to a side effect and move on with my life.

<span style="font-weight: bold">TINMAN</span> What you said  = theory. 
<br />

<br />
Reality = It's extremely hard to erase even small memories using telepathy, and even when you do your sure as hell aint' gonna get nothing extra. 
<br />

<br />
Science doesn't have to tell su that you cure an amnesia patient by trying to get him to remember small thinks but reminding him of that! That's been happening since the beginning of time.
