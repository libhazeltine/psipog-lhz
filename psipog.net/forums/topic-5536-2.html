			Well, psipog, wasn't very lively anyway...
<br />

<br />
BUT IT'S THE BEST PSI-SITE THERE IS!
<br />

<br />
There's no other site like it! Everything else is either too whitelight or too dumb! Psipog restricts everething to reason, which is the reason I joined.
<br />

<br />
Although it does seem like some sort of conspiracy... either that or Sean was never truthful with the skeptic rants (he's archiving psipog because of some sort of religious belief?). I say we should create a comunity for the remaining members of psipog, and wait patiently 'till someone re-opens psipog  or creates a site like some sort of psipog II.
<br />

<br />
Maybe I'm wrong about the religious belief but you get my point about contradictory points of veiw, right?
<br />

<br />
It's okay if he wants to go on but... what about those following him? Shall we just harshly change too? Shall we just search for a better (unexistant) page? Shall we keep our hopes up? Shall we just continue psipog uner another name? 
<br />

<br />
I mean, we're an organization! Why should we just fall apart when the webmaster decides to go away? Still, it nearly died away when he started flying lessons... <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			Because it seems that stupid people will always be stupid, maybe a double post will come close in the effort to remove the stupid people...
<br />

<br />
&quot;I honestly don't understand why everyone is so upset about this PsiPog thing, I think that Sean has made a fantastic personal decision, but it doesn't really affect anyone else (except the influence his decision will make on people, such as the creation of his new site). 
<br />

<br />
I've been watching so many threads about people who are going to stab themselves in the heart because they can't live without Pog. Tell me, what makes PsiPog so great? I'll tell you: The site's content, the help from the staff, and the PEOPLE. 
<br />

<br />
Well let's address these three things: 
<br />

<br />
1.) The site's content is ALL still there and is going to ALWAYS be there - it's being A-R-C-H-I-V-E-D. 
<br />

<br />
2.) The staff. Well, as far as I know, the staff isn't going anywhere. You can find JoeT, SheepKing, Xict, Float, and others at UPC. You can find Apollo at PsiLinks. You can find Stony at PsiOnline. I don't know all the staff and where they currently are, and where they will go, but that's a basic idea. The list goes on. 
<br />

<br />
3.) The people. Well as far as I know, Sean isn't about to send some highly advanced biological weapon to somehow kill everyone who knows about PsiPog. You'll all still be around. There is nothing great about these forums, there is nothing great about ANY forum. Forums can't be great, they can only be bad. Bad forums just work like crap and have bad topic sections - there are a lot of forums that aren't bad. The only great thing about these forums is the way Sean set it up, like the inability to spam post. That was an awesome idea... But still, that doesn't make the forum, that is just to prevent spamming because PsiPog is a big place. YOU make the forums, not PsiPog. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Oh, and let me say something dangerious here: Maybe there are even places that are BETTER than PsiPog  To some extent, it's a matter of opinion. 
<br />

<br />
I'd recommend going to UPC, Veritas, or Psi Scape. That's just a short list of three good sites, with great content, great forums, great staff, great teaching and help. And none of them are out to kill newbies. 
<br />

<br />
I know that a bunch of people have already gone to UPC because of the familiar staff and memberbase, along with the strong level of content and activity. 
<br />

<br />
You guys made PsiPog, never forget that. I think Sean would say, and has said, the same thing. Sure, he worked his butt off with a rediculous amount of hours and stress to make it possible for you guys, but the people make the site. The people become the staff, the people become the authors, the people make up the discussion, etc.&quot;
<br />

			well he has every right to do what he wants with psipog, he brought it into this world, he has every right to take it out. but hes not even doing that, its still gunna be here, just frozen in time.
<br />
yes im upset ill no longer be able to talk on the forums or chats, there are other psionic sites out there, i may migrate over there, thought it still wont be psipog.
<br />
the one thing ill miss the most is peebrain himself. he one hell of a guy to introduce all of us to these mindblowing practices. he sure as hell opened up my eyes. hopefully he wont be gone from the psionic community and drop by the other forums now and then.
<br />
plain and simple, yeah im bummed about this, but its peebrains decision, and im sure he didnt just decide this out of nowhere, he has plenty of good reason and thought put into it.
<br />
and to the people who asked about the chat and forums. as far as i know chat channels have to be registered, and i believe the psipogbot costs money as well. with the forums im not so sure hes deleting the info, that would be rather foolish, hes just not allowing logging on or interacting.
<br />

<br />
instead of ranting about all this, lets just remember what a contribution this site was to the psionic community.
