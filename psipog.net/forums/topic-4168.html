			Is there a method to distinguish between an OBE, and just waking up in a dream?
<br />

<br />
I'll give an example. I have dreams where I wake up within a dream, but I feel a little &quot;caught in the moment&quot; (i.e. not in a very lucid or aware state, I just go with whatever my subconscious feels at the moment.) Last night I had a slightly different experience. I physically felt myself waking up, took a bit to orient myself, got out of bed, and then dressed. Once I reached for my door to touch the handle, I woke up again. The difference between waking up during a dream, and this experience, is that I felt completely cognizant and awake. I'm fairly certain this was different from a lucid dream. So, does this sound like a lucid dream, or an OBE?
<br />

<br />
For those who read, thanks. I'm completely new to Out of Body Experiences, and just now read up on them. Any insight, or tell-tale signs that you're having an OBE would be appreciated.
<br />

<br />
EDIT : I read over some more threads, and it seems it was a FA. My questions still remain, though. =)

			FA, yes. But look I believe OBE's are, well, dreams! There is still a debate going on about it, but it's just a dream. So really OBE's are Lucid dreams.

It's just the trickery of the mind that makes you think your in a OBE. Seeing your sleeping body, cold feelings, going to the astral plane.

			Ah, I see. I was very skeptical, as I don't believe in the &quot;astral plane&quot; or third eyes. I haven't experienced it yet, but an OBE does sound like a lucid dream. Thanks!

i hope that answers you questions...by the way dont just atamaticly assume that an OBE is a dream...to answer your question: when you OBE go to a freinds house and note how the room looks and what people are doing, find a clock and note the time...at the end of your OBE download your memmories nto your body...when you wake up, call your freind and ask him about his house and such, just like monroe does (by the way if your interested in astral projection pick up &quot;Journeys Out of the Body&quot; by Monroe) well that all cya

			Dreaming in general is just a weird, weird phenomenon, so it's understandable that there's a lot of confusion when you throw extrasensory perception into the mix.  What you describe, Gekido, sounds more like a lucid dream than anything else, given that it wasn't just a normal dream that happened to be really mundane.  I have dreams sometimes when I become semi-lucid, not enough to control the dream, but enough to realize that I'm not awake.  I usually wake up shortly thereafter.
<br />

<br />
I don't put much stock in the theory that all OBE are dreams, and vice versa.  I also don't believe that an OBE and astral projection are the same thing.  Some people may equate them to one another, but I frown upon the term of &quot;astral projection&quot; since it has a lot of fluffy connotations, especially those of the astral plane and astral spirts and astral weapons and whatever other nonsense people tend to dream up (no pun intended).  OBE's can be verified in an objective manner, whereas the astral plane cannot.
<br />

<br />
So, in conclusion, from what I've experienced personally and from what I've read, if you have to ask if you had an OBE, then chances are you didn't have one.  I could be completely wrong since this isn't my area of expertise.  Peebs will probably have to weigh in here.

			i agree with roy...if youve had an OBE there will be no doubt in your mind that it was genuine...you wont care what 10,000 advanced psions and phisisists say to disprove it your mind will be made up

i bet a NDE also sounds like a lucid dream but when you have one you sure as hell wont keep the same mindset.
