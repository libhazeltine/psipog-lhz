			Learn how to relax the body. If the body and breath becomes deeply relaxed, the mind will follow. So if you are new, first start with relaxing the body. Then comes the breath, then the mind will follow. So do a little excersice if you will, just to get the body and the blood-circulation going. This is not nessesary but might help you in the beginning. Then sit down in a comfertable position and take a few deep breaths, as if you sigh. Then gow with your attention through your entire body, and be alert on any tensed muscles. Relax every musscle of your body. Then you will automatically be in Alpha state once you did this. Then you may want to continue focussing on the breath, it will take you deeper and it will make your mind relaxed and still.

			ma gives a lot of good advice for noobs on this topic. i think one thing beginners have to understand is that they most likely will not be able to meditate for an hour one their first try. i would try meditating for about 5 maybe 10 mins. try to make it a habit to meditate each day; when you wake up and before you go to bed. after you've become more accustomed to meditating you can make your sessions longer depending on your needs, wants, and time available.

			Agreed, meditation is a practice as well, your mind must get used to it. Learn how to get in a relaxed alpha state and learn how to stay there for a minute or 10. Just relax the body and don't force your mind too much to listen to you. Just let all the thoughts go by and relax a little. This will settle the mind gradually in relaxation. From there you can start to meditate for longer periods of time in a row and try to make the mind still.

			The best way of meditation is don't worry about what you're doing. The whole point is to be relaxed and free of thought, if you worry too much whether or not you're doing it right, you defeat the purpose. Even if you're not free of thought, just take deep breaths and relax and think about the thought..just let your mind flow.

   Because you are stupid. I've asked others to share their sources too. You're the worst poster here though so it just seems like I'm on your back because I don't like you. Actually, it's both. Mostly just because you post so much trash though.

			Define trash, please state your sources for what trash is, because what you referring to as trash, is basically information that goes beyond what you can belief.

   When I say &quot;trash&quot; in these cases I'm talking about incorrect information. Slang and all.
<br />

<br />
   No, it's not just a matter of opinion. What I believe has scientific backing. What you believe doesn't. That's the difference. It's not that I believe it's impossible. It's that it doesn't have any scientific backing. Get what I'm saying?
<br />

<br />
   Yes, I am saying most of the people who post around here are either stupid or gullible for whatever reason.
<br />

<br />
   Fear? No. I'm a mod. My job is to make sure that this place stays decent. Quality and all that stuff. If I wasn't a mod I'd probably ignore you. My &quot;job&quot; is to make sure that you don't ruin this forum though.

Not trying to be snarky or anything.  It's just that your point seems to have been made and if you have a serious wish to continue with this back and forth off-topicness, there are always PMs.

About the scientific backing: It is still your opinion. It will always be a matter of opinions. I never hear you back up anything yourself, and when I see your post, all I see is ignorance. Ignorance mixed with cockyness and alot of over-estimation of your own scientific correctness.
