			ah yes my old enemy... sleep paralysis, god ive had this problem for YEARS, and it really doesnt help that i have asthma and possibly sleep apnea(need tested to be sure) anyway yes this has happened to me ALOT not recently but in past years but ever since i moved from my old house i noticed i havent had one yet, but before i moved i atleast got this once a month, but usually 3 times. this really scared the hell outta me cuz normally i would just see some really strange image of my face with like i see my face blue and my eyelids completely open and really wide eyes with a scared look on it, one time i even saw other things. now anyway as you noticed oncc a month does seem like a lot for this to happen so i eventually had to learn how to stop it as there was the whole i could cause it immediatly thing.
<br />

<br />
and this is how. now im kinda special because at any point in time of my dream i can wake up instantly, really strange huh? but yea if i can focus enough i can wake up, trust me its really hard, especially in the middle of a quiet dark room, but it has been done alot, but this sometimes messes up and causes sleep paralysis because all i do is focus enough to open my eyelids. so i would be yet again trapped in something that looks like a horror film on acid...so yet again with the focusing at nearly unfocusable moments, i just force my body to move and my mind to awake all in one big thought. its really as simple as that, but you have to gain focus, which is really hard when your pretty much asleep, and watching some wierd ass clip play in your head, really really hard. so anyway yes its possible to revive from dreams and sleep paralysis, no its not easy doing it my way.
<br />

<br />
does anyone else have any other experiences similar or techniques with dealing with it?

			I like the way you put it &quot;my old enemy&quot;, I understand you cause I've been having SP's since 2000. What you have achieved is really great and I'm glad that someone found a way to prevent it from happening. 
<br />
My case is a bit dofferent tho, I don't see any dreams before it starts so there is no way to tell if it's gonna happen or not. My body all the sudden goes numb and there it is... I can't move for about 10 - 20 secs (yes I can count even if i see things) and wait for it to end.
<br />
The one and olnly time I was scared shitless was when I saw this (http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/MK-DA/y63.jpg), standing &amp; threating me from right next to me.
<br />
It hasn't been bothering me that much ever since.. I just don't mind it anymore.
<br />

ps: I found the photo by accident on the internet while looking for something else.

			sleep paralyis.....
<br />

<br />
I used to get sleep paralysis when I was younger ...Actually I still get it....
<br />
the thing about sleep paralysis is you have to determine wethter your deeply relaxed or under spiritual attack...or psychic attack for that matter.
<br />
One night I woke from a nightmare into sleep paralysis and quickly came to the conclusion I was under attack....so instantly I shielded as best I could and it stopped immediately......
<br />
I used to be fearful of my sleep paralysis until one day I realized that when I was in sleep paralysis I could snap into a lucid dream If i like or even have an OBE,
<br />
What you have to do is put all your energy into you head when in sleep paralysis than project that energy down into the earth for lucid dream or into your room for OBE...
<br />
another way is not to become frightened when in sleep paralysis(this is key)
<br />
If you are in pain during sleep paralysis shield immediately ..use a light shield as well.  but if you just happen to notice your completely paralyzed but nothing out of the oridnary is happening (your not levitating or being choked)
<br />
than just visulize a nice place youd like to be..your mind will take you there..
