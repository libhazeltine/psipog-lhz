			There are 8 articles about PK on the main page. Each one has valid and detailed information on how to do it. I suggest re-reading them carefully because what you're asking has been answered a thousand times.
<br />

<br />
And you don't imagine it, you simply <span style="font-weight: bold">do it</span>. Like you don't imagine anything when you move your arm or leg. You just do it, there's no better way of putting it.

			Well I usually don't see the aura, instead I get this illusion effect and the object I'm looking at is getting bigger or smaller or more abstract, so in the end I have to focus my eyes really good to see what's really there in front of me <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
However, seeing the aura might help, I wouldn't know. What matters is relaxation (it's important that you are in a relaxed state while trying to perform PK), connection to an object, your objective and <span style="text-decoration: underline">practice</span>. I suggest you read <a href="topic-594.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">JoeT's PK techniques</a>, he explains things in a way everyone can understand.
<br />

<br />
Yes and it IS possible you just moved it. Usually before you can rotate the psiwheel you can affect it in a way that it starts shaking a bit. That's a good sign of you really doing something. And if you don't want the wind to interfere with your practice just seal windows/doors dude.
<br />

<br />
Good luck!
<br />

			What helps me, is i have to completely shut my mind off. If i manage to just stare at the psi wheel and no thoughts cross my mind, it will start to move. So you just have to keep practicing &quot;not thinking&quot; when doing it.

don't shut entire mind off, you clear the mind other than what's your objective is.

			Finally, I moved Psi Wheel <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> It wasn't my breath, because it spins differently. I'm really happy about this <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
P.S. Sorry, if I wrote not in topic about this, but I think that it's about psi wheels so I wrote where I need.

P.S.2. I'm not really good in english, so sorry if You didn't understand <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" />

			When I'm spinning it, I don't feel very much, and I have hardly any control over it: it spins whatever direction it wants to.

For some odd reason, though, I find it really easy to stop it completely.

			To answer Johnyo5's Question, my psi wheel is built from foil, but its shape is different and that's why its easy enough for almost everyone to push with telekinesis.
