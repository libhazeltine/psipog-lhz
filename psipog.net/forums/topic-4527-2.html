			<span style="font-weight: bold">Phasing-</span>You are, from deffinitions found on this site, either aligning your molecules with the objects therefore passing through it. Another psion said something differnt but I can't remember. It was also more logical.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Teleportation-</span>Matter or information is dematerialized, usually instantaneously, at one point and recreated at another.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I doubt you teleported anything mostly because of the &quot;purple room&quot; you described. Me and my friend would stare and race to see who could get the room to go purple, in their eye site. Things seem to disapear. You may also not have phased through it but missed the object entirely. I know when you said things seem to be off a little. You may have seen a part of the straw disapear then your put your finger on the side or above it.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />  Just some healthy skeptisism.

			Ok I think I understand what you meant. I didn't understand your description at first but it sounds as if the straw wasn't solid at all and you moved your finger through it. Now see this is interesting because I've always heard stories of people doing this and it looks like you have your luck. I've always wanted to do that but... what would happen if you lost your concentration in the middle of it. I assume whatever you imagine will happen will happen. Will your finger get stuck, or do you believe that you can only solidify after passing through the straw?

			hey i do thus all the time but differently.i make parts of the object invisible not phasing because im not passing anything through. but thats probably a eye trick i can force on my self. also i dont like move the object close to me it can be at any distance and its edges will slowly disapear

			I can make a whole room seem to disappear, but I never thought to move while it's happening. I've also always had a strong desire to phase through a wall... I shall proceed with utmost care and caution...

			Maybe this could be a visualization for phasing, seeing the object dissapear so your mind will think &quot;Oh I can go right through there since it's empty!&quot; and then you could trick yourself into phasing...I'm going to experiment with this <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" />

			ah, the  amazing placebo effect, it could very well be that, due to the hallucination of keeping ones eyes focused on the same spot for a long time, it could have triggered that effect by making ur mind truly beleive that it was half there or whatever, idk, im a n0Ob <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Only if you phase improperly, then your pain receptors and nerves would be phasing in and out of existence, and when they are &quot;existent&quot; the receptors notice they're severed from nearby cells and so send the message of extreme pain associated with loss of a limb to the brain.  But some of those impulses reach dead ends when a nerve is properly phased so a less intense, but still very painful, sensation reaches the brain.
