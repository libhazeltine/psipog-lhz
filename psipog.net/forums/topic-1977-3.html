			Well...this may be my first post on here, i'm not sure...but I wanted to respond to this. 
<br />

<br />
I came across this thread by using the &quot;search&quot; function (yay for me!) and felt compelled to offer my insight into this area, because I've been thinking about this very subject latley. 
<br />

<br />
Have any of you seen the &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; movies or Stand Alone Complex anime series? They have &quot;cyber brains&quot; which house one's &quot;ghost&quot; or consciousness. They even have &quot;barrier traps&quot; which cause people seizures and death if they trip them...mental advertising and SPAM also become a reality and problem in this universe. 
<br />

<br />
I've just seen a news article about Honda announcing a new brain-to-computer interface that uses brainwaves and an external cap to control a robot. We are getting much closer each day. . . DARPA is also throwing big bucks at this tech to allow all our ampute soldiers &quot;mental&quot; control over their robotic prostethetics. 
<br />

<br />
This is my wierd forcast:
<br />

<br />
Humankind will eventually through a combination of bio-engineering/genetics and physical technology to allow mankind to &quot;enter&quot; into cyberspace. Browse the internet in your mind...exist whole lifetimes in mere seconds. Time beomes totally trival. . . 
<br />

<br />
I think though, when we first put our consciousness onto the internet, we'll discover that it's already inhabited by sentient AI's. I belive that right now as I type this, the exponential expansion of complexity the internet experiences is forming the very basic building blocks for a global-network-machine mind. 
<br />

<br />
At this point we will either have to merge with the machine intelligence to survive, or fight it. I belive we will want qualitites of the machine (vast archives of instant knowledge) and the machine will want what we have (creativity, imagination and art)...
<br />

<br />
Just like the transformers used to chant, &quot;Till All Is ONE!&quot; We are going to use technology as a prosthethsis to extend our awareness and consciousness.

			You know.... if anyone could do this, you might not have to have a wifi spot because I get internet with my cell phone.  I don't know much about how it works, but isn't it the same idea? Kind of?

i've noticed when a cell phone is being used near me my computer's wireless adapter alerts me that a new connection opened, though it's not a strong connection.
<br />

<br />

<br />
anyways, as far as going to war with technology, we'd lose hands down, as mankind is completely dependent on technology at this point in time, even if we destroyed all technology, most people wouldnt know how to survive.
<br />

<br />
anyways, if anyone wants to bother trying to figure this out it might be interesting to test, i'm going to try, but i need more practice still before i can get close to being able to do anything that big
