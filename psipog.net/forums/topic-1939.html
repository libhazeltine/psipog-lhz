- If you must, try to just realize that the pinwheel &#40;or, again, whatever object you're using&#41; has the &#91;i&#93;ability&#91;/i&#93; and/or the &#91;i&#93;potential&#91;/i&#93; to be effected in the desired way.&nbsp; From there, you may be able to perform the &quot;just do it&quot; method.&nbsp; This works well with the method I described above, about influencing direction of the psiwheel and not worrying about actually spinning it of your own accord.</font></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
&#91;code&#93;I know talk of religion is forbidden, but it's not clear to me whether this rule only applies when talking of specific religion or religion in general.&nbsp; However, I feel that, in this case, it's okay, as I'll be vague and unspecific.&nbsp; Having said this, it is still true that I am new to the forums and I'm not entirely sure how the rules are enforced and whatnot.&nbsp; If this is still breaking the rules then call me out on it, and I'll be sure not to do it again...&#91;/code&#93;
<br />

<br />
Those of you who pray to a diety or do anything of similar concept may understand, or, at least, be enlightened to, what I am talking about.
<br />

<br />
There is always a slight twinge in the back of my mind; an emotion that may take many forms, that isn't directly controlled by my conscious mind.&nbsp; &nbsp;Basically, I consider it the &quot;cold truth&quot; emotion; knowing if I truly, honestly and really believe what I am feeling, thinking, saying or doing.&nbsp; For instance, one who is praying to their diety, who had a traumatic or similar type of experience that tests their faith, may feel this during a session of prayer.&nbsp; You may not consciously think about it during the session, but it is&nbsp; there.&nbsp; You can imagine it literally as a twig, flowing in the river of thoughts in the conscious mind.&nbsp; This twig is being influenced based on my true feeling on the subject.&nbsp; For example&#58; if I don't honestly trust my ability to perform psychokinesis while still telling myself that I can, no matter how hard I try to convince myself that I &#91;i&#93;do&#91;/i&#93; believe, this twig will flow in the opposite direction as the current of my thoughts.&nbsp; If I am able to convince myself, the twig will gradually flow in the correct direction.&nbsp; Sometimes I'm able to snap the twig violently, sometimes in two pieces.
<br />

<br />
Of course, that is all just an analogy, and what I deem as an emotion is up to you to realize and percieve in your own way.&nbsp; It's still a helpful thought, in my opinion, anyway.
<br />

<br />
For the record, I don't actually percieve it as a twig.&nbsp; I have a sort-of argument in the back of my mind with my conscious.&nbsp; Try to always be sure that the &quot;twig&quot; is &quot;going with the flow&quot;.&nbsp; You know if you're decieving yourself.&nbsp; Don't mask this problem; confront and conquer it.</font></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

			Till yestorday I have never given TK much thought, and thought it mainly useless. I still have had no results starting the thing spinning, however, once an object is in motion it is easyer to keep i in motion then it is to start it in the first place.
<br />

<br />
For instance, 20 kids can push a 50 foot long school buss from a stop no prob. But once its moving it only requires 5 kids still pushing to keep it moving assuming the ground is level.
<br />

<br />
If you push it, and don't use TK it will stop. Thus, if you can't get it to start you could try to start it with your finger, then just keep it going.
<br />

<br />
I've not read enough into it to know if someone has said something to that point before.

			I agree.  The thing I posted about only focusing on controlling direction and allowing an air current to give the pinwheel its momentum is similar to what you said;  I should include it in my first post.
