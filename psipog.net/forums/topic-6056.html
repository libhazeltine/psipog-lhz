			Hi guys
<br />

<br />
I was bored yesterday, so i decided to brush up my energy manipulation skills.
<br />
I was gathering energy in my palms for a really strong psiball, and i went into this weird state. It happens whenever I focus on something too much, everything pretty much gets blurred, colours change and i feel calm. In this state, I can see auras.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I saw blue in my palms. It was definitely clear, and i had no blue lights on, windows were closed. It lasted for like 5 seconds, then it faded. I tried it again later that day, and i made it go blue again! I had to concentrate to see it though.
<br />

<br />
Do you guys think i was seeing my psiball, it's aura or just a reflection of some sort?
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Damn, I just realized I posted this in the wrong forum  
<br />

<br />

			I just focus on the area where my psiball is, and i visualize a blue psiball with electricity around it. Then i focus on it for a while, and i go into that state. Then i see it. It's a wierd method, but it works for me.

			i have just thought of something interesting, in science class, we were talking about the chemical reaction that happens inside the bodies of organisms.  you have 6 oxygen molecules and a glucose molecule.  in the body, it produces 6 carbon dioxide molecules 6  water molecules and energy.  this is the exact opposite of what plants do,  ther take in energy (sunlight) water and carbon dioxide and output glucose and oxygen.  so my question is is it only organisms that give off aura, or is it any form of matter.  because if it is then this would give an explaination of where the aura comes from.  if there is actually a proven explaination of where the aura comes from, please reply

			eh, its not even proven that auras exists..... proven by science that is.....
<br />

<br />

<br />
but i'll give ye my explaination on auras....
<br />

<br />
all objects have psi/qi/wadeva.... and the aura is the leakage of this energy, as the objects naturally gain psi from other leakages, it overloads and leaks itself..... this leakage is quite constant, thus a distinct auric shape....
<br />

<br />

<br />
ta-da! theorist's auric theory! debug it for meh, ty

			umm...different!  thats the best word!  Not wrong, it's all opinion.
<br />

<br />
But i suggest to all of you to do research on auras if your going to try and understand 'em.
