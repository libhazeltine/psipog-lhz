			I am not exactly skeptical, I just have a theory about psionics that I think you might like to hear.
<br />
The universe is filled with living creatures. Many of which are intellingent enough to dream. Each creature that can dream has it's own alternate reality. The two realities are &quot;Individual reality&quot; (Dreams) and the &quot;Ultimate Reality&quot; (The real world). In dreams, you are the only one that is really there. Everybody else is created by your mind. This, being your world, is entirely under your control. Now, the Ultimate Reality is something much greater, where all living organisms reside and meet. We are not creations. We all have real lives, and are not figments of one's imagination. Therefore, there is no supreme ruler. Although it is possible that forces guide us in everyday life. But let's not get off track. We as individuals have the potential to control the universe around us. The normal person would have no control, but those who know psionics can unleash their potential. We will never have full control, because we are all sharing the universe. It's not one entity's mind. The more you practice psionics, the more control you get. Most of us here will have somewhere around 0.0000000045742% control of the universe, allowing us to perfrom feats such as psychokinesis and clairvoyance, where as in our own individual realities, we have the potential to reach 100% control, but only lucid masters can reach such a state. In the ultimate reality, it's pretty much impossible for one to reach 1% control. In closing, the more you practice psionics, the more control you gain. Allowing you to manipulate reality at will.
<br />
What do you think?

   I like your theory, but where did you get these statistics from?  Are the percentages just based on how many people there are on earth?  And if so, does that mean that together, we have 100% control of the universe?

			You should really not use statistics without facts behind it.

You're going to make yourself look like a jackass.

Either way, I don't think your theory is great.

			Most of my statistics are approximations. It's just to give you a rough idea. And yes, together we have 100% control is the theory.

			I suppose they may make up a minute amount but only because they exist. If they were more intelligent and knew how to use their powers, they would have much more control. Although, I may be wrong. Animals could be using psychic powers more than the average non-psychic human.

And what sense does that have? Universe is infinite, so the power one can wield is infinite, so the amount of power each one psion has is about the amount of having a grain of sand on a desert planet 100 times bigger than Jupiter. Our power is minuscule.
