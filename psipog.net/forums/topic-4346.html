I felt sick in next day and i need to go see doctor. When at night i sleeping on my bed and start to have this bad dream. I dream about the train in the hole and i was in the train. The train move so fast that scare me after that i heard a voice it was my brother calling me. Then he tell me i keep shouting  grandfather no please.....no please.
