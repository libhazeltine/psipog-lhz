			Heh, I've told as many people around me as possible, on purpose. I said it once, then never said it again, except to those who believed me. I'm too weak to prove anything. Mostly, they just think I'm insane, which is fine by me. Nobody really bothers me, they sort of forgot.

			I made the mistake of telling my uber-empirical boyfriend about it early on into my training, and we had a huge fight about it... &quot;It's just heat from you hands, don't be an idiot!&quot; &quot;Why don't you just open up that thick head of yours for two seconds and realise there's more to this world than science has told us!?&quot;
<br />

He's actually come around to being fairly supportive of it, which surprises me.  He says that he'll be willing to believe me when he sees me move the psi-wheel from a distance under the glass.  We'll see; I hope I can do that soon.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I don't tell anybody else about it, but when I have those brief telepathic, empathic, or precognitive flashes I always joke &quot;Yeah, it's because I'm psychic&quot;.  Then I can laugh at them from the inside. xD

			I used to, but I've gotten sick of answering the same obvious questions 30 times and then have them forget completely about it 10 mins later. Annoys me.

Small school? 650? We must be right backward over here, there's like 500 hundred in my school; 80 in my year atm (25 dropped out). Still too much imo.
<br />

I don't understand though why you'd tell your classmates? Good friends, sure. Have someone close to share things like this with, etc...but classmates?  Most of my year are retards. They have trouble moving pens with their HANDS, let alone their minds.

			Sure we all want to climb to the highest point and scream it for the whole world to hear.  But few people understand psychic phenomena, and what they don't understand they fear and hate.  If it becomes more widely known, but not understood it'll become the next thing to be picked on.

Some of you were avoiding talking about your opinion about homosexuals, but think about the prosecution that they go through.  Anyone who has experienced racism knows how it feels.  Go back and read your previous posts in this discussion, then put them side-by-side with that of writings by homosexuals.  Keep in mind that we are essentially &quot;in the closet&quot; about our abilities.

Worst case scenario there could be another witch hunt.

Sorry, that I went on a tiraid, but it isn't far from the truth.  So be brave, and know your time will come, but until then chose wisely who you tell.  Most of all don't brag it makes you a target.

			Most of the people who try to tell people about psi 1. are not very good and 2. are setting themself up for failure. The immature power freaks that practice psi are bound to go about toning themselves the wrong way when they talk about it. Also, most of them are terrible at proving it, like theorist. If you tone your talk correctly you can get them to just accept it. Also, if you prove it effectively. You have to go about it not as a big secret but as just something that's a part of you and you should be able to do it with ease. This should make them see it as slightly more normal than the kids who just say &quot;I can move things with my mind.&quot; Don't be scared; it's stupid and will ruin what you're trying to do. Look at the big picture, this whole topic is kinda stupid.

			Y'know Niushirra, aside from the remarks about stupidity, that post was pretty much bang-on. In my experiences, I would go to tell someone, and they'd instantly ask me &quot;What am I thinking?&quot; or &quot;Move that with your mind.&quot; It got annoying and degrading, and eventually I stopped telling anyone. 
<br />

<br />
Now, the only people who know of what I do are my parents, my TA (Teacher Advisor), my best friend (who's also a Telepath), and another close friend of mine (who'd be my girlfriend if she wasn't already with someone). A small circle of people who accept my abilities (although my TA sometimes says he distrusts &quot;you Psi guys&quot;...). And really, that's all I need. I don't want everyone to know. I just want a few people I can trust.

			I've only told one person, and that's because of two reasons: 
<br />

<br />
1) Since she's into the whole &quot;Wicca&quot; thing, I knew she'd be open-minded about it.
<br />
2) She's a really good friend, and one of the few people I know in person that I can trust.
<br />

<br />
Generally, I avoid telling people I know in person though, because I have trouble trusting people when it comes to matters dealing with my mind. Also, I don't want to deal with the idiots sgtpsion described, I can easily see how getting told to move something with PK every time you tell someone about it would be annoying. And besides, the only people it really concerns is all of you (because you deal with it as well, and sharing experiences in this area is helpful), and those I'm close to.

			I taught a bunch of people about psiballs and constructs and telekinesis and stuff. I mentioned lucid dreams to several people and discussed telepathy and the nature of the mind.
<br />

<br />
I tell stories to a lot of people and that's what I'm famous for.
<br />

<br />
If anybody even mentions these topics I lecture them to hell.
<br />

<br />
Except for one guy who stood up to my lectures, but then I realized his knowledge was shallow and he was a Narutard.
<br />

<br />
Everyone I talk to about telekinesis or telepathy is extremely hungry for more knowledge about these topics, some of my friends I saw would be holding their hands in psiball making position.

			I have come to the conclusion that it doesn't matter so much who you tell, or if you decide not to tell anyone at all and just keep it to yourself. What matters most is that you know what you can do and are comfortable with your talents and with yourself.

Precisely. I don't talk about it anymore because I know my abilities, and most others can't even fathom what I can do. They don't understand, so I don't tell them. I'm comfortable with my skills.

My problems all started when I tried to teach closed-minded people something they didn't know was possible: how to make a psiball. Now, I only give instruction to people who approach me personally about it, or on public foums like PsiPog.
