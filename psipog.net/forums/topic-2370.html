			Ok, me and a friend were trying some telepathy over AIM. It was going ok but he stopped messaging me for a few minutes and did not tell me why. When he stopped messaging me I tried to sort of remote view and see where my dad was on his boat (I live on a lake). I sort of started moving my mind to turn around and go through my room door and once I ran into the hallway I stopped. A random thought popped into my head and it was like a shadow man. He was pitch black and you could not see his face. Another way I could describe him would be like a black flame person or whatever. Anyways, it freaked me out. I sent a message &quot;are you there?&quot; back to my friend but he wasn't. Next thing I feel like the shadow person was looking right over my shoulder and I turned around three times randomly to make sure nothing was there. It was REALLY scaring me. Then my friend said &quot;back.&quot; The he said &quot;When I was washing my hands I imagined myself walking through your house to try and find you so the telepathy worked better.&quot; Then I told him what happened. Then I never &quot;saw&quot; the shadow person again or felt it watching over my shoulder.  
<br />
      Could this have been my friend or something else? Can someone shed some light on this?
<br />

<br />

<br />
P.s. I have only felt something like this once before in my life about 3 years ago. I don't get this a lot.

			Well it sounds as if it could of been your friend, though it did go away when he said he was back? That points more so to it could of been him. All in all that is my theory, though there have been reports of &quot;shadow men&quot;, even on the forum there was a big thread about it. But the important matter is it is gone now, so no need to fear whats not there, eh?

			Thanks but it really scared me even though there was nothing there to be seen. Do you remember what that thread about the shadow man said by any chance? I'm just trying to understand what happened so it won't be as scary if it happens again. Most things aren't scary once you understand them better in my opinion.

			There was a thread by Uriah but it got locked on something similar to this.  It got too close to the religious line, unfortunately.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
