			I have a few concerns about meditation. I have heard from other sites that meditation can be dangerous if the person practicing it is not guided by a teacher. Apparently people have had schytzophrenia (or however you spell it&quot; and panic attacks because they didn't meditate properly. I just wan't to know if any of you have had teachers or guides and what your experiences have been.

			You can definitely experience problems. Your past memories can come up from your subconcious and it will seem your mind is trying to make you go mad. Some say it's your ego. All you can do is forgive and forget to get on with your exspansion. If you experience negitive feedback stop and hit the books till you come across your problem and a way to help it.

			I have yet to hear of any sort of negative side effects of meditation.  This sounds to me like pure bullshit, especially when you consider the fact that meditation is just focusing on one &quot;thing&quot;.  Draw a dot on your wall, and sit and stare at it.  That's meditation.  Wow....how dangerous....you really need a teacher to guide you for that.

Although it is possible to develop disassociation disorders from meditating... don't worry about it. You don't need a teacher. If you start to feel strange stop meditating for a while or go speak to a mental health professional.

			it depends on what kind of meditating you do and how high of a level you get on your own.  Lower level basic meditations pose no danger.  These are meditations such as staring at a point on the wall or repeating a phrase over and over.  But if you begin to practice advanced forms of meditation such as attempting to leave your body, delve into your subconscious, contact internal/external beings, recite 'magical' phrases etc. then it's best doing it under supervision.
<br />

<br />
As a general rule, however, you're probably not advanced enough to hurt yourself through meditation.
<br />

<br />
I've been meditating in various ways for the past... must be 5 years, maybe 6.  During this time I personally have never gone skitzofrenic or experienced any kind of mental trauma, but there were a few occurances with others in the group that were potentially damaging (but fortunately not)  For example, I had a friend who one time during a group session accidentally left her body and then when she came back her spirit-head wasn't well aligned with her real head and our guide had to walk her back straight.

   No talk about past lives. I'm not sure if that's what you meant by that, but I gave you a heads up. No past lives, no life after death, no reincarnation, etc.

Bro you are making assumptions. past memories in this life  couz. Memories that are negitive and bother you when thought about. If one has none, than lucky them, or they maybe they havent made it that far yet.
<br />
 it kool couzin I aint paying negitive attention we are here to relate on subjects, not be rule and order cranks. Focus on mastering yourself,dig deep within and shatter the sculptered persona regain that being you really are. That's what most are seeking on forums with this topic. I can tell lot's of youngans round here. Peace

I'm quite aware of what meditation is, insofar as the mental and biological response.  I don't really go for nor care about what different disciplines say happens to your &quot;ego&quot;, or your &quot;spirit&quot;, or your &quot;whatever else&quot; during meditation.  It's all the same physiologically.
<br />

<br />
I meditate for medicinal benefits, for increased focus, and for thinking problems through in an altered state of consciousness.  Everyone meditates differently, but please don't underestimate my knowledge of meditation.
