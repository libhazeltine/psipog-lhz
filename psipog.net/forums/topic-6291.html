			I have been trying to obe for about 4 or 5 months so far and with no success,  and im starting to get pissed of reading how some people just decide to try it one day and end up having one while i have been trying for months and i have not had one yet. I know for a fact that my desire for it is strong enough and i have no fears about leaving my body, the vibrations dont even bother me anymore anymore, i just cant seem to get out of my body. <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
anyone have any ideas on what i may be doing wrong?  or any methods that actually work?

			I've been at it for a couple months aswell without success. I get the real strong &quot;spins&quot; all the time but no vibs yet. My suggestion is take a break. Remember peebrain (might've been someone else but I don't think so) said he was at it for months before his 1st one too. And he only had his 1st one when he wasn't even trying to. It was after he took a break and the next day he had one. My advice. Patience. What else could there be. You're most likely closer to doing it than me seeing as you get the vibs. Also remember everyone on the site might not be 100% truthful about their experiences. Don't compare, just experience.

			If you’re getting the vibrations, I’d say you are very close indeed to inducing an OBE.  The simplest advice I can give you is that if you are at the vibration stage, do nothing.  Just sit (or lay) there with as clear mind as you can and the vibrations will pop you out (eventually)

that is what i try to do but some time i just get random things pooping into my mind.
<br />

<br />
but very interesting story, last night while trying to induce one i was unsuccessful but i did feel my consciences start to move out then back in, then out and back in...... this happened a few times.  Then very interesting i then later saw a woman walking back and forth around my bed, but she was completely made out of light energy.  Very strange not shore who or what she wanted.  So i do know that I am getting really close now.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I’ve had many OBE’s, but I’ve never seen a woman made of light walking around my bed.  Sounds like you fall asleep and dreamed that, though I obviously can’t say for sure.  If your getting random things popping into your head, I find that usually means your falling into a dream, so maybe try when your more awake, or just after you have woken up.

I don't think it was a dream because i was conscience throughout the whole time.

			You concious in dreams also, so you think.. .and it coulda bena  lucid dream. It could also have just ben your mind going to a wierd stage of conciousness in diffrent ways... 
<br />

<br />
I havent OBE'd and I honestly cant remeber enough times to do it at night because Im usualy to sleepy to think : /... BUT I think if you stated your exact method to induce it would help others who have done it see what your doing and maby give tips on what did it for them. Or even seeing it writen out may somehow let you help yourself...
