<br />

<br />
I want people to learn by them selves, not being hand feed every day like a mental retarded human.

You are correct. People don't learn if your always their to tell them the answer. For they will become dependent of your knowledge and wisdom and haven none of their own. 
<br />

<br />
But at the same time if they are never told they must <span style="font-weight: bold">waste</span> their time learning how to reinvent the wheel instead of <span style="font-weight: bold">spending</span> their time improving upon it. 
<br />

<br />
In every decision the opposite end of the extreme is usually have correct. Not telling them the answers persay is indeed the path to take, but not giving them anything is also wrong.
<br />

<br />
As such, their is another saying that goes along with your quote. &quot;Give a man to fish and he will be full for a day. Teach a man to fish and he'll be full for a lifetime.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Everything is a concept and mythology that leads to a trail of techniques. A thought process that made the original creator come up with the doctrines in the first place. For karate, psionics, science, and so on and so forth.  
<br />

<br />
The trick is to not only teach them the lesson, but the through process in which it derived from so they can now use that new concept to create and conceive new thoughts and opinions on other matters they may face.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Be open to anything, but question everything. 
<br />
The thought process behind it is the answers to questions we ask cannot always be answered with what we already know. for we donot know everything. That logical thought is not a subject. Meaning that all things cannot be explained with what the masses conside &quot;science.&quot; Logical thought is a process.
<br />

<br />
The very words of this thread &quot;Be open to antyhing, but question everything&quot; within itself can be a concept that leads to a trail of techniques.  Such as the thought process behind creative thought itself. But that is another subject to tackle.

IF WE DON'T SPREAD THIS IDEA LIKE GENERAL KNOWLEDGE THE SAME SHIT WILL HAPPEN OEVER AND OVER AGAIN.
<br />

<br />
THE SAME QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED. 
<br />

<br />
THE SAME THREAD TOPICS WILL BE SPREAD.

Just like if the Be intelligent or the sticky thread of forum rules were not posted more idiocy would be posted. Although those threads dont complete rid the world of them. It helpls greatly.

He sounds like oneof those guys who wasn't mentally stable to begin with and was not ready for the truth.
<br />

<br />
Thus as his power grows so does his insanity.

Know a lotta people like that. NLP saves them though.

			who and what is this guy? is he a kn3wb poser or is a crazy l33t?
<br />

EDIT: I checked that thread out. He's probably a deluded poser kn3wb already with unstable psyche knowing of psi and such just gives him a justification to act crazy. People like that have no power. To busy asking dumbass questions.

Unless their to talented not to. Then the drama comes...

			Avuis was clearly not in a 'well' state of being during his/her (very) short role as part of the psipog communty. here, Avuis was called crazy and banned (with good reason, in my opinion) because of the posts he/she made. i'm sure there are some places where what he/she wrote would have been revered as extremely wise. 
<br />
but psipog seems too analytical for that approach. and i've always stayed with psipog because of that.
<br />
It's analytical demeanor allows for better explaination to outsiders.
<br />

<br />
what would you rather have found out about psionics on? a website full of fluffy explainations, tarnished by the writer's own perception? or a place that looks at Psionics from all angles. giving a non-biased view?
<br />

<br />
EDIT: found Avuis's userpage for those interested, <a href="forums/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1163" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://psipog.net/forums/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1163</a>
