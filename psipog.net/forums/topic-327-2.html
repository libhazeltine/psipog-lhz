			LOL   SYLVIA BROWN IS THE BIGGEST FAKE IN THE WORLD! 
<br />
MOst people think that sylvia is loved my the psychic community (mediums and all that), but you'd be surprised at how many people hate her. A majority of people like sylvia browne think the woman should be shot. I saw a topic about sylvia in a psychic forum once and they were on about how awful she is and all that.

			I personally believe Silvia Browne has genuine psychic abilities.
<br />

<br />
However, I also believe that with age, her abilities, much like her mind, have dimmed somewhat. Also, she might be slightly loopy at this point too.
<br />

<br />
Still though, let's remember that this is only my OPINION before flaming me good. I could very well be wrong.

			Since we all seem to be throwing in our opinions on the subject, I think she is a complete and utter fake, for several reasons.
<br />

<br />
1. The way she presents herself. To me, she seems to be somewhat arrogant, quite the opposite of what one would expect from a &quot;good&quot; person.
<br />

<br />
2. The way she handles questions. She never seems to pause to consider the question or the possible answer. She also never seems to have to concentrate on the question.
<br />

<br />
3. The variety of answers she gives. She seems to give a lot of self-fulfilling prophecies. For example, one woman asked her &quot;Will I lose X amount of weight?&quot; (I don't remember the exact amount, give me a break here) No matter what answer she gave, it would be correct. If she'd have said yes, the woman would have worked extra hard, making the answer correct. If she said no, the woman wouldn't have bothered exercising, thinking &quot;well, if I'm not gonna lose the weight anyways, I'm not even gonna try,&quot; thereby making the answer correct. For the record, she answered yes. Also, she gets some questions to which the answer is unverifiable (like &quot;Is the spirit of my dead dog at peace?&quot;), therefore she can just make up whatever sounds plausible. Personally, I wouldn't handle those types of questions even if I could answer them, what good does it do if you don't know whether or not I'm right?

			i think thats the thing that skeptics are using. Its her own fault for being arrogant and answering every question someone asks. Clairvoyant, audient whatever, dont know all the answers all the time and thats where browne messes up. She answers anything and everything.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Notice how these TV psycics dont do any energy manipulation of any kind at all. You would think that atleast one of these jokers would do something like that. I would like to see someone from this forum go on the montel show with sylvia and have sort of a &quot;psycic showdown.&quot; Make psi balls, move pens n what not. Not only that, but it would also be interesting to see what sylvia has to say about it, because no matter if the person developed it, or was born with it, i bet she would say the person was born with a gift, in an attempt to flatter and make herself look credible. She is a faaaake. Just as fake as edwards.

Thats why I don't like revealing on a mass cale since we would be called fakes...They need to interview someone who isn't a &quot;cold reader&quot;...a psychokinetic would be more appropriate or maybe a telepath, remote viewer or a skilled energy manipulator <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

It is perfectly and completely possible for mediums to interact, no, integrate with the dead. I don't have much to back it up, I know. But I just have a feeling, that a million people in the world are completely lieing to the rest of the world. If it wasn't real, why would they say it is? And second, if psi is real, mediums sure as hell can be.
