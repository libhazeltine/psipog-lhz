			Practice this exercise once per day before sleep. Take a blank sheet of white paper and draw a dark colored circle in the center. Fill the circle in. Place the picture under a lamp and stare at the picture for three minutes. Then look at a blank wall and see the picture projected there in reverse colors. Hold your hands up, palms facing each other.
<br />

<br />
Absorb
<br />
Sit up with your back straight and your chin up. Place your left palm on your right calf and your right palm on your left calf. Be aware that there is magickal energy all around you in the form of a colored snowy cloud and you are going to breathe it in. Breathe the color of your choice for the snowy cloud into your solar plexus for 4 heartbeats. Hold your breath for 2. Breathe out for 4 heartbeats but not the color and hold your breath for 2. Do this for 10 repititions. Your body will begin to rock a little involuntarily and your solar plexus will get warm. You may even feel butterflies. This is normal and is a sign that you are absorbing magickal energy.
<br />

<br />
Collect
<br />
Place your fingertips together near your solar plexus as if you were holding a softball. Look at the space between your hands. Sense the warmth in your solar plexus and feel it going up to your chest as you move your hands up. Then fork the warmth down both arms and out through the palms of your hands shooting into a softball size sphere. Your palms will start to tingle. You may see a white grey or blue light flow out in waves or shoot out in straight lines toward the center of the space between your hands. The texture and material looks similar to a snowy television screen. Your hands will feel warm.
<br />

<br />
Shell 
<br />
If you move your hands away your eyes will be able to see this snowy sphere. The sphere will last for only a few seconds. Move your hands away only slightly and focus on the rim of the magickal sphere that you have created. Imagine you harden that outer rim into a tranparent like glass that contains the light. This will not last unless you use some sealing techniques as described below using sigils, gestures and words. 
<br />

<br />
Genekinesis
<br />
Visualize the sphere from the last exercise materialize between your hands.
<br />

<br />
Telekinesis
<br />
Visualize moving the sphere with your magickian's will. Move the sphere from your right, to your left, back to your right palm. Center the sphere between your palms again.
<br />

<br />
Cryokinesis
<br />
Visualize the sphere become more solid, then turn it into a ball of ice.
<br />

<br />
Electrokinesis
<br />
Return the sphere to its previous texture and polarize it. Visualize the sphere warming up and sparkling. See electricity envelope the sphere.
<br />

<br />
Morphokinesis
<br />
Make it hot. Reshape the sphere into a cube, and then reshape the cube back into a sphere as if it were metal in the fire.
<br />

<br />
Pyrokinesis
<br />
Visualize the sphere getting white hot and igniting on fire.
<br />

<br />
Oxykinesis
<br />
Visualize the white hot sphere of fire turn into a star and see it dissolve into dust.

			I do not believe in using a psiball to use any form of -kinesis, maybe psiball moving but hey, i dont believe in developing (In advancement, sorry for the fluff terms) cryo, pyro, or oxykinesis. I use conventional; telekinesis practicing. Psiballs are, IMO, only a step to making a construct.

			This thread is going to get locked from all the -kinesis and &quot;fluff&quot;.

Sounds like a Ki thing, really. Still usefull, but the -kinesis thing is a bit much.

Last time I checked...I didn't need any &quot;-kinesis&quot; to shape psi. It forms to your thought, and has technically not been defined as matter or not, to be placed under any kind of &quot;-kinesis&quot;. Quit making up silly terms.

This doesn't even make sense what you are trying to accomplish here...its rather disturbing.

			You guys, this is simply an advanced form if visualization. I think what this person means is that there is PSI around you, energy. In my opinion, getting an afterpicture of a picture of a circle and starting visualization with the afterpicture between your hands sounds like a good idea. This simply sounds like a more magical version of the basic way to make a psiball. Cup your hands together, and bring energy up from your solar plexus chakra.
<br />

<br />
A snowy sphere, a ball of ice, a flaming ball, they're all different forms of visualizing psiballs. 
<br />

<br />
Though psiballs are just psi, energy, only the most advanced psions out there can actually use pyrokinesis or cryokinesis to actually light in on fire or make it icy. And even I havn't heard of such a thing. Tthis person simply means visualize it in different elements to make it colder or warmer. You can move it with your mind and create constructs. (:

			Interesting comments. Really, it is a fresh perspective you have given me. Here is more information on the suffix ending -kinesis. I did not invent these terms. They are quite well known throughout many works of fiction.

Maybe my brain is failing me, but I'm pretty sure I don't see Morphokinesis or Oxykinesis on either of those pages, nor Genekinesis if you want to get specific. I normally don't mind when people use them in the convential sense, such as &quot;I would like some information on cyrokinesis&quot;, because I can see how it would get annoying to have to type &quot;freezing water with TK&quot; rather than the much shorter version. But here you have done something totally different, and applied the names to the visualizations during energy work, rather than the actual process of any of the kinesis you mentioned. Therefore you are no longer using them as shortened forms of &quot;freezing water with tk&quot;, but instead trying to apply the names to visualizations. Which isn't what the original word stands for. They are names of actual processes, not simple visualizations. 
<br />

<br />
I definately don't condone the use of any &quot;-kinesis&quot; terms because people get way too carried away, and try and name every little thing, when in actuality all Telekinesis is the same. In every form of Telekinesis you are manipulating atoms/molecules, which falls under the definition of Telekinesis. For example: Freezing water = slowing down water molecules, Lighting things on fire = speeding up molecules increasing the energy and friction in an object until such circumstances arrive which cause it to burst into flames, Moving air = again...you are simply moving the molecules in the air that were not moving before. By this, any kind of manipulation you do to your enviroment on a physical level falls under the classification of Telekinesis. The only thing I would not consider Telekinesis is forms energy manipulation, and by energy of course, I mean that undefined thing you all make your constructs out of and whatever else you do with it, not simply potential or kinetic energy. Then of course you have your other categories of Telepathy, and everything else, which are not Telekinesis either.

			Wikipedia is the only website that supports those terms.  Do a google search - you won't find any other site that uses them.  They SHOULD be removed from Wikipedia, and I've tried to remove them in the past... but you know how Wikipedia is.
<br />

<br />
Also... we aren't Wikipedia.  We have our own rules, and creating random -kinesis terms off the top of your head does break them.
