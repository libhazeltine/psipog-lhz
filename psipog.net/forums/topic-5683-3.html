			Good to hear your not quitting &quot;tryagain&quot;. Make sure you try different methods found on here to do it. Mabye if you were only trying to use one method this whole time, that one simply doesn't work for you.

Here's an idea for helping your PK: Instead of working on getting it to move, how about working on some control?    Set up your psi-wheel(assuming you have one) in some place with a constant(but gentle) flow of air, such as in front of a far away fan on low.    Get into the position you'll be in for doing PK, and observe the wheel for a little while.    Get a feeling for how often it changes direction(if ever), how often and how long it stops, etc.   Once you've gotten that down, begin trying to influence it left, right, or even try to make it stop!
<br />

<br />
If you're careful with the results(trying to weed out the coincedences(sp?)), this can be very effective(well, it was for me, at least).   Personally I can't move a psi-wheel worth crap, but I'm pretty good at controlling one already in motion.   I was able to make it stop completely for one full minute before losing concentration and letting it return to spinning.   Now tell me the chances that it just happened to stop for one full minute, in the light wind of my fan, beginning and ending the MOMENT I started concentrating/lost concentration?
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Anyway, not sure if this technique works for many people, as PK isn't my specialty(I seem to have a natural affinity for manipulation; I discovered it on my own before even reading about Psionics.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  )

My mind actually has diffuculty getting over the static friction, so I blow some air on it from time to time, see how far it goes by itself, and then I see how long I can influence it to keep on going. I've even been able to make it change direction. I'm still trying to grasp the PK mechanism in my mind, though.
<br />

<br />
It's so subtle, that if you try to force your influence, it will do you no good.
<br />

<br />
It has helped immensely. I used to only be able to get over the static friction with both hands around it, but I don't need hands anymore, and I've been practicing with more distance as well. It's very interesting to note the effects of it all.

			Even though I wanted to believe, to an extent I used to believe that everybody was faking, but then that didn't make sense, why would so many people be living a lie, so I decided to believe.
<br />

<br />
When it happened though, i couldn't realy believe it, but now I take it for fact. Like gravity. 
<br />

<br />
I don't visualise though, I just look at it and relax.

			Yeah, this stuff about all this people living a lie togheter makes sense. well, i mean, DOESN'T make sense (to live a lie ^^)
<br />

<br />
but i think it isn't something you just come one day and say: &quot;well, people would lie, so it doesn't make sense, so i'll believe it&quot;
<br />
i think we can't control this like that, it takes time for us to get more open minded and acept, even if we want to. it's like choosing which girl you will fall in love with. you don't just think she is nice and good for you and start liking her. it takes some time and all (i mean if you didn't like her alredy), you don't control that.
<br />
when i first started to read articles in psipog and stuff, i felt like that myself. &quot;this people are faking&quot;, is the though you get when you read something like that. it's really a little &quot;voice&quot; in your head that shots that almost instantly. i tried to silence it, and give people &quot;a chance&quot;. with time i was able to believe what people said. but i didn't become someone credulous. actually, nobody here is credulous. we are all skeptic actually. GOOD skeptics. but still skeptics. cause we don't want to know we have been fooled, and we always want some more proof that it is all real.
<br />
im 18 by the way ^^

I guess. I suppose its all about believe its real and you can do it.
<br />
The more i read about quantum physics though, the more i believe in this stuff.
<br />
There are experiments that show this could be real but scientists are so confused about the results that they dont want to believe its real.

Just because it took you a year to move the psi-wheel doesn't mean you have no talent. That was ignorant. I commend your &quot;talent&quot; in patience.

He ment it was lame to say someone has no talent. As for a Serbian? It's someone who is native to Serbia.

			Well I kinda know what you're feeling, Mark. Mostly because I had no success with psiballs, or psychokinesis, etc etc etc ('cept micro-pk, i had some little success, but it might have been just luck) and because many people here start with the &quot;oh no omg this is impossible bla bla bla because this or that or this or that&quot;. Wasn't PK impossible for you before you began doing it?
<br />

<br />
And phasing, yea it sounds way too awesome to be true, however, who knows? I got shocked when I found Psipog... &quot;how can this stuff be true? Isn't this some childish forum with &quot;dbz&quot; / &quot;matrix&quot; / &quot;crouching tiger hidden dragon&quot; fanatic members?
<br />

<br />
I read the articles, and well, why would thousands of people lie about this?
<br />

<br />
Plus, I'm someone who can't disprove anything. My life is normal, but I'm not. I have a weird... how can I say... a weird &quot;thing&quot; which always stays with me. Like if I had a soul inside a soul, or something. I dunno. I know that there's something wrong... Very wrong with me. However, nothing special happened since I was born.
<br />

<br />
Of course, whoever is reading this will be saying &quot;this guy have some mental problems...&quot;. This is why I rarely speak about my life. I always end up with some people saying that I'm a teenager and this is normal and well, I know it's not normal, but what can I do? What can I do if no one will ever believe?
<br />

<br />
The same for psionics. It might be true, who knows? Some people say it's true, some say it's fake, but what can we do but believe for ourselves?
<br />

<br />
So, I'll keep trying, and I hope you keep at it as well.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
