			Hello all,
<br />
   I have tried fork/spoon bending many times, never with any (observable?) success. I've tried fork-you's method as well as others. However, with the exception of one time, I've always been by myself, and a &quot;party&quot; atmosphere with others around seems to be a key element in being able to do it (at least the first time). What I've done before is focus, watch a movie or something to hold my attention, and check periodically to see if it was warm/flexible yet. (I did an online chat party once, but that was basically useless to me for some reason.)
<br />
   How do you all go about getting friends/family/etc. to come to a party if you host it? &quot;Hey man! Want to come over tomorrow night? I'm having some other people over too, and we're going to try and use psychokinesis to bend some silverware!&quot; Most people (at least, most of my friends and family) would think that I'm a little bonkers. This would only be proven true in their minds if they did decide to come, and we were unsuccessful. 
<br />
   Provided you get people to come, do you lead/would I lead? I've never done this (successfully) before either, so why would I lead? Then again, I probably would be more knowledgable about it than anyone else there ...
<br />
   Any input and/or advice you all have would be greatly appreciated!
<br />
   God bless,
<br />
       Alex

			well, just keep practicing...but if i was you, i would wait until i could easily bend silverware before hosting a PK party...this is because imagine if you got like, 20 people to show up...but then after like, 3 hours STILL nobody has bent any silverware, then you'll look like a total jackass...at least you should be able to bend somthing before you do that so you can show eveyone your not crazy...also, are you makenzi phogerty? (i know someone with that name)

Thats the guy who invented the PK party.  He couldn't bend shit when he did his first one and 19 out of the 21 people succeded, so i say go for it.  I'm having one this week or next week.  me and my friend are planning it.  We're going to have about 20 people.  Perfect size IMO.

Read that WHOLE site.  IT's amazing and if you have the people, more than half of you WILL get it to work.  he's done 17000 people and 85% have done it.
