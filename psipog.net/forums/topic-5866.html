			I said ages ago that these 'Scan Me' threads are getting really annoying and pathetic, and i got shot down....So yeah. The forums are going to close down soon anyway, so there isn't really a point in adding new parts to it.

			One: Yes there is a forum for this, it's called Applied Psionics, if the posters are too dumb to realize that &quot;scan me&quot; falls under that, then they do not deserve a new section.

Two: ChorZ hurry up and die from the failed radiotherapy. Not meant to be rude, but your gf doesn't want you here and from what I hear you are an order following pussy who wants to follow the wishes of a &quot;love&quot; well get this, Love wouldn't exist if sex didn't. They are the same thing. You can't love a girl more than your best friend, well here, I have a philosophy that can make life alot easier for you...We call it nihilism.

I am a nihilist.

Are you?

Ok. let's back up...is it just me or was that extremely irrelevant and insulting? I can see why you got banned last time elkan.
<br />

<br />
edit: And by the way...what you just did then was advertise a religion, if that's what it is, even though Nihilism screws faith up the ass and discards it.
