			What do yo uall do to work on your concentration? Im working on doing the &quot;Energy pooling&quot;, the first thing in the Psi .PDF manual, and I can only concentrate on visualizing the psi for like 30 seconds, thn my mind wanders. 
<br />

<br />
I sort of need help with this, as it does not go well with the whole &quot;Practicing&quot; thing.
<br />

<br />
I can get the feeling in my abs, but I would like to be able to actually visualize something for more than just 30 seconds. I am repeating myself.
<br />

<br />
also, sorry if this is on the wrong board.

			meditation.
<br />

<br />
Or keep doing stuff that requires much of concentration, like reading or chess.
<br />

<br />
Or use tactile, that'll reduce the amount of concentration you'll need.

			There are many different ways to concentrate.   For pooling your psi in your abs, like neveza said use tactile visualization.  For other things, focus on your breathing or focus on your goal or one thought.  Practice makes perfect and each time you concentrate you will get better and the amount you can concentrate for will increase.

			One thing I've always wondered, does your mind have to be absolutely clear to practice psionics, or can you have the majority of your conciousness focused on the task and some of it on sidethoughts. Often when I meditate or practice psi, there's a tiny simidgeon of thought on something else... or running commentary, and despite all my efforts, its next to impossible for me to completely clear my mind, though i can focus 95% of my thoughts very well.

			For me, it's not absolute 100% concentration, I may think something else [example what was that noise heard from the street] and still keep my psiwheel spinning, BUT, it's a lot harder. I personally don't even meditate before practice, but I do it all the time when I'm practicing, hard to describe how I do it, but try it out yourself and I think you'll get the idea at that second. If you want to keep your concentration on 1 thing, then do like this : Everytime you lose your touch of thoughts, then force it back. Example : if you think of psiwheel, and your mind wanders to nearby glass of water, then bring it back to wheel, and start to figure out new stuff like what it seems like, how light/heavy it is etc. Find your best way, don't read topics like &quot;I must do this thing like this, and there's no other way to succeed on it&quot;. Almost on every case, own way is the best way, feel what suits for you, and ask yourself &quot;Am I good when doing like this?&quot;. Learn to know your innerself [sub-c]

			I too, don't  meditate at all before performing psionic activities.  I just give my full attention to the task at hand.  I find it easiest once all my focus in on the wheel or whatever it is I happen to be practicing with.
