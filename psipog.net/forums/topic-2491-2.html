I know you know that, but your status tends to give weight when being viewed by the other posters. When you ask me to &quot;verify&quot; and &quot;back up&quot; my obscure comments, I assume you mean I should do this by coming up with some &quot;facts&quot; regarding the apparent coincidences and their connection to the universe.
<br />

<br />
Let me tell you sir, language is a very dull and ineffective medium of communication.
<br />

<br />
I have simply, over time, come to recognize what pagans and newagers refer to as &quot;signs&quot;. If you open your mind, the universe will speak to you, using symbols. It will use your environment and your experiences within the environment to reflect its messages in a way that a person can potentially grasp. The type of understanding required to see and interpret these messages is beyond any widely recognized method of communication.
<br />

<br />
I possess this type of understanding. Sometimes I see the message but can't interpret it, other times I can interpret it. 
<br />

<br />
I am not claiming to be special or above anyone. I am not making a statement like this to sound big and whoopy-dooish. I am simply telling Roy and anyone else who might be interested, that I cannot make you understand what I already do. You have to do that yourself.
<br />

<br />
PS: If you think that sounds guruish, then oh well.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

As far as carrying weight as a moderator is concerned, yes, I do admit that is true.  There are times when I post and people who agree with my post or like me (for my sparkling personality, no doubt) will go the whole &quot;Roy pwned that guy&quot; route.  I can't speak for these individuals, though I do appreciate their enthusiasm.  Of course I'm not in possession of some special knowledge far above others at Psipog, and I'm even wrong sometimes (very rarely though).
<br />

<br />
Although I don't put full stock in what you say (personally), that is a suitable response, and one that I approve of regardless of whether or not I agree with it.  It may not be filled with facts, but you are at least attempting to explain yourself rather than posting one-sentence responses or brief obscure references
<br />
.
<br />
This is Psipog, and we try to, through discussion and some of our rules, convey the sense that any claim you (not just you personally) make can be, and probably should be, challenged to some degree.  Some may prefer a full-on onslaught of skepticism, while may just want clarification.  I'm somewhere in the middle.

			First, this is really off-topic now. I can see a lock in the near future. (One of those big FAT padlocks that can't be broken or opened except by the key!)
<br />

<br />
Second, the belief in &quot;signs&quot;, while often quite legitimate (I believe in signs myself), is (in my opinion) bordering on religion, and we all know what the mods are like with religion...
<br />

<br />
I think we should either end this thread here, before it gets locked, or civilize ourselves, to prevent it from being locked in the first place.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">[EDIT: Roy, I again agree with you. I also thank you for helping to civilize this thread.]</span>

			Thank you for reminding me why you're a moderator in the first place Roy.
<br />

<br />
sgtpsion... the principle of cause and effect has nothing to do with religion. At some point, we'll come to a stage in science when it can be proven. It is one of the many mechanisms that help this universe tick.
<br />
If anything, you could consider it as philosophy. Certainly not religion though.

			Good of you to remind me of what you meant when you referred to &quot;signs&quot;. I stand corrected!
