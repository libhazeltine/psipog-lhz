			This sounds like a crazy idea.... but.
<br />

<br />
What if we had a religious section of the forum? I know it would be very controversial. But just note this:
<br />

<br />
Most of us don't have anywhere but here for an outlet to talk about psionics. Which means most of us don't have anywhere at all to talk about religious integration of psionics.
<br />

<br />
So we have all these crazy ideas, and notions we wish we could get ideas on, and people's thoughs and input but we have no where to go. Obviously the rules would hold the same so it will be monitored and people who would just be trash talking and trolling would get temp to perm banned if they do so. But it would be something unique and I think it would ease this tension of like being afraid to mention something religious. Plus it will keep the religious talk out of OTHER threads.
<br />

<br />
Thank you for your time.

			here is how I would make it. 1 religious board, sub-bords for the major religions and just use the general bord for cults, sects, and the lesser known religions.

			All relgions are technically cults. Its just some are more comercialized. You'd be a fool to categorize them, it would just bring trolls.

			you could always have it up for a trial run, and if all goes well then keep it up for awhile. If it doesn't go well, then just take them down.
<br />
it may possibly be something worth trying at least.

			PsiPog has actively chosen not to be involved with most kinds of spirituality or religion. One of the reasons for this is that most religions have their own views on psionics, which causes conflicts. These conflicts, so far, have not led to anything positive, except for PsiPog setting rules against it.
<br />

<br />
Also, the focus of PsiPog is not spirituality or belief, but psionics 'as is'. We do not question your religion in any way, and accept any beliefs you might have. We ask you, though, to keep it to yourself as much as possible.
<br />

<br />
If you are interested in holding religious or spiritual debates, there are a ton of other websites for that. If you insist that you must discuss religion with another member of PsiPog, make sure that they are also up for it, and avoid doing it through PsiPog.
<br />

<br />
As for creating a religious section on the forum to keep religious and/or spiritual debates out of other threads; such [religious/spiritual] posts must not exist on the forum _at all_, and will be deleted on sight. Although there might be a few exceptions to this rule, they are slim enough that there is no real reason for listing them in this post.
<br />

<br />
If you decide to come into the chat, however, there may be times when religious/spiritual debates are actually allowed. This only happens when the moderators feel that the chatters can handle it, though. Please see <a href="chat.php" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/chat.php</a> .

			Great post Mannen.
<br />

<br />
Also, there are basically two factors of why we don't support religious discussions.
<br />

<br />
1. We find that psionics operates independently of religious beliefs - i.e., we know athiest psions, Christian psions, Buddhist psions, Satanic psions, etc...
<br />

<br />
2. Some parents only allow their kids to come to PsiPog BECAUSE it doesn't talk about religion - and that's completely reasonable!  If we start to incorporate religion, then we are cutting off a part of the audience.  Yes, we might get more involvement from other people, but I don't want to lose those few who it would isolate.
<br />
