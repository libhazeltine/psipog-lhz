huh?
<br />

<br />
okay anyways, yay im slow but i finaly understand the &quot;save the cheerleader, save the world&quot; thing that was <span style="font-style: italic">burned</span> into out minds hehe. Correct me if i'm wrong. If sylar would have gotten to the cheerleader he would have been pretty damb hard to kill or just defeat of whatever. Since he uses his USELESS gift to er... figure out complex thingies (like clockwork or the brain [hehe]) to take some essential part of every &quot;Heroes&quot; brain and idk: implant it into his own? Thats hot he got the even dorkier teleknitics power isnt it?
<br />

<br />
I was talking to my friend jess about how this guy who attended the thanksgiving party at my school looked exactly like sylar and she said she saw some reseblance but i thought they were exactly the same like i acualy thought it was him! i was like wow wtf? i didnt catch the guys name but she tells me this guy is also on top cheff wich im going to try and record sometime soon. this was pointless but im just like the pointless information guy so there you go

			Zomg, it seems to me every episode = ten times better then the last. I feel bad for Hiro, unable to save Charlie. I like that small speech at the end where he said the power he has is much bigger than him... does seem true. The ability to bend space and time is a very big ability, more then just plain flight XD Though flight is amazing too.
<br />

<br />
I do think it will be DL too, though it may not be. Being that stupid Micah told him everything. He should like... make the car stall or something with his power, hah! I don't think it could be Hiro, Nathan, or Peter... well actually it can't be since there is a future Hiro, Nathan won the election in November, and Peter was known by future Hiro &quot;You look different without your scar&quot;... Claire obviously not since she just got saved to &quot;save the world&quot;... I don't feel like naming more though I probably could.

He was already in an agitated state, no telling what might trigger his abilities when he's already keeping an eye out for danger.
<br />

<br />
It could very well go right through him harmlessly, without him even realizing it.
<br />

<br />
So um, can I gloat now, about knowing that Sylar wasn't Peter?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
EDIT: You can find the episodes online.  I found all current 10 of them on LimeWire.

he probably was able to use sylars power, only problem is that sylars power isnt TK, its some ability to figure out how to take others power.

			Yeah, in the beginning, Sylar had a power that allowed him to understand really complex things (or something like that anyway) like the human brain, so he could take other hero's powers.

Also, if you want all the episodes, go to <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com" target="_blank">www.dailymotion.com</a> and search &quot;heroes&quot;.
