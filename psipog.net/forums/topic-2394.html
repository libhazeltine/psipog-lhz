			I was reading through the &quot;Is psychokinesis real?&quot; thread, and I started wondering, why do so many people waste their time making fake videos to try and prove us wrong? Do they just have too much time on their hands, or do they all have superiority complexes? What's WITH them?
<br />

<br />
Also, those who accuse us of being frauds have next to no basis for their claims. Why would we lie about being Psions? We make no money off it (well, most of us don't), and the publicity is generally more bad than good. So why would we be frauds about it?
<br />

<br />
To be completely honest, yes, there are some frauds out there. But to my understanding, most of us here at PsiPog are legit. Not all, but most. And I'm just wondering, why some people are so hell-bent against that fact that they'll waste their time making fake videos (when we all know they can be faked) and start flame wars that just rob the forums of bandwidth?
<br />

<br />
Can someone help me to come up with an answer?

But seriously, we are going against their current beliefs.  It is just like Galileo vs. the church.  Galileo figured out that the earth was not the middle of the universe and was spreading that idea around and the church put him under house arrest because he was going against their teachings.  Same thing with what we are doing.  Its just human nature.  To have a real, 100% covered arguement, you have to understand both sides and be able to argue both sides.

			Stop dividing people.  Remove the &quot;us vs. them&quot; mentallity.  How do you know it isn't the other way around, where we are the church, and the skeptics are Galileo?  Because we know the &quot;truth&quot; and they are just fools?
<br />

<br />
Just because someone disagrees with you doesn't make them an idiot.  One thing that I've learned is that people believe things for a reason.  Not just to be difficult and annoying, or that they're incapable of understanding your point of view.  Skeptics believe what they do for a reason, and they do so intelligently.  You can either sit there and complain about how wrong they are, and how right you are - or you can take their different perspective constructively and understand their position and use their ideas to benefit yourself.
<br />

<br />
The skeptical mindset is sharp, and the ideas are useful.  It's GOOD to doubt strange experiences, and ask: &quot;is there a way I can confirm this is happening?  Is it possible that I'm hallucinating this somehow?  Am I fooling myself?  Are there alternate explainations that make sense?&quot;.  You <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> be asking these questions.
<br />

<br />
You don't know the truth.  I don't know the truth.  PsiPog doesn't have the truth.  Skeptics don't know the truth.  You need to drop the self-righteous belief patterns, and step up.  We are in this together, and even though skeptics disagree with us, we are <span style="font-style: italic">all</span> in the pursuit of truth.

			Maybe I was misunderstood. I wasn't criticizing skeptics or skepticism, because those things are good. I was criticizing those people who are so stuck-up that they make an account on the forums, and make fake videos, just to try and preach &quot;the truth&quot; that we're wrong and they're right.

It's the arrogance I'm bitching about.

Maybe I should've made that clearer earlier.

I agree with you Peebs, the whole I'm right you're wrong mentality is bad if we want people to take us seriously.(there were a few posts about skeptics doing that so now we are no different) As long as <span style="font-weight: bold">we</span> know that this real because <span style="font-weight: bold">we</span> tried it and succeeded.(some of us greatly) If they don't want to believe then let them not believe and let them express their opinion.....I'm positive after a while it won't be 'us vs them'(reminds me of Pink Floyd) it will just be 'us' and 'we'.....

			I can relate to sgtpsion, I keep wondering why do people do stupid things.. but what is stupid to the eyes of them? They could think i'm doing something stupid too. It's no different. In our own eyes, it's what we believe is right, and it seems like few till try to see both sides.  To those that act like an idiot to you, just leave them be.  Why complain?

I find this to be enticing a response from the person you are talking about, drawing them into a flame battle. However, since you did follow up with a question, I'll give what little input I have. This is in no way speaking for or about anybody except for general archetypes I've seen in my experience.
<br />

<br />

<br />
1: Assholes: People with such firm commitment to their views that it borderlines on zealotry. They are right, you are wrong, end of story. Discussion with them makes you an idiot in thier mind. Usually degrades in an insult tossing match, and is enough to piss off the most level headed. What they say has NOTHING to do with what you think, but only the views they already have. It is not worth your energy to approach them.
<br />
2: The Teacher: Some people actually like to educate others. They believe that thier truth, which is usually widely accepted, is the way that things should be done. The usually confront opposition from 'wrong' people in a way that they consider to be harmless and with understanding, but come off as condescending and pretensious. Either way, they do look down on you in a sense, and it is therefore difficult to get them to hear you out on anything. The best way to approach them is with confidence, intelligence and cold, hard, solid proof.
<br />
3: The Equal: They understand you are on equal ground. Although they believe in something they are willing to challenge thier beliefs and see things from all sides. They are easy to talk to and in the end are fun to debate with, win or lose.
<br />

<br />
Of course, there are in betweens, omissions, and all that junk, but these are usually what you find in opposition to your beliefs and find a need to confront.
<br />

<br />
As to why they do the things they do, some people believe beliefs are worth fighting for, and some do it in different ways.
