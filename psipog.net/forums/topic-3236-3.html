It's the same as someone coming in here and telling you that those videos of Psiwheels are fake or some illusion.

It's okay to believe that he is doing psychokinesis on some of his demonstrations and it's okay to believe it's just an illusion. But it would be better just to say it's possible either way.

			You know, just because he's a magician doesn't mean he's serious about convincing people that he's really magic. Too many people are approaching these illusions like a puzzle or like they are real demonstration, which they are not. They are entertainment, and are meant to mystifying and cool. Apollo, I appreciate your intentions of posting that clip, but it's not nice to give away a magician's secret.

Still, magicians are tricksters, not wizards; don't get the two confused.

If Criss Angel really levitated using pk from one building to another, then why does he need to use a gimmick to do a little levitation from thr ground and up to the chair? Wouldn't he tell us that he is doing pk instead of illusions? I don't care if he really can do pk (that's even better if he could), but &quot;EVERY&quot; trick he does can be illusion.

			I've seen him do a couple things he's done (in person) that without wearing long sleeves are frankly not possible. I saw that unless he comes on here and says one way or the other, no one here really knows. We all have fairly strong convictions, but we don't really know, outside of the above video.

  I know he made it. I also happen to know that the DVD that teaches that trick costs $100USD, and that trick was the biggest secret in the entertainment community until it was released. I'm not accusing you of being like that stupid masked magician guy, just a little impolite. I would've posted a link to the website that sells the DVD, personally.
<br />
  And on topic,
<br />

<br />
You don't think that when someone sticks a candy wrapper to glass with static as a joke that they're doing it with TK, do you? Most people don't perform telekinesis as a party trick, and the same goes for real levitation. Criss Angel is doing this stuff to entertain us, not for a practical reason (although if you could float from one building to another, that would be pretty practical).

			I generally ignore anyone who shows off their abilities on TV. It's just a personal policy, as most of them are either frauds or illusionists, and you can't be certain about it unless you shell out loads of cash.

			Yea, I knew from first watching his show that he was a fake. I could that he was just putting on a show. Anytime he's doing stuff that requires a lot of physical strength, like lifting the taxi, he gives it his first try and fails, and succeeds on the second try. That doesn't make sense in the least bit, your muscles are more worn down on the second try, so his best bet would be on the first try. There are guys with a lot of physical strength that can do incredible things. There's a guy that can bend tools with his hands, like big wrenches and such. I think it's like wrestling, fun to watch even though it's mostly fake.
