			Just out of curiosity, what effect would energy drinks have on making psi balls, or just gathering energy for that matter? I drink a lot (and i mean a lot) of red bull and i don't know whether it's hindering my psi practice of helping it.

			Whatever makes your brain work overtime.. then again, like most psi related things, you need to focus. If caffiene helps you focus on one thing and one thing only, then go for it. At a glance, caffiene would probably cause alot of people to focus on everything at one time, they would be very alert and easily distracted.

			Interesting. I never though of it making you concentrate on <span style="font-style: italic">everything</span> before. Well, ive been drining red bull before i started so i dont know what its like before.Maybe i'll stop drinking it for a week and see what happens. Probably won't survive though since i'm pretty much addicted to the sh*tting stuff. If anything though, it would give you more energy reserve.

			anything with vitamin b6 will help your concentration at astronomical rates. The only problem is the illusion of depleted concentration below your normal due to the vitamin being digested and emptied from your system. Then your concentration goes back to normal.  every once in a while when i have off days and have an energy drink with 100% b6 it will help. But if you dont need it then certainly dont use it.

			Red bull has b6 in it? Oh yeah so it does, according to the back of the can it also has b12........I find it quite sad that I had a can of it on my desk. One goes, one comes to take it's place. It's like they never leave. Apparentely, and i'm not sure whether this is just a little stupid rumour, but i heard that it also has ox sperm in it too. Is that true???? Becasue if it is, i'm suprised i havn't f*cking concieved yet!!! Im a boy btw.

			Yup, we had to research something for social studies once, an invention or something and someone did it on coca-cola <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Anyway, I like to get energy drinks as  much as I can <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  They usually seem to help me, but tonight I had a Monster AND a red bull and there wasn't an effect for either <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />.

My mom has these B12 strips.  I've been taking one about every other day since I found out about them, but they've only been in the mornings, so I haven't really been able to test it, but the state I go in after I take one might help.

Vitamin B12 Benefits - Functions in the Body 
<br />
Like vitamin B6, vitamin B12 is essential for the production and regeneration of red blood cells. It is also needed for the proper functioning of the central nervous system. It improves concentration, memory, and balance, and relieves irritability. Vitamin B12 is necessary for proper utilisation of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins for body building. It promotes growth and increases appetite in children. This vitamin is also involved in many vital metabolic ,and enzymatic processes, including the metabolism of folic acid. If the immune cells made in the bone marrow are to mature into active disease-fighters, a sufficient quantity of vitamin B12 and folic acid are necessary.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
vitamin b12 is your proteins and fuel for other functions of the body. It also helps with concentration...

<br />
Vitamin B6 Benefits - Functions in the body
<br />
Pyridoxine or vitamin B6 aids in food assimilation and protein and fat metabolism, especially in the metabolism of essential fatty acids. It activates many enzymes and enzyme systems. It is involved in the production of antibodies which protect against bacterial diseases. Pyridoxine helps in the healthy functioning of the nervous system and brain. It is essential for the normal reproductive process and healthy pregnancies.
<br />

<br />
This vitamin prevents nervous and skin disorders, provides protection against a high cholesterol level, certain types of heart disease, and diabetes. It prevents tooth decay. Vitamin B6 regulates the balance between sodium and potassium in the body, which is vitally important for normal body functions. It is also required for absorption of vitamin B12 and for the production of hydrochloric acid and magnesium.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
when you read vitamin b6's benifets it doesnt say anything about improved concentration. This leads me to beleive that, in order to get the concentration benifet, you need both vitamins b6, and b12. B6 is found in nuts, breads, grains. And b12 is found in animal products such as meats, stock ect. Proteins help with the absorption of both vitamins and acids break it down. So if you want the full effects, breakfast could consist of eggs, some wheat toast and orange juice. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Im getting way off subject, but energy drinks contain other things that arnt necessarly needed at the specific time. So the best way to help your concentration, without a period of down time, is to have a balanced diet. Vegans, it not wise to not have atleast alittle animal products or forified foods with the vitamins due to what it helps and what it wont help if you dont get this vitamin. I know it says no medical advice, which this treads close to, but i also think i am just summarizing what my sources also say. So all in all, eat a balanced diet kiddies <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			well ya. But the three meals a day is to make sure you get everything you need with out deficientcy or overloading. If you drink a red bull then you get everything you need too fast, which im sure would have adverse effects. Balanced diet is the way, with red bulls if you cant eat at the time, or if something has you down. Dont depend on it.

			no problem... meditating to not drink one when the desire is strong would be a good way to go. After a while the illusion of you having less energy after the effects ware off will slowly distort your mind into thinking that it is real, when in reality, your just used to the red bull's effects, and think that the waring off will cause a slump. Meditation will help your mind more than an overload of these vitamins. Yes it does help though, and i have done it. Its just the dependancy will occure when you have the feeling of being &quot;weaker&quot; after the effect wares off.
