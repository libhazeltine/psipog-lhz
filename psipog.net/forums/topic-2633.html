			I'm starting up again on the psi-wheel after a long absence(like a year, background for me is in the &quot;Hellos&quot; section <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />), and I'm having a problem. I can make the psi-wheel like, twitch, or move, but no more than a quarter of a rotation so far.
<br />

<br />
And whenever that happens I either think &quot;yay&quot; or &quot;it was the wind&quot; ...My brain is arguing with itself about the validity of it all. Anyways, how can I get it to continue its rotation? I remember back in the day at times I had it moving semi-fast.
<br />

<br />
Edit: Lol...In a bit of frustration I told myself &quot;I will hold my breath until I move it a quarter of a rotation&quot; and nearly blacked out before giving up &gt;_&lt; But I did move it an 8th of a rotation like twice &gt;_&lt; stupid brain is just playing with me now *shakes fist angrily*

I also had the &quot;problem&quot; of my mind finding excuses to what it could be, try to ignore that and focus on your goal.
<br />
ow yeah and keep practicing.

			Ooh, perhaps you're aiming too much for the 'getting back to where I was before' goal, rather than 'getting it to work at all' and then building up from there.
<br />

<br />
Try to drop all your expectations of what _Should_ be happening in your opinion, and lose the preconcieved ideas from your past experiences, etc. Just let it happen, try to give the 'power' over to your subconscious in this situation.
<br />

<br />
Take on the mentality of  discovery / playful-ness, and being focused - rather than frustrated and annoyed with the psiwheel and yourself. Both factors lead to a whole lot of nothing!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
As for the arguing with yourself over results, they should drop away if you take on a less frustrated mindframe. And getting results again will help quite a bit! 
<br />

			I have a suggestion : 
<br />

<br />
When the psiwheel move. Think that it is always because of you, even if it is mainly the wind or whatever. Follow every movement with your eyes.
<br />

<br />
If it dosen't move, move it slightly with your finger and follow movement.
<br />

<br />
It works for me
<br />

<br />
ciao
