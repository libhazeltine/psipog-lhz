			Perceptionengine.com Mission Statement
<br />

<br />
1) Perceptionengine.com will be a website dedicated to presenting and understanding information that relates to the human mind and how we perceive and interact with the world around us.  Subjects contained therein include, but are not limited to, extrasensory perception, philosophy of mind, self-improvement, and etc.
<br />

<br />
2) The website will be accompanied by an IRC chat room as well as a forums section.  The forums will not be immediately available, but will be instated as the site (and the site’s visitors) grow.
<br />

<br />
3) The website’s staff will be held to a very high standard to ensure that visitors receive a valuable and informative experience each and every time they visit Perceptionengine.com.  All moderators will be expected to follow the rules that they enforce, and should scrutinize each other to ensure that no one is going beyond their bounds.
<br />

<br />
4) Articles can and will be submitted to Perceptionengine.com to be posted.  The authors of the articles will retain the copyright title to their work, and can have their work removed from Perceptionengine.com at any time if they request.  Perceptionengine.com will screen each article submission for quality and content and reserves the right to post or refuse to post submitted articles at our own discretion.
<br />

<br />
5) Perceptionengine.com would also like to host content other than articles.  User-made artwork, music, or movies will also have a place at this website since we encourage all users to express themselves through the diverse artistic mediums.
<br />

<br />
6) Skepticism is encouraged whenever any ESP topics arise.  This should not cause venomous debate, but instead, open and intelligent discussion of the facts and opinions at hand.  Being wrong is much better than being self-deluded, please remember that.
<br />

<br />
In case you stopped reading halfway through this blurb, and decided to check out perceptionengine.com, you'll have noticed that it doesn't exist yet.  This is because it is a website that I plan on creating.  I do not intend for this to be a replacement of Psipog, I feel that is impossible and inappropriate.  It is also not related to Peebrain's upcoming new site, although I'm sure some of our goals overlap.  This is something I thought long and hard about doing, and I think that initiating a website that deals with all topic matter relating to the human mind/brain would be a fun undertaking.
<br />

<br />
I can't run a website alone, and I don't intend to.  I'd like to extend an open invitation to whoever reads this.  I'm looking for web programmers, staff, authors, and anyone else who can chip in or just wants to lend some form of support for this soon-to-be website.  I hope that with your help, together we can create a dynamite website that is a conglomerate of so many interesting topics and promotes online interaction of different viewpoints and perspectives.
<br />

<br />
If you are interested, please private message me through the forums.  I'll be honest though, the first attribute that I will be looking for is knowledge in web programming since I have literally none, lol.  I appreciate everyone reading this, and I want to thank you in advance for any replies.
<br />

<br />
Edit: Also, if you want to reply in this thread for any questions, comments, suggestions, complaints, or whatever, please feel free to do so.

			This is a basic outline of the staff for PerceptionEngine.com.
<br />

<br />
Manager - That's me.  I'm not going to be something like a boss, at least not in the traditional sense.  My goal to begin with is to assemble a team of highly motivated individuals who I can work with to establish PerceptionEngine.com.  After the site is up and running, I want to discuss website policy with the team so that we can develop a system of semi-autonomy, meaning that website staff will be able to work in their respective areas without having to get approval from me or anyone else with every stop of the process.  I'll definitely help out by doing whatever web programming I can (but I must warn you, my knowledge base is very rudimentary), and also by being a forum/chat moderator as well as a researcher.  Before and for a little while after the site is up and running, my primary motivation will be as the Manager, but after the site has been running smoothly for a little while, we can, together, develop a system for autonomy and then being a Manager will become secondary, at which point I can focus on helping everyone out by being a mod and writing articles.
<br />

<br />
Administrators - These are the tech guys.  They need to have a decent knowledge of web programming.  HTML, PHP, Flash, any of that stuff is good.  These are the guys and gals that I'm looking for first and foremost since a well designed website requires programming knowledge.
<br />

<br />
Chatroom Moderators - The job description for these individuals is obvious.  They are to help promote a proper atmosphere in the chatroom, as well as help to direct inquisitive chatters to the necessary resources on the website.  They will also, should the occasion arise, deal out warnings or punishments if chat rules are broken.
<br />

<br />
Forum Moderators - Same as above, except for the forums.  The forums will not be up for some time, though.
<br />

<br />
Contributing Authors - These are individuals who will submit written articles to PerceptionEngine.com.  The authors will retain all rights to their work, and may request to have their work removed from the website should they deem it necessary for whatever reason.  The staff of PerceptionEngine.com reserves all rights to deny any article submissions.
<br />

<br />
Researchers - Researchers are simply contributing authors who have consistently provided intelligent works, and express an interest in accepting assignments from the staff of PerceptionEngine.com.  For example, if Person A and Person B are both researchers, and I feel that the site is lacking in articles addressing body language, I may ask Person A and Person B to team up and write an article about different hand gestures and what they mean.  Researchers are not obligated to accept any requests for articles or assignments from the PE staff.  They are just in the esteemed position to be considered by the PE staff as excellent writers who can provide articles or other written works to help fill areas of PE that may be lacking.
<br />

<br />
Contributing Musician/Artist/Filmmaker - These are the same as contributing authors, only using different media.
<br />

<br />
Again, if you are interested in any of the above, send me a private message, and if you have any suggestions, feel free to reply in this thread.  
<br />

<br />
I'm getting a lot of good replies guys, I really appreciate the support and your willingness to volunteer!  If I don't message you back immediately, please be patient.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
