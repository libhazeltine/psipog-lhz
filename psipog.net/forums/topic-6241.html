			Hey, many of you may remember me. I got some flak some time ago when I merely asked about a construct shape, not use. Well, I'm back.
<br />

<br />
I haven't gone over EVERY SINGLE topic since I left, but I have gone over a few- and the forums are in sad shape indeed.
<br />

<br />
It seems idiocy has overrun this place.
<br />

<br />
While there ARE people that DO have a good knowledge base and show it intelligently... there seems to be a mich higher amount of stupidity.
<br />

<br />
Back when I was a kid, that kind of stupidity was punishable by burning at the stake. Now, it seems no one gives a rat's behind.
<br />

<br />
Other than that, anything important I missed?

...which one do I fall under?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Well welcome back, I'll admit I'm ingorant in these things. (can't even move a pinwheel yet  <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" /> ). The site is closeing, I think about maybe a month or even this month or so (don't take my word on it) Peebrain is going to make a new site for just OBE I beleive for spirital needs. 
<br />

<br />
Anything else I can help you with? (or try)

Tankdown: you fall under a different category; the honest-yet-not-great-at-PSI member.
<br />

<br />
So the forums are closing? Is it because of the idiocy? or other reasons?

			it sucks because back when I joined, I did learn ALOT from this forum. Not all of it worked for me personally, but not so much of it was rediculous like most of it looks now.

But there's still some solid stuff here, sad to see it go.

			No, its closeing because Peebrain has no other use for it. The reason why Peebrain had this whole system up was to prove psinoics exist. A gieger counter showed that it does exist. Seeing that Peebrain has toke to myself that he wants to find a deeper meaning in life through OBE so hes going to make a new spirital website. He hasent made the website yet.
<br />

<br />
So no its not for stupidly.

			I haven't seen anything in your posts to suggest idiocy at all.
<br />

<br />
But I've been working a bit on my own with PSI... though some of the things I found would make me seem close to fluffy(ok, ONE thing... but three people have helped me test it, so I'm PRETTY sure it's not just my mind). 
<br />

<br />
If PsiPog is shutting down, I might have to make my own forum for this.
<br />

<br />
Well, at least Peebrain got the evidence he needed.

It's a shame there are few people here with any remaining mental integrity, as I very much enjoy sending healing energy when I can.

Although I refuse to help these &quot;Narutards&quot;, as you call them. I fix flesh, but nobody can reverse brain damage that bad.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			It's bound to happen. The word of &quot;Archiving&quot; means to most people &quot;I'm dead, now leave! NOW!&quot; so, most of the smart members and moderators aren't around anymore or have other things in their life. I surprised how many people think that psipog is dead or unusable.
