			I had a few interesting ideas:
<br />

<br />
1: Couldn't you just use some form of biotelekinesis to live forever?
<br />

<br />
2: Maybe kids with imaginary friends at a young age would be better at subcoscious communication.
<br />

<br />
3: I read an article once (don't ask me where) about a study where two groups of kids were tested, each with equal experience, which was probably zero, in basketball.  Every day for a week, I don't know for how long per day, one group was asked to shoot baskets and the other was asked to pretend to shoot baskets.  At the end of the week, the ones who shot baskets in their minds were able to get more accurate shots.  Maybe this could apply to psionics practice.  I know psionics isn't so much a physical skill, but maybe just pretending that you are stronger at psychokinesis, imagining yourself using it, than you are would make you stronger.  No, I don't mean pretend you can lift a car.  Just move a piece of string or even a tin foil wheel.
<br />

<br />
4: If younger kids are introduce to psionics at a youg age, without even knowing the possibility that it might not exist, if the kid's parents are moderately skilled psionicists who could use psychokinesis and communicative telepathy, maybe that kid would grow up to be an extremely powerful psionicist.  I remember an article being discussed at this forum about, I think kindergarteners who were asked to to throw imaginary baseballs at some bottles that were set up, and some were able to knock them over.

			1.  Possible, not probable
<br />
2.  Maybe...
<br />
3.  Good Idea
<br />
4.  I would like to try that, if/when I grow older and have kids.

The most interesting thing to me was the Bio-PK but I don't want to say anymore about it because I think it has something wrong with it in rule aspects or something. If it does, please correct us in a nice and respectful manner.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">It would be hard to slow the death of ALL those cells, and hard to raise your creation of new cells so that your body does not die. Besides, even if you did prolong your life for a long time, someone would shoot you. I don't know why. It would just happen. You can't expect to be around forever and not die. 
<br />

<br />
     Lets say that 2/5 people die because of things that are uncurable or unstoppable except by Chuck Norris. That means that if you lived 5 lifetimes of 80 years (400 yrs.), then in two of those lifetimes you would meet death in a form that psionics could not stop. Unless you're Chuck Norris. So, you could live for 3 lifetimes (240 yrs.) without dying. Or maybe you'd die after 80 years. Or 160.
<br />

<br />
Of course, this is all probability. and the 2/5 ppl was a guess. So don't quote this. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  Except in this thread. But don't flame me. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I saw Bob Barker beating up Chuck Norris downtown.

Sorry, I just had to. But seriously, those are pretty good ideas overall. Especially the basketball and imaginary games ones. I think I'll try that.

			Good ideas, but I think a childs mind can do that mainly because they can imagine.

			You just basically stated what we all already knew.
<br />
1: Of course it's possible but it would take some high level programming.
<br />
2: It depends on what kind of things the imaginary friend was saying to them. If they were saying things that a subconscious would say than you're right. I think it is just another representation of theirselves maybe related to their subconscious or just bullshit.
<br />
3: Everybody already knew that. I think there's even been studies done showing that muscle strength can increase from mentally lifting weights or mentally running.
<br />
4: Everybody already knew that. Children are very moldable and actually the best psions are those taught early because they do not need to overcome the belief factor if they start later in life.
