			Hi i know that the videos people post are not meant to be there to say &quot;hey see it can be done&quot; but they all seem to be the same. The movement of objects always seems to have a magnetised look to it. Im not typing this as a sceptic but as a person whol would like to see some pretty decent footage. It would be nice if someone could post a video of them performing telekinesis when you can see both their hands and what is under the table, so the only way it could be faked would be if they blow it or they use a computer to edit it.

			I've also noticed this.  In fact if you get two magnets and push one with the other (with their magnetic push) it looks just like someone moving it with PK.   
<br />
Even large objects (like JoeTs PK clip where he slides the magazine) seem to move like this.
<br />

<br />
Pretty interesting.  Makes you think.

			One that I watched a few years ago, when I first came across PsiPog, the shadows didn't seem to match up with whatever was floating.  I don't remember exactly what it was, so I could be pulling up a modified memory, but I think me and a friend agreed on it.

			lol. Try putting the camera on a tripod or something and as for the hole puncher you cant blow it but its a big block of metal, easily affected by magnets. I dont doubt its real just hard to believe at times.

			You need a strong magnet for that and besides, you cant push metal with magnets just attract it.
<br />
Tinfoil is not affected by magnets, I tried that out a lot of times.

We have those videos in the media section.
<br />

<br />
And no matter what the video shows, it's possible to fake it.  Even if the video is an hour long and shows every angle, and inspects every object, with high resolution, it's STILL possible to fake it.
<br />

<br />
So it's pointless to ask for a video that &quot;can't be faked&quot; because ANY video can be faked.

			I know anything can be faked. Its just morebeneficial when you think that its really real then when you think maybe that was done with magnets, if you know what i mean better for your belief in telekinesis.

			yes but that is also why people say that the video is not to show that tk is real.  The only way you could possibly KNOW a video is real, is if you were there and you could see it, feel it, analyse it.  Other than that, you just have to trust the person who makes the movie.

			i know they say it cant be proven i understand that. It just make you think &quot;maybe i can do it&quot; more when the video seems pretty real and you dont have doubts. better to believe its real then its not.
