Hello Reputator,
<br />

<br />
My advice to you is to keep your head held high and continue your practice. I'm thinking your bringing your personal feeling with other things into your practice. Which is not good. Your practice may not be bringing results in due to your head being bombarded by other thoughts and feelings. I suggest that before you practice PK that you first either meditate or relax before you jump into it.
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />

<br />
ah, good advice, thanks. Right now I haven't done much. I'm taking a break I guess, which is probably good for me. A little recharge time, and hey, if personal feelings or distractions from my life are interfering, it's a good idea to give myself as much time as possible to sort them all out. Don't want to needlessly overwhelm myself with multiple stressful endeavors.

			First I would like to say, good post JoeT.
<br />

<br />
Second, I would like to suggest something to you.  Understanding that your friend is blind, it would be an even GREATER experiment to have her practice RV, right?  Or perhaps (this may fall under combat, with no intentions whatsoever) have her use your mind to see the world through your eyes.  Not sure if you are skilled at RV or telepathy, but I just thought it might be interesting.

			So far every time ive practiced with the psiwheel, I put a plastic thing over it, I think its better to start with something over it. The reason why is because when I first started learning to skateboard, I was taught to learn to oliie while moving, because if you do that, you can ollie while both moving and stationary. Everybody I know that has learned an ollie while stationary has difficulty doing it while moving, because you almost have to relearn it. So I figure its the same with the psiwheel, learn with plastic/glass over it first= Being able to spin it with, or without the glass. Learn without the glass= Being able to spin it only without the glass.
<br />

<br />
Oh and by the way, good post Joet  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .

<br />
well first off, it's my first reply in the forum. my name is Alex, i'm from israel, got to this forum after searching the net for info on PK,
<br />
i found JoeT's and NI's words very convincing, as ones i was a skeptic.
<br />

<br />
so i was up to trying a bit of psiwheel turning myself, and as to my quote of pyro, i did start off ollie while stationary. and realized that was a mistake.
<br />
now i did start of, trying the psiwheel without a cover, and got it spinning after some time and concentration, pretty hard for me to believe it still, my biggest problem is the &quot;it couldn't have been me spinning that&quot; having thoughts about heat and stuff. trying the psiwheel while 'undercover' still has no effect what so ever for me..
<br />
but i've onely been trying for about two weeks. the only thing keeping me trying is that i'd just love to prove myself wrong, being a skeptic in the first place.
<br />

<br />
thank you Joe for this post, and your experiment. really encouraged me.
<br />
but still, no go at the wheel under a plastic cover.

			Welcome, and you can do eet Alex! just read up some good experiences, methods, and stories to give ya some nudges in the right direction ^^ keep trying and you'll make a breakthrough eventually.
<br />

<br />
Lately i've been trying to use TK by asking my subconcious to ask the psi wheel to spin, or nudge.  I think it's being stubborn.. i've only gotten it to wobble a tad.  I've tried the contrast idea of me and the psi only being blue, I don't think it works for me.. O_o or maybe i'm just being impatient. Oh i just remembered! this is a weird method i tried out.. I tried to be the psi wheels friend, i was trying to be gentle to it. I was smiling, asking it to spin please.  Since it was tin foil, i asked &quot;can i see my face please?&quot; and it moved so i can see myself ^^ then i asked &quot;can i see my face on the other side?&quot;, that worked too.  After awhile of asking that, it stopped moving.  I think the psi wheel was getting irritated. Or my sub-c, i donno.  Should i threaten my sub-c saying that you're in MY head, my rules will always follow, or i'm going to *insert something drastic here*?

			<img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> Yay, my first sucess with the psiwheel this morning! Sorta... It was actually pretty pathetic, but ill settle for it anyway. First I started with the plastic thing I normally use over it, then I remembered how someone on here said you might be able to do it easily if you take off the cover and try it. It worked! I felt like I entered another state of conciousness (Can't spell for beans I know) and it wiggled slightly! Then I quickly lost focus, but I kept at it for awhile and I entered that state of connected mind again and got it to wiggle some more. I did that a few more times but I couldn't get it do any more then wiggle randomly. One of the times I got it to slightly move in the direction I wanted it to. Then I kept losing focus so I decided to take a break, then after the break I put the cover back on and was able to make it wiggle then to! I just don't know how you guys make it spin, it took so much energy just to get it to wiggle a bit sheesh... Of course it didn't help that my cat kept coming in my room and bugging me...

			I got it working yesterday, but only for one of those.. one time a day moments, which tick me off because i tried to show my friends and it didn't work  <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" /> .  I used the method that involved focusing on it intently, and then focus your concious somewhere else, and all of a sudden ZOOM! it span like crazy for about 2-3 seconds!

			Yes, I seem to have a lot of success with the &quot;focus intently then ignore it&quot; method.  I personally hold to the theory that regardless of what you are thinking of, your sub-c knows what you want to do, and doesn't take <span style="font-weight: bold">&quot;much&quot;</span> training to get your sub-c to understand what it needs to do.  I always am sitting at my computer when I practice, and whenever I look away from the psiwheel it takes on a life of its own it seems, spinning crazily in one direction or the other.  Anyways guys, keep up the good work!

			hi joe it's a great article to read
<br />
but i've used a technique that makes it hard to spin the wheel under the glass
<br />
which is :
<br />
well i've programmed my subcon. that when i put my right hand beside the wheel it must spin, and i put my hand real close to the wheel so i can feel it, but when i put a glass container whatever it was, it makes it harder to put my hand close to the wheel and feel it and the wheel doesnt move at all Well HELP!!!!
<br />

<br />
P.S (I've moved my wheel after about 2 hours of practicing &amp; knowing that there is somthing called telekinesis )
