No need. Just because someone has a different ethical standpoint doesn't make them stupid. Saying that it does, is stupid.

			Kenshin is using suggestion on someone without their consent.  Most people would argue that this is highly unethical, as evidenced by the &quot;ethical standpoint&quot; thread in this same section.  That is why it is stupid.  Surely he can have his own morals and standards when TPS is involved, but we of course reserve the right to call him a fucking idiot.

			telepathic suggestion is making someone do something against their will.  That is considered combat which is against the rules.  Also, all of you guys need to grow up.  Seriously.  Roy, no need to waste your time pwning little kids who say that.  Anyway, topic locked.
