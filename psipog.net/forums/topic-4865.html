			Sorry in advance for this being a &quot;Did I make one?&quot; thread (especially since there is a topic for these), but that topic has not been replied to in a while, so  I shall post it here.
<br />

<br />
Okay, here is the situation.  I have tried several different methods of making Psi Balls, but have never been sure if I have been successful.  The closest I came to realizing success was with the &quot;Tactile Method&quot; recently added to the article section by Peebrain.  After using the method, I felt tingling sensations in both of my hands, and when I moved my fingers, it was like they were, in a way, &quot;fixed&quot; in their spots until I moved them (no pain, but still, very noticeable).  I attempted to program it to feel hot, as a way to detect its presence, but felt nothing in the way of heat, merely the tingling sensation and the finger thing.  I am also fairly certain that my hands were not just going numb, as I had only been working on the Psi Ball for about a minute and a half.
<br />

<br />
Can anyone clarify if this is a Psi Ball?  Thanks in advance.

			I would say, yes, you made one, programing is almost a completely different ball game if you ask me...its going to be alot harder to be able to manipulate the psi ball than just creating one in the first place--keep at it, your definitely getting somewhere.

Thank you for the clarification, Workonit.   I had heard from other places that similar feelings to that may just be your body tricking you, so I couldn't be sure.

			You probably made one. When I'm not sure if i made one or not I shell it and the feeling usually becomes stronger.

The main reason I was asking was because I have heard shelling is more difficult and comes with experience.

			I have been trying to make them for a while now, as well as feel resistance when I try to put my hands together, but I never feel it.  It is always the tingly feeling.
