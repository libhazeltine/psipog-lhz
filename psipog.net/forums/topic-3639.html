			I don't understand the split between these... I think they both fall in the same category!
<br />

<br />
Micro PK means changing chance statistics (I believe), but how? Binary in a computer? That means you're physically moving energy to change it. Rolling dice? The dice are physically moving! How is this different than Macro PK, besides that you are unconciously instead of conciously moving it?
<br />

<br />
On the other hand, Macro PK means moving matter. But if I'm moving something, what does that really mean? Am I myself &quot;moving&quot; it, or am I changing the &quot;chance factor&quot; of it having a tendancy to stay at rest?
<br />

<br />
So I propose this question because I don't think we know enough about PK at this point to label or differentiate between &quot;micro/macro&quot; PK.
<br />

<br />
I may be (and probably am) wrong (is there a right answer to anything???  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ) but I'd like to understand how we know these terms are correct.
<br />

<br />
Thanks,
<br />

			Macro-Pk, is making the particular object move with no physical contact whatsoever.
<br />
Micro-Pk, youre changing the probability of a certain object, i.e a dice.
<br />

<br />
If you were trying to influence binary, you wouldnt want it to move would you?
<br />

<br />
but good point anyway.

			Macro and Micro are just ways to divide up an umbrella term we call Psychokinesis. Basically they are the same thing, one just works on a different level than the other, Macro larger easier seen, Micro lesser seen and smaller.
<br />

<br />
In the end you doing psychokinesis irregardless of what you call it.

Ah, thanks for clearing that up.
<br />

<br />
So then, we still have to answer the question of &quot;what is psychokinesis?&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Is it moving stuff, changing the probablility of said stuff moving, or is it opening another alternate universe created because of infinite possiblities?
<br />

<br />

No your give 'silly' answers to questions unasnwered. If we knew _what_ psychokinesis was exactly, what psi is, what all of psionics is...Well we would have a new scientific field as a major instead of being see as little less than outcasts by the scientific community.
<br />

<br />
Psychokinesis is basically effecting the enviorment by that of your mind, be it in smaller or larger sense, thats all that really has to be known and for now thats the only definite thing known on it on the accords of &quot;What is Psychokinesis&quot;

I'm just brainstorming possibilities, and hoping for more. They aren't be-all, end-all answers.
<br />

<br />
However, I believe that if we knew _what_ it was, it'd be easier to prove, study, practice, basically just an all-around improvement.
<br />

<br />
Are there any large studies right now that are trying to figure this out?
