You are arguing. From dictionary.com:

<br />
1. An oral disagreement; verbal opposition; contention; altercation
<br />
2. A discussion involving differing points of view; debate

<br />
Also, as others have stated before me, you are being a hypocrite. First you claim that the whole &quot;communism is bad&quot; thing is a fact, and then you claim it's an opinion. Here's some in context quotes from you to prove my point:

Absolutely right, for once. You are reading his posts, but you're not reading his long, stupid posts, because he has none. So far they've been intelligent and of medium length. Also, we all are basically arguing against ourselves because, as Lightbringer stated, you have no skill in debating.

Well, I'll give you that we're being childish. However, I can safely say I have only met a few people (like maybe 2 or 3) in my entire life that weren't completely childish. Stupid, is another matter. You would have us become tolerant of Zemeon's idiocy. When you become tolerant of it, it will come <span style="font-style: italic">en masse</span>. If we do not root out idiocy, we will have to deal with it sooner or later.
<br />

<br />
Also, I will agree that this started over something trivial. I'm too lazy to look back and see exactly who started it, but it started with someone being intolerant of the opinions of others. Probably Zemeon.
<br />

<br />
I definitely agree that Zemeon should be banned.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: I don't know how the hell I keep forgetting, but quit double posting, Zemeon. The edit button is there for a reason, use it. If you want to separate your points, use whitespace. You can create whitespace with this magical button we like to call the Enter button. Unless you're on a Mac, then I believe it would be the Return button, I'm not too sure.

<br />
I'm not reading all of these arguements, because all arguements are useless, opinions are false, so why read them?  
<br />

<br />
But I will give some advice to Zemeon. I have been in many arguements, and I'm not sure about you but they start to consume me, they can get close to you and they don't feel good. My advice to you is to walk away from it right now. Say something that they cannot argue with back, something nice usually does the trick. You will be the better man doing so. 
<br />

<br />
I have never seen anyone do it. Not many full grown men can even do it. It is even hard for me to do so. I've done it a few times, and it hurts as well. But prove me wrong, prove that you can do it too.

I just got one word for you. LOSER.
<br />

<br />
I'm not stupid. I have reasons why I think communism is bad. I don't have to tell a loser information he won't understand. Now stop picking through people's points and pointing out irrelevant things like a loser.

<br />
How many times to I have to stress this! I have tons of skills in debating. I had a debating class! I just don't like handing out shitloads of facts to complete losers.
