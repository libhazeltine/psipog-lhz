			Its the same as normal PK only the object in this case is wind or air.

I think this thread will be locked due to invalid kinesis terms described here:

			Why would it be locked? He didn't put any words in front of kinesis. He effectivly said wind psychokinesis which is what everyone always says to say.
<br />

<br />
Anyway. you could try the wind psychokinesis method where you visualise strings attatched to your hands that are pulling the winds from north, south, east and west, so that when you jerk your arms in ways it makes gushes of winds.

			i would advise learning to use the pin-wheel first, if you haven't already.
<br />
heres a technique i use, to get the feeling of the wind:
<br />

<br />
btw it helps alot if you have a gust of wind
<br />

<br />
create a basic psiball between the hands, program it to repel wind. visualize the wind whipping around it...keep as much focus and concentration as you can. eventually you should feel the wind whipping around the area where your psi ball is!
<br />

<br />
im not sure of other methods :S

			Because wind is such a universal force, you don't have to get past thinking PK is impossible to get it to work. ...noobs... Oh, wait, I'm one.

Because they think that it is different than PK and they think if they were able to move wind, they would blow things over.  Little do they know, it is still PK.
<br />

<br />
Use regular PK techniques.  THEY WORK FOR ALL XXXXkinesis (enter word for XXXX)

			actually...... using regular pk techs for all kenesis helps out alot...... its like an all purpose tool or a swiss army knife.. its not a swiss knife, swiss screwdriver and a swiss winebottle opener. Its still a swiss army knife. But, noobs wont know the &quot;valid kenesis terms&quot; and i can also bet that they wouldnt expect a &quot;valid kenesis term&quot; meaning... it doesnt matter about the term just so long as everyone says to use the pk techs.

			Doesn't seem like much people at all actually tried wind PK.  I have, tis in my blog, but I can say here that I visualize blowing wind off my hand.

I would agree and disagree with Apollo on that comment. Agree in as it's the best way, and disagree that it's whatever works best for one person, one might not like to do a &quot;normal&quot; PK.
