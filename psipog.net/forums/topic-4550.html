			I guess what I was asking is if someone is a natural telepath/clairvoyant and they take antidepressants, a really mild one at a low dose, will it mess with their abilities or shut them off?

			how the... i only imagine you are assuming there are natural telepaths that know theyre naturals and are also taking low doses of antidepressants? i doubt anyone is aware that they have the answer for you. however... everything is easier when you're 'sober'

Thank you. Your knowledge of pharmacology is unparalleled. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
For information that might actually be helpful to the OP, here is a post I made regarding SSRIs (the most common class of antidepressant medication) a few weeks ago. <a href="#" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?p=38688#38688</a>
<br />

<br />
If you have any questions on that, feel free to ask them here or in that post. I may reply later after I've eaten with more in depth information regarding the interaction of SSRIs and telepathy - if you would like to ask any questions in specific about that, it would help.
<br />

<br />
Generally speaking, SSRIs will not negatively or positively impact psionic abilities after they have achieved peak plasma concentrations and have normalized within the body - certain exceptions would be drugs with strong action that can impair normal senses, such as paroxetine in the early dosage stages.
<br />

<br />
Other antidepressants, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, are actually reputed to be able to moderately boost telepathic ability - one notable MAOI known for this is harmine, also called telepathine, which is extracted from the syrian rue. This is not, however, a prescription medication, and this particular class of drugs (MAO inhibitors) is <span style="font-style: italic">very</span> dangerous, so I don't recommend taking them.
<br />

Bad doubt, I guess. I am a telepath and have taken these medications, though I don't currently. It should be noted that the majority of antidepressant medications do not affect an individual's &quot;sobriety.&quot; The effects, with the exception of affect and mood, are usually undetectable to people who don't know the individual. Antidepressants are designed to normalize behavior; as a result, individuals who take them tend to appear &quot;normal,&quot; not inebriated or impaired, or flowery and bubbly, or whatever else.
<br />

<br />
Please do some research on the subject before chiming in with your two cents - &quot;they do stuff, it's complicated&quot; is hardly helpful or informative, and it doesn't demonstrate any degree of understanding of the subject, let alone mastery of it.

i wasnt aware that we were allowed to discuss drugs. cause in this country anti depressants classify as DRUGS. and there are many anti depressant drugs that effect your sobriety thats why they have them dizzyness labels othem.

But yet you responded?
<br />

<br />
Also, in this country, caffeine and alcohol are classified as drugs, and in Canada, caffeine is a controlled substance. What's your point?
<br />

<br />
And no, most antidepressants don't affect your sobriety - the dizziness labels are primarily used during the first two weeks when there are other effects aside from the intended ones because of the serotonergic effects and the adjustment period. 
<br />

<br />
And seeing as I'm the guy who puts &quot;those dizziness labels&quot; on them, I'm wondering which drugs in particular you're talking about? I'll double check at work tomorrow, but I don't actually think many antidepressants have those labels. Sertraline doesn't, fluoxetine doesn't, citalopram doesn't...paroxetine <span style="font-style: italic">might</span>...

Unless, of course, it does good. Antibiotics that treat syphillis mess with the mind.
