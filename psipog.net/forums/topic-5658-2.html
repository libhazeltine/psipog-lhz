			I know that was sarcasm but I have never hallucinated before, I'm not on drugs, and I'm not looking for attention or anything else by saying this. But I'm almost 100% sure that I did OBE my arm out. It felt too real to be a dream or anything. This is just one of these things you know even though you can't prove it. Much like a lot of psionics unless your good. Everyone is different and I'd be willing to bet (If I wasn't broke) that it is possible. After all, it didn't last long anyways and that's the only part I remember of it so I could have been completely out or whatever but for about 10 seconds I know it was just my arm

Listen your not using logic....OBE=OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE...no body...just conscious...mabye you were halfway in a lucid dream or something. I get feelings like that all the time after HOURS of motionless meditation...but sorry that was not an OBE

			lol umm nothing? a weird feeling?....try the motionless meditation for a long time and let me know how it goes. I've done it for hours straight before and I couldn't feel my whole body, it doesn't mean i had an OBE...Read some of Monroes books and try the meditation and i bet you'll see the OBE in a whole different way..When you really OBE you'll know

Ummm....I'm making assumptions? I never took a particular side. I just said that since I don't see real evidence to prove either side, I have decided to just not sit here and decide which side of the argument I want to take.

Maybe you should go LEARN to read....

Ok I wasn't even talking to you about assuming. None of my posts were directed towards you. And I'm pretty sure I can read seeing as there's messeges written by me but thanks for coming out.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
