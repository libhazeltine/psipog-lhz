			In a convocation I had today with the majority of my chemistry class on the topic of what they would do if they had the power to do anything, I was intrigued by the number of individuals who stated that they would carry out relatively humble tasks, such as giving everyone environmentally friendly cars, and the low number of people that would want things such as global conquest.

			In contrast to the environmentally friendly cars thing:
<br />

<br />
I would give everyone Hummers and fix up the environment and make it stronger so the environment would be fine and everyone could drive cool cars.
<br />

<br />

I mean seriously, why would you worry about hurting the environment and stuff if you could do anything?   Just repair the ozone layer!

			That point did actually come up in my previous conversation.  The reason they said they wouldn’t do such things, as fix all the environmental problems, is that they wouldn’t want everyone else to do what they want and expect them to fix the problems it caused.  Or something like that.

			I'd give myself omniscience and learn all the secrets of the universe, then give them to human physicists. That way, we could finally colonize the planets and the stars.

Of course, that would go right along with me placing myself as Supreme Dictator of the Universe, followed by extract various sorts of revenge on... various sorts of people (don't ask, because you have no idea). Then I would continue to impose my will, giving freedom to those who earn it, and, well, not giving freedom to those who didn't earn it.

			Have anyone seen the X-Files episode about a genie? I think it thought some important lessons, specially when (hypothetic) people screw everything up when trying to fix anything beyond their understanding. And how trying to improve yourself goes against the reason for doing it in the first place, that we are doing how we do to learn from the process, just skipping it all to the end wouldn't give us the lessons we are supposed to learn.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I think my first step would be to get rid of my false ego. Then I think I would know what to do (and what NOT to do) next   <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			If I could do anything... hmmm.....

Well, I'd first gain omniscience, and give modern scientists and mathematicians all the answers (after bagging every Nobel Prize for a single year <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />). Then I'd produce the perfect conditions for socioeconomic equality. Everyone would have plenty, and nobody would do without. Nobody would be in excess either. I'd make everyone happy.

<br />
Then I'd acend to Heaven and chill with Jesus for the rest of eternity. That'll be awesome.
