			Me and my friend were just skating around and I was thinking about how I wanted to go to McDonalds to see this girl and all the sudden my friend is like &quot; Yo, want to go to McDonalds and find some girls? &quot;  I was like WOAH.  It was wierd because the other night we were talking about reading minds and saying sentences in our heads and having the other person guess.  We weren't close then but maybe our minds connected?  Well now I'm determined to learn telekinesis and telepathy better. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Do you think that was Telepathy?  What's the difference between actually hearing there thoughts and thinking you know what they are thinking?

			sometimes, when you have that ability, it happens out of no where because you do it subconsciously. so it's possible, it just takes a while to focus it. i had the same thing happen with my physical control of water.

			I never tried it before.  It was just talking about stuff like that a little earlier.  I just looked telekinesis and telepathy up this morning and have been practicing.

			but make sure you don't force it though, once i tried to force water control but i got emotionally hurt, you must take it little by little, never force it.

			you're odd iceguy... sorry cant help it... anyway Joed12 i guess you should read the articles in Psipog.net to help you get started... my advice to you if you're starting telepathy... do it yourself with every means possible... just be guided by the articles... as I have read from some response of the older members... &quot;help yourself first before you let others help&quot; <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> thats all, and good luck... I would want to practice TP with you sometime..

			Remember. There is alwayse chance. In my views, skepticism is your BEST tool to find out if your realy doing it. Practice telepathy daily, and if it seems that you and the person you practice with have the same thoughts a lot more, its probbably working.
