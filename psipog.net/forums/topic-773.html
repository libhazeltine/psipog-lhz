			Sorry if this has already been absolutely and definately covered already, but either way I know I will get shot out of the water. Here goes. I think PsiPog should dedicate a sepparate section for something - still not allowing it to be discussed in other areas. I think that they should have a sepparate area for instruction and practice of mild psi combat. Nothing too intense just a little sparring, or at least better instruction on what to look for in the rare case (at least in my experience) of psionic attack. I know that you guys fervently oppose this idea, but how many people think it might be useful? (Please don't flame me. [Shrivels up in terror.])

			Combat in any form is bad. Psionic combat can be portrayed as more harsh than physical combat however due to the lack of most people knowing about it. Im sure there are other sites out there dedicated to psi combat (albeit the information may not be factual or as correct as psipog). Fighting isnt good in any way shape or form and we dont need it here.

			Psipog is a place to teach those who wants to explore the possiblities so if they tuaght combat, it would make it seem like a aggressive place, making people less accepting and stuff, I don't think peebrain would want that.
<br />

<br />
also there probably plenty of other sites about combat psi, although you probably find fluff.

I know exactly how that would go: &quot;How do i make a psiball to throw at the person who attacked me,&quot; or somehting along the lines. 
<br />

<br />
I think psionic combat should not be on any psionic forums. If someone is practicing psionics to hurt others then they are doing it for the wrong reasons. The only thing people should know even remotely related to combat is how to make a sheild and there is already a section for that.

			It doesn't take a astrophysicist to sit down for 10 minutes and figure out how to defend yourself.  Honestly, its not that hard of a concept to grasp that you need articles to teach you how.  If you can't figure it out on your own, you dont deserve to be attacking people anyway.

nah. i know there's already articles on it, but some people are just plain stupid. and personally, i find the best way to defend myself is through practice. i have osmeone launch something at me, and i try to defend myself. easy peasy psiball squeasy. however, most people won't get the concept unless something attacks them. i'm not suggesting we all send pain-balls at each other to learn self defence, it's just first hand experience is the best. you cannot argue with that.

			but if we did that... we'd be teaching some BAD people HOW to attack someone psionically.. wouldnt we? we'd be describing different ways someone could be attacked. If there was any kind of psychic combat allowed, id make it so you could learn to make constructs fight other constructs <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			the chances that someone bad is going to spend their time learning psionics and waiting for psipog to talk about combat is slim.  very slim.  To be successful in combat, you need to be advanced in psionics.  That means practice.  The &quot;bad&quot; person would have a better chance of hurting someone by pulling out a gun.

			Well, half of me knows that there are far too many people who are too irresponsible to handle something so dangerous, also too many fluffs look at psychic stuff because they have been outcasted from a group of peers, first thing they'd do is learn about psychic combat to get back at em, because who can honestly pin a psychic crime on anyone today? The other half of me says that combat is something that should be available to learn if you so desired, for that matter, why allow people to learn Martial Arts? I know that teaching combat will never be very practical, and it would be hard to practice (you may not know your own strength). In the end, it is safer to say no to teaching combat at all on PsiPog.

			I dont think it should be availible to everyone like you have just said.  I think it should be done like UPC did.  They have a section that only a small group of people can access stuff about like telepathic suggestion etc.  I think that is a good idea.  But really, it doesnt matter what any of us think because it is up to peebs <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

<br />
If someone really wanted to commit a 'psychic crime,' something like telepathy would be more suitable for information purposes.  (i.e. blackmail)
<br />

<br />
And then you have to argue that someone who would be good enough to truly harm someone using psi would be good enough to teach himself anyways.
<br />

<br />
But asking for a psionic combat section is just like a gun store (or just guns in general); guns are for self-defense and sport, only.  They're not for shooting other people (unless they attack you first of course...) or being used as a threat.  (to those that don't get the semi-sarcasm, HINT: get the analogy?)
