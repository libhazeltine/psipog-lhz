			I was in pre algebra working on the asighnment. I was realy bored so I decided to ping my friend Abbie, I started to make the psi ball and it wouldnt work! The bell rang so I lost track and didn't remeber til a little bit later. I tried again after I rememberd and I only got this tiny little thing. No one was looking at me either time. Has this happend to anyone? Why do you think this happened? Thx for any help.

			so...what is your question exactly? does school effect psionics? if you mean the atmosphere then I would say so merely for the large bulk of sentient beings sitting around you.

			If you're asking wheather being at school has an efect on your psionics, my guess would be that it's the atmosphere. At home, you're comfortable and relaxed, and surrounded by familiar things that are your own. At school, it's not quite the same. At least that's what I feel it is when I run into the same kinds of blocks at school. (Not that I try it a whole lot, but when I do, I get the same thing you're describing.)

			Yeah, I find it hard to concentrate at school too. But there is a way to turn it on it's head. Draw the energy from all the people, from all the noise, all the movement, or just from their minds. Tends to give me big psiballs.
<br />
Thing is, I can't relax at school. I don't trust the people around me enough  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			With me, its the exact opposite sometimes. It was nearing the end of school, and my hands got really, really hot. 
<br />
As a joke, I put my hands up against the sides of my friends head, and I actually knocked him unconcious. He didn't physically jerk or anything, and his bowels didn't release. He just sort of slumped over in his chair. 
<br />
It was really loud in class, so no one was paying attention to what just happened, and I thought he was faking it, so I walked away. But then he got up about a minute later and was very disoriented.
<br />

<br />
YES, I have considered the fact that he was playing a joke on me, but he couldn't have faked disorientation because it was so realistic.
<br />

<br />
He made up some story about how I gassed him to make him fall asleep and then I told him what happened and he thought it was awesome.

			meh. psi at school should be an instant consideration. 
<br />
(he says jokingly) just scan the teacher and learn all you need!
<br />

<br />

<br />
(with a serious tone) since stress affects energy production, it's no wonder we sometimes have a hard time. try producing a &quot;happy&quot; shield to counteract it. works for me.

			I never get time to really, though I've had about the same results at home as in school, maybe moreso as I'm more relaxed at school than at home, I don't like wasting time at home but I don't mind doing it in school <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

Anyway I can understand about the not being comfortable or feeling stressed at school. The rest is basically alien to me, sorry I couldn't provide any smart to say like the rest of you <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			I have practiced a number of psionic skills while I was at school, including TK and RV.  I found that the time at the end of classes (high school) usually is enough to make a good sketch.  Anyways, as far as the atmosphere is concerned, I always wanted to be able to do psionics at will, without anything that could distract me.  School was excellent training on how to block out other people/thier emotions/thier noises/whatever.

			I notice you mentioned the fact that &quot;no one was looking at you&quot; when you were creating this psi ball to ping. This would obviously conclude that you were self conscious about who might be watching you, therefore your concentration wasn't fully on the making of your construct.
<br />

<br />
And secondly, I don't think you need a construct to ping. Besides a shield of course to prevent something happening on your end. And you can also use a tendril, which comes off of your shield.
