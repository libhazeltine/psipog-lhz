			I found on Osho's book &quot;Meditation: The Art of Ecstasy&quot; a lucid dreaming technique which seems to be very straightforward and easy yet powerful.
<br />
Mind that when you master this technique you will be lucid all the time.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
ENTERING SLEEP CONSCIOUSLY
<br />

<br />
&quot;The moment you are dropping into sleep is the moment to encounter the unconscious. You have been sleeping every day, but you have not encountered sleep yet. You have not seen it: what it is, how is comes, how to drop into it. You have not known anything about it. You have been going into sleep every night and awakening from sleep every morning, but you have not felt the moment when sleep comes, you have not felt what happens. So try this experiment, and after three months, suddenly, one day, you will enter sleep knowingly.
<br />
Drop on your bed, close your eyes, and then remember -- remember! -- that sleep is coming and you are to remain awake when it comes. This exercise is very arduous. The first day it will not happen, the next day it will not happen, but if you persist every day, constantly remembering that sleep is coming and you are not to allow it to come without being aware of it -- you must feel how sleep takes over, what it is -- then one day sleep will be there and you will still be awake.
<br />
That very moment you become aware of your unconscious. And once you become aware of your unconscious, you will never be asleep again. Sleep will be there, but you will be awake; a center in you will go on knowing. All around you there will be sleep and the center will go on knowing.
<br />
When this center is knowing, dreams become impossible; and when dreams become impossible, daydreams also become impossible. Then you will be asleep in a different sense; a different quality happens because of the encounter.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
This technique is also recommended for veterans who wish to be lucid ALL the time.
<br />

<br />
NOTE: I am still working on this technique, so I can't promise it would work,
<br />
though Osho was a great master and I trust him <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			That sounds like an overly simplified version of WILD. I don't like the cryptic way he gives you the information either. While that technique may work, it is probably not the most effective/fastest to learn. He just flat out doesn't tell you enough about what he's trying to get you to do. I <span style="font-style: italic">think</span> he's trying to get you to program your sub-c into keeping you conscious, but I can't be sure. His technique is more a name then anything.

Hmm I disagree with you. 
<br />
In WILD the objective is to enter the dream consciously every time you try, here (like you said) the Objective is to program the mind.
<br />
Maybe for us Lucid Dreaming is fact but for a &quot;normal&quot; person it's confidential, Hence the cryptic way he gives the info.

Nice <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> , but still, there are many LDers who have LDs for years, yet only 2-3 times a week. Some are satisfied by it, some are not...

Good points. I still think there are more direct means then this method however, such as self hypnosis, but I am interested to see if you can get a simple technique such as this to work. I am interested to hear about your results, let me know if anything happens.

			I think the reason he uses this slow process is because its the most complete. If you do this everynight for lets say 2 years. Just from observing what sleep is more deeply, you will start to recognize it everynight as it becomes more natural.

			I disagree completely. WILD can give you just as much insight into sleep, becuase you go through all of it consciously before dreaming. It also doesn't take two years to learn, unless you're slow about it.
