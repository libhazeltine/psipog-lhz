			I was meditating yesterday before sleep, for about 1 hour or so (trying to change my eye color) when I suddenly thought about psychokinesis. Then I started to feel something weird. I felt everything around me was spinning, and it seemed all objects in the room were willing to move (like if them were asking me to move them). In that moment, I thought I could do Macro-PK easily, I had no doubt in my mind. But it was so weird and strong, lol I got scared and got back to sleep without even trying.
<br />
Note: I never moved a psi-wheel.
<br />

<br />
What was that? Have any of you felt it before? Is this a good signal?
<br />

Thanks

			All due respect, but I would call you a fool for not trying pk then.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> Just kidding. I have never had that feeling before and lots of people have. I am frankly very jealous. The feeling you described is basically pure belief and the ability to do maybe anything (from what I know).
<br />
Is it a good signal? I havn't the foggiest. It's really neither. Or maybe it's your mind telling you to follow a path of pk.

			The funny fact is that i became afraid of my &quot;feeling&quot;, i felt any object could just be thrown without resistance so I thought I would throw my TV. (Come to think of it... HOW could I THROW my TV if I can't EVEN move a PSIWHEEL!). For one moment random thoughts just popped up in my mind (the reason was probably the fear). I never felt such thing before, and now i'm so motivated to try Macro-PK. Maybe I'll get better results if I try to get into this &quot;state&quot; again. (hey maybe we can get a technique from this)
<br />

<br />
Maybe someday i'll throw my TV for real.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

			Whenever you go a long time without sleep, and you get in an appropriate setting, you black out for a few seconds and wake back up, it's called microsleep. Well, anyway, I'm a really busy guy so this happens to be during practice and sometimes I'll close my eyes just to clear my thoughts again for a second and fall asleep. But last night I had this feeling at one point and I was also listening to music which might've helped. The feeling was strong, but I still couldn't move the object I was trying to. It was good for motivation but it didn't make much of a difference in my ability, unfortunately.
