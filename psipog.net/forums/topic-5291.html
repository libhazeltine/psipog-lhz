			well, I was in the chat during a slow time, and I had announced that I had my first OBE this morning (8/10). so I'll just post it here because I can, and I'm still very excited.
<br />

<br />
here it is:
<br />

<br />
(before bed) I lied down to sleep and was just thinking of random stuff, then noticed that it had been almost 6 months since
<br />
I had gotten serious in psionics, then I remembered reading that peebrain had his first OBE after giving up after 6 months
<br />
of daily practice. I hadn't even practiced close to that, and I couldn't get even close to relaxed enough to attempt. then I fell asleep
<br />
shortly after that.
<br />

<br />
I woke up alittle before 5:30 AM for some reason, I think it was my baby brother crying.
<br />
I had just been having a non lucid dream and I was flying around everywhere, when I woke up I was just lying there
<br />
and still imagining flying around, then I thought &quot;hey I'm awake, it would be fun if I could go OOB and fly around&quot;
<br />
but since I hadn't had any OBE's before I dismissed the Idea, and continued the imagining.
<br />

<br />
then randomly, I don't know how or why, maybe my subconcious felt sorry for me or what. but somehow I was in and OBE
<br />
and somehow I knew it, then I proceeded to roll so my &quot;head&quot; was hanging over the side of my bed, then I felt my self
<br />
being pulled back to my body, then somehow I grabbed the edge of my bed and pulled my self back. at this point I have
<br />
not Idea what my lower body was doing so I don't know if it was a complete seperation or not. then I wondered if I could
<br />
open my eyes without loosing the OBE, so I did, then looked around my room. saw my room with afew different things, but it was my
<br />
room. then I wondered if I should look at my body to see if it's really that scary. then what I was doing hit and I got excited over 
<br />
all of the things I could do, except that THE split second I started to get excited I was pulled back to my body faster than
<br />
I could do anything about. at this point I was in my body, it was 5:30 exactly, my baby brother was crying. and I was really happy. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
other notes: I could feel vibrations, and I felt alot different then when I'm in my body, but I could also recall everything much
<br />
more vividly then any dream I've had in my life.
