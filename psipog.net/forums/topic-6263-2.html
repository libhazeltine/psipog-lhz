Over the last few months my will power has indeed increase, but not by the commonplace. I, myself have a bit of a strange histroy compared to others. Althought I always thought of myself of being a logical person in the past, I never really liked it. I always been a shy child that been rude to people in school and other public places. But when I cross a simply dead cat, I cry for it. All my life I been a stranger to people, watching from the outside. How they yell at each other, mock, insult, become close to each other. Even if I couldnt talk to them honestly face to face, and even if I did, it didnt help. I discover that one of the things people hate, is being wrong. Some will do anything to prove themselfs right, even if there not. Its why I always think to myself that I could be wrong.
<br />

<br />
One of the best things I found is to listen to people, even if most of the words are hurtful and maybe even lies. There still lies turth.
<br />

<br />
I always been called gifted, even when I was a child that I was tested retarded. They still called me gifted, when they tested me again for average. My mother jump with joy, when they tested me with the results of a genius. But what I could never do when I was younger is to accpet that who I was who I am. I always thought I was wrong and worthless to people.
<br />

<br />
There are somethings I don't agree with hypothesis, but I will always have that quesiton mark in my head till the day I die.
<br />

<br />
I wont say anymore untill I can get a answer. But I enjoy your opinions very much Niushirra. Indeed like everyone else I seen in this world. There is talent beneath your skin.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

That sounds depressing. Why not find the answer(s) before the day you die? It's not that impossible <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
About your analysis Niushirra, I understand what you mean, and at some parts I disagree with your way of analyzing it, but I must say thanks for sharing and you did a good job trying to explain it. I know it can be difficult. I always love to see people trying to explain that one simple, yet impossible to understand concept. Or rather: reality. Therefore, I would like to clear somethings up, according to how I would describe it. 
<br />

<br />
First of all, you answer a post with: &quot;We don't have free will.&quot; I disagree on that. But thats simply a personal opinion, so i won't dig this one out, just wanted to say it.
<br />

<br />
In this part, the middle part of your theory, you make, in my eyes, a few misassumptions which I cannot blame you at all, since these misassumptions are made while being in the normal mind, trying to explain something much subtler than the mind itself. Subtle things are always hard to analyze from the normal mind.
<br />
Here is the part:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">After experiencing it I tried to comprehend it rationally but could not and then started to remeber my buddhism. I realized that the &quot;commonplace&quot;, as I called it, resembled enlightenment in buddhism. <span style="font-weight: bold">Later I realized you have to integrate the commonplace into your &quot;soul&quot; in order to be enlightened.</span> That's probably the hardest things anyone could ever do and I have not yet. To sum up everything important you need to keep in mind: <span style="font-weight: bold">The commonplace is an aspect of everything and connects all. The commonplace is eternal and is where most of the universe is mentally.</span> </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Yes that commonplace as you call it is indeed the place to reach enlightenment. However, you can never integrate this place into your soul or your mind for that matter. It is the other way around. This commonplace is always there, whether you experience it or not. It is not a state of mind, it is the state of god, which you can experiencing by taking the mind to the corners of itself, his most subtle parts, and then leaving the mind for what it is and re-uniting your individual consicousness with your god-consciousness, aka: commonplace. This commonplace is the very essence of your Self, your entire being. You are this commonplace, al the time, whether your lower mind realises it and experiences it or not. So it is not a matter of integrating the commonplace into your soul, because your soul = commonplace. The trick is, to dissolve the mind and your lower-self and individual soul as you could call it, into this universal unmanifested soul which is the source of all that is created. IMO. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> But this is an important thing to realize, that this commonplace is nothing else but the real you which is indeed eternal, infinite and not created, undefinable (hence: hard to explain) and unseperatable. So you cannot integrate god into your soul, you can only integrate your individual soul, into this God. This God equals <span style="font-style: italic">you</span>. Even though we cannot experience that from your individual point of view (yet).
<br />

<br />
Second thing I would like to reply to, is this:
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">
<br />
The commonplace is an aspect of everything and connects all. The commonplace is eternal and is where most of the universe is mentally.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
You say that this ocmmonplace is mentally. I can very much understand this assumption, because to many people the mental level of our being, is to them empty, as if it is nothing. They see this: <span style="font-weight: bold">Physical &lt;&gt; Mental.</span>
<br />
However, it would be more accurate like this: <span style="font-weight: bold">Physical&gt;Etherical&gt;Mental/Astral&gt;Causal&gt;Light/Love&gt;Commonplace(God).</span>
<br />

<br />
In my view, this reality we live in consists out of multiple levels of reality, and subtleties. The higher you are capable of concentrating the mind, the higher you get into the levels of vibration. Nature is dividable in different levels of vibration. the grossest one, we call physical. then we call it auric or etherical. when vibrations start to vribrate at an even subtler, higher level of our being, they become astral and close to the vibrational level of the mind, which is the mental body. the mind can reach to the very subtlest parts of manifested nature. You will then be capable of experiencing oneness of all and ceasing of ordinairy thoughts yes. However, this is, most of the times, not necessarily god or the commonplace. Commonplace lies beyond. It is not manifested, therefore, when feeling one with nature, your individual consicousness has not yet reached god's place. It has pierced to some levels of nature, and is now experiencing a level in which all energy (manifested!) is connected with each other. This is where consciousness and awareness are capable of expanding. However, it is not yet god <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> . This is a misinterpretation of god. Because even though you experience the oneness of creation, you are still in creation, rather than at the source of creation which is the creator. Creation is one with the creator yes, nevertheless god lies beyond any level of depth of mother nature. God is you, which is unmanifested, pure consciousness. In my view. 
<br />

<br />
So you see, the commonplace can never be mental in my eyes, because the commonplace is something undefinable. It is something that has no forms, no shapes, no movement, no energetic fluctuations. The mental level <span style="font-style: italic">does</span> have those energetic fluctuations. They may be impossible for us to see and very subtle in nature, they are nonetheless manifested forms of energy and to God, that level is still very gross, almost physical. The mind, mental body is much more subtle than physical nature, I agree, yet the mental level is created, is manifested and manifesting all the time, therefore, not God. 
<br />

<br />
I think you understand very well what I mean, but lacked the clear perspective to differentiate between those levels and explain them from your mind's point of view, to other minds in a detailed, concrete and defined manner. Please do correct me if I am wrong. For this was an assumption I just made. 
<br />

<br />
So the point I want to state is that some of us often experience transcedental states in whish we become one with a larger area of our surroundings and in which we start to get a feel of the subtle levels of creation. However, these states are often misunderstood to be god-experiences, so stay charp. IMO. God is nothing else but you. Look inward and focus the mind up to a very beautiful and subtle level, then when you do that, let go of the mind and you will transcend even your mental body and eventually you'll be able to let go of everything energetic even, everything manifested and you will discover that god, was you all along. Or rather: you, have been god all along. You will then unite your individualness with your godliness. there is no greater joy, no greater satisfaction than this. And once you are ready to let go of all of these skills and beauties acquired at these higher, subtle levels of reality, you will then rest in your own, pure, godly consciousness. To me, that is enlightenment. You cannot integrate something so essential and unmanifested into your manifested mind or in any other of your manifested bodies that together form your individual soul. No matter how subtle the body is, it is impossible to integrate god. You must integrate your individual Self, into god. You'll have to let go of the mind. Which is so difficult to do, because for many of us, we think ourselves to be the mind. And how can one let go of something that he beliefs himself to be? Is it possible to let go of your self? No, not your true self, not of the god you are. You can however, let go of what you <span style="font-style: italic">think</span> yourself to be.  Once you start the spiritual journey you will be capable of discriminating clearer and clearer between you and your mind. Once the identification with it is dissolved, transcedental meditation will come automatically and the mind is easier to let go of. Then you can continue upwards and start to experience your true undefinable nature that forms the essence of creation.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Once you let go of everything you can let go of, once everything you ever thought you could be or identified with is destroyed in your eyes, there will still remain one more thing... That thing is you. Then God is welcoming you and all you need to do is accept this invitation and enter you own home.</span>

			Tanky, you have personal issues that I can't address for you. Keep searching yourself for the answers. Also you're are straying off topic. I tried to deal with the questions your were asking in logic phase. Then when I found the commonplace I abondoned them because the commonplace was like so much better.
<br />

<br />
MA, the problems you had with my hypothesis were totally my fault. I basically agree with everything you just said. If your leave your mental mind to go to the source then you cannot function in everyday soceity so in my eyes enlightenment is maintaing a connection with the commonplace and blurring the line between you and the commonplace. I have a problem were you talk about god and levels of reality. I also do not agree with giving up everything to become enlightened. You can still have a sense of enlightenment when you shape your mind as close to the commonplace as you can get and maintain a constant connection. Full enlightenment can happen at death when you let go of your physical life and mental life. When I met my partner in creating this theory she was jewish and believed in god. I asked her what she thought god was and her description matched the commonplace almost exactly. Since then I have rid her of calling it god. God has a somewhat bad connotation around it these days and so many people have misinterpretted &quot;him&quot; over the years. God has become a tool of terrorism and soceity shaping just as communism has become what the USSR or china was. The real god is lost and thus a new name must be found. 
<br />

<br />
I tried to talk about the commonplace in very concrete terms like mental but really there is only one adjective for the commonplace and that's commonplacey. Since it's the source of everything it is no idea at all and thus cannot be described as anything. 
<br />

<br />
About your levels, I believe that everything is connected and falls under on thing, the commonplace. Every single thing is just a different aspect of it, even ourselves. There are no levels, there's just the commonplace with distortions growing out of it.
<br />

<br />
These misassumptions I made were made because I'm a hybird. A person from a normal philosophical standpoint that moved up to this. I agree with most everything you say and everybody should take it as an extended, MA written part of my theory.

What would you <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> know?
<br />

<br />
Please stop being negative about yourself so much. For your sake.
<br />

<br />
To Niushirra,
<br />

<br />
I understand what you mean about the word God and I agree. Though I do use it because to me, I have come to associate God again with what I belief the word was meant to describe. But yes I should relate the words I use to the public I speak to as to make it more attractive to them.
<br />

<br />
About the levels you disagreed on, you said:
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">About your levels, I believe that everything is connected and falls under on thing, the commonplace. Every single thing is just a different aspect of it, even ourselves. There are no levels, there's just the commonplace with distortions growing out of it. </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Very very true, however, in these distortions that grow out of the commonplace, there are different levels of vibration. It is not such a complicated theory really, it is extremely logical and it should not get motivation down. To my eyes, the process from Commonplace to the physical realm goes somewhat like this, albeit simplified:
<br />

<br />
There is the unmanifested source that at itself is not a creation of any kind, but it does hold all the potential for all that can be created. From this source there is created one immense unified field in which everything is one and the same. Or rather: there is no everything at this level, because there are not things in it yet. This is just one field of energy so subtle and close to the commonplace that it almost ceases to be an illusion for the advanced practitioner, however, it is still not the commonplace. But lets continue with the process.
<br />

<br />
This subtle field too holds all the potential to create forms and shapes. So it starts to create some very subtle forms of energy which are still connected with everything else in a very obvious way. This level is not just one and the same field anymore, but there are now multiple shapes in it. Allbeit wubbly, almost undefinable and very subtle and it has a high level of vibration (the particles/waves). This field then creates more concrete forms and shapes like one could see in for example the astral level. These things can be defined and can be given names. they are obvious shapes and forms, yet less physical and hence more subtle than our physical level. Out of this level there is the physical level that is created. Now forms are very concrete, physical, solid and definable. This level has most people in its grip, because it is an illusion. People view this as the only reality, while it is just a level of temporary forms and shapes that have no real value except to challenge you to find your way out of their illusion. For after all, without illusion there would be no enlightenment. Without darkness, how could you recognise and find the light?
<br />

<br />
So I indeed agree with what you said:
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Every single thing is just a different aspect of it, even ourselves. There are no levels, there's just the commonplace with distortions growing out of it.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Only I want to add that these distortions do have different levels to them. your body has different levels. It has not only the physical body, but its subtler aspects which vibrate at a higher velocity exist too, and then we are talking about for example the etherical body which penetrates and surrounds the physical body (EM-field) and if you go even subtler, there is the astral body which penetrates and surrounds the physical AND the etherical body and there are some more levels of your body to it. Each deeper level is more subtle, less concrete and therefore less definable and penetrates the levels which are grosser, less subtle. Eventually the source is one yes. Most certainly.
<br />

<br />
Oh I almost forgot, please don't wait to get enlightened until your death =). I have read alot about this subject. Alot of what i believe to be authentic scriptures of authentic authors. It is very much suggested that you find enlightenment while living. In other words, that you choose for a consicous death. not the deathj of your physical body, but the death of your sense of individualness. When you kill the entire concept and belief and sense of Niushirra, you will reunite with what you truly are. This is not somehting that happens after death. Well, it is a possibility, but it is highly suggested that if you posses the skill to enter enlightenment, don't wait until you die, just enter. You will then live among the people while being completely liberated. Not only is then your mind enlightened with wisdom as occurs when you take it often to the deeper levels of your being, but your entire individual soul is free in every aspect you could think of. Consciousness is then fully unattached, yet connected to everything there is. You see, it is said that many people have practiced alot in their passed life and had indeed reached those very sublte levels with their mind, and acquired powers and wisdom and anelightenment of the mind, however, these people still had to return to the physical realm and go through the forgetting process which happens at birth in order to finish their process. So if you have the change, I would personally advice you not to wait until you die, just become enlightened and then you will have the choice to do whatever you like and to go wherever you like in whatever level you'd like to experience after your physical body dies.
<br />
