			I personally can't take much credit for this technique, but it is one that I use to base all of my personal psionic development on.  I stumbled across the technique in Bob Peterson's book entitled &quot;out of body experiences&quot;.  Peebrain wrote an article (<a href="art-fire-and-ice.html6" target="_blank" class="postlink">here</a>) on this as well, where I believe he got the idea from Peterson as well.
<br />

<br />
Some of my theory is as follows:  The basic premise is being able to freely converse with your subconcious, which helps break down internal mental barriers, and to give you an excellent starting point for any practice or experiment.  Since it is believed generally that most things of psionic nature are handled by the gatekeeper (your subconcious) it is in your best interest if you wish to develop that nature to become excellent friends.  Once you are able to do this, in my experience, it is much easier to progress as long as you remember to take care of your subconcious.  Remember it's there for a reason, to protect you.  I personally believe that if anything the concious mind dreamt up came true or something happened psionically we would be living fairly dangerously.
<br />

<br />
Keeping this last point in mind I use physical triggers to sort of &quot;unlock&quot; or release control of certian abilities my subconcious can have control over, but that I want to give control to my concious mind.  A good example of one that we can all &quot;switch&quot; between which part handles is breathing or blinking.  These types of actions always intrigued me even though they are fairly mundane.  My goal was to use this ability already present in the mind and apply it to psionic abilities I already could do, at the moment that consists of macro and micro telekinesis, energy manipulation, telepathic suggestion/broadcasting and to a lesser extent DMILS which I have been working on a documented experiment as of late.
<br />

<br />
Basically each of these skills I set a &quot;trigger&quot; which in this case has conditions that are not only physical, but also conditional on me being completely concious (such as not being tranced or sleeping...etc).  These triggers are actually just physical hand placement, such as one is that my hand is in a fist with my thumb crammed between my index and middle finger.  Nothing fancy, but its a physical gesture that represents to my subconcious the things I want it to unlock.
<br />

<br />
Now you may be asking yourself...how did you do this?  If you'll take a look at <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html097" target="_blank" class="postlink">this</a> article you can see the way triggers are used normally.  The most common one that is probably used by most of us, is that to your subconcious, cupping your hands means &quot;create a psiball between them&quot;.  It is a near automatic response.  These triggers are designed to do the same thing, but instead of using it to create something such as a psiball or a telepathic link, I use it to erect barriers that naturally my subconcious had in place.  This does not mean that I can do anything my concious mind dreams up, but is rather a tool for advancement in many different areas.
<br />

<br />
The other way that is necessary to achieve this effect is by being able to effectively communicate with your subconcious.  If you can do that your subconcious will tell you what it needs in order to accomplish your goals, whatever they might be.  Personally I get odd food requests every now and then, according to my subconcious in means &quot;I need vitamins!!&quot; so I think it may be a good idea.  My point here is that your subconcious is very smart, but it is also like a computer.  Take care of it and it will take care of you, that is really the best advice I can give.
<br />

<br />
Remember, this is just my personal technique for psionic advancement.  The actual things I have done, and how many times I tranced and such are not really important because my subconcious tells me what it needs.  Yours can too I believe, then again...maybe not.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  But really, don't take anything said here to be the final word on psionics, for me it is always a journey and the best way to get there is together, and with as many tools as possible.
<br />

<br />
Goodluck to you all!

Jesus christ. What's up with folk not reading full articles? Is this community retarded?
<br />
Original poster: I liked it. I'm not too used to communicating with my subconcious  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />  Boo lol.
<br />
I should put more practice into that.
<br />
Thanks for the post  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I read the whole thing ^^ and I totally agree with you on the subconcious part. I've been trying to talk to it via self-hypnosis, and meditation, but I feel I should try to take it further than that until I can talk to it 100%, or anything close to that.
<br />
Good read.. if anyone would actually read it &gt;_&gt; I recommend reading it.

			Hey cool, I thought communicating with your sub-c was something only I did i guess not. XD Truth be told I have two, ones better at keeping my abilities down low and excells at mental combat, the other... Im not sure yet, I just realized that the two can switch off roles of regulating my emotions and my subconscious control today about a half hour ago so ill let you know of my ordeal, but so far im more impulsive to do things and am more bodily energentic but the biggest thing for me is im not all into music with her behind my sub-c.. Its weird to be blunt.

			I use triggers so that I trance instantly, I dont see the need in triggering psi abilities and such, except maybe shields, if anything trigger mindstates, for example in deep trances you are able to expand your awareness, which you may find help for some applications of telepathy and energy manipulation, while it is not the ideal state it helps.

			I never really seem to get subconscious messages that I can pick up on outside of my clairvoyance practices...  Communication 'casually' with my Sub-Con is still on my to do list, quite high on it, also my long break from psionics really hampered the link I had with it, that and the bout of depression I went through in my break period.
<br />

<br />
Mostly i'm focused on getting the commucation with it, heh my main problem is not being able to completely decipher imagination from subcon messages...yet.
