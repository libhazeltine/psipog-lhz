			Yeah, that sounds about right, but I prefer the term Aero-PK, could I use that? it is, after all, more specific.
<br />

<br />
Also, would Chrono-PK be acceptible as Chrono-TP? as it is altering a person's perception of time, therefore it is more of a sub-skill of Telepathy rather than Psychokinesis. Hope I made that clear.

&quot;Chrono-PK&quot; ... is more of a time distortion... time dilation?  If someone has some evidence or experience that they think would fall under &quot;Chrono-PK&quot; (not a fictional story, real actual experience), then it would probably be easier to label.  Just don't create a new term - spell out exactly what you want to accomplish without relying on the term.

			Well, if it was something new, it'd be a special case.

Otherwise, just explain what you did to get it, and <span style="font-weight: bold">what effects it had</span>, that's like describing 'Aero-PK', aka weather control.

			Hey, why not just poll and see what would be good acceptable terms for the whole community?  
<br />
That way everyone could give their opinion on matters and they could be viewed in a good fair way.

Everybody has a say and everyone knows what is acceptable.

			i have a question
<br />

<br />
we have a term for controlling matter(the stuff with mass and volume) called PK 
<br />

<br />
but controlling energy(volume no mass) is just sub sections to PK like pyrokinesis (fire takes up space  but has no mass)
<br />

<br />
shouldent we have a term for controlling energy?

			Pyrokinesis isn't controlling fire, it's psychokinetically generating heat. Heat is what you get when atoms (or molecules) vibrate. You use psychokinesis to cause the atoms to vibrate, generating heat.
<br />

<br />
Therefore, Pyrokinesis = Psychokinesis

			Okay I know there are alot of kinesises floating around out there that just basically fall under PK right but can't you still specify them indivudally like Hydrokinesis, it only focuses on water and the movement of it not the creation of it. It is a form of PK and so are many others but it isnt completly wrong it you do indivudally specify them, is it?

			Why on earth be so picky???  this is more frustrating than any term anyone could create.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />   I say stop with the arguments and let some call it pyro, cryo, hydro or what ever the heck they want....Some people have been using those terms longer than some of you have been alive.  Stop focusing on terms this IS NOT an exact science.  You show your own stupidity every time you put down something that has existed longer than psipog.  If you absolutely don't like how someone says something, get over it.  psychokenetic heating or whatever the heck you call is possibly the worst name for that skill I've ever heard!!!  A lot of us would appreciate if you would get off our backs for WORDS.  It shows an immaturity that isn't needed when it comes to potentially deadly powers.  
<br />

<br />
I propose this thread be lock so there isn't anymore of this crap about what term is alowed.  Let  people have the freedom to call things what they want.  
<br />

<br />
 <img src="images/smiles/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" border="0" />  and if we really have to watch what we say...the cursing level of some is not good.  And a lot of those who do it are as young as my little brother.  That IS NOT acceptable in my view and SHOULD be delt with before terms...There is no need for it in a place were people are to come to learn.  
<br />

<br />
I say put a profanity block...if anyone uses it their reply/thread should be taken out.
<br />

<br />
Thank you and I hope some agree.

			I agree.  I think things such as pyrokinesis, cryokinesis (i know, i know it is the opposite of pyro), and some others (not insane like hydro/aqua whatever) should be allowed.  A thread got LOCKED because it talked about chronokinesis (the ability to alter ones perception of time) because of this thread even though people still think it is NOT a kinesis and was misnamed (like the battle of Bunker Hill).  I see no point in this because it is a conversation about a misnamed &quot;kinesis&quot;.  It is just a hassle on the moderator's part.  Yeah, it will get crazy with &quot;hydrokinesis and aquakinesis&quot; and whatever else there is but just allow a few words.  It gets really annoying.  Another thread got locked because he asked a question about &quot;electrokinesis&quot;.  In fact, 2 threads got locked by different people.  Another thread got locked looking for &quot;people who have mastered fire manipulation&quot;.  He didnt say pyrokinesis.  Yeah, sure some noob comes still thinking that people can master abilities.  You can easily and KINDLY (in caps because I am to lazy to italicize) set him straight and not completely block his learning.  One topic got locked by saying &quot;chrono-pk&quot;.  Getting better, no?  He showed that he knew it was a pk but he wanted specific help.  Just go throught the 4 pages of threads and see what was locked due to &quot;bad words&quot;.  One was locked on &quot;gravity&quot;.  Yeah, sure lock that one!  That was crap.  There are a couple others but, yeah you get my point...

			I agree with you Chris, its useless locking all those post just because they use a word to make clear what they mean.
<br />
get a poll up or something for Good/bad words and make a list of acceptable terms.
<br />
Just PK, is not usually enough information to describe what you mean, yeah you could say psychokinetically generating heat, but then its still easier to say pyrokinesis, or just any other term, a lot more people understand the term electrokinesis than &quot;manipulating psi to behave like electricity&quot;.
<br />
1- or get a poll up for &quot;to use and not to use&quot;
<br />
2- or accept those terms and don't lock everything just because they call it ...kinesis

			but there need to be some limitations, things such as &quot;pyrokinesis&quot; should stay because it is less stupid than say... &quot;geokinesis&quot; if you can move a coin, you can move an amount of dirt equal to the coins weight, so it's really the same, pyro, however, is on a molecular scale and therefore quite different from moving coins and dirt.
