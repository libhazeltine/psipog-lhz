			pepsiboy i agree with you 110%..How people say that there are strings and what not and she didnt actually move it...Damn people do RESEARCH you ever heard of that term....If you took 5 minutes to research her name and that video I promise you that you will find articles saying that she was under strict supervision by scientist and searched for any type of magnet, strings, metal etc..Whatever the hell your little imaginations come up with that wanna believe could move objects of that weight with a string..  
<br />

<br />
Besides, if she supposibly used a string to move the objects, the strings would have to be long enough to reach the objects when they are covered..and if you were to do this test yourself and debunk the situation you would find that the string would have some slak to it, enough slak causing the lady to have to turn her body to move her leg far enough to even begin to move the objects

			OMG NO WAY!! I was just about to ask you guys if speeding your heart rate while doing pk can harm you, because i did it.....big time!...Today at 1 30 in the morning i was trying to levitate a piece of paper and after about 20 min out of nowhere my heart started pumping, hard. Along with mustering a mass or energy and what felt like adrenaline. It got to the point where i thought i was SERIOUSLY going  to have a heart attack (i used to do cross contry and my hearts never even been like this at the END of a race...so i stopped after few minutes...but i was still in full control of it..its like i was deeper in my mind than ever before...I didn't realize until after but while doing this EVERYTHING was quieted(tv, my regular thoughts)...like i was entirely closed off from the world...The paper was sooo close to being 100% airborne and also twisting and bending and stuff...AND a spoon that was on the floor beside me bent aswell (about 30* and never done it before)...I could tell i had crazy energy going..it was a hardcore trance..but yea sorry this is so long but i'm too excited not to tell anyone...so does this mean it is unsafe?? because i know i can get back to that place now at will because i tried again right after lol...but the 2nd time wasn't nearly as powerful as the 1st...NEWAYS..safe/unsafe???? apollo or any other advanced guys this ever happen to you too???...............and by the way i WAS NOT RELAXED AT ALL...legs and arms very tense....comments??
