			Okay, I have a story about me and my cat that happened last night. It is very strange to me, and I am looking for an explanation. 
<br />

<br />
Last night, I just finished watching Ghost Hunters and I was kinda scared. I was just going to bed and turned off the lights. I was laying in bed looking around, frightened. But my cat comforted me by kneading my armpit.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  She always does it. After about 10 minutes of kneading, she stopped and moved, so I did too. But as I saw her walking on my blanket, she made it glow with her paws! I was shocked and freaked out. So I tried to debunk it. I feeled around for any flashlight in my bed but there were none there. So then I wanted to see if she would do it again. So I got into a better position and she came back on my bed and started kneading me again. And sure enough I did see the little bright points as she stepped there. But it was a bit dimmer this time. I can't really explain why this happened. I only have one theory and that is static electricity, my blanket produces a lot of it and with her kneading the blanket, I think she retained all of the static. Then, she released it with her paws as she walked. That is my only explanation. 
<br />
What do you think?

I highly doubt it was static electricity. When it's released it's a quick &quot;zap!&quot;. You know how it works after rubbing your socks all over a thick carpet then touching somthing metal. You get a quick shock, and then it's all gone. It sounds like your saying the impressions of light were there seconds (milliseconds?) after it happened. Static electricity would be released very quick, and with only one shot. Not a trail. If you did see what you saw I have no explanation.

I have a new thought though. When my cat steps, it creates indentations in the blanket, maybe this bends the light and reflects it at me somehow...

unless your blanket is metalic i doubt it especialy if your room isnt that lit up at night.

Huh? Have I had a problem with your past quoting?
<br />

<br />
Anyways, no, my blanket isn't metallic but I observed such things as light reflection before. It is quite simple, go out into the sunlight and place a piece of paper right next to your hand, you will notice that the light reflects the color of the paper onto your hand. It may be possible that a small amount of light comes through my window and then the light gets refracted along the blanket.
<br />

<br />
It seems as if no one is taking me seriously here. I am very serious, I almost mistook that light as if it came from a flashlight, I did see something. I just don't know what it is. There must be more theories.

			What would it be getting reflected off of then? And why would it happen only where your cat stepped? The light would be coming in from a higher spot than you wouldn't it? Wouldn't the light be reflected upward? I don't know. And Tankdown I doubt it's static because static produces bolts. (Like miniature lighting) Haven't you seen those things on TV or science fairs before. They have 2 large metallic spheres and a spinning contraption generating energy. When it's released it does so in the form of a bolt between the sherers making a loud cracking noise. That's exactly how static electricity looks and is released like. Just miniature.
<br />

SFG are you sure it only happens after your cat rubs on you? Are you sure it's not some sort of after-image?

This experience only happened that one night. I just stated that she rubbed on me to produce more information so you guys can analyze it in higher detail.
<br />
And yes, I am positive that it is not an after image, I wasn't looking at anything except my cat walking. I saw it very clearly. 
<br />

<br />
I was speaking to a friend who does go to this website last night, and he said it is probably an aura. He says that auras are most abundant on either the hands or the feet. Whether or not a cat can extend their auras is something I don't know.
<br />
I did see an article about it when I first came to these forums in matter of fact. And it may of also been my aura interacting with my cat's as well. Or something like that.
<br />

<br />
The light refraction. Okay, I have a curtain to cover my window. Light still does get through though, with this fact, that light could reflect off of the blanket's tiny indentations as the cat walks. Light travels in many places I must add. Since indentations are roughly domes, the light would be bouncing all around the indentations as well. So the light comes through the window, hits my blanket, and then my cat steps and creates new angles for the light to travel. 
<br />
But of course, this is all a very deep theory that is also me stretching any facts that I have.

Then why would the reflection of light disappear so quickly. If the light was being reflected, it would've stayed refelcted until you altered the shape of the blanket. Sounds like you're stretching for answers but I doubt you're going to come up with any feasible explanation.

Hehe, very good point. The indentation would still be there, but not to the same extent is all I can say, so the angles in which the light travels will once again change.

But all and all, this is a very stupid guess.

I rather to follow the aura idea.

I experience static a lot at my work. I move cloths around into a baler machine, or if its a slow day I work sorting cloths. I tend to feel static in the air when I look at the cloths in some plastic contendors. I do feel a shock once in a while as well. I know what static looks like cracking the air like it does. And I know that light reflects off everything, just some more then others. Like only about 12% of the light I believe is reflected off the moon (Mite be 15%, could be wrong).
<br />

<br />
It does sound rather odd, but as I know about cats who also lay with me. 
<br />

<br />
I wonder if there is more to somefatguy story, such that he mite have pet his cat while in his armpit. Being a cat, would roll around the blanket.
<br />

<br />
I'm not exactly somefatguy last time I check so I don't know exactly what gone on every detail.
<br />

<br />
To the light I do think it was reflected off from below the cats feet where the static mite have jump from. 
<br />

<br />
But its only a small idea that came to mind.

			Well you're right Tankdown. It is static. I proved it last night and I was having so much fun with it!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />
I was just under my blanket making flashes of light with static and then putting my hand near my flourescent light and watching it glow. It was very cool. 
<br />
I am positive that it is static now. I just don't understand the science of it though. Why does my cat create such a different static light? She came on my bed last night again, and only made one light but it was pretty big. 
<br />

<br />
Here's my thought on it though: I think that my cat is acting like a giant feline battery. Since she is made of 97% hair, she takes in all of the static from the blanket and then releases it somehow. 
<br />

<br />
I can even put this on a small video if someone tells me how to upload it. I will also look up the materials in my blanket, because it is actually two different materials back to front. 
<br />
This is all very interesting to me. If someone knows the science of how my cat makes these different static reactions I will be greatly apprciative of your knowledge.
