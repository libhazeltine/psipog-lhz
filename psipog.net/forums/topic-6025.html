			Well I'm trying to move the psi wheel with this method and it's not working. I sat down stared at the wheel and collected everylittle detail and got nothing. Should I have my hands around it? Does anyone else find it hard to &quot;become one&quot;?

			Becoming one with the object is more than knowing the details about it and looking at it. I believe that in order to do so, you must know how to do it, from experience. The more you move the psi-wheel and practice PK, the more you start to understand what &quot;becoming one with the object&quot; really is. In my opinion you must experience it to know what it's really like. It's very hard to explain in words. Therefor I suggest when starting, try using a different method. Try the &quot;just do it method&quot; and remember your not forcing it to move. Just &quot;<span style="font-style: italic">let </span>the wheel move&quot;, and know that it will. And always...relax and have fun  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I attempted this method for days with no progress, and then tried the &quot;just do it&quot; method which i find is much better. I dont even think about moveing it now i just concentrate a little and the wheel spins.

			I think the missing point in your technique is to feel how the object feels. Collecting details can only be usefull if they help you to feel how the object feels. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
The object is living in a way. Can you feel how it feels ?
<br />

<br />
Move it gently, how does it feel now ?

			Jeee! I just posted this today and got 6 replys thanks. I've bee practicing this method for a few days. I still don't understand how it works so thats not the method for me. I have discovered another 'methom'. I just put my fingers bout 5cm away from 2 of the psi wheels corners and moved them around the wheel slowly like madrid demonstrates in the media section and the wheel moves like hers does. But it's not as fast and it stops a lot. How does this happen.

			Feeling the object, or getting a sense of the object, is often mistaken for becoming one with the object. Both are very different. Becoming one with an object will only occur after alot, I repeat, alot of practice in the skill of concentration and bringing forth one-pointedness of the mind.
<br />

<br />
What happens when you are getting a sense of the object, is that your energy communicates, in a way, with the object of choice. You sort of receive the energetic info, or energy from the object as your energy blends with, or hits the energy of the object. This will allow you to move the object more easily than normal, but it won't give you that much benefit, in my experience.
<br />

<br />
Then there is the true becoming one with, as I see it. Normally we have three stages in meditation, or in concentration upon an object. you got:
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">1: The meditator &gt;&gt;&gt; 2: Process of meditation &gt;&gt;&gt; 3: the object </span>meditated upon.
<br />
When you truly become one with the object, those three stages collapse. But before that becomes a possibility, ones mind must become as clear as a pure crystal. There should be no desires and no thoughts present, that are able to disturb your mind. This is reached after extensive practice of concentration. When the mind becomes ready to not only hold just one object and its aspects steady, but just one single impression/thought/image/concept in mind, without any dynamic thoughts about its aspects, but only that one single impression, then you have established one-pointedness of mind. After you have practiced this, it may occur to you that you become one with the object. literally. I do not mean that your body blends in with the object. I mean that your consciousness becomes fully absorbed in the object of choice, so that there is no longer a seperation between <span style="font-weight: bold">1: the meditator </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold">3:the object meditated upon</span>. Hence: the <span style="font-weight: bold">2: process of meditation </span>is not there either, because how can there be a process of meditation if you have only one thing? Cause in this state consicousness is fully absorbed by the object itself. You forget about everything, you lose your sense of time, space and even your sense of Self. You know only that object, and nothing more. You will realise hidden information, or secrets about the object in this state, through <span style="font-style: italic">direct-knowledge</span>.
<br />

<br />
This is what the true &quot;becoming one with&quot; method means to me. People underestimate the power and the benefit of concentration. They think they have already established good concentration. No. Not may have. Our minds are too disturbed by selfish desires and thoughts that crave for objects outside of us that give us little pleasure. Real concentration is the key to any succes and any ability.

I think you've told us enough.
<br />
Please don't say you can't do it unless you've tried really hard and for a long time, then and only then come here asking for help.
<br />

<br />
Please! We are not the same and some can do it in less time than others! Keep that in mind and just practise!

			But why would I waste my time on a method that I don't understand? LOL. I'm a very impatient person and get bored easily. Btw I made a new dicovery on the new method; it seems that when my finger are to close to the wheel it stops but when I bring them back a bit it moves. I'de still like to know what I'm doing to make it move.

That could be static electricity. Depends if it's spinning or just something like tilting towards/away from your finger. Also being very impatient and getting bored easily will get you nowhere fast in psionics.

Well yeah static is like magnetism, it would move even if you don't concentrate at all.

			It couldn't be static as attraction varies with distance. you can't attract something that is far from you with more power that something that is near you.
<br />
deffinantelly (sp??) it's not static. when i started doing it, the wheel started following my hands. i looked like:  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> . i washed my hands 3 ou 4 times to get anything out of it, dropped my needle and the wheel to the ground so any charge it had would be dissipated, and it kept following me.
<br />
plus, i was able to move it from a bigger distance like 2 times.
<br />
not static.
