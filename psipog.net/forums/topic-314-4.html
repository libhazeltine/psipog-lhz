			yeah with terminology everybody is correct, and by the way that's pretty good.
<br />

<br />
Once again not to be religious but I believe that their is evidence here, in the buddhist texts it states that many of the ascetics gained the ability through concentration to levitate, walk through walls, penetrate a person's mind, see cause and effect that are not seen normally, hear things faraway, touch the moon and the sun.
<br />

<br />
Now when it says &quot;touch the moon and the sun&quot; it can be taken literally or figuratively to show the extent of their powers.
<br />

<br />
So psi powers are extremely powerful physically, and if not extremely then maybe even all-powerful physically.

No, I'd blow him off the front porch with one of the many guns around the house before he could get to the door.

Ok...
<br />

<br />
1. Psi is defined as the mechanism or mechanisms that allow PK and ESP to function.  Under this definition, if 'Chi' or 'Ki' display PK or ESP, then they would fall under the umbrella term of Psi.  Now, on PsiPog.net, it is mostly assumed that Psi is one mechanism, but it is quite possible that it is multiple mechanisms (I personally believe it is multiple).  Part of this confusion is my fault for presenting Psi as a 'type of energy' on PsiPog.net - in the future, I hope to move away from this a little bit.
<br />

<br />
2. What the hell are you guys talking about?
<br />

<br />
3. At PsiPog.net, one of our goals is to seperate ourselves from both Magick and New Age schools of thought.  I'm not saying Magick or New Age techniques don't work - in fact, I believe a lot of them do work, and I know psions that use them.  However, my main complaint with Magick and New Age is their explaination of <span style="font-style: italic">why</span> their techniques work almost always rely on religion.  You're free to link someone to a magick article if they're curious, but ultimately, I don't want this place to turn into a site focused on magick.  And you're free to discuss how chi and ki relate to psi, but realize that ultimately - this website is about psi.  I don't want to attract people who want to do &quot;ki blasts&quot; or martial arts.
<br />

<br />
Basically - at PsiPog, we focus on psi without relying on religion.  The reason ki and magick conversations make me twitch is because this isn't what PsiPog is made for.  They are different schools of thought, and there are other websites out there made for those schools of thought.

<br />
thats not always true, i practice some magick, but i done belive that it all comes from &quot;divine&quot; or &quot;religeous&quot; reasons.  i figure its more like the large amount of belief in something creats like a &quot;pool&quot; of energy that gets used when it is required, and that without widespread belife in it, it wouldent do anything.  
<br />

<br />
thirdly, does anybody know a site that allows talk of magic and chi AND psi, without neglecting any of it... because its very difficult to talk about one without talking about another,,,, it all probly comes from the same thing anyways...

			hey, I've been waiting for a comment from you Peebrain! =) I've been wanting the opinion of this sites overseer, so thanks. and if you don't want anything else on here about chi or martial arts, i can respect that. even though i disagree somewhat with you on something you've said, i still respect what you say and the site here. but, i am going to go ahead and say what i disagree with you on: for one thing, i disagree that PSI should be the master umbrella if you will and that chi and everything else should fall under it. Please hear me out on this one: imagine if you will that instead, chi is this master umbrella. Now, this is what i believe: i believe that PSI is chi being used more through the mind, same applies to cryo and pyro-kinesis', its chi used as fire or ice energy.

			Psi is psi. Magick is magick, and all the rest. It's all the same thing, simply changed by different perceptions. Different techniques for different minds, people all think differently, some tech's that work for some people (you see it a lot in PK for example - almost everyone does it differently), will not work for someone else, because of the difference in thought. Anyway. I'm a psion. I practice psi. I'll stick with it. Magick/Ki/Chi/etc isn't my thing.
<br />

<br />
And I've studied and practiced Shotokan Karate-do for some years now (4ish). I try to keep its concept of <span style="font-style: italic">kime</span> seperate from my Psi studies. I'm agnostic. Keeps things simple. Lost my train of thought somewhere when I was writing this, might edit if I recall what it was I was trying to say.
<br />

<br />
Point: Sean is right. I've seen several websites which mix magick and religion into its content. It's nice to have a 'free' haven away from that. Lets keep psipog like it is.
<br />

<br />
(And I don't particulary care if you disagree with my perceptions - they're mine not yours, your welcome to your own.)

<br />
&quot;1. Psi is defined as the mechanism or mechanisms that allow PK and ESP to function.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I don't think you really want to state that psi or psionics is the _mechanism_ by which PK and ESP (these things I define as a product of psionic phenomena).
<br />

<br />
A mechanism is a testable explanation as to why an observed phenomena occurs. 
<br />

<br />
Like for instance, sexual selection is a mechanism via which evolution is able to occur. We can observe animals selecting specific mates with specific traits whom they choose to mate with. 
<br />

<br />
I liken this to psionics and psi when I think of it in this way - evolution doesn't cause things to evolve, evolution is not the mechanism through which things evolve, natural selection is. Evolution is the general explanation we give to describe the phenomena. Natural selection is HOW the phenomena happens. Evolution IS the phenomena. 
<br />

<br />
Psionics is not the mechanism via which someone moves an object with their mind, it is the explanation given as to why something moved when someone wanted it to using only willpower. 
<br />

<br />
An actual mechanism explaining psionics would be something like, for example (and this is all example, entirely bullshit, and goes on the basis that there are PSI genes and PSI energy waves distinct from say, light waves), a person has the PSI gene. This gene expresses the PSI horomone which binds to ligand gated ion receptors on PSI neurons. The activation of PSI neurons allows one to generate PSI energy waves and direct these waves outside of the body, causing an object to move. 
<br />

<br />
Does that make sense? I hope so. I don't see psi or psionics as a real, physical thing, unless it is proven to be an actual form of wave energy or quantized particles. It is my impression that psi or psionics is the term, the explanation we give when we observe what we could claim is &quot;psionic&quot; or &quot;paranormal&quot; phenomena, but is not how it is done. 
<br />

<br />
As a scientist (LOL), I am just trying to keep it scientific. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;2. What the hell are you guys talking about?&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Martial arts, energy, chi, magick, psionics, hehe what I would call &quot;all of the above. 
<br />

<br />
When dealing with a phenomena with no known mechanisms as to how or why it works, trying to cut out discussion of magick, chi, and all that jazz I feel is really silly. 
<br />

&quot;3. At PsiPog.net, one of our goals is to seperate ourselves from both Magick and New Age schools of thought.&quot;
<br />

<br />
A major problem I have with this is that really what you, we, are doing IS magick in every traditional sense. 
<br />

<br />
A rose by any other name will still smell as sweet. Whether one calls it psi, witchcraft, magick, chi, etc., the results are the same when it actually happens - paranormal phenomena that is devoid of a mechanism as to how it works. So people will say, well, it works because it is psi, or it works because it is magick, or it works because it is chi. It's really all the same thing, and the explanation is not a mechanism as to how and why it works. 
<br />

<br />
But I can understand wanting to distance oneself from those other camps and only for this reason - the term &quot;psi&quot; is used scientifically (to describe magickal events and unexplained phenomena), and most often those in the new age and magick camps are VERY unscientific and just 'fluffy' in general (like you said, trying to use religion as an explanation for magick). 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;this website is about psi. I don't want to attract people who want to do &quot;ki blasts&quot; or martial arts.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I have read many pagan and witchcraft books that describe how to make and control &quot;power balls&quot;, and play games with them. They are the same thing as what you would call a &quot;psi ball&quot; and someone else would call a &quot;chi ball&quot;. A rose will still be a rose even if we decide to call a rose a lily and lillies roses. They will still be what they are no matter how we name and redefine them.  
<br />

<br />
A rose by any other name will still smell as sweet. Magick by any other name will still be magick. 
<br />

<br />
Saying psi I would say is a more scientific way as opposed to saying magick in that it gets scientists to not just laugh you away when want to discuss the issue. 
<br />
I can understand your penchant not to like words like magick, chi, witchcraft, sorcery, because they can be associated with religion, but this only happens when a person wants to mingle religion and personal convictions with magick, or redefine magick or witchcraft to include religious and spiritual convictions when really magick/witchcraft does not have anything to do with religion or gods. 
<br />
The reason why people will mix them is that they are using religion, the divine, as a mechanism as to why and how psi/magick/chi works. Such mechanisms can be disproven through the use of logic and philosophy, and are unscientific at heart. 
<br />

<br />
We still don't have a real, working mechanism for explaining psi/magick. Anyone want to help me find one LoL? We could make a million dollars  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
While I want to personally keep psi/magick out of spiritualty, I feel that there is no way to seperate the two when trying to find an actual explanation as to why/how, and I feel others would agree that there is a connection between spirituality, however you want to define it, and magick (ie. I feel that no mechanism of psi/magick will be complete without some sort of what people define as &quot;spirituality&quot; coming into play with the mechanism. Like, for instance, with my example before of PSI energy and PSI genes as a mechanism, it doesn't explain the great philosophical WHY).

OK I'll shut up now  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
