			i have just thought of something interesting, in science class, we were talking about the chemical reaction that happens inside the bodies of organisms. you have 6 oxygen molecules and a glucose molecule. in the body, it produces 6 carbon dioxide molecules 6 water molecules and energy. this is the exact opposite of what plants do, ther take in energy (sunlight) water and carbon dioxide and output glucose and oxygen. so my question is is it only organisms that give off aura, or is it any form of matter. because if it is then this would give an explaination of where the aura comes from. if there is actually a proven explaination of where the aura comes from, please reply
<br />

<br />
i posted this once before in the topic called flare in the psychokinesis section of the forum, but no one was reading it.  so im making a sepparate topic about it in the modern sciences section of the forum.  please post whether or not you believe this is a valid hypothesis.  and if there is alerady a valid explaination please post either a link or an explaination of wht it is

			Hard to say, auras have to be in link to some form of energy production. Which is of cource connected to some form of nerve network, and health beitfits. I don't know of any proof of there of auras but I'm willing to look a around a litte. I'm sure someone will give you more but I don't think any of it would really be exactly &quot;proof&quot;.

			This is just my opinion and hypothesis, but I think that auras are just infrared light or heat emitted from our bodies, and those with aural vision have the ability to see infrared light, thus, the aura. Just my opinion though.

			infrared isn't created by heat, heat could bend light , but thats about it, and we wouldn't even generate enough heat to do that.  if you have some proof of me being wrong, please link me up

Can't be. It would show up in the electromagneic spectrum.

Infra-red radiation is radiated heat. Infra-red radiation is emitted from the Sun or from an ordinary filament lamp. All objects are emitting some IR radiation. As the temperature of an object increases, it emits more IR radiation and of shorter wavelenghts. At 500 degrees Celsius most objects start to emit red light as well.

And as far as I know and experienced, everything has an aura. Which is probably the electromagnetic theory came from. And organisms supposedly have more complex auras (humans having the most complex) though I personally haven't seen more than one colour. I'm not very proficient so I don't doubt its existence.
