Are we Psis not a small group of people, even counted in our entirety? We're not exactly the largest group on this planet of 7 billion. If we were, this thread wouldn't even exist!
<br />

<br />
But extremely small groups, such as STAG (my own, which I'm trying to get off the ground) don't really work too well. If you'd like to make STAG bigger, then just check out <a href="http://stagpsionics.tripod.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://stagpsionics.tripod.com/</a>, and then e-mail or PM me with your choice of pseudonym (fake name, can't have a title, and numbers are discouraged) and your nationality.

			Maybe you didn't get what I meant. The name STAG is fine, the acronym and the mascot go along nice.
<br />

<br />
But, what I was talking about was the Psuedonym that the members give, such as here in Psipog. My real name is Youseff, not SheepKing. And in a &quot;serious&quot; organization aimed at proving something, I'd say I was Youseff.
<br />

<br />
Get what I mean?

			As far as an overall idea, its sounds nice, but I dont think it is very plausible.
<br />

<br />
Psionic communities have enough trouble co exisiting ONLINE much less in public. Asking them all to &quot;unite and rise up&quot; or whatever is not going to turn out.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I'm right, you're wrong!&quot;  &quot;No!  We've been around longer WE'RE right!&quot;  &quot;No, you're both wrong, my group is doing it the right way, follow us or GET OUT.&quot;
<br />

<br />
You can see where I'm going with that.  But the point is, is that psionics has been a pseudoscience and non standard art for hundreds of years, simply because it fits in to society that way. It is easier to coexist with psychics when the mass public thinks its a crock of shit.

do you think they would actually print an anonymous (&lt;----lol. thats how you spell it i think) article? i mean....if i was the editor i would. but i can't speak for anyone.

<br />
i would give it a go though.....how about PK? that seems to be the most popular psionic skill people want to know about. (Correct me if i'm wrong about that though.)
