It is probably some ESP thing.  You are wanting something to happen, you avert your concious mind but still focus your subconcious, you know someone replied.  Just like the rest of psionics.

			I've had a simular case of this before, though not in the same respects. I am far enough from my computer to not hear noises or its sound is off or drowned out, I will then hear a faint sound, it changes depending on the nature of the message im recieving. Email usually sounds near to the popping sound Yahoo Messanger gives for new messages, though most of these times Yahoo Messanger is off. Sometimes when I check it, or get that or other noises I find a message or sit down just in time for the message to pop up. Granted i've been wrong more times then right, i've always shrugged it off as my imagination playing tricks. Then the times I was right on things such as MSN messages I always had that in thought before also the person, so probably not ESP in a sense, but maybe subconscious pinging by the other person on their want to send me a message.
<br />

<br />
Though probably not ESP I felt it relevant to tell of these occurences that have happened to me.

			Ahmed, 
<br />
It sounds like some form of ESP indeed. To narrow it down, precognition and / or telepathy of some kinda probably.

*Nods*,
<br />
I was expanding on what had been said. Being able with telepathy doesn't neccessitate being able with precognition, and so on.
<br />

<br />
That being said, a lot of people find working on one perceptive skill <span style="text-decoration: underline">can</span> increase skill in the others. Better to work on a skill you're good at then branch out from there, than fumble around at something and dishearten yourself, no?
<br />

<br />
Ahmed, I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to ask in that last question. Could you rephrase it please? 
<br />

<br />
Aether.

			I don't believe that telekinesis belongs to ESP. Telekinesis is one of the projective skills, it is not a <span style="font-style: italic">Perception</span> skill, like in Extra Sensory <span style="font-style: italic">Perception.</span>
<br />
If I am correct, <span style="font-style: italic">ESP Is everything that can be <span style="font-weight: bold">percieved/viewed</span> by an individual, beyond the use of the five senses.</span>
<br />

<br />
The projective skills <span style="font-style: italic">in total</span>, are usually called Psychokinesis, or Mind over Matter.

			To answer the original post: there is no label for that.  ESP works.
<br />

<br />
In parapsychology, it's divided into two categories: ESP and Psychokinesis.  ESP being perception, and PK being manipulation.  OBEs are usually considered seperate.  That's the basic break down.

			As peebrain said, ESP is a broad topic.  The 2 topics are ESP and Psychokinesis (i guess i was wrong about PK being ESP).  ESP and Psychokinesis are both psionic (psychic) abilities.  You have to enhance one part of it (ie telepathy, RV, etc).  Sorry, no short cuts.
