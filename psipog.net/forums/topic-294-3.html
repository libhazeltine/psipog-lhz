I myself told my parents right away when I spinned the psiwheel and stuff...
<br />
Before all the telekinetic stuff, I was doing telepathy, EVEN WITH MY PARENTS! My parents are pretty down with it, they really accept this... although my dad wants sometimes evidence and stuff at times, but that's cool, he still allowes me to do the whole psionic thing. 
<br />

<br />
My advice would be tell it to your parents. Or on the other side, if your parents are really the high religious people, then it's best to keep it for yourself for a while <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.

			I haven't told them. I might have shown a mild interest on occasions when the subject has come up, but not <span style="font-style: italic">told</span> them outright.
<br />

<br />
Like most people here, I want to practice and get confident with it, get some solid results, before I show them. And that's IF I can pluck up the courage to do so. They already think I'm a little weird, and I doubt that telling them about my interest in psionics would help matters, eh? ;)
<br />

<br />
Though my mum does seem to be <span style="font-style: italic">quite</span> open-minded about such matters, and my dad's actually had a few psychic experiences of his own (he's got a little precognitive ability, I think)... It's really just my own apprehension that's stopping me telling them.
<br />

<br />
They might take it a bit seriously, you know? I don't want that. I like to be playful about it.

			My dad thought I was crazy when I told him, but I've been quiet about it and he's left me alone.  My mom tries to sound like an expert on it by getting all these books on energy, religion, etc. but doesn't make an attempt to practice anything psionic herself, so I don't always pay attention to her tips.

			Well, i chose 4, but that is only because that is closest to my situation.
<br />

<br />
My mom is definantly into stuff like this, just more of a passive thing than anything else. She sees spirits, visions, OBE's, ect. Not really into tk,pk, and psionics, but she believes they do exist. My siblings and I do share her ability to sometimes see ghosts (in my case feel em). I am the only one who seeks it though, my siblings are very &quot;down-to-earth&quot;. or at least more so thatn me, so they don't really try these kinds of things. Well, my mom does know that I seek/practice OBE's (I have had 2, neither intentional), etc. but she doesn't know that I am specifically working on this aspect if it. She will be fine with it though, adn same with siblings.
<br />

<br />
My grandad is a preacher, so most mystical stuff is a no-no in his family, but after bieng with my mom for so long he has come to accept/support it, so he wouldn't hae a problem with it. 
<br />

<br />
So, it is more like when I have proof that I can form psi-balls etc. then I will probably reveal this latest &quot;endeavor&quot; to my mom. my dad probably wouldn't really care to know (not in a bad way though, if I told hime he would just be like &quot;ok, sounds nice&quot;).

First off, I told my mom, but not my stepdad.
<br />

<br />
The only 'proof' I could provide was for her to feel a psiball. I made her stick her finger in it and she described the same sensation I get when making one. Although she says she believes me I cant shake the feeling that she is only trying to humour me. Telling anyone else in my family is out of the question.

I showed my parents the effects of a force bubble, eliminating all doubt from the very beginning. That way, I didn't have to rely on being able to perform with people watching, either. Dad is moderately interested, and mum doesn't care. They're relatively open-minded.

			i live with my mom and she is a skeptic with everything...she is a big believer in God (so am i but i dont follow alot of the bible). 
<br />

<br />
i practiced moving the psiwheel in my bedroom for a while (without my mom knowing) and after i saw results everytime i tried (took only 2 days) i brought her up to my room and said &quot;i have something to show you&quot;
<br />

<br />
I moved the psiwheel right away (it moved with every command from me) and suddenly she tells me &quot;God gave you a gift, use it well&quot;
<br />

<br />
she later went into this beleive that God is only making me believe it for a reason (i cant tell if she believes or not)

			Wow, this thread is really interesting. I haven't told my parents, and probably won't. But it's not like I go to great lenghts to hide it either; if they wanna pry into my PC or ask, &quot;Are you a psion?&quot; I'm not gonna lie. My whole family, including myself, are pretty devout Catholics. I think my interest in psionics has strengthend my faith, and doesn't interfere with it, so long as I don't get into anything occult-ish. I have also had mild depression in the past, which made my parents very concerned about any of my friends or interests. These things being said, the WORST case scenario if they found out is one like Apollo's. However, my pap and my mom can dowse for watter, and think nothing of it, except that it's pretty cool and useful (they found a well for my cousins when they moved to a rural area). And my dad is into science and new theories and stuff too. So I guess best case scenario is them being mildly interested.
<br />

<br />
But as far as being a Catholic psion, my personal belief (just sharing, not imposing) is that you don't have to follow every little law, or everything a priest says. If you believe you're not doing anything God would'nt want you to do, it's between you and him. If a priest is gonna make a big deal about it, who cares? Who is he to say what God aproves of and doesn't? Then there are priests (like the one currently at my parish) who are big Harry Potter fans... go figure. I could see him not having a problem with psionics. But I wouldn't dream of starting a discussion with him about it!
