You sound like Siddhartha (Buddha), lol. I also disagree with the way society is. Unfortunately I enjoy the luxaries of modern civilization too much and just want someone to make the government a socialist one for the most part. I wouldn't want it to be pure socialism though, just give everyone the same wages so they can do what they love without worrying about being shit poor <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. And I also believe that a lot of other things would have to be fixed too such as preserving the environment, cutting down/eliminating polution, etc. If I were to go in the forest I'd only do it for a short period of time to see what it's like. If I liked it I might visit the forest buddy forest for a short time <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> (assuming I pay rent to help you pay for your taxes <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />).

He thinks going there to become more spiritual and knowledgable through meditation is useless because you can simply do that at home. It's ok for you to do it because you're just doing it because you'd like to live in a forest. At least thats what I think he means. Though I don't agree.

			Well I am with enlightenment, that is your choice and this is mine, I do not hate you for that. 
<br />

<br />
Well, I was thinking. We should make a list of the supplies that we need. Fakiti's website had some but they missed out on some important stuff.
<br />

<br />
-Vitamins (definetly need these, we need some calcium and lots of other missed out nutrients...unless we get a cow.)
<br />
-Dynamos (good light source and you charge it yourself!) 
<br />
-Books (we need some good reading material)
<br />
-Camping Soap (camping soap is very good soap that goes a long way)
<br />
-Pots and pans (if you want me to use my famous cooking skills, I need pots and pans! Just kidding, I haven't cooked before)
<br />
-Weaponry (you never know when I am going to have to protect you guys from a bear, yes, I can take on a bear!) 
<br />
-Plant seeds (we are going to need to grow some agriculture for a small food source)
<br />
-Tents (of course we are going to need a nice shelter that keeps out the bugs) 
<br />
-Durable clothing 
<br />

<br />
Ehh, thats all I can think of right now, any more supply suggestions will be greatly apprciated.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
EDIT: 
<br />
-Zip lock bags (they are extremely useful for almost anything)

			Heh, I love camping, nature, so on and so forth (I'm a pagan, goes with the territory, I guess) but I'm willing to bet after about a month you guys would be missing a lot of stuff pretty hardcore- like indoor plumbing and thermostats. I'm all for being in touch with nature and maybe a temporary exodus from society, but as for an actual lifestyle is probably not that realistic. Cool idea nonetheless, though.
