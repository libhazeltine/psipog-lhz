			It's wierd, but lately if I &quot;happy&quot; myself, aka take the feeling of hapiness and feel it inside, not smiling or the like, then send it to my sub-c, my psionics go better, especially making the psiwheel spin, at which this technique seemed to carry huge success (hence why I posted it in PK)
<br />

<br />
Do you think that this could be an amplifier of sorts, through emotion (if I may go so far as to say something in the ream of Matilda using anger etc.)?

			Makes me think listening to a good joke and then trying the psi wheel would work better. Laugh! Power to the sub-c! i'll try this on myself.

			Well me and my one friend were experenmenting with Retro PK. And i found on teh bell curve(my favorite one) acting crazy and talking and being all pumped and in general acting rediculus made it go REALLY high everytime.  And her favorite was stopping the pendulum, and she found not breathing and flexing all your muscles, almost an angered focus, made it stop better.
<br />

<br />
So i agree with you!  I'm gonna try that more.

			It's like, how much motivation you give your sub-c to actually do something. It would be funny to be all like &quot;YEAHHH&quot; to a friend, then the other one is all like &quot;YEAHHHH~!!&quot;.. back and forth. ya know. all I CAN DO IT attitude.

			Plus another thing I thought is that if you are all happy and OH YEEAHHHH then you aren't stressing or being too focused on a goal, you're just going for the emotion and surely that helps? Heh, I have that written in an article I am writing for the school newsletter on moving the psiwheel, loads of different techniques and stuff.

			While not really a technique I don't think it belongs in the psychokinesis section. Since you mentioned something about psionics in general I think we'll move it to the techniques section since it's a way to help improve your abilities.

			i find its alot like 'hugging yourself'
<br />

<br />
if youre nicer to your body, and mind, instead of always eminating harsher emotions, itl be nicer to you in kind.
<br />

<br />
that content, kindness (etc)  envokes a 'happy, euphoric (etc)' feeling that relates -usualy- to a higher level relationship where 2 beings are in a shared, upper state.    dont produce this feeling unless youre in tune with it, and youre happy enough with your sub-c and body.
<br />

<br />
producing good feelings after a well done practice, reading, etc will make it all more the worthwhile and productive. i find i remember more as well.
<br />

<br />
all this week i gave myself nothing but good vibes and pleasant thoughts and ive noticed an increase in visualizations, emotions, and even my concentration went back up.

			it attracts more good energy though,
<br />
and it allows for a cleaner, clearer mind,
<br />

<br />
hence, maybe a feeling of more energy youve been getting
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
dosnt it make your psi 'gears' feel cleaner though??
