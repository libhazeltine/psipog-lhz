			i have a theory on this:
<br />

<br />
in Rainsong's guide, didn't she say something about &quot;fluffing&quot; out your field and &quot;fluffing&quot; out the object's field?  would this somehow be the link that depaterns or balances out the magnetic repulsion that keeps us from naturally phasing?  let me emphasize:
<br />

<br />
if the only thing keeping us from naturally phasing really is a magnetic repulsion, then we just have to get rid of the repulsion to phase.  this can be done by obliterating it somehow, or maybe balancing out the waves into flatlining (white noise when dealing with sound).  maybe our fields have an electromagnetic field of the same frequency as an atom's.  this in turn will balance out the atom's electric field, and get rid of the repulsion, in conclusion allows us to phase.  this makes sense when thinking about psychokinesis as well.  maybe we can move objects because of this electromagnetic field.  the waves move the object, which we can control by will.  or, we use our field to interact with other object's natural electromagnetic field's, which creates repulsion or attraction.  this field is what we call our psionic field, but maybe it's really just our natural electromagnetic field that a select few of us (telekinetics) have learned to turn on and off, and have learned to use to move objects.  like i said, it's just a theory, but one to think about.

WildgOphers,

<br />
That is completely your own choice, but the fact that phasing can actually be done, sways my decision, namely because i've done it.

			hmm, I'm pretty sure Ive read something about &quot;phasing&quot; in the bible,

Passing through objects with ease or something... I can't realy remember

anyways i also heard about phenomenon about these building bricks somehow passing through the walls of another building when it got blasted off by demolition. Oh and the arrow which was probably half-way phased through a glass bottle.

phasing started to interest me as of late...

That sounds interesting, ive never ever heard of the bricks passing through walls in demolitions before.

Maybe they think it's dangerous for you, I dunno...
