'I would like to see these documents stating that &quot;Rhine was fooled by magicians for quite some time&quot;.'
<br />
I personally have not found official documents, but his being decieved by a circus horse is quite a famous story and Rhine is a commonly used figure for skeptics to show just how much some people can want there experiments to be right. Even if they are total rubbish. The following link explains some of Rhines exploits in humerous detail.

We do not get worked up by people such as Kief, just a little frustrated, if you look at his previous posts, they have no argument to them at all. If Kief had given sources of information and said something that made sense, then we would not have a quarrel with him, but instead, he has just called us names and believes that everything he says is 'the truth'. He likes the sound of his own voice, and at times sounds like an 8 year old.

<br />
Alright, you made two mistakes. Your first mistake was to say that my video clips are faked and an illusion without showing any proof aside from your horrible skeptical attitude. The second mistake you made was making this comment at this time. I'm currently going through some family issues and I'm quite pissed off. So, I'll give this to you like you deserve.
<br />

<br />
Over the past few months I've seen you spread your ridiculous opinions based on Psychokinesis (PK). At one point you decided to make several fake videos trying to get the point across that anyone can fake them. However, you have yet to impress myself and the other staff members by this. You love to spread your opinion stating &quot;Psychokinesis (PK) is not real&quot; yet you fail to realize that Psychokinesis (PK) has been tested and proven by scientific testing in the past. 
<br />

<br />
Since your unable to do your own research on Psychokinesis (PK), I'll be glad to give you an quick history lesson. Perhaps this will stop the spread of false, ignorant statements. You've finally stepped on my toes. Your mistake.
<br />

<br />
The history of Psychokinesis (PK) dates back thousands of years where people wrote about how man could move objects without psychical force. Parts of the bible speaks of Psychokinesis (PK) as well. The Egyptians sketched in drawings Psychokinesis (PK) as well as Gods who came down from the sky who had these amazing abilities. 
<br />

<br />
Psychokinesis (PK) has been documented throughout mankind?s history. However, it was not until modern times that humans started to scientifically test Psychokinesis (PK) existence. People such as Joseph Banks Rhine, Nina Kulagina, Helmut Schmidt, Robert Jahn, Dean Radin etc, all contributed to the study of Psychokinesis (PK). Allow me to give you some information based on these people and organizations that they worked with.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Joseph Banks Rhine:</span></span> J.B Rhine is the founder of the Rhine Research Center. Joseph spent many years scientifically testing psychic functioning which included Psychokinesis (PK). His research alone made a permanent mark on the research of psychic functioning and is still regarded as hard evidence. He died in 1980.
<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
Robert G. Jahn:</span></span> Robert was the director of the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR). Robert and his associates performed and scientifically tested psychic functioning which included the study of Psychokinesis (PK).  
<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Nina Kulagina:</span></span> Nina was a Russian woman who actively participated in Psychokinesis (PK) experiments and studies performed by the Soviet government. Nina is best known for her unbelievable PK skills. Throughout several years of studies and experiments performed by Soviet scientist, Nina alone supplied scientist with factual/tested data on Psychokinesis (PK). The Soviets used Nina for many psychic related experiments. 
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">
<br />
Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab:</span></span> PEAR for short, was established at Princeton University in 1979 by Robert G. Jahn. PEAR spent several years providing solid scientific support for PK functioning as well as other psychic functioning.
<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Rhine Research Center Institute for Parapsychology:</span></span> The Rhine institute has been operational since it's founder Joseph Banks Rhine founded it in 1962. When Joseph started this organization, he titled it Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man (FRNM) which in 1995 was changed to the Rhine Research Center Institute for Parapsychology in honor of the 100th anniversary of J. B. Rhine's birth.
<br />

<br />
If you would like to learn more about these people or these organizations, please check the bottom of this page for the links that I've supplied. Now, I've only named a handful of names and organizations which helped support Psychokinesis (PK) existence through scientific research. There are hundred people, websites, organizations and communities worthy of mentioning however I'll leave that for you to research.
<br />

<br />
Your main problem is that you can't comprehend or accept that Psychokinesis (PK) is real and proven. How dare you neglect scientific research and call yourself a skeptic. You my friend are not a skeptic, you're a fool. 
<br />

<br />
I've seen your fake video clips and you certainly did bring up a good point. Video clips can be easily faked. I'm sure people have faked videos and people will continue to. However, please do not neglect hard work. I have spent several years of my life studying and practicing Psychokinesis (PK). Over the years, I have taught and lectured people in classrooms, telephone conversations, email, seminars and of course chat rooms based on the practice and existence of Psychokinesis (PK). Excuse me for being upset when someone walks into a community where I am active in and says &quot;Yeah, it's fake. Just an illusion&quot;. That is not only disrespectful, it's foolish. 
<br />

<br />
You're discussing your point of view in a community that is based on learning psychic functioning. We welcome healthy skepticism with open arms. We have a section of our forum dedicated to skepticism. However, what we don't welcome is bad skepticism. What you are currently displaying is bad skepticism. 
<br />

<br />
If you wish to call yourself a good skeptic, you need to understand what is a good skeptic really is. Allow me to share with you some traits of a good skeptic:
<br />

<br />
1) A good skeptic shares his or her opinion in an respectable manner. 
<br />

<br />
2) A good skeptic puts in the time of research to fully understand their opponents argument. 
<br />

<br />
3) Although persistent, a good skeptic allows other people to share their opinion without personally attacking that person.
<br />

<br />
4) A good skeptic knows when he or she is wrong.
<br />

<br />
Please try to comprehend what I'm saying. You need to stop stereotyping another?s work without showing any probable cause or evidence to back up your statements. Don't look at something and say &quot;Well, it's fake because I think it is&quot; because that will get you nowhere in debates or conversations. 
<br />

<br />
As of now, I have no respect for you. I'm sure you've lost the respect of many others as well. If you wish to gain my respect or others please learn how to be a good skeptic. If you wish to deny another?s work, please come with something other than your opinion on the matter if you wish to state something as serious as &quot;That isn't real&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
This rant slowly became a helpful small article. I guess I must have calmed down while I was writing this. However, the fact remains that you were disrespectful and your attitude towards Psychokinesis (PK) is absolutely ridiculous. This is your warning, do not state accusations on my work unless you have probable cause and evidence. If I hear that you disrespect my work again, my attitude will change and you'll find yourself  being lectured again.
<br />

<br />
Also, flip357 asked a question that I'll be more than willing to answer. The wobbling that my video has is due to my web cam being supported by a small box on top of my computer. I was trying to get an above view and my web cam had to be place on top of something. The wobbling was probably due to the box being unsteady and I apologize for that.
