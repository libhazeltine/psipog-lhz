			why don't some of those items have shadows when they should? why doesn't that pencil have a shadow? does it emit light due to your OMGTEHSPEZHULPWRZ!!!1111ONEONEELEVENTYELEVEN? actually the camera... I am not sure how we're supposed to know it's levitating, you might have hung it on something, or set it on something slanted, or just threw it. you know, alot of people come on here and expect us to be a bunch of idiots, and some of us are, but many of us actually have the ability to think.

			Yes, these are all completely fake. I am amazed that some of you thought these were photoshopped. I just threw this shit and used a high-speed camera. The story about my aunt was just icing on the cake. It is true that I had a crazy-ass aunt who would occasionally make psychic predictions that turned out to be true, such as the date of JFK's assassination, the hour of her son's death, or stock market values for the weeks ahead- how she managed to become well-off. Then again, she spouted bullshit almost nonstop, so some of it was bound to be true.
<br />

<br />
The sole purpose of me even coming here was to try to concoct the absolute bullshittiest story I could think of, then produce the most badly faked images I could take. Honestly, people! With lines like, &quot;I want to know how to control these &quot;powers&quot;, if they exist; I want to know if I am really crazy&quot; how could you not see how stupid this is? None of you should have even given me the benefit of the doubt! The fact that any of you even considered those pictures to be close to real says to me that <span style="font-style: italic">you need to start examining what you believe</span>.
<br />

<br />
Psi is like religion. Some of us take it for granted; we see some demonstrations and hear some stories from a sacred tome and assume it all to be true. Others come into it later in their lives, often with some skepticism. It is that skepticism that is most important in preserving the integrity of your beliefs. I, personally, do believe that there are some forms of energy beyond the sphere of human comprehension. Anytime I see a video on this site or hear some ridiculous claim, I don't immediately assume &quot;holy crap check out that guy's pk.&quot; I approach it with skepticism. &quot;Maybe has a magnet under the table. Maybe that glass is pressurized. Maybe there's been a string edited out of the picture. Maybe he's just throwing that into the air.&quot;
<br />

It seems on the surface that I concocted this story to hurt all of you and to make you look stupid. To some extent, that is true. The main reason I wrote all of this, however, is to make you think about your perspectives on any claims you hear over the internet. People will lie to you, people will bullshit you to make themselves feel better. If you want to be taken seriously, don't project onto the world an image of gullible losers. Don't fall for me or my bullshit. Think about it.

<br />
I came to this site as a result of it being featured on Somethingawful.com. You'll have to think about how depressing it is that there are enough gullible idiots on this site that it would be torn apart by the likes of those guys. If you approached this with an air of skepticism and scientific observation, I doubt they'd have a problem with you.

			I wasn't trying to fool anyone. The point was to come up with bullshit and see how you responded. The problem was that any of you considered this even close to realistic, and most didn't stop to examine the veracity of my claims. For instance:
<br />

<br />
&quot;whether or not it's real...looking good anyways!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;As for your story in general, i'm here to say that yes it is real.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;That is really quite an accomplishment. Hard to beleive, as a matter of fact. But if it is true you may have what others train for years to attain. Consider yourself very fortunate.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;unbelievable...that's all i can say because well...i can't really believe it, i can but it's just so mindblowingly incredible it's hard too XD (so much reiteration there)&quot;
<br />

<br />
In fact, hellomoto, the most fervent believer in my stories, edited all of his posts claiming me to be the best psychic out there to read &quot;a bear ate my cat.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The much bigger problem is the response of some of those who saw through my words, namely you, JOHNNYBEGOOD, and WhiteRaven. Your response was harsh anger and criticism, something that a bright-eyed idiot teenager (such as the character I portrayed) would be completely disillusioned by. It is important for people to realize what is real about psychic energy and what is not. By yelling at people and calling them names, you don't get anything done. I was far more satisfied by the responses of maxus and SheepKing, who took my story with a grain of salt and didn't immediately criticize me or believe me. If more of you could do that, this place would be a much healthier environment to post in.

			My camera has a &quot;Multi-Burst&quot; mode that allows it to take 16 shots at an aperture speed of 30 fps. I just pressed the button, flung an item in the air, and caught it. Believe me, the pictures shown on this site are not the only pictures I have. Most of them came out blurry or badly centered. This hoax was almost not worth it, but, hey, it was fun.
