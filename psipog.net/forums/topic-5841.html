			I just posted regarding how psi organisms might gather energy to divide and make more of themselves, and realized that we have no reliable scale for how MUCH psi we are talking about.  I think we ought to get that hammered out.
<br />

<br />
Just as a basic idea, let's have psi measurement be derived the same way work is derived- the amount of psi necessary to do a certain task if the doer was perfectly efficient.  The only one that comes to mind is the necessary force to move a small object a small distance, such as to move a 1 gram object 1 cm vertically into the air.  Let's call it a psium!  Unfortunately, a fairly large amount of psi is required to do this, compared to the amounts which we will probably be referring to most of the time, such as for construct programming using signals and triggers and such.  So perhaps the psium (p) can use the metric prefixes to mean smaller or larger amounts.  So a millipsium is one thousandth of a psium, a micropsium is one hundred thousandth of a psium, etc. etc. all the way down to the nanopsium, which would be one billionth of a psium.

			Interesting idea, and it could be useful, but there is the problem of <span style="font-style: italic">how</span> to measure psi in the first place. Otherwise, this could prove to be very useful system.

			Well, I have a somewhat related topic. I know two people that can scan the &quot;x&quot; factor of a psion. &quot;x&quot; represents the psionic power of a normal person that doesn't practice psionics. A normal psionics is, on average, 6x. I'm at about 30x, and the other person is at 50-60x.

Yes, that is correct. I use this system a lot and it has been proven to work quite well. It originated on mpw13 and grew a bit, but is still not known that far. The works of it are as follows:
<br />

<br />
1. A scanner is required
<br />

<br />
2. The scanner scans for a &quot;null&quot; (null being a person with almost none , if not, any psi within them).
<br />

<br />
3. Once the scanner has felt the energies and memorized them, he/she then scans the person who wants their &quot;x&quot; level known.
<br />

<br />
4. The scanner then feels out the subject's energies also and then compares them to the null's.
<br />

<br />
5. Lastly, the scanner clears there mind and then wills a number to appear (the number being the amount of psi in the subject to the number in the null)
<br />

<br />
For example....if a non psion has an x rating of 1. The null is scanned and the subject also. If the subject's power rating is 5 times as strong as that in the non-psion, it will be 5x. And so on. 
<br />

<br />
In clover's case, his/her base (base being the current amount of energy inside him/her, not including any constructs, interference or outside aid of any kind) is 30 times more dense than the nulls/non-psion's. I'm not sure where the 50-60x came from.......
<br />
As for my power rating, well it goes RATHER high. Numbers that you wouldn't believe me if I were to tell you.
<br />

<br />
As with skills in psionics, the more you practice with psi, the higher your base will climb, and of course fall if you lose practice. Charging your body with psi is related to this too. It increases your base rating. There is also a term called &quot;peaking&quot; where you have reached your maximum energy charge and cannot charge any further without burning out.
<br />

<br />
With this method you can actually measure how much psi is in your constructs by having someone scan one.
<br />
But this tech was considered much too fluffy to be used widely.....so I guess that's why not many people use it anymore. Yet.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

			I think you guys are talking about the strength of a person to use psi.  The measurement I proposed is more meant to be used with constructs and suchlike.  So you can accurately tell someone how much force to put into a construct, rather than just &quot;a lot.  A LOT.  As much as you can&quot; in order to get it to work.
<br />

<br />
For those of you that haven't picked this up about me, I'm trying to get a system going for the effective creation and sharing of constructs.  The idea is that we can design, improve, share, refine, and develop constructs and methods that can really be proven, to eventually and kick off this 'revolution' that we are all thinking about at the back of our minds.  Currently, we are all reinventing what the other discovers.  And then twenty years from now, those psions are reinventing what we thought of.  This may have been going on for an extremely long time.  If you're smarter than the average bear, you'll figure out where this precise happenstance has already occurred in human history, and what happened when we broke it.

			Nah, doesn't seem right. I mean, I think we'd just use the same stuff we measure radiation with bit added modification. Could measure power of psi...but not psi energy itself.
<br />

<br />
Either way, nobody can say this system doesn't work without testing...unless someone knows a actual, scientific measurements, but I doubt that.
