			I've read of many techniques on how to move a psi-wheel.  One technique is the infamous using PK to spin the psi-wheel (Earth).  Another technique is to use PK on the air to blow the psi-wheel around (Wind).  A third technique was using Pyro-PK to create a convection current to spin the psi-wheel (Fire).  
<br />

<br />
So I was wondering which technique would be easier/more efficient/stronger to use with a psi-wheel, Earth, Wind, or Fire?  And what would be the most effective on larger or denser objects?

The psiwheel is not an &quot;earth element&quot;: it's a piece of paper/tin foil on a pin, and if you want to be more specific, it's energy. I've heard of people using air currents to affect objects, but still it's not a &quot;wind element&quot;. And Pyro-PK is the ability to influence fire. Your information is a little out of whack. Read some of the beginner's articles on the main site. If there are indeed &quot;elements&quot;, then in my opinion, there is only one element in psionics; energy. You master that, you master all of the &quot;elements&quot;.

i see what you are saying, but there are many different techniques to move a psi-wheel.  to go along with your topic, we here use PK to affect the psi-wheel.  most of us project the energy out of us in some way to move the wheel, others use the Just Do It method you can read about at the main site.  it all depends on what works for you.
<br />

<br />
again, this all depends on you, what works for you, what techniques you like, ect.  we don't associate elements with psi here, and as a friendly warning, you will be flamed if you do.  also, pyrokinesis (or your fire) is the manipulation of fire, not the creation of.  so if you were going to create convection currents to move the wheel, you would use psychokinesis to vibrate the air atoms near the wheel to generate a heat current.

But it doesn't matter what phase the matter is in; it's all energy. All of it. Everything. Solids, gases, heat, liquids, everything is energy. And it doesn't matter how you move it, because in the end you are using PK to move it. Forget about efficiency. Learn to use methods or make your own that make it easier to move objects. Efficiency will come in time as you practice and experiment.

that's what he was saying.  he wanted to know what &quot;method&quot; would be best to move it (moving the air around it, using straight PK on it, or creating a heat current to move it).  i know it's a bit fluffy to associate elements with these methods, but i guess that's how he understands it.  he just needs to understand that it's all pk.

			For example, air is lighter than the psi-wheel, therefore, alot easier to move.  So if you moved the air, of which you can move more of and at a faster pace, perhaps creating a stronger force than that could be accomplished through just moving the psi-wheel alone.
<br />

<br />
I'm trying to maybe promote some strategic thinking towards how you use the psi.  Whether you are strong or weak with using PK it doesn't matter.  After a while of using psi energy you become drained even if you do draw from other sources.  So when all that matters is the goal of moving the psi-wheel it might be easier on resources to use an alternative method of moving the psi-wheel.
