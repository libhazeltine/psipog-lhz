			I just want to know if some people have made visable psi balls. And have you shown them to other people. If you have what was there response? And I also want to know if this is a real spi ball, I saw it on another website and they said they didn't know if it was real because it was so bright.

Anyways, no I've never made a visible psiball. But I don't try to flare a psiball though, I dont' see the point in doing so.

Well anyways do you think that ball might be Ki, because I think they are bigger and more visable than psi balls and I dont see how it is fake. Does anyone have any theorys of justifying that the energy ball is fake? Maybe he is just really powerful with Chi/Ki and made it really big.

King AJ, have you ever thought that maybe, just maybe,  Chi and ki are the same a psi? have you ever thought to think that maybe, it's might not be possible to do such things such as DBZ classified skills?
<br />

<br />
By the way, Chi\Ki is religious, one of the reasons Roy locked the thread.

Where in Psipog do you see &quot;ki&quot;?  We don't talk about ki here.  Why you may ask?  Because we're a website dedicated to psionics.  There is a general consensus that psi and ki, in the least, have a distinct set of practices for each (with some overlap, of course), and at the most, two totally different types of energy.  There are a plethora of websites dedicated to ki and it's applications; Psipog is not one of them.
<br />

Edit: I forgot to mention that Dragonball Z is fake.  IT'S FAKE!! GET IT IN YOUR HEAD!

			It's photoshopped. And we don't really talk about ki here - we just use psi. I consider them the same thing, really, but ki has a lot of fluffiness attached to it. Ki isn't 'stronger'. Ki isn't 'bigger and more visible'. It's just a different name. The name used here is 'psi'. Got it?
<br />
It's rather simple to photoshop something like that.

			wow! I guess you guys only believe in psi. But almost every website I go to they have all this Ki stuff. At first I thought that they were making this up but then I saw other websites that said they have done some of them. And im thinking maybe its real.... could someone answer this: Do you make psi balls to help you with telekinesis?

<br />
Making psiballs just help us gain better control and more use of psi, and it can help with telekinesis. But it still takes time and skill in psychokinesis to move a object then just moving psi around.

I never said ki was fake.  It's obvious you quickly read over my post and decided not to benefit from the invaluable and choice nuggets of knowledge which I so warmheartedly decided to expound upon for your benefit.  I said Dragonball Z was fake.  In your other post, which I quickly locked due to its sheer stupidity, you advertised websites that taught ki techniques as used in Dragonball Z.
<br />

<br />
Now I'm not sure if you were informed by your parents, legal guardians, or elementary school teachers, but cartoons are not real.  Dragonball Z may have fake techniques that are _inspired_ by esoteric martial arts practices, but that does not make them real and therefore privy to cheesy geocities and MSN websites maintained by pre-pubescents.  I hope now you catch my drift.

Ki has varied definitions.  A master of Okinawan Kenpo Karate I was lucky to train under for a short while had a definition of ki that was nowhere near what you and other radki people think.
<br />

<br />
Yes, Dragonball Z is fake.  If you cannot understand the simple fact that a cartoon is not reality, then I suggest you find a good psychotherapist.
<br />

<br />
Ki cannot be treated like Dragonball Z, in my opinion.  If it could, then we'd see the countless denizens of radki websites shooting spirit bombs or kamehameha blasts around the world.  Last time I checked, there haven't been any real life Goku's.
