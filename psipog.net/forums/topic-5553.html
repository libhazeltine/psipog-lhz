I haven't OBEd before and I have tried a lot pf stuff over the year to OBE. Can someone help me out here? If not give some incouragement because I've (dont wanna say it's true so far) wasted a lot of time trying psionics.
<br />

<br />
I might have OBEd my arm out but I think I was dreaming. Anyways someone please give me a few tips for OBEing

			Perhaps narrowing your focus to <span style="font-style: italic">just</span> PK or <span style="font-style: italic">just</span> LD or <span style="font-style: italic">just</span>[ one thing that suits you will help.  I know when I first started I wanted to do it all, and I wanted to do it NOW! <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  That of course didn't happen.  I tried a few things and eventually settled on getting better at PK <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span>.  Perhaps one day I'll move onto other projects but for now, this is what I want to improve.
<br />

<br />
So maybe you need to do something similar?  Pick something you've had the most success with to boost your confidence.
<br />

<br />
Meditate.  If not to get better at your chosen task, then simply to relax yourself more and put you in a more receptive and relaxed state of being.
<br />

<br />
Soak up simply everything that you can on the subject.  If you are constantly reading and thinking about new ways to try whatever it is that you do, it'll keep you motivated to stick with it.
<br />

<br />
Relax.  Take a break once in a while, and forgive yourself for having 'off days'.  Besides, I think it was Peebrain that said the first OBE he had was the first day he took a break from trying in months (or something like that <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />)
<br />

<br />
This isn't any different from putting your mind to doing something mainstream.  You'd have to have the same dedication to write a novel, to compose music, to get your university degree.  So go for it, and prove to yourself that you can do it!

thanks man. I'm just not sure. OBE or telekinesis.

WhiteRaven thanks too but you could have been a little bit nicer (I'm actually not saying that sarcasticly). But I guess I'll &quot;stop whining.&quot;

			if you havent obe-d yet (or havent done sth you really want to do yet) just say to your self its a momentary thing. you will do it, you're just having this little problem now, but it will pass. The mind makes the problems, the mind keeps providing the obstacles to sustain the problem (given that you think you have one). This is the lates &quot;truth&quot; that i have learned. So if something is not working for you, its just not working right now, it will pass, you will overcome that too. I havent OBEd yet, and im not realy bugging myself about it, because in this year or so practising &quot;PSI/CHI/OBE&quot; all this stuff, i have had many wonderful revelations , many wonderful experiances and i have learned a great deal about myself; and im sure you have made quite a progress yourself. So its not a problem, just a momentary thing, keep trying, thau shall succeed <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			The whole giving up thing is also just a phase ... if you're interested in the subject, you will try again some day. I have been through this numerous times, I wanted to have OBE really badly for like a month, then I didn't think about it at all for a couple weeks, then again I was practicing for about a month every day and because of the constant lack of success I gave up, then after a while I tried it again ... and guess what? It worked! I had an OBE which lasted for about 1 minute but it was convincing enough for me to try it again. When you try the thing after a while, you already know what to expect and feelings don't surprise you that much. If you feel exhausted of your practice, just quit doing it for a couple of days or months. When you feel like you're ready to try again, do it.
<br />

good luck and peace out
