			Of course animals have a sub c!  I can do some very basic comunication with my pets, though I very rarely do so as I see no reason for it.  I know some people who comunicate with animals frequntaliy, I am 100% certain that animals have feelings, emotions, and a sub consience.

Correct me if I?m wrong but that?s enlightenment.

Anyways rolling with the idea that animals have an Id would it be safe to assume telepathic suggestions work on non-humans?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
Well an Id can exist alone and a being can be purely instinctual, but something like a pack of wolves would require an ego (not superego since as you said, the Ego governs the Id whereas the Superego wants perfection (among other things)).  So, by their behaviours and assuming the mental classifications of Id, Ego and Superego apply to animals, wolves must have an Id and Ego.  Whether they have a Superego is questionable though and is a Superego required for telempathy?
<br />

<br />
I doubt it.  My personal experience is that only the Id and Ego aspects of an animal are needed since I've felt the &quot;thoughts&quot; of things as simple as bees (btw has anyone else noticed a bee's acuity regarding the state of the person they are near?).  I've never felt the feelings or thoughts of something that is purely Id though like bacteria or virii though.  Maybe the ego is the difference?

			Not entirely true but it can indicate an open third eye as well. Hearing voices would still be along the lines of receiving right? 
<br />

<br />
Anyways sending animals thoughts or commands is no different than doing it to another human. Dogs pick up on them really well. I've called dogs over to me a few times by using telepathy. Cats receive well too but they're usually too stubborn to listen to you. 
<br />

<br />
The best you might be able to do is use empathy on your mouse to see what it's feeling and pick up signals from it. I wouldn't try more than that.

I agree... animals mostly display theirselves emotionally thats why its easier for empath too... to calm them and tame them.. i guess thats my opinion... but telepathy also gives a deeper understanding on the animals... when combined both then you could very much understand the animal...
