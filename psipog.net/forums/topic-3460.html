			I've finally successfully done macro pk. Last night, I moved little crumbs of tobacco like crazy, made them jump like 6 inches into the air and slide like 6 or 7 inches in various directions. I knew it wasn't wind, but thought I might have collected a static charge from the carpet. I was doing it for like 5 minutes straight, and after that i realized it wasn't simply a strong static charge. I found a little peice of tinfoil and crumpled it into a ball (very small peice, but still much bigger than tobbacco) I tried that, and got it to slide a little twice. After that i got tired and went to sleep.
<br />

<br />
I woke up today, and tried the tinfoil but it wasn't working, so i made a pinwheel. I got it spinning almost right away, doing a lot of full roations, and almost two full rotations at one point. Also had a lot of shakiness to it when it wasn't moving. many times it did a half a rotation or a little more or less. did this for maybe ten minutes, started getting sore from keeping my body still, do i moved to the floor. I had it moving on the floor, and, get this, something really cool happened.
<br />

<br />
An empty plastic cup (fair size, not small) that had contained my juice earlier, was positioned on the floor a little over two feet away. It was right within my field of vision, but my focus was on the pinwheel. Suddenly i heard the sound of the cup sliding and looked up in shock in time to see it move about two inches to the left and away from me.
<br />

<br />
After this happened, i got a little nauseous (very little, and really tired and my eyelids felt heavy. So, i got some milk, and felt better like 10 minutes later. I decided not to practice any more tonight, that was good for today.
<br />

<br />
So folks, I can officially pk now, which im ecstatic about. 
<br />

			terrance coleman what are you talking about?
<br />

<br />
my method? The just do it method. In a little more detail, i'm aware of my energy field connecting with the object, but not exactly of how that makes the object move. And only sometimes was I aware of the energy field.

			Sorry bout ya.  If you had one with a guy and a girl, i would find that offensive.  Anyways, I am not getting into it.  Its not offensive, just is what it is.  There are other people out there than what fit into ur mind.  If you wanna debate it with me, you can IM me at awsales18, but, this is not the place for it.
<br />

<br />
*Edit*  Hmmm...never thought of trying it like that Xious....seems as though you are having good results with it though

God whats your problem! I really think you should just calm down and get in the 21st century. Ppl are gay get used to it. Its not like its a crime or anything, though your behavior towards it is immature and reminds me of a prepubecent teenager. Maybe you should think before you talk, and keep an emergancy rope around so you can hang yourself before you say another derrogative and offensive comment like that.

			Its cool...now give Xious some Props G!!! Cuz he has got some major accomplishments, i believe, in what he has done...
<br />

<br />
And the tiredness you felt could have been low blood sugar...I am diabetic, and it sounds as if you drank milk, which has carbohydrates in it, and that helped in 10 minutes, that was what it was...just drink a carohydrate-full drink before practicing and it probably wont happen.
