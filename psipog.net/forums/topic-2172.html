			In many years past, some strange things have occurred. Would someone here please call out some definition to the following.
<br />

<br />
1) Working in a retail store selling home lighting at age 17.
<br />
    An old couple approached me as I was dusting and aligning lamps on display. I got a quick look at them 20 ft away and it occurred to me that they were perfect soul mates at absolute peace with each other. I felt envy. Imagine a spry 17 year old jealous of and unsettled by 65 year olds. As they ogled at the bright lamps or was it me, never known, I continued straitening things out. With the couple no closer than 15 ft away, a loud but soft woman's voice and with such clarity in my head asked &quot; Do you moon &quot;? The ambiance and volume was not consistent with 15 ft. It felt more like stereo headphones but better still. My reaction was instant fear and a heart that raced like mad. I asked if I could be of some assistance at the same time maintaining composure and putting up my guard. &quot; I like this one &quot; this time she spoke reaching out to the price tag. I knew it was b.s. because she chose to quickly. The sale did not go on and they left discouraged and me shaken.
<br />

<br />
2) Demonic Ouija board. With my sisters friend. I was 12 and she 17. She  asked me to try out the game. Girls of that age would ask the board about boyfriends, like I cared. The indicator or what you call it moved with strong purpose and fine precision. Right were I chose it to be it went almost better than If I were physically moving it with my very light finger tips. I was convinced that she was moving the thing around only by my thoughts through her. I relaxed my hold so much that I could not have been moving it at the extreme force it was gliding about. So on she went about marriage and I made it give retarded answers. All the while she was in awe of the performance. Also disenfranchised by a 12 year old boy.
<br />

<br />
3) Study aid. I was in the active US Air Force and a good friend asked me to help him study for Airman of the Year Contest. Part of the contest is questioning about military history and structure. He handed me the book he was studying from and at that point I commended him for what he was doing as I could not perform in these things. I opened the book and read paragraphs here and there and formed a dozen questions. I corrected wrong statements he made and otherwise reinforced his knowledge. The next day he woke me at my room all exited that he had won the contest and that all the questions asked were the same that I asked and he knew all the answers. He has told me that I'm a great realist and asked if I were an angel sent to watch over him.
<br />

<br />
4) Frightening invasion. Still in the US Air Force here. On a temporary assignment to the St Louis area to attend class. A motel room mate told me about a local strip joint. I call for a taxi and waited a very long time in the parking lot. While thinking of what kind of woman I may encounter and the lewd things that they may do, a family pulls in the lot. Out of a car comes a 7-8 year old girl and she points to me and says &quot; Mommy that man is thinking bad things &quot;. Go away kid your bothering me, I thought. The girl was quickly ushered away by mom. It made me wonder just why this family was traveling. The thoughts of hot women was replaced by technical details for the girls sake.
<br />

<br />
5)Sleep over. At 13 years old I was thoroughly into the opposite sex. I wished that my girlfriend would sleep with me on the sneak without her parents know about it. This was a family with strict rules as most were back then. She slept upstairs and me downstairs. I wished so hard that she would become frightened and come sleep next to me. I imagined that I could pull this off if an item in her room moved by itself without any cause. The next morning she told me that she was so scared when a stuffed animal moved that she came downstairs and slept in a recliner chair beside me. By then I was sound asleep and didn't know until morning.

What do you all make of it?
