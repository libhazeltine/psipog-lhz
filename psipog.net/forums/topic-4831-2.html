			yeah, I'm 22 years old. I've had issues sleeping since I was ten. A cocktail of pills is the only way I can even fall asleep within an hour of going to bed, no matter WHAT I do throughout the day. Even then, I'm still a light sleeper. A bug walking on a piece of paper can wake me up. So its either take a bunch of pills and get some semblance of a good nights sleep, or only actually sleep every 3 nights, only then because of pure exhaustion, and be tired and incoherent all the time.

			man they have cured the most chronic insomniacs; i believe ther is a solution for you too. It all comes down to the levels of melatonin but, maybe you have some sort of malfunction and dont produce enough.. but anyway, try gradually taking less pils as johhnyBgood suggested, try to meditate some and calm down before sleep and try to set your bio rythm by waking up and going to sleep at the designated time and trying to et some 7-8 hrs of sleep pre day.

			Its not an addiction it's a sense of dependancy but I'm able to over come it whenver I want. I only take it when I HAVE to go to bed early and I am not able to sleep but even then when I lay completely still as if trying to OBE I fall right asleep (which makes it hard for me to OBE and why I still haven't).

			Ok here's what I would have to ask my doctor...
<br />
Does Melatonin make my ability to become Lucid in my dreams worse?
<br />
Better? Does it make me not be able to control when I dream less often?
<br />

<br />
It's just my opinion but those are kinda weird questions to be asking a doctor.

			In my experience Melatonin has no effect one way or the other on dreams. It's something your body produces in response to specific times (Internal clock) and in response to darkness. Melatonin is a good suppliment to help keep you on a regular sleep schedule, and to help especially when you travel or suffer from insomnia. And it has no harmful effects, unless you take it in large quantites (But then again, what DOESN'T? Heck, if you drink a ton of water all at once, it's gonna be unpleasant.)

Ok, to give you some perspective on the amount of Melatonin in supplements and how much much your pineal gland produces: During the night your pineal gland produces anywhere from 5 to 25 micrograms of Melatonin. the supplements usually have 1 to 3 milligrams. That is a huge percentage increase from normal, and thats the &quot;recommended&quot; dose.
