			As we all know, evolution is driven by the fact that certain individuals are less fit to reproduce than others. I.e. Africans born with heterozygous sickle-cell trait are resistant to malaria, so even though it seems counter-intuitive to develop a trait that is deadly in the homozygous state, it still saves many more lives, and therefore evolves.
<br />

<br />
However, now we have pharmaceuticals and hospitals to prevent death. Houses and clothing to protect against climate. Travel so we may obtain maximum genetic diversity throughout the world. Guns to kill predators. Etc. Etc. Etc.
<br />

<br />
The list is huge. There is no selective pressure anymore. Every generation we are racking up more and more genetic flaws that would have been swiftly taken care of in the wild world. Likewise, there is no pressure for the most intelligent, athletic, and best endowed individuals to spread their genes. What is this going to do to our gene pool? Only time will tell.
<br />

<br />
I don't think we will ever split into different species, you need some sort of isolation, be it geographic or genetic. And as long as we have airplanes and eHarmony, that won't happen.
<br />

<br />
And there's a near infinite number of us. Gene therapy will one day curb most mutations. We're mostly non-migratory. Hang on a second...
<br />

<br />
We are the only species to fit the Hardy-Weinberg principle...Or at least damn close. 
<br />

<br />
If that's the case, then our species will totally stagnate. Humans are not going to get very much different in the coming millenia.

			i think that we are evolving and will continue to evolve until we either go exstint or evolve to another state, and i also beleive that we are the cause of most if not all of our problems, instead of letting our bodies become immune naturally we create drugs that my help one but hurt a thousand because we think we are smart enough to mess with somthing that is way to complex for us and end up making it worse in the long run, sorry for the rant ,and this is just my opinion.

so wtf did we evolve &gt;&lt;, and started to talk?
<br />
telepathy is much better and usefull, as you can talk to anybody without any range-limiting factor (trees, rocks, distance, the enviroment), and can be heard just by the one who s meant to hear (pratical use: hunting and coordinating your &quot;strategies&quot; without telling the animal you are hunting you are there, war, and gossip  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> )
<br />
but in the other side... if the ancient men alredy used tp before staring to talk, we can get to 2 conclusions: OR they weren't a lot less smarter then we are now (i think we are much smarter then the guys on those ages, but anyway), actually, more evolved and intelligent then us, OR telepathy is a really rudimentar way of communication...

yeah, AND there is no more natural selection too, as someone very obese, who almost can't move, who doesn't have a leg and is on a wheel chair (don't know it's name in english) can kill any animal that tries to atack him, just needs the proper weapon.
<br />
in ancient times he would need to run not to get in melee combat, or to use actuall force to kill the animal with a spear or something. today you need just a good arm (or 2) and a finger.
<br />
and it all depends on your $$$ too.

rich people can have more secutiry then poor ones, despite of the rich guy having heart and lung problems or bad genes for cancer, and the poor dude having a good health

<br />
No, and yes.
<br />

<br />
The average IQ is not going down. In fact, one of the problems with psychological testing that assesses intelligence is that every few years, the &quot;average&quot; IQ has raised to the point that the test has to be redone in order to redefine the &quot;average&quot; point. During those years, the number of &quot;high scorers&quot; tends to temporarily decrease while the adjustments are being made.
<br />

<br />
As far as artificial evolution - it's much faster.
<br />

<br />
But then again, as a natural telepath, I already consider myself <span style="font-style: italic">Homo sapiens excelsior</span> as opposed to you silly non <span style="font-style: italic">Homo sapiens sapiens</span>.

How? I've been lurking around here for a while now (been visiting every now and then for about 2 years), and I haven't seen much of anything that makes  not knowing what &quot;chakras&quot; are sacrilegious. In any case, this isn't a religious site (unless my senses have been rather cleverly deceived), so therefore anything we say <span style="font-style: italic">can't</span> be sacrilegious, because there never really was religion in the first place. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
In any case, I don't believe in any of that Chakra thing anyhow. I have somewhat different theories... when I'm finished fleshing them out I'll post them here.
<br />

<br />
Okay, back on topic now:
<br />

<br />
In my opinion, we've sort of suspended evolution because natural selection isn't taking as much effect as it did before. There still is some, and I believe that's what will determine the next phase of evolution for humans. I suspect it may have something to do with computers and technology; those who can't adapt to the new technology won't get jobs as easily, and therefore will fail at life and their children won't be as likely to grow up.

			Sorry, I use the term sacrilegious not in its most direct sense, that being anti-religious. But in the sense that it is very taboo. Taboo because they have not been proven (well, according to who you talk to and the evidence that you present) to be real. And everyone on this site, atleast when it comes to anything spiritual in nature, gets very hissy when its mentioned.
<br />

<br />
OPINION:
<br />

<br />
My experience is that the Charka system is very real, and and is an integral part our body. They are tied to every part of our being and feed each feed different parts of our body. Any dis-ease or the like we experience shows up long before in our etheric fields than our physical body, and be cured before it is even an issue; this includes cancer.
<br />

<br />
And before anyone states &quot;well, then why don't we use it to fix everyones cancer&quot;, I'll remind you that to do this requires a cultural paradigm shift (which isn't too far away). There a countless spontainious remission cancer stories from people who recieve energy work. You don't need to believe in energy or psi for this to work, but it helps. But if you refuse to allow the work to be done on you at all because &quot;its silly&quot;, or whatever, then you cannot be helped by it.
<br />

<br />
The Chakra system is directly related to the ascenion to the light body and will be a very important aspect in the years to come. If you havn't yet, I recomend you read up on it, and practice techniques to open and clear your Chakra's, to maintain a solid ground at all times, and, when you can, maintain a strong Haric (Hara) connection. Meditation is the practice that will open new doors in your life.
<br />

			I seriously doubt it. Despite the fact that humans are slowing evolution, evolution is not a consious process. The body doesn't say &quot;Hey, those leg things are cool, lets evolve those!&quot; Despite how cool or potentially useful something is, if it doesn't:
<br />

<br />
1.) help you or your children survive until you are done reproducing.
<br />
2.) make you more likely to reproduce or reproduce more.
<br />

<br />
than evolution isn't likely to care much either way. Do psy users have an advantage in these areas over normal people? Not to my knowledge (disregarding mind control, you evil evil people! <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> ) so evolutio n will leave it alone to either rot away or stay the same, or by some absurd chance, increase.
<br />

<br />
This is of course false if psy abilities come from another trait which DOES help in these areas.

			ooookay guys.. some of you have far out answers.
<br />

<br />
why would we use language instead of grunts+telepahy?
<br />

<br />
uh cause its much easier to say a word than to telepathically transfer it via brainwave as emotion/suggestion/manipulation. there was no forum that cavemen could go to and learn how to do this. they didnt even have a certain number system. one grunt two grunt whatev.. 
<br />

<br />
i dont belive that we're NOT evolving. look at the different variations of peoples skin color. we have more mixed couples than ever before. 
<br />

<br />
ask yourself why do we have hair? on our arms? legs? on your BUTT for all i care? why do other people not have as much hair or some people have more hair on their back for instance. its cause we used to be hairy-mo-fuckas to protect us from all the cold weather. now we don't need as much hair, so here comes technology to remove it via lazer surgery. technology+evolution= techolution

			we will evolve in memory get taller and our brain will get bigger.
<br />
We will unevolve as a whole because all the disorders we have will be mainstream and everyone going to have to be drugged up or will have some mental disorder.
<br />
Autism taht used to be in 1 of 10000 births is now 1 in 163  as an example
<br />
Theres only 2 ways to stop us from being disorder ridden. 
<br />
One is morally wrong and is to sterilize all with extreme disorders to prevent the disorder from spreading.
<br />
the other is morally wrong in some religions and is to genetically engineer people from getting these disorders.

			The whole idea that we are &quot;Not evolving&quot; would be silly... But, the factors contributing to our evolution HAVE changed.
<br />

<br />
I think it is safe to say that in several parts of the world &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; no longer applies to the passing of genes. There are some exceptions, in the case of severally debilitating diseases which don't allow you to function minutely close to how a &quot;normal&quot; person would function. 
<br />

<br />
Another factor that we have to discuss is the current accessability we have to go to all different corners of the planet. There are some still relativley &quot;pure&quot; genetic populations as compared to areas in the United States and other industrialized countries.
<br />

<br />
If you're worried about inbreeding and what not, we have a while until we NEED to medically intervene on such things.
<br />

<br />
You'd be surprised what technology and school can do to otherwise &quot;poor genetics&quot; assuming the person in question has the drive and environment to help him/her go on... Think Steven Hawkins <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
As for Psi... I can only see it becoming a part of our social lives (Apart from groups like this) if there are some amazing technological breakthroughs, not genetic ones.
