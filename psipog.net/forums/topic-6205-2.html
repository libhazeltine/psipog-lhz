			Ahh, this is a good thread. I haven't been around to catch things like this, because of my Fall Break which I am at home and aren't allowed to use the internet much. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
TruePsion, I am very interested in the way you meditate and how long you do so. I meditate very often, almost every day. But I have never reached a higher level of concisouness, or at least I don't think so. But, I am curious as to what you have done to reach a higher level. I wonder if you do Motionless Meditation...
<br />

<br />
As for the spiritual question. Yes, I now follow a path that would be called &quot;spiritual.&quot; It is all because of psionics too. If I never became interested in things like this...I would of never came to this website...and this is where I became interested in spirituality. It's funny, the most influential person towards my path has already posted on this thread a few times. 
<br />

<br />
All of this has boosted my interests. I look forward to your response.

			I'm not sure who you mean by most influential person, but mine is Martial Artist and I'm glad he caught this thread. I too was first interested into things like Psionics and then found this site. Then I searched for more and my father was spiritual so that led me towards a higher meaning. Then my friend Martial Artist told me of his progress and I wished to seek a higher meaning as well. Just a few weeks ago I finally found meditations that helped me very much. If anyone cares to chat with me I am almost always online, whether doing something else or not. PM me first. As for the meditations I do, it started with opening each chakra and concentrating on each and it goes from there all the way to work with the natural elements to &quot;transform&quot; the chakras and the soul.

True, but one still first needs eyes to see the world, to first imagine what could be in there. Or so I think in a sense, what would I know.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

I, for one, am not interested in 'attaing spiritual fullfillment'. Just some tricks to help meh in poker and screw around with. Like making flames do funny things.
