			Kief,
<br />
Im sensing youre a very emotionally angry person, mainly with yourself, here....http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/html/managing_anger.html, treat yourself to some relaxing foot massages, read some housewives digest, have some cucumber slices over your eyes while being treated with a mud mask, go on Kief, you deserve it buddy, i hear the best way to relieve anger is to relax, take some deep breathes and let it all out. I hope this helps you in the long run.

Your best Pal,

Why would you end a pointless ranting full of ad homs with the phrase &quot;no disrespect intended&quot;? </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Because there really was no disrespect intended, I ment everything I wrote in the exact tone I wrote it in. The point of my post is not to make you offended or make you laugh or sick or anything, it's there because I thought it would open your eyes just a tiny bit.

Probably. But I'm not a silly no-one with oh-look-at-me attitude offending people everywhere I go writing some scientific-skeptic-bullcrap. You know there is probably ten times more forums on the net about skepticism on the psi subject that there is on the psi subject itself, so I recommend you go find one of them. Oh yes but where would the fun be then, right?

That's what you think. Look, I can't figure out why the hell would some guy who totally despises the things this page stands for, would even go around any yack around like that? What are you trying to prove? You keep on saying that we should prove this and we should prove that and that well guess what WE DON'T. It's up to you to believe whatever you'd like to believe, and it's definately not up to us to go and try to convince a silly skeptic. We convince people that want to be convinced, we show people that want to walk this path that it is indeed possible, we don't go around showing telekinesis to majority of people because they're simply dumb like you and even if I would to put a pinwheel in a jar and move it underneath it you would still come up with some sort of explanation. Oh yes, it was the flood in South Africa right? <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> Let me remind you that 90% of people on Earth think just about the same way you do, and in my opinion (and everybody else's too I guess) that is very sad.

True, though this conversation would be a lot more interesting if you wouldn't have that i'm-your-god-you-stupid-noobs-in-your-face-attitude. I like debating with skeptics when they're intelligent and nice. In fact you can be a drug addict, or a whore, or a billionare or you could stand against everything I stand for and I wouldn't mind it had you a good character and a kind personality. I'm not going to start arguing because you feel you are smarter than everyone and you can prove anyone wrong. That's not my point of being. I'm here to help people and to help myself, no other reason.

First of all, you seemed unintelligent to me as well, and I didn't attack you I just said that you're probably a dumbass which I still mean.

Second, if you'd be a little more (insert positive word) you would know that all the kung-fu masters also phrase themselves rhetoricaly and it's usually very hard to understand  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.

No to offense because I care nothing for this arguement seeing how I have no proof of PK and care nothing to discredit the supernatural being a student of the occult, but a tip to sound more intelligent and perhaps gain more respect, I realize it can be hard sometimes to not sound redundent but you are over using that &quot;ad hom&quot; phrase way to much, I hope you don't reply to me with any &quot;ad homs&quot; you might hurt my feelings <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Kief,

Mr 1 Post no longer. In anycase, I don't know why I bothered to talk to such a fool. That soul thing was an overstatement (another english vocab word you can learn besides ad hom), but I wouldn't be surprised if Joe could. In anycase, I'll let him take care of you, if he decides your worth his time.

			Hello Kief,
<br />

<br />
Alright, a little better but you're still not impressing me. I am glad to see that you've taken my advice and added more effort to this debate. I appreciate it. I would like to participate in a semi-decent debate. Not a waste of my time. I?m sure you can understand that.  Let's get this started. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
You may as well call psi magick or chi. </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
A lot of people do consider psionics magick. I have had many intelligent conversations with people from different communities who fully believe psionics is just another form of magick. Perhaps they're right. Perhaps they aren't. It's all based on how you personally view the subject.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Giving an ability a name isn't uncommon. You must understand the history of psychic abilities to fully comprehend the meaning of different beliefs, techniques and rituals. Please note; scientist has classified certain psychic abilities as psionics in a sense. I don't understand your problem with the title of psionics. Perhaps you need to do some research on the name, before attacking it.

It was originally split into two categories of psi-kappa and psi-gamma, denoting active and passive psi, the first subsuming those phenomena such as psychokinesis which appeared to involve an effect upon another system, the second covering phenomena such as extrasensory perception, which showed a more receptive aspect. The main problem with the terms is that they do not have a precise definition, indicating which phenomena may be counted as psi and which are excluded. Psi has been defined as the 'unknown factor' in psychic experiences, and often this is modified to being a factor which is not reliant on the conventional sensorimotor channels.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
I <span style="font-style: italic">have</span> proven that I can remote view, manipulate psi energy and perform psychokinesis. Those who know me on a personal level, have seem me do a lot of psionic related abilities. Now, have I proved psionic related abilities by scientific means? No. However, I have had experiences where I have sat down and talked/performed psionic related abilities in the company of college professors and local scientist.
<br />

<br />
If you haven't read the recent news, Peebrain, myself and Erik have been working on measuring psionics with an interesting gadget called the geiger counter. We sat down, logged into an online telephone program and opened Erik's web cam which showed his graphs/geiger counter. While talking, we decided to try it out. 
<br />

<br />
Now, I've heard you have many questions and skepticism towards the geiger counter and it's results. Allow me to clarify this matter. Perhaps your misunderstanding of the test is due to not hearing our procedure and the precautions we took to insure that it was the sender who was making the graph spike.
<br />

<br />
Before starting this experiment, Erik gave all of us the basic outlines on how we would be operating this experiment. His instructions were simply; &quot;When I say go, start to send/project energy towards the geiger counter. Then, when I say stop, stop what you're doing&quot;. This insured that the sender was sending his energy in the required time period. Allow me to show you how this experiment went.
<br />

<br />
Erik: Okay Joe, are you ready?
<br />
Joe: Yes, I am.
<br />
Erik: Alright, good luck.
<br />
Erik: Go.
<br />
*Sends*
<br />
*The graph went from 15 to 47 in a matter of seconds*
<br />
Erik: Stop
<br />
*Counter slowly goes down*
<br />
People: Holy shit!
<br />

<br />
That was a basic outline of the experiment. Please note: the graph raised when Erik told myself or another to start and it sloped when he told us to stop. Now, doesn't that interest you in any way?

Like I've stated, you need to first understand the meaning of the title, before you attack it. What you need to also understand is the history of that name and people's beliefs on it. I don't understand your problem with the name, I simply find it interesting that you're concerned with the name rather than what the name represents.

Perhaps you should take your own advice. That paragraph pointed out two things; that this conversation is based on personal views/opinion and that the information being presented in being used in every other post. I have noticed that as well. However, it's pulling teeth with you to comprehend my point of views based on scientific testing and psionics (psychic abilities).

I also understand your point on the amount of respect given to each other between this argument. I have used some unfriendly words that I am not proud of and I'm sure you have certain statements that you feel the same about.

Like I've stated, science hasn't proved the existence of psychokinesis. Science has done some past testing that has showed certain unknown activity, but as I've said, showing is not proving. We know it works, we don't know how it works. Until we find out how psychokinesis works, we won't see any information based on psychokinesis in school textbooks. However, we have certainly seen psychokinesis and other psionic related abilities talked/shown on television, magazines, radio shows etc.

That is absolutely incorrect. Once again, please do not insult scientific testing. You make it sound that scientist are allowing people to show up wearing large coats, sitting them down, watching them move an object, then the scientist asking the man to take off his jacket and in doing so, finding a very large magnet. Scientist take the proper precautions before attempting the experiment.

The Russian documents for scientific research based on psychic abilities is actually quite an interesting read. Russia and the United States spent millions of dollars researching psychic abilities. In doing so, they were able to effectively use remote viewing. Russia also spent time/money on other aspects of intelligence gathering techniques as well as psychical abilities such as PK. Now, I don't believe that two super powers would spend millions of dollars and decades of investigating/research/testing on something that isn't real. 
<br />

<br />
We may never know if the Russian documented evidence based on researching psychic abilities is actual information or altered information to scare the United States. We may also never find out if the United States or Russia ever really stoped investigating this subject. What we do know is that by doing years of research, both countries were able to effectively use remote viewing as a source for gathering information. Remote viewing was proven to work and was used until the end of the Cold War.

<br />

<br />
That is entirely untrue. 
<br />

<br />
We don?t know why gravity works, but we know it is an attractive force exerted on objects. 
<br />

<br />
We don?t know why particles are able to undergo something called ?tunneling?, but we know it happens. 
<br />

<br />
We may not know the reason behind something, but that does not stop us from making empirical observations, especially to try and figure the phenomena out. 
<br />

<br />
Like for instance, it was observed for years that species were evolving, but just how was unknown. More and more observations were made and we saw that sexual and natural selection were playing dominant roles. Then DNA was discovered and we had further evidence to explain just how organisms were evolving. </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Using gravity as an example is a good example. Like you've stated, gravity isn't yet known how it operates and why it happens. However, science still states gravity as real. However, that's expected. The difference from PK and gravity is gravity is a natural force for this planet. If science couldn't explain why we are held to this planet or why matter tends to fall towards the earth when dropped, does that make science look intelligent? No. 
<br />

<br />
Gravity is everywhere on this planet. People cannot escape the earths gravitational pull. Science is obligated to give an understanding to one of earths main aspects to the general public. I can understand the scientific communities decision on making gravity &quot;real&quot; by scientific means because not only does scientist know that gravity is there and working, everyone does! Psychokinesis on the other hand has only been reported by a handful of people. Not everyone understands or experiences psychokinesis. I'm sure you understand where I'm going with this.

I can't tell you how frustrating this is. I have supplied plenty of material that supports my statements. I have listed scientist, organizations, universities, testing experiments, dates etc. You're either not understanding my given information or you're ignoring it. From a scientific viewpoint there needs to be more clear cut evidence into the phenomena. Since there has not been any clear cut evidence to date is remains a phenomena until there is documentation available to us which will prove how and why psychokinesis is an existing conscious power. This will, unfortunately, require time and with that time we can search for our own clues into the phenomena of psychokinesis. Please don't neglect scientific testing, there is proof that something abnormal is occurring when these test are being operated.

I'm showing you my material and certainly giving my argument. My argument is simply: Psychokinesis has been tested through scientific means to work effectively with highly significant results. Throughout this debate, I have been supplying you with information based on science testing psychokinesis and other psychic abilities. 
<br />

You're telling me that science has absolutely no evidence of psychokinesis existing and it's fake without a doubt. Well, psychokinesis is not proven by scientific means, however, science has tested psychokinesis in many occasions as well as other governments/countries to work. Knowing something works isn't proving it's existence, I know that. However, don't neglect documentation, something is there and science will continue to investigate this phenomenon

You're neglecting the results of scientific testing! Psychokinesis has been tested and it has worked! You can't jump over this evidence and say that nothing is there. There is something there! If there isn't, science wouldn't still be investigating this phenomena. People like Helmut Schmidt, Dr. Julius Krmessky, Dr. J.B Rhine, Dr. Genady Sergeyev, Ingo Swann, Uri Geller all participated in testing the existence of psychokinesis with significant results, don't neglect that.

Good God man, give them some credit. You're making scientist out to be liars when they're not. Scientist do not write false information to support their claim on any aspect of study. Where would lying get them? These men and women are very intelligent people investigating a phenomena. Please do not insult them by calling them liars. You have no right to state that accusation. 
<br />

<br />
As for the other comments, probably not. A lot of people write false information to make their image seem better. However, please take in consideration that these people are not certified scientist making false claims. If scientist make these false claims, other scientist would surely want to view these amazing results for themselves only to be wasting their time while they find out that the scientist who wrote his/her tested documentation lied.

If that is your beliefs, then stick with them. However, like I've stated, people have different views/beliefs on this subject. We all have our personal views on everything, we all like make our own personal analogies and theories. Psionic is a name. It's a title given to the practice of psychic abilities. When we use the term &quot;psionics&quot; we're referring to the practice of psychic abilities. Whether it's telepathy, empathy, psychokinesis, energy manipulation, clairvoyance, etc. These abilities fall under the category of psionics.

Our government as well as other government agencies in different countries, used remote viewing which falls under the term clairvoyance as a tool for gathering information. Scientist knew that remote viewing worked yet they found it hard to convince the scientific community that remote viewing  was in fact real and actually occurring. The scientific community this absolutely ridiculous and stated that remote viewing couldn't be real due to their uncertainly with knowing how remote viewing was operated.

No, I have done my respectable amount of research. You on the other hand obviously haven't. Rhine spent the majority of his study researching parapsychology. His institute is based on researching parapsychology! His institute have spent many years researching parapsychology and they have certainly been able to support their claims with scientific testing. I find it humorous that you believe that his research based on parapsychology isn't creditable. I also find it outrages that you think his field of study wasn't related to the paranormal or psionics. Let's define parapsychology, shall we?

The majority of the testing were failures, I know that. However, please don't neglect the 71 test that passed successfully. Those 71 successful represent that something indeed is occurring. If there wasn't anything occurring relating with this phenomena, then no test results would come up as successful. 
<br />

<br />
Please also take note that Helmut Schmidt's testing began in the 1960s. That was over 40 years ago. Our technology has advanced and the gadgets Schmidt used would be unreliable in today?s world. Please also take in consideration that Helmut Schmidt's testing were only from one source, there are/were others testing parapsychology related abilities.

Everyone makes mistakes. Scientist know that better than anyone. You cannot tell me that your sources are 100% correct 100% of the time. No one can say that. I find it humorous that you believe scientist from PEAR, Rhine institute, the government and other organizations data is nothing but incorrect information and unreliable. It's quite easy to discredit another?s work when you have no work to do for yourself and that is exactly what most skeptical people are doing. Criticize and gossiping over another?s work to fill in the time. Now, I'm certainly not stating that all skeptics are people like that, however the shoe certainly fits for some of them.

That is absolutely incorrect. Have you read the reports of Dean Radin and Roger Nelson? Radin and Nelson tracked down 152 reports describing 597 experimental studies and 235 control studies by 68 different investigators involving the influence of consciousness on microelectronic systems. The Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab center focused more on micro-PK rather than macro-PK. I recommend you look into organizations who were more focused on macro-PK.

My offer still stands. If your school would like to set up a date/time to test  psychokinesis, I will gladly participate. However, like I said, I am not going to drive to your location and perform psychokinesis for your viewing pleasure. I am doing this for the purpose of research, nothing more.

<br />
That's scientific testing for you. In order for psychokinesis to be proven by scientific means, more test and experiments will have to be conducted. That of course means, more failures and success. Any subject being tested should have the results and scientific attitude towards it.

This is absolutely ridiculous. Show me any documentation that shows that Rhine had ANY indication of lying or documenting false information. That is entirely unacceptable and quite frankly rude.

The Rhine institute had amazing success with random-number-generators as well as other forms of testing for micro-PK. Perhaps you are unaware of the testing results that came from the Rhine institute when they tested with psychokinesis. Perhaps this article will help you with that.

I certainly have gave you enough information to back up my statements. You on the other hand show little proof to back up your accusation. What you need to understand is that sharing your opinion and speaking with factual information are two very different means of expressing information. I know that they're skeptical information out there concerning this subject, and I certainly understand their point of view.

If you're interested, please let me know. If you feel as if you cannot allow the public to know about this, you can contact me at <a href="#">JoeT@PsiPog.net</a>

Like I've stated several times, I have done my respectable amount of research towards psychokinesis as well as psionics in general. I have spent several years doing this research. Also, the link that I posted earlier, you misunderstood the meaning. I explained that further up in this post.

I'm absolutely shocked. I feel as if I should be expressing that statement. My research is backup by an considerable amount of sources. Your opinions and statements come from older skeptics who can't frankly comprehend the subject. What you don't understand you fear. So, what do people do when they fear something? They either avoid it or attack it. A lot of skeptics attack the subject and come up with theories on how and why psychokinesis cannot be real. Or any psychic ability for that matter. Not all skeptics act like that, must are reasonable and are understanding. 
<br />
It's alright to remain skeptical, just have an open mind to understand another?s point of view. Don't attack the subject because you don't understand how it's logically possible.

Throughout this entire conversation, you have repeatedly called my sources unreliable due to it's nature of study. Colleges, organization, scientist have been disrespected because of their research in parapsychology. You my friend are not only lying when you call these sources unreliable, you're being disrespectful.

<br />
First off, what's with you using &quot;ad homs&quot; in every other sentence? It's quite annoying to read 20 times in a conversation. Back to the topic at hand, I am not embarrassing myself at all. The link I provide was to show one thing, that although the majority of Helmut Schmidt's testing failed, 71 of his test supported his ideas. Which means, his test passed 71 times. Which indicated that something is indeed occurring. If this subject wasn't real, would it have passed 71 times? I think not. It's not a lot, but it's something. Which is why I believe further research on this matter should be done.

But it's doesn't seem fishy to me when someone would try and distort scientific findings and then claim they have nothing to prove.

I support research. As you can obviously tell, I wish for psychokinesis as well as other psionic related abilities to be researched by scientific means more than it already is. If you know your school will want to conduct experiments in this field, I will gladly participate. You and I have something in common, you love to share our opinions and we're searching for the truth. If we can make some arrangements for testing, let me know.

I have recently tried to contact James Randi as many of our members know. However, he has yet to return my phone calls or emails. I understand that the majority of our members would love to see someone win that challenge however, if the owner doesn't want to test someone, he doesn?t have to. 
<br />

<br />
I'm not the kind of person who is looking for fame. The only reason I contacted Randi in the first place is due to countless people asking me to. So, I figured &quot;What could it hurt?&quot; however, nothing happened and I don't believe that going to a person like Randi would be beneficial to researching the subject. I'm interested in researching psionics for the cause of science, not fame. I'd rather help with the researching process rather than appear on a television show, move a book and it a day. I'm sure you can understand where I'm coming from.

As I've stated earlier in this post, I apologize for coming off as disrespectful and for using certain vocabulary. I have recently been shown by another moderator (peebrain) that I should be more helpful rather than argue with members.  If I wasn't a moderator, I really wouldn't care how another viewed my writing. However, I respect the other moderators opinions and for that I apologize to you. You have my word that I will not use any disrespectful comments based on your statements of beliefs. I hope you can understand and show me the same gratitude.

The gabbly chat is very different from our main chat room located on IRC.   I'm always around the chat room (#PsiPog) on IRC. I definitely recommend that you stop by.

Well, I'm sure you can understand how others can become offensive when you argue and attack their beliefs. We have many intelligent conversations based on scientism however, we usually have to lock the thread due to the arguing. However, if someone were to start a skeptical topic in an respectable manner, there would be less arguments and more understanding. However, if at any time someone breaks the rules or attacks your belifes, please let me know. I will deal with the situation accordindly. That goes for anyone. Moderators are here for a reason.

Well then, let me know about it. Most moderators are understanding and respectful. I know peebrain would certainly set the record straight and I'm sure other moderators will do the same. I think this debate is going fairly well and the personal attacks are limited. I find this debate to be entertaining and benifical to understand another's point of view. Hopefully we're all benifiting from this. As well as the members viewing this debate.

As I said, I'm not going to drive down to perform psychokinesis for you personally. I will participate in this research if the school is notified and worked with. I am doing this for researching psychokinesis, not for personal gain.

There has been documented statistical success when testing psychokinesis in the past. I know you don't agree, the data says differently. PEAR, Rhine institute and others have showed reasonable cause as well as data showing the existence of psychokinesis as well as other psychic abilities.  Although the data may be small, it's still showing that there is something there that should be investigated further. Please take note that research on this subject has not stopped, there are still testing/researching still being done.

I conduct independent research on my own accord, but no professor I know of does such kind of research at my school. My professor may be interested but I don?t know what you may be willing to move or what you feel the extent of your ability is so that we can test it.

As long as the school is notified that research is being done and that our research is documented, I'll participate. If you are able to set this experiment, I will share further information based on the extent of my ability with psychokinesis so future planning can begin.

Exactly. However, it will be just another documented case. If you and I set this experiment and we are indeed successful, do you think that other people may attack our research and findings? Yes. There will always be someone who disagrees.

Take care.
