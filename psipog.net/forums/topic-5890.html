			for the last two nights, ive had very morbid endings to my dreams.  Usually I really enjoy my dreams and wake-up not wanting to have it end.  But yesterday morning i woke up because I was trying to boil my cat in a pot of water on the stove, and I remember thinking that I should have snapped her neck so she wouldnt suffer, and I ended up just taking her out of the water because she was still alive.
<br />

<br />
this morning i woke up devestated because in last nights dream, I was trying to catch a plane and was running late, so i tried to take a short-cut through a mcdonalds parking lot, and i realized that it was only going to lead to the mall in my hometown, not the airport, where my in-laws were waiting for me.  As I turned the corner around the building, there was a stark-white, skin-and-bones, bleeding man laying on the asphalt.  He was arching his back while holding his chest.  Beside him stood his horse, which was black, and beheaded.  The horse was bleeding profusely from the open neck wound.  I locked my doors and tried to turn around.  i thought someone else must have called the police, but everybody else acted as though there was nothing to see.  
<br />

<br />
If anyone has any ideas, let me know..
<br />
I ve been rather disterbed by them.
<br />
I havent drank, nor eaten anything out of the normal, and I dont watch scarry movies.

Wow, ummm, your dreams are very creepy. I am not a dream reader or anything but maybe something bad is happening in your life, or something died a while ago and you saw it. 
<br />
But heres another thing, you are taking these dreams seriously right? So you infact are giving the dreams more power and more exsistence so you are therefore premoting even more of those types of dreams. My advice would be to completely forget about them, if you even slightly think about them before you go to bed agian, they may return. I worded that a little strange but I think you should get the idea. If you make a big deal out of something it just may become a big deal.

			one thing you have to realise is that most dreams are metaphorical. there's most likely nothing in these dreams that's literal.
<br />
Think. there's got to be a reason for these disturbing dreams. try asking your sub conscious if anything's wrong. see what you dig up.

			Those things happen. I had one about a child molester that still haunts me to today. It makes me want to throw up. I start crying thinking about it. I really think I need therapy but my parents wont let me

			Monkey, just get a lucid dream and then change everything so it's like the bad dream. Then, let the dream play out, and when the molester comes up, blow his head off with a 12-gauge. And then all the psychological problems are resolved because you have faced down your fears and other issues or whatever. And no, I'm not joking because that's what I'd do, it's the best thing I can think of. It would help you get over it and maybe even, later, laugh about it, which is the best medicine.

			Until you can master yourself and your mind, meaning your fears as well as emotions, you cannot hope to gain mastery of psionics. Stay strong, and don't let dreams scare you. They may seem real, but seriously, pass them off as nothing, and they will go away. Energy flows where attention goes, and you are giving too much attention to the thoughts of these dreams, which allow them to thrive.
