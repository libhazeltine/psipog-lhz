			I had begun doing this slightly, like in a long car ride when some songs came on I would go, &quot;I will sit perfectly still for this song&quot;, but to do it for that long of period of time sounds very intriguing and fun, I will try it tomorrow.
<br />

<br />
But MA, I was wondering, also sometimes when I'm bored, I will try to overpower my bodie's impulses, for example I completely got rid of my bodie's want to shiver, now when I am cold I can just sit still and bear it when everyone around is shivering.  Is this alot like the goal of this meditation?

Yes <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. It is about mastering the mind, the body and the senses. And it seems you are starting to do so in staying still while its cold or while you are bored. congrats,

			I'm not sure if you can count not feeling cold a type of meditation. It's proven that if you just relax your muscles, they don't shiver and you feel more comfortable.  I've done it countless times. Very useful though.

Well, about anything could be called meditation. It is just relative to what you see as meditation. So the name doesn't matter, the fact is you and he can keep the muscles from shivering and feel no cold. That is still a form of controlling the body and mind.

			I tried Motionless meditation yesturday.
<br />
1st attempt 10mins on my laying on my back--then my arm like spasmed for some odd reason.
<br />

<br />
2nd attempt I was on my back again I set my goal at 30mins and I started to feel my hands falling away.
<br />

<br />
3rd atempt i tried for 45mins on my back, and my grandma started asking me questions so I had to stop
<br />

<br />
4th atempt was at night-- i tried in a half lotus, and decided to go for an hour.
<br />

<br />
It was cool.. I got to my goal of 1 hour, but am I doing it right? it seemed so easy. am I suposed to let my mind wander? or focus on something?
<br />

<br />
other than my arms and hands &quot;falling away&quot;  one thing I tried to focus on was my breathing. It was wierd, the I started with deeper/longer breaths then the longer i sat there the shorter/shalower my breathes became. at the end of the hour it was really short and controled breathing Is that suposed to happen? or was I just concentrating to hard on my breathing?
<br />

<br />
aslo about the drool.... I swallowed once, but then after that I just let the slivia run down the back of my throat it felt really wierd.. I could feel it all the way down to my stomach.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Today I am going to work on it again, I want to be able to stop my mind from wandering while motionless meditating. and i want to shoot for 1.5hours too.

<br />
About the breathing, it is better if you do it the other way around. First focus on your breath. It will probably be done at a normal pace. Then eventually let the pace slow down. Take deeper and longer, more silent and slower breaths. Go from focussing on the breathing proces, to becoming a witness of the automatic proces of breathing. You will notice after awhile if you let go of focussing on your breath like that, that you will become a witness to the proces. All things go by itself and the body breaths on it's own. You are just witnessing, not interfering or controlling it in any way. That should deliver you a quite blissfull experience. Shortening the breath's pace is not a more beneficial thing to do. The slower, the more silent, the longer and deeper the breaths are, the better. Don't go forcing the breath to go slow. It comes with practice. Masters of breath are said to take one whole cycle of breath in 12 minutes. Other yogi masters are said not to breath at all for hours in a row when in a specific state called Samadhi. But that is something else.

			I am basically bumping this, I think it is the best meditation article in this section and I do not want it to go to waste by eventually getting deleted. (by the forum's automatic deleting mechanism) And there are new people coming on here all of the time so they should also see this. Maybe it should become a sticky?
