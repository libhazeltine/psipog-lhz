			I noticed Psipog didn't have much in the way of healing on the forums, so, out of curiosity, does anyone practice healing? I find it's a wonderful skill to have, for any random ailments you have. So far, I can do headaches and smaller scratches (like those pesky shaving cuts that just won't stop bleeding). Any other healers around these parts?

			my mother and i were in a car accident about a year ago and a couple week after it i tried to heal her back or atleast releve her of some pain. when i did the hand i was using woke up with a lump on its wrist. I was so scared but the doctor told me not to worry about it that it might go away. Hopefully it was just a weird coincidence but its gone now and ive never tried healing since then

Putting your hand in boiling water isn't the best thing to do. You will get a burn from that no matter what...even if you don't feel it.

			I am a healer. I live in Vancouver, BC. I attend Langara University-College, which is an acceredited instituion; and well known.
<br />

<br />
We have a program called &quot;Intergrative Energy Healing&quot; where we learn all about not only healing, but esoteic knowledge, modern science, hands on practicum, and roots of conciousness. It is a similiar program to Barbara Brennans, and some of our instructors have B.B.'s school in the US.
<br />

<br />
In our program, we actually go out into the hospitals in Vancouver (among many other places) and give treatments to people in need. This is sanctioned by the controlling body for the hospitals, doctors, etc.
<br />

<br />
We are all here to heal here. To shed our ego's and live in the self. Pain and trauma to the physical body, exists also in the energetic (psi) bodies. Healing our physical and emotional wounds, keep us in good heath and allow us to begin to shed the ego-mind. 
<br />

<br />
When we heal, in our tradition, a connection of grounding to the Earth is very important. We hold an allignment with the universe through our 'hara line', and use our chakras to channel the energy for the healer.
<br />

<br />
We are not really healing the person (client), they are using the energy that is being directed through us (the healer) to heal themselves. We can use techniques to help facilitate certain releases, and focus on certain areas. But it is the one being healed, who directs where the energy goes (conscious/unconsciously).
<br />

<br />
The energy we use is the abundant subtle energy that exists throughout all that is. We do not use our own energy, as it is draining. You can draw energy from certain places if you wish (ie. power spot).
<br />

<br />
And of course, Love, is a very important perspective and tool here.

Nerves are delicate and complicatedly connected. You can't just rip them apart and put them together again, stop lying. And yes someone else was right when they said even if the nerves are disconnected you would still get burned. The nerves are your body's way of telling you, &quot;this is injuring me&quot;. Whether their messege makes it to you or not, the injury will still be there, just without the pain. So, unless you're friend pulled his hand out of boiling water with blisters all over it, it would be nice for you to stop lying.

I do a little healing. And I do mean a little. The extent of my skill is getting rid of minor pains and headaches in myself (I have yet to try it on anyone else)... Whether I'm actually getting rid of the pain or blotting it out, I don't know, but it works. Any strong pains I can't get rid of, though I don't know if it's because I can't concentrate, or because I'm just not good enough at healing.

He didn't say he altered them, he said he rewired them. Like, read it yourself. Who didn't read things correctly? And I'm still right about his friend having blisters whether the nerves were connected/<span style="font-weight: bold">numbed</span> or not. That's my point. That's valid. 
<br />

P.S I guess I need derogatory comments in my post from now on? Telling me to shut the fuck up is real mature.
