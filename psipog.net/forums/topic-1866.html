			I believe totally, in TK, telepathy, ect., however... I have always had my doubts on RVing and the such. I know that I probably offended some RVers out there, but I'm willing to accept RVing is real if you can show me a quick example.
<br />

<br />
I've hidden a can of Dr. Pepper somewhere in my house, and I want to see if someone can find it.
<br />

5593-0322 are coords

			A better way to pose a challenge would be to say: &quot;I have a challenge for you, the coords are BLAH.&quot;  - That way, we won't get AOL.
<br />

<br />
I mean... we now know we're looking for a can, and we know it's in a house.  This information can really get the imagination going.  Hence why coordinates were used in the first place... it's not so you can hide something, it's so that you can completely cut off the RVer from information about the target to avoid AOL.
<br />

<br />
Anyways... I'll give it a shot.
<br />

<br />
Colors: Yellow and white, a little bit of blue.  It looks like an elongated horizontal tube of some sorts, that gets pinched on the ends, and curved up.  Sort of like a white and yellow smile looking thing <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  The yellow was on top, and the white was on bottom (Fig 1).
<br />

<br />
I get the feeling it's surrounded by other cans.  Like, I see lots of cylindar shapes, that remind me of cans (Fig 2).
<br />

<br />
Just got an image of a large M shape (Fig 3).
<br />

<br />
If I had to guess, I would say that you hid it in a cabinet with other cans... like canned soup and vegetables.  Perhaps a pantry, I don't know.

<br />

<br />
Short answer: No.
<br />

<br />
Longer answer: I honestly don't mind showing people stuff that I can do, but goddamn so many people are complete assholes about it. For every one person that I enjoy showing something to, there are thirty jackasses. If you realize that I'm a human being, and that I'm not a stupid hippy, and if you just CONSIDER that I just MIGHT be telling the truth, and give me an ounce of respect, then I might do a demonstration. On the other hand, if you're just gonna barge in and demand that I prove myself to you, you can shove it. This website is for people who want help with psychic abilities. I'm not in the business of ?converting? or ?proving? it to people.

I have to say that I am quite surprised that your skepticism is referring to remote viewing and not psionics abilities such as telepathy, PK etc. Perhaps you haven?t done your research on remote viewing. Allow me to give you a crash course.
<br />

<br />
Remote viewing is proven to work. The military used remote viewing for many years. Countries such as The United States, Russia, Australia, England have worked and experimented with remote viewing. 
<br />

<br />
In the early 1970's the United States started projects based on remote viewing. These projects were called &quot;Grill Flame&quot;, &quot;Sun Streak&quot; and &quot;Star Gate&quot;. These projects were based on remote viewing targets to gain information. 
<br />

<br />
Although remote viewing is proven to work, we can not find out how it works. The quote &quot;We don?t know how it works, it just works&quot; was not enough to convince skeptics and the scientific community. In the 1900's project Star Gate was ended. It wasn?t until a United States Army general and sergeant decided to share information about remote viewing to the public. 
<br />

<br />
There are still remote viewers working to this day. Most remote viewers use remote viewing as a hobby. However, some remote viewers decided to make remote viewing a career and started company and businesses. 
<br />

<br />
I think that you should do some research before you make certain judgments. Going to a community and saying &quot;Hey, I don?t believe remote viewing is real, prove it&quot; is not going to be respected.
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />

Peebrain posted that April 9th 06. Its April 11 06, and still no answer.
<br />
I think its safe to say he totally forgot. Pfft. Dang, and I wanted to know if he got it right.
<br />

<br />
I wonder if you could find my car keys. They were sucked into the black hole that is my hosue a few days ago, so I've been using the spar set. ^_^ Sure, RV can be used to track criminals down, find a sniper, ect. But what use is it if you can't locate a remote, keys, or sunglasses with it?
<br />

<br />
In anycase, I'll vote my option. Its to the left of your PC monitor (assuming your looking at it) beside 7-12 other cans of soda pop. Half of them are turned over on there side. However, they have been cleaned up since the 9th, and the can is now sitting in the local dump.

			This is one of the reasons why I hate &quot;demonstrating&quot;.  A lot of so-called skeptics aren't really interested in the results.

			peh ya.. But thats just those who either, havent tried it, or cant do it yet. I'll admit i was just interested in my psi wheel spinning. not for the results, but to prove it to myself that PK exsisted. I guess thats why its so hard in the beginning. I guess it also depends on who you are...?

i just like to read the technique and try it out for myself, thats the only reason why i provoked any kind of demonstration.

Experiences like these stick with me...

I try to integrate my beliefs into one large belief system, that is consistent
and complete.  Things like this stick out so non-elegantly...

Even as an old fart, with my infinite "adult" wisdom (groan)... I don't know
how to explain this.  How do you explain it?  No explanation has satisfied
me... and at this point, I'm more comfortable with the idea that "I'll never
know" than the idea of "I must find out".

I've had my fair share of failures, but not enough to be able to claim this
was a coincidence.

(That being said, I'm still convinced no one else knows what is going on
either... every path I've explored smells of bullshit or ignorance... oh
well.  Maybe someone else will figure this out.  Best of luck.)

(((( ...but at the same time, I don't want to encourage anyone to waste
their time trying to figure it out... it's not worth it... I spent years,
and a large part of me feels as though I've wasted a lot of time and
resources... which I now see is my most precious possession as a living
being... ))))
