			Im so sad. This place is probably going to be one of the most memorable websites i will ever be to. Its a shame it has to end, and i wish time could stop. I dont want to ever ever leave it. I know there is no possibility that its staying, because the pk party is already over and everything. I had a great time.
<br />

<br />
Now i will give my special thanks to all of my friends and fellow psions.
<br />

<br />
Peebrain- thank you for starting this whole mess... this wonderful mess. Your psi ball article was the thing that started my whole psionic career.
<br />

<br />
somefatguy- thanks for being a kind person, and not acting stuck up or anything
<br />

<br />
greatwhiteninja- i enjoyed talking to you over the course of psipog. i had a great time
<br />

<br />
evlmonky- thanks for talking to me on AIM. sometimes you were the only one i could talk to
<br />

<br />
bladeslinger- for the first few months of being a psion, you were the only one i talked to. you introduced me to tons of psions, and made my buddy list grow from 10 to 155. PS- sublime is awesome. thanks for telling me about it
<br />

<br />
pyroman- thanks for the wierdest chats and help.
<br />

<br />
hellomoto- thanks for talking to me. you are probably one of the nicest people i know. im glad i dont have to say goodbye to you forever!
<br />

<br />
tankdown- thanks for being entertaining and a nice guy
<br />

<br />
Gonzo- thanks for making your website, which is probably where i am going to go after psipog is officially over
<br />

<br />
maxus- if you are alive, then i hope someday you will read this. i am worried that you arent because you had cancer, so..... yeah....
<br />

<br />
MOBC (probably not on this forum)- RIP my friend. ????-1/26/2007
<br />

<br />
ChanServ- thanks for keeping out the trolls and the asses (even though you denied to op me or kick people for me)
<br />

<br />
(everyone that i chatted to)- thanks for listening (well, reading) and making me think about psionics. thanks for helping me get farther and better in psionics.
<br />

<br />
(sorry to everyone i left out. it has been a sad day and im not very good at goodbyes...)
<br />

			I think that if you suggested this earlier, you may have had a little bit more of a chance. But, a large amount of the Psions from Psipog have now left. It's too late. There is nothing we can do. 
<br />

<br />
I am already completely overloaded on what new website to choose from. Now another one? I just don't know what to say.

			Psi_Ninja, I don't want to be rude but if your forums are just gonna be another invisionfree, takeforum, forumer, proboards, or another service I don't think I'd join unless it had a large, respectable site associated with it.
<br />

<br />
However, if you plan to download and install your own message board script on your own website, I'd be glad to come and join you.  I myself am currently working on <a href="http://www.briggswd.com/psiacademy" target="_blank" class="postlink">a project</a> intended to help fill the gap that  PsiPog's collapse will bring, but it is still under development.

Pending your reply I will vote.

			Well, it was just going to be a takeforum board, because i dont know any programming. Also, its just so all of the people from psipog can stay together on one forum.
<br />

<br />
Ehh, never mind. I don't see the point of another forum now that you mention it. But we should at least decide one forum to go to.

Good idea. We could go to PsiOnline, which i believe i am still a member of. I also like PsiStudies, because there arent a lot of skeptics or noobs their, so it is pretty much fluff free. (only 1 skeptic so far, and he didnt believe that anything was real (such as the earth, air, or anything))
<br />

<br />
EDIT- forgot some...
<br />

<br />
If you want to get someone who can program a forum for us, then try to. We have 5 days until this forum is gonna be closed. In the meantime, if you want, i could make a temporary forum with Takeforum, or Forumer.
<br />
Can someone please help me think of a name for the forum? they will get to be a mod! im not good at thinking of names for forums or sites...
