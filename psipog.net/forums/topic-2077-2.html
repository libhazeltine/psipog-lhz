			Well, I like being sceptic and a believer. It COULD BE possible....
<br />
Its funny, that I can Macro Psychokinesis and not believe in psi-balls <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.
<br />
When you would create such a ball, who yould be able to hack, you would have to program its EACH LINE OF CODE, like how php or html is programmed. It would take just DAYS if not WEEKS to get the basic of such psi-ball together. 
<br />

<br />
BUT
<br />

<br />
In come the ANCHORS <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />
Once you successfully program the base of such hacking psi-ball you can call it like &quot;Hacking Base&quot; and each time u say it, it will appear on your destination (mainly between hands or on one hand). SO when you have coded all parts, like how to intercept network traffic, how to install a trojan... (since the easiest way into a PC is through Trojan) you can summon a psi ball just like that in matter of minues.

<br />
i want a clone of myself so that i would have more time to train in psi and in ki as well.ever since then it has been an &quot;up hill battle&quot;.
<br />

<br />
   ihave seen battlestar on scifi like the the miniseries and didn't get much but the name cylon.but i guss everything started to come together in my head when i saw a post about it,sence then i have got everything i can find on this robotic people,and have got a stronger chush on there number six,but thats beside the point.
<br />
instand of 12model i want to create 18models,but i organgaly ust wanted a clone of myself.so i plan to to look over all my notes and come up with a plan that allows me to a clone of my self and a couple of agents by myside <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			Hey man, it sounds awesome what your doing. But, I hope sincerely that you wouldn't program these psionic beings to do bad things to other people, I surely hope not. And why is it that you want them to hack computers so badly?

			i'll try to do anything at lease once in my life,but not before long thouht and planing.
<br />
yes <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> i have created a working model of the human &quot;psyche&quot; in just one day.if you want want me to share,just ask me,and i'll give it to you.
<br />

<br />
i am geting closer to competleing my goal,but now that i think about it ,if i pull this off it would change my entire outlook on everything.i mean if i can mimic the most compelx creation on earth as we know it, just think about what else i could do.oyahh i have mastered walking on water,but i don't want to replace god in any way ,when i do pull this off i plan to have my creation belif  in the true god and to thank and pase him for thier creation ,and they will never know that i created them. the only reason i want to create this type of psi consturct is so that when i do clone the solor system and move it a claok i will have someone to cut the gass and water the plant well i away on this planet.but i guss i can uderstand some people not want me to do this.i mean it's kind of like i am bootleging the entire earth just so that i can have every.but thats where my conscious kicks in and explains to me,that i if i have worked this hard,then it is my right to have want i truly desire, and puls not to meanchin tha bagging rigths i would have. 
<br />

<br />
p. s. i want  post the teachniques i have gained from being alone in my head for so long,but i think after this month is over so that i get some time to look over my spelling and get every thing in order for every to learn from and so everyone use it to their benfit or just to talk about if it's possible
<br />
currently i am trying my hand in time travel and any helpwould welcome in eye

			Actually from what i know, this kind of thing is very possible. Do a little reasearch on the topic of tulpas. Basically they are constructs created from you own mind which can over time develop a free will. Though you should be careful because some of the stories ive read have had some negative outcomes from messing with tulpas. Because since they have free will and are not bound by the modern laws of society they can pretty much do whatever they want. That includes hurting people. For instance, ever hear of a story about a kid who created an imaginary friend that got out of control and started hurting her. Well its something like that. So research tulpas but plz be careful. also trlk02930 although many people here(probably all of them or nearly all) say that this kind of thing is impossible. I however say that anything is possible, i mean its been done already or how else would we have gotten here. Personally i have goals similar to yours however i want to create an entire plane of existence all to myself. I most likely wont be able to do this anytime soon.(hell i may never be able to but i can sure as hell try.) Anyways to those like myself who have a god complex, good luck. To everyone else, i know it seems silly to have these kind of goals but hey, stop with the insults and such. Just because you havent seen it done doesnt mean it cant be. In my realm of thinking...anything can be done.

			wow...
<br />

<br />
after reading this im truly amazed. not only that someone with such bad language skills can write so much, but that someone actually is going against what most believe is an act against god. i myself see no harm in it. for all you religous people, from the commandments only state that we dont try to do things that makes us be better than god and this doesnt go against it. it doesnt mainly becuase we've had these abilities and they have been with us forever. Which means we already have the potential to do this and that something gave it to us to try and do these things. if we can do it then obviously he/she wants us to otherwise he/she wouldnt give us the ability to for whatever reason. So i believe it can be done and will most likely be done over some amount of time, whether from several months or to several hundred years, we will figure out how to do it if we think it. 
<br />

<br />
i hope this puts to rest any religous beliefs against not only this, but any other thing related to psionics

maybe he is a PsiGod, who knows? he
<br />
anyway, all this religious-my-ass issue, you people need to chill, first, if this stuff makes you feel uneasy about your beliefs, dont read it!!!, you really think this guy (or any other human) is capable of cloning the Solar System (duh!)?????
