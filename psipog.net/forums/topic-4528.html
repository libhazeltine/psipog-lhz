			This is a forum I made for people that are a bit more advanced in psionics. There's a simple test I made that you have to pass to become a full member. 
<br />

<br />
The REAL forums have a ton of great stuff and activities. Advanced Psionics is a great way to practice psi and hang out.

			You can &quot;sort of&quot; astral project. Many people sometimes get partways out of their body then get stuck, or have really short astral projections. While these are technically true projections, they could also be seen as &quot;sort of&quot; projections.
<br />

<br />
Also, by many definitions, dreaming is astral projections, so by that token, we're all experienced projectors, too bad its not consciously eh?

I don't see the point of you breaking off from PsiPog, what is your main reason for doing so? Its not like you can't help people here. Maybe Peebs should open a new section for personal apprenticeships or something, to prevent all these people from making these splinter groups.

			To the OP:

<br />
6 months isn't advanced.  I have been active in psionics for about 6 <span style="font-style: italic">years</span>, and I do not consider myself advanced.
<br />

<br />
To Mad:
<br />

<br />
There's nothing wrong with forming your own group with your own goals and purposes.  Dont tie all psychic websites other than psipog into one group. That's a bad thing.  My site is not a &quot;mimic&quot; of psipog, I have my own goals.

			I guess that may have come across a bit harsher then I intended. When I say splinter groups from PsiPog, I mean people that start out at PsiPog and then decide after a certain amount of time, they'd like their own site. I'm not saying these are bad, but that all too many of these lack a significantly differenct purpose from PsiPog. If the sites have a specific goal that this site doesn't offer, then by all means, full speed ahead. But it just doesn't make sense to me to start your own smaller site when there is already a large, well established one doing practically the same thing. That being said, you can make as many sites as you want, but just try and make sure they're somewhat unique. 
<br />

<br />
True, I may have generalized a little, but I hope you get my idea. 
<br />

<br />
Slinger: I'm not attacking your rights to make a forum, I'm just asking what is your purpose? You didn't say what this forum is about, besides general psionics and that the registration is limited to those more advanced members that pass your test. I was simply trying to see if you had a goal in mind.

			The only reason he wants to have his own site is because he wants to teach psionic combat! i became a member and figured out thats all it is he has an &quot;arena&quot; were people can go and &quot;duel&quot; i suggest you do not waste your time taking this &quot;test&quot; or even join <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />
