			Hey guys im new here, and being new, that means, i gotta ask the same old shit youve heard 100 times LOL
<br />

<br />

<br />
I practice the psi wheel. after a few minutes of a good connection, I can snag it, and drag it back and fourth left right, and of course spin. but ONE thing im trying for, is POWER Id like to strengthin my signal, so that I can move it faster or even knock it off the pin and move to bigger things like straws, balls balloons cans pencils you get the point.
<br />

<br />
what can I do to strengthin my signal? ive been doing this a month now and im staying around a certain point. Not enough power to knock it off yet, any tips guys?
<br />

<br />
Thaaaank you.

			on second thought. harvest your energy instead of writing a whole paragraph do a search or something, and use the energy you save to move the damn wheel.

			thanks pepsi guy. on second thought, why dont you.. save your energy on being a dick, and comment something useful. I was asking for advice, not to be told to &quot;do a search&quot; or move the wheel. If you read my post i want bigger things, like the ability to rupture your organs cause youra dick

			Ok and now for a nicer post..
<br />
The dealie with power, is that at some point there might be a mental block with the wheel that.. you can spin it but can't knock it off, or does your mind know how to knock it off? it's a little hard to explain, but then again I guess it could fall in my own personal tech.. anyway, try other things for now, like a ball of tinfoil.

			thank you lucidess! Ive seen a 14 year old kid push a ball of tinfoil around a table, I was so jealous because I use psi wheels for 2 hours a day, and I can move it, but control is limited, and I guess.. I dont know how to knock it off yet, How strong is YOUR guys TK and and pk? Ive seen a guy on antother site levitating a swiss army knife in his hand!

			hehe, that wasn't another site. That was this site, the main site of this forum. The person doing that was NI (Not_Important), a respected member of the soceity it would definetely seem. Although there has been a lot of dispute as to whether that pic was real, mostly just skeptics pointing out lots of irregularaties in the pic concerning photoshop. I like to believe that it's real.

			Caught out! I don't know much, if anything about chakras, sorry. I know most of everything else, but not chakras...and I don't know their names either. MA (Martial Artist) and other people who hang out in the mditation forum know about it all.
