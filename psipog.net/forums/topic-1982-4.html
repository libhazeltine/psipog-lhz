			maybe we can have apollo setup a paypal account, and those who want to donate can donate it to the account, taht way, he got the money quickly. 
<br />
Apollo, chose a camera, within reason, inexpensive, but with excellent resolution. fore go all the nifty bell and whistles and just get one for pk videos. if anyone has other suggestions please post. lets see if we can get this done this week. gotta go lunch with a freind, i wanna finish and get home and practice already. oh, i have something else to tell you guys about the post that peebrain put up on talking to your subconcious, i read it, make so much sense, so i did some programmin of my subconcious to let me have restful sleep, yet remain alert for anything, suer enough, at about 9am i began to wake up, i was thinking to myself, no, more sleep. so i went back to sleep, sort of. i kept waking up. sure enough, there was someone at my gate. no one else got up to answer the door. i got up to look out the window and saw that it was the mail lady delivering a package i thought i was gonna recieve on monday. she was walking away, so i ran downstairs and got my package. pretty cool eh.

			Lets get serious.  I love your guys' enthusiam but do you think my parents are going to be suspicious by randomly gaining money?  And using it to by a camera that they already didnt allow me to get in the first place?  I promise i will get a new one sometime in the future.

Oh, to the question from rahmid:
<br />

<br />
I dont find it any easier to push or pull.  I always like to push but with the hole puncher, i dont have much control over it yet.

			Even if apollo had a good camera he is limited in the amount od data he can upload at once. If you do get a good camera thought try filiming you tk then split the video up and upload it in peices. Oh yeah i added you on aim.

			There are many video editors that can cut a big video file into much smaller segments...  Then someone could re-join them.

So the uploading problem isn't too much of an issue <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
