			I meant that the brain for that individual was allowing the consciousness to percieve outside the body.

And i'm not saying you <span style="font-style: italic">can</span> do that. A cheap argument maybe, but you can't always prove everything. As far as what the brain is using to percieve the outside world, I could not tell you. As people have reported (sans documentation, if I could find Monroe's stuff that'd be different) seeing things that they couldn't, I doubt it is one of the normal everyday 5 senses. Perhaps it is that part of the brain referanced in those articles, the &quot;angular gyrus&quot;. I could not tell you as I am not an expert in brain functions, and as far as I know little serious research has gone into it.

<br />
That site, while not a real scientific study (sigh) is the scientist that worked with Monroe and with Miss Z. You've probably already read it, but for anybody else who wanted to make their own calls on whether OBEs are really out of body or all in your head, there it is.

   Yep. I am saying that. People use their imagination, dreaming, or just lying. False memories and all that stuff.

<br />
   Isn't one of the dangers of lucid dreaming forgetting that it's just a dream? Or getting convinced that you're crazy for thinking it's all a dream?

So in other words, when you &quot;had&quot; one you just lied... So get off this forum. We don't need ppl like you. Srry but not to offend you much but you just fully contradict yourself and jump down ppl's throat in a &quot;pleasant scientific&quot; manner.

robert bruce discovered it when he was out of body... he was floating around, and then saw his physical body, his physical body looked back(having clairvoyant sight at the time).  this caused astral feedback... ect...

<br />
the point is that it causes a split in conciousness, this is why most new astral projectors feel the vibrations ect... but dont remember any projection, because the physical bodys memories are stronger than the etheric bodys...

Can OBE lead to astral projection?? Im scared of AP and I dont want to any possible way end up there. I heard Lucid Draming can lead to OBE so I was wondering does OBE somtimes lead to AP?

			OBE refers to both Astral Projection and Etheric Projection, if I'm not mistaken. In both situations, you feel &quot;out of body&quot;.

			Why would you be scared? And yes, OBE's can lead to astral projection, from what I know, OBE tends to mean etheric projection, which can then lead to astral, as stated before. Lucid dreams can also lead to OBEs, but you usually have to try and invoke them. But theres nothing to be scared of, really.

			Because I heard AP can be very dangerious off halo's old site, and AP has monsters and when they attack you, you can wake up in real life blind. I also read to be friendly to them or they may possibly ATTACK you, you gotta use psi back which I can barely do. And from a previous post a guide is waiting for you?? that might freak me out or somthin.

			cjay I don't know where you get your info but it's not true. You won't go blind for anything while out of body, and if you confront an &quot;evil&quot; entity you can just think about being somewhere else and *puf* you're there. And if you have fears about OBE you won't make it out anyway, first you have to free your mind of all the detachments that its holding to.
