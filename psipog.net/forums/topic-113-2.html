			Wow NI! I think you hit the nail right on the head. In fact when I look back, this, unknowingly, was the exact method I used when I first moved the psiwheel after a year of failure. I completely agree with you and think that this method is the best one I have ever heard of.

			hmmm ive been thinking about what ni said and i have noticed it working for me. Lets just say i get good with moving the foil and i want to start on pencils, do i use the same method until it works and the object moves. Or do i have to get in a different mindset for when i start on a different objects? or do i &quot;just do it&quot; with all objects?

			Hi,
<br />

<br />
first, NI, I send you a PN today, NOW I saw your comment on that ... sorry <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />
I have a problem with the psi wheel. Since I never trust my success with it although I am pretty ?sure? that I can change its direction I would like to try to move it under a glass bowl. That way I could exclude a gust of wind.
<br />
But I just can?t ?duplicate? the feeling I have when the psi wheel moves without the bowl. I always seem to consider it as another barrier.
<br />
I hope you can give me a tip.
<br />
Bye

Move on... if you would move on, you will become more confident as you are able to move bigger things, or slide/roll things. Cause covered objects is just a mental block... And how can you overcome it? Well you could overcome it by just practising covered... but I don't think that will really make you progress allot... I mean if you do actually succeed spinning it covered... you are still at the same level, only you are able to spin a psiwheel covered (Woah). So if you move on, you get better at moving things, and will also be able to move stuff covered. Cause really focusing on only doing it covered... is really just waste of time imo. It's all about confidence.

			Hi Expedion,
<br />

<br />
thanks for the Tip.
<br />
The problem ist that I just restarted my training. I had to take a longer pause.
<br />
Therefore I am having slight difficulties with the wheel. So I believe I wouldn?t have much success with bigger objects, at least not now. But I will give it a try.
<br />
Bye

			Move on ones you can spin pretty much a psiwheel... doesn't need fully control... just fast spinning, some control. But don't force yourself <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. Then move on to straw/balanced foil on desk, ones you can do that stuff, you try to roll, a can, plastic cup, pens, etc.

Goodluck <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

No, step 3 is wrong. If you take it as &quot;waiting&quot; nothing will happen. You're sending your subconscious the wrong message. If you tell yourself &quot;ok Ni said I've got to wait now&quot;, then your subconscious is going to say &quot;alright lets wait&quot; and I think you can guess the outcome of that method.
<br />
Step 3 = let it move. Basically you move it, but without conscious effort. It's a delicate step since you've got to do something without doing something consciously. That's really the only tricky part about telekinesis.

I'm not sure what actually your question is. Try something that works for you, if it doesn't try something else.

Vader, I've got your PM. I haven't read it completely yet, but I may answer it on the forums some time this week. (It's a long PM <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> ). I just wanted to thank you for it. By the way you write I've noticed you're an intelligent person. Nice to meet you. I don't like your nickname though (sounds a little bit fluffy heh) 
<br />
Just to give you a short tip: the bowl-problem is a very common one. There are 2 different theories about it. I'll write more about it soon.

			Would <span style="font-weight: bold">&quot;seeing the object move&quot;</span> qualify as forcing the movement with your conscious mind?
<br />

<br />
How do you <span style="font-style: italic">set your goal</span>? Do you use words like &quot;move left&quot; or &quot;move right&quot; in your head or out aloud? Do you visualize the end result? Do you just &quot;know&quot; what you want to do? How do you do it?

Jack Houck has a <span style="font-weight: bold">similar</span> way to do PK:
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">(i am not insinuating in any way that it has been stolen by NI or vice versa, and no, i'm not being sarcastic)</span>
<br />

<br />
First Step: Make a mental connection with what you want to affect
<br />
Second Step: Command (intention) what you want to happen
<br />
Third Step: Let go!

<br />

<br />
Back then when i first read this i thought it was a &quot;bad method&quot;, not my kind of thing, so i just continued to force object movement, now i think i'll give it a try but i'll try NI's method instead because i think <span style="font-style: italic">clearing your mind</span> is an very important step.

It's just an intention in your inner self. You have to want it. For example, you've got a mosquito on your nose, so you want to kill him. The intention in your inner self right before you set your hands into movement is what I'm talking about. You have to create an intention to move that object and keep that intention &quot;active&quot;
<br />

<br />
You really surprised me with Jack Houck! Indeed his method seems similar and it's a good sign that two people not connected to each other come to similar conclusions. We may be moving in the right direction! However, like Sean said, we may have similar background beliefs and that's why we may have come to the same conclusion.
<br />

<br />
I think I'll write Jack a letter.

Concerning Jack Houck: it's not his method but i believe he uses it on PK-parties, thats why i said he <span style="font-weight: bold">has</span> a similar method. The method wasn't &quot;developed&quot; by him but by a metallurgist named Severin Dahlen who came to the first PK-party (1981) Houck arranged at his house, nevertheless two people came to similar conclusions.
<br />

<br />
Sorry about that, i'll try to be more accurate next time.
