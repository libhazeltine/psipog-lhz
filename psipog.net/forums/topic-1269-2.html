			LoL... I've been talking to myself fo so long now, that I can't tell witch is just me answering my own question, being a dumbass... and witch is my tru subcontious answer... Usualy I'll get 2 answer simultaniously  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
but sometimes its just undeniable... One time I was in the shower getting ready to go to work, so i could quit... and for some reason I just did not feel like getting out after the usual few minutes... so I hung out just relaxing for a while longer... I then commence getting redy and so-on... when i pull up to the office parking lot i notice my bosses car is just pulling in too....
<br />

<br />
I got there the EXACT same time she did... I was able to meet her right at the front entrance to give her my security card and resign... I didn't even have to enter the building LoL!
<br />

<br />
Lot's of lil' things like that tend to happen with me... just perfect timeing.

			my subconscience has helped me with awareness since im naturally cautious....my friend and i were sparring with bokkens and i was turning the tide when my mind just went 'move the sword to the left.' and when i did i saw the handle of my sword had blocked an accidental head shot but instead of stopping we kept on with the fast paced fight just giving a small &quot;cool!&quot; but ive had many other useful things like that

			I'm not sure if talking to the subconscious is a &quot;psi&quot; thing as much as it is a relaxation/meditation thing. This is something I've done frequently. 
<br />

<br />
Basically, you meditate like normal (deep breathing, silence the inane babble in your mind, etc). Once your mind has calmed, you visualize that you are in a secluded sanctuary that is just for you -- basically, daydream that you are in a relaxing, safe, soothing environment. Don't &quot;create&quot; it. Instead, allow it to appear. For me, this is a tiny little hut deep in the woods by a stream of water. I enter the hut, and my mentor is there. Again, allow him/her/it to appear. On your first visit, 'knock' on the door to your training hall (the 'hut' in my case) and allow your mentor to answer the door. You may be surprised to find that you are not surprised who/what your mentor turns out to be. The whole process is a bit silly, frankly, but the results are incredible.
<br />

<br />
The mentor is an amazing resource. You can ask for advice (and the advice will always be just what you needed, right when you needed it), or you can ask questions. I don't know about anybody else, but my mentor is incredibly Socratic -- my mentor nearly always answers my questions with a question that instantly reframes my thinking and leads me to the correct answers on my own.
<br />

<br />
I found this process in the book &quot;Life 101&quot;, if you wish to read more about it.

Your subconscious controls your TK abilities, so it actually has it and hasn't really &quot;stolen&quot; it from you. It just lets you use it  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> .</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

why don't you build a construct or whatever to gather energy?

			No, no, you don't use energy by talking to your subconscious. Convincing it to the job is the part that requires good talking skills and of course, will.

			I know this topic is kind of old, but I thought I'd post anyways. I've had a weird experience with my Sub-C a couple of months ago while I was in my kitchen. I'm a cheese freak, so I was getting ready to reach for a slice, then an instant thought came to me saying &quot;You sure eat alot of cheese to be lactose intolerant.&quot; I've never really worried about it, but I'm thinking someone/thing is...

That is really a superb method for people with trouble. It's the whole &quot;Mentor&quot; mentality that really increased communication and my ability to do so. Unfortunately I found out about this much later, and would have saved me a lot of trouble had I found it earlier. My &quot;mentor&quot; experience was during a meditation. I created the image of me on a beach, purely quiet minus the wind and the surf. There was the sun that was semi-setting. I remember thinking it was relaxing, and the sun replied &quot;Indeed, I like this place as well&quot;. Soon later I realized my sub-c took on the role of the sun. Why the sun, I'm not sure. My Sub-C absolutely loves to speak in symbols. Anyways, that's what really improved and created a beginning to communication.
<br />
For those of you reading this thread that have a hard time talking to your sub-c, the &quot;Mentor&quot; really is a fantastic method, and I like Darth's method a lot.

Not necessarily. My subconscious responds immedietly, unless I'm pondering about something in order to not interrupt me. It's entirely a personal thing, so I can't speak for everyone. I believe it's not how long it takes, but just recognizing <span style="font-style: italic">who</span> is speaking. Is any one voice the same? Some are similar, but all are unique. Your conscious and subconscious have different characteristics and attributes that make them &quot;sound&quot; different, and make them feel different.
