			An interesting topic, I was thinking about this my self (a lot) and I believe it's possible.

I agree with that and actually tried it at correcting vision and eye color, now the thing is that after much time(and that fact that I remembered it only once in 2 or 3 days) it did started to change and actually some people asked my what the hell is my eye color because they remember it a little different(and it didnt change much but was visible) now the problem is that when I stoped it slowly but eventually faded back to original. And again there is the time problem.
<br />

<br />
Now what I think is that this topic would be about faster change in that case it WILL be related to PK because you'll have to change things yourself and not wait for new cells to appear or your &quot;message&quot; to sink into your subconscious.
<br />
Because I guess that if someone can move a hole-puncher or a chair he can easily move around some molecules and other small parcticles.
<br />

<br />
About eye color changing, psi4life061 mentioned los of vision but I dont think that in this case it could come to that because you are not dealing with the nerve system just with &quot;pigments&quot;(or whatever) and what could happen is that just after some time the color will go back.
<br />
On the other hand if you can't concentrate well you can &quot;miss&quot; and hit wrong and that WOULD be a problem.
<br />

<br />
And if you'll ask &quot;How the hell should I know how/what to change in there to achieve my goal?&quot;, I think that the answer will be that your subconscious would know what to do if you trust it, also on this topic I cann mention the theory of the &quot;Information field&quot;(Or however it is called in english) in which should be like all information that is and was(and by some that will be) and if it stores all information your subconscious can easily pick the right &quot;set&quot; of changes/genes to make that even permanent.
<br />
Which concludes to how much you trust your subconscious or trust it to tap into this source of &quot;life experience&quot;.
<br />

<br />
P.S: Almost forgot, another problem could arrise is that if you manage to change something physically but not internaly(i.e genes) what will happen than? conflict between genes and what is? what could happen, slow changing back or if the change is big enough something worse??
<br />

<br />
Whoaa that was rather long for me and the fact that english is the 3rd language Iv'e learned.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

Agreed.
<br />
I'm gonna try this as well as normal randomized practice (psiballs mainly: I'm still in my newbie stages in the world of psi). Would it be possible to change to &quot;unnatural&quot; colours such as red or white (zombie-style, minus the pupil)? Or are the pigments limited to the normal human colours?

Actually, the eye color is determined by the amount and placemant of melanin in the iris, which (I think) is determined by genes.
<br />
(I hope I got that right...) So if you can control the production of melanin and  direct it to the iris, you could probably change your eye color. But it would probably still be hard/impossible to change to &quot;unhuman&quot; eye colors.

Then the site lied, you get your eye color from your genes, which is part of your DNA.

			You get your eye COLOR, from genes.  And i'm pretty sure, dont quote me, the amount of the melanin isn't.  Because if you dont go in the sun for a long time they get lighter.  My eyes become ice blue, almost silver, in the winter but are a nice, normal blue in the summer.  A couple of my friends have similair things with their eyes.

			Well, I didn't put in everything from that site, now did I?
<br />
Directly copied from the site: Eye color genes, through the enzymes they produce, direct the amount and placement of melanin in the iris.
<br />
So yes, DNA controls the eye color, but not directly, so you could probably intercept somewhere in the process and control the melanin quantity. And that would also explain why moshe's eye color turned back to original after he stopped trying to change it, the melanin production process simply turned back to normal.

ok about the sleeping thing that is true. because your body heals itslef while you sleep right. so if you tell your sub-c to do something right before you go to sleep it might do it. like this one time i had this relly cool dream and i wanted to have it again so i was thinking about t right befor i went to sleep and had it again. so if you tell your sub-c to do something it will do it and it dosnt half to be while your asleep. 
<br />

<br />
so im going to start meditating everday for 30 mins and while im meditating im going to tell my sub-c to change my eye coloer to blue over and over again. and im going to do the same thing while im asleep
<br />
maybe this will work maybe not but i dont have anything else to do cause it just let out for summer. i will post more about this everyday. maybe someone else could do it with me and we could compare results. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Hello, well just to let ya'll know it is VERY possible. I do it all the time. Changing my eye colour is nothing now. I can switch it form Blue (Natural colour) to Green to Brown, ect. But it takes ALOT of practice to do it on command.

I did my meditating last night for 30 mins and told my sub-c to change my eye color to blue. well anyway i just went and looked in the mirror and my eyes (which are brown) had a blue tint around them.

I also have an experience in this topic, 14 days ago, i asked a PsiPog member(not that  known) on how to change eye color, he said the procedure had something to do with visualizing so on and so forth.
<br />
he also mentioned it would take a month or so..
<br />

<br />
I tried this as an experiment, guess what?, my dark brown eyes are now
<br />
tinted along with grey... which I wanted to have in the first place.

Yea im going to do it 30 mins in the morning and 30 mins in the evning and see how long it will take to fully change them. You should try it to and we could compare results over the next few days.

My eyesight got better too! I've been doing some stuff called natural seeing or something like that. It has to do with the human body being able to regenerate/heal itself(or something like that). I'm pretty sure changing your psychical appearance is possible... Ever heard of plastic surgery(naaah just kidding) It might be possible but it would require lots of training and it would be dangerous. On another site I've heard it's called biokinesis... I know it's kinda fluffy but some things really seemed possible...
