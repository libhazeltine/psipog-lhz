<br />
Build psionic constructs within physical objects. Program the objects.
<br />

<br />
There are some materials, I will try to list them in order of powerfulness:
<br />
1- Tachyon crystal.
<br />
2- Zero point energy plate.
<br />
3- Quartz crystal.
<br />
4- Aluminum or iron bar.
<br />
5- Bloodstone.
<br />
6- Quartz stone.
<br />

<br />
Okay, if you can find one of these:
<br />
Try programming it to do something specific.
<br />

<br />
Example:
<br />
Program it to absorb energy from plants and powerlines and then program it to channel the energy into you.
<br />

<br />
See if you can psionically program a relic that will help empower your psionic abilities. Later on, see if the tool works or not; see how powerful it is.
<br />

<br />
Test #2:
<br />
Drink a herbal tea containing:
<br />
*Echinacea - (Echinacea augustifolia)
<br />
*Mugwort - (Artemisia vulgaris) 
<br />
*Sage - (Salvia officinalis)
<br />
*Peppermint - (Mentha piperita)
<br />
you don't have to use all of these ingredients if you don't want to/can't,
<br />

<br />
But these herbs are said to help boost certian psychic &amp; mental powers.
<br />

<br />
So you could try making the tea, drink some--then see if it inhances your practice/abilities.
<br />

<br />
I'll make this into a thread now, to see if other people would also like to try this out.

I believe that all matter is capable of being programmed, but the materials that I have listed seem to be best.
<br />

<br />
Use an iron object for your programming, IMO, iron is best &amp; easy to find.
<br />

<br />
~
<br />

<br />
You can buy a zero-point-energy aluminum plate here:
<br />
<a href="http://www.purpleplates.com/magic_plates.htm" target="_blank">http://www.purpleplates.com/magic_plates.htm</a>
<br />

<br />
I bought a few, and I ware a smaller one on my solar plexis [attached to my jacket]. The people who made this website did a rather cheesey job when talking about it, and it didn't sound scientific enough IMO, but I have been waring a plate and I am so glad that I bought one. What they said about bodily oscillations of energy--I think this is correct. From what I can tell, my energy level is always about 3 or 4 times as high when I am waring the plate.
<br />

<br />
The plates boosting plant growth speed and size shows that they empower organic life forms.
<br />

<br />
I am unsure as to how possible it would be to program one of the ZPE plates though, because of how strongly programmed they already are.

I think a construct is about storing code, not storing energy.

Mustard, it is very good that you have such an ability.
<br />

<br />
But I must warn you:
<br />
In the same way as the clay ball is programmed to do things--there are non-physical creatures on earth that are programmed to do things, and some of them are very harmful. &quot;Demons&quot; exist. It may be a &quot;real&quot; being, or it may be a form of AI, &quot;made of energy&quot;, that appears to be alive, but either can definitely effect some people.
<br />

<br />
Avoid:
<br />
* Thrift stores &amp; second hand items
<br />
* Goths &amp; witches
<br />
* Churches [especially pentacostal churches]
<br />
* Posessed or crazey people [because some diseases are not physical, they are infections from non-physical beings/programs].
<br />

<br />
Just some advice. Ignore me if you dare, because this is first hand experience; I am sure of these being danger areas for bad programms and links.

			perhaps instead of trying to program an object, you program a symbol to represent something. like, for instance, a dot on your arm.you look at it, and it triggers a response or creates a construct.

this all is very interesting, but you really dont need an item for psi... its not really any more effecient than using your own body.

			meh... i dont beleive in &quot;demons&quot; atleast ones that act on their own. I think these are just constructs people made, or even the victum makes with the combination of an overactive imagination + the ability to project his own thoughts. 
<br />

<br />
I heard that in a dream (once your lucid of course) that if you notice something like a silouette and you think to yourself &quot;that looks like &lt;insert random anything here&gt;&quot; then it will be. Could this also be for demons?

			I'm not sorry for anything. This isn't &quot;religion&quot;.
<br />
I gave you good advice and you can do whatever you want with it.
<br />

<br />
Quantum entanglement applies to objects that your energy passes through. It's a standard principal of things like voodoo to use someone's hair or something like that during the distance-effect spells. So this applies to when you get second hand clothing, as soon as you get it from a possessed person, you're in for some ****.
<br />

<br />
If you never experienced demonic damage then good for you, but there are some who have realized it as it happened to them. Often people don't realize it is even happening.
<br />

<br />
There are non-physical beings with stronger psi then humans.
