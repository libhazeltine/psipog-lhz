			This is becomeing annoying for me in my efforts. I have tried again and again and have seen some results. I know it takes different amount of time for different amounts of people. But there is one flaw I can't seem to get myself to go around. I'm having a hard time imagineing more power flowing through me, I find some nice results but still annoyed at somethigns I still can't get such as moving a pinwheel. But I know I'll get it in time. 
<br />

<br />
Late last night I threw some energy into a psi ball. I was annoyed at how I can feel only a limited power in the psi ball. Same with everything else I do. I tend to feel better in the dark and late at night. But everytime I try to break this limit something blocks me. I was so annoyed I place myself in deep mediation trance. I simply do this by relaxing my muscles like any other mediation. I then just speak some words to myself repeatly to help me escape into my mind.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Enter the subcounious&quot;
<br />
&quot;Exist realitory&quot;
<br />
&quot;Proceed to fantasy.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sometimes I find myself saying these words in a different order. But it works just the same. I did this last night for a while and forcus on a psiwheel in my mind, the psiwheel was in front of me floating in the air. I imagine the psiwheel like a ball of fire. I feel the heat hitting the sides of body. I even believed for a moment I really was feeling heat hitting me all over. But when I tried to do this in the morning I found myself not being comforable enough to do it. I sometimes wonder if the power source I'm useing it not strong enough. I don't use the earth or the sun, once in a while I use myself. But what I find what I like useing is human machines. I don't know whybut I tend to feel like a theif If I take it from the sun or earth. I feel taking it from something that is already takeing power from something else is ok. 
<br />

<br />
Just today I tried to pass this limit but found myself doing it weaker. Frist I couldnt get myself into a good trance to collect energy. At the end of the trance part of my subcounious started to forcus my energy someone else. I felt compelled into collecting energy in this spot. I guess most of you would called it the &quot;third eye&quot;.  In no time I found myself saying different words.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I am one&quot;
<br />
&quot;I see as one&quot;
<br />
&quot;I feel as one&quot;
<br />
&quot;I am only one&quot;
<br />
&quot;I see only one&quot;
<br />

<br />
I pretty much said a few setence that had the word one in it. Anyway after I broke away from my trance I felt a slight burnig feeling on the head. But I did say a few things that didnt have &quot;one&quot; it in.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I see what can not be seen&quot;
<br />

<br />
But sort of in between them. Anyhow it sort of breaks away from my problem...is that I can't seem to break away from this energy limit I have. But I just felt like telling you. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Sometimes I ask myself questions in a trance just to feel to the words. Any subjections?
<br />

<br />
P.S. If I put this in the wrong area I am sorry....or sorry for anything else I mite not have done.
<br />

<br />
I know I can collecting some energy. Because at the end of each psi ball I throw the psiball back into me, and I always have a charge.

			The energy limit is but in your mind, young one. Realize that the only limit is your imagination, and you will be free.

			Actually, I believe we are limited on psi depends on how use our body is to it. I believe that there is some kind of reaction in our body that causes psi energy to do what it does. Although, no true proof besides the lost of potassium and other chemicals (which I've heard) after using psi.
<br />

<br />
Just keep practicing and just keep trying. There are some mental blocks, but I don't think everything is because your Sub-conscious doesn't believe or some shit like that.
<br />

<br />
How much do you practice psi manipulation in general? More then PK?

			I tend to give up on moving things, but I'll do it about once a week or more. I feel like ever since my dream with a OBE my limit gone higher. Annoying that I can't flare or move anything, But I know I'm getting closer...but I can't exactly get there. I know my mind is part of the problem, I'm trying to open my mind to greater levels. I fear part of me has doudte that hold me down...
<br />

<br />
I don't do a trance every night, and when I do it normaly a dark room at 1:00 a.m. Reason why I don't do it in the morning because I am so sleeply when I get out of the trance I normaly have the problem &quot;Falling&quot; asleep...The reason why I do it at night is because part of me REALLY wants to do it. But I alway tell myself &quot;DANGET I GOT TO GET UP FOR WORK IN THE MORNING AT 5:00 FREAKEN A.M&quot; But it never works.
<br />

<br />
First I like a reply on some of my styles. Also what do you think of my power source that I am useing?

			Hmm i think you're techniques are good, but you're thinking too much. Don't try to force anything by repeating phrases or something. Just relax, but still try to stay focused on your goal. 
<br />
To the times and places when you practice: I guess place and time aren't important, it is only important that you feel alright when you do it. Otherwise you might not be able to move anything. 
<br />

<br />
Another thing i think is bad is that you fear that part of you has doubt that hold you down... Sounds to me like being afraid of fear itself which sounds pretty crazy.
