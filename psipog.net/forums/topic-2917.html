			Im laying down thinking to get outta my body and i get this very weird vibe like I got a huge headach tinklinf feeling but it doesnt hurt and even if i stand up and lay back down it will las for like 2 mins and then go away. I try again and the longer I let &quot;whatever my minds doin&quot; it gets deeper and my body starts to feel paralyzed so I start gettin scared but I didnt want that to hold me back.
<br />

<br />
 I read on here on some topic saying they hear evil voices (i know its mind tricks) Welll anyway I read since your out your body .A demon or w/e can get in your body and pozess you. Is this really true?? Has anyone ever have this happin to them?? Its bad enough my body reacts to dreams (as in if I jump in my dream ill end up kicking my legs)

			I know we've hashed this subject out multiple times, but I've only managed to find four threads on it. (Mostly because I didn't check every thread with the creative titles of &quot;OBE&quot; or &quot;OBE?&quot; or &quot;Question&quot;.)

Maturity is knowing when something is beyond you. I commend you for your maturity.
<br />

<br />
You might still try OBE though. Personally, I've never heard any voices, evil or otherwise, during my OBE exit attempts. I generally get what I call the &quot;astral breeze&quot; - not to be confused with Robert Bruce's &quot;astral wind&quot; which is a completely different animal altogether - a noise that sounds like wind whistling through a forest in winter. I've also occasionally heard other sounds, but nothing voicelike at all - I've heard a sound like a Swiss alpenhorn, and another which I don't even remember. If I open my eyes or wake myself up out of the trance state, the noises immediately stop.
<br />

<br />
It's important to realize that any noises are <span style="font-style: italic">completely</span> inside your head, and that you can stop them at any time by simply opening your eyes or thinking yourself more awake. You cannot possibly be harmed by these noises, because they are not real.
<br />

<br />
Hope that helps. Good luck!

I agree with him. I've had my share of weird noises noises, especially in that state right after you wake up and you're still gaining full consciousness. Just open your eyes and think that you are fully conscious. 
<br />

<br />
I've been doing The Gateway Experience and their suggestion to gain full consciousness is to: inhale, think the number 1, then exhale. It works well for me <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Thanks on the responses but I guess its because of daytime that I feel being scared of voices is dumb. But its good to know I could make them stop.

1 Last question I have for you guys is when your out of your body and IFF by anychance you see some ghost or abnormal thing, can you force yourself back in your body?? Im basically asking can you return once your out or do you have to wait till you naturally go back in? Also do you come out naked??
