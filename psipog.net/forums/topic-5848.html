			I am going to be making a speech next week about the New Age Culture and the two main sub-groups. I assume they are Psions and Wiccans. I will be writing about why these people become Psions/Wiccans, who these kind of people are, what goals Psions/Wiccans have, and what Psionics/Wicca basically is. If anyone wants to give their input, feel free to. Later.

			I think you got your definition of a sub-group mixed up, Psions would be the main group with Wiccans/New Age as the subgroups. There's nothing discrimatory about this, a sub-group must still have the major properties of the main group. Psions don't have a the heavy spirituality and/or fluff you see in New Age groups, but both New Age and Wiccans have the major characteristics of Psions in that they're still practicing their own variations of psychic abilities.

			That's the problem with psionics, it's hard to come across a highly-decided upon opinion to describe it, and it's subgroups.
<br />

<br />
I would say that psionics is a general group, but then there's alot of subgroups and hybrid subgroups. And it's hard generalizing, because then you put people who fit into a bunch of categories, into one or the other, where most, or some, details may not be true.

I don't see the &quot;new age&quot; people as a subgroup; I see them as the next step or the step below depending on who you talk to.

			It takes to long to enlighten people. Read some shit about hard core eastren philosophy. Not the religious aspects like universal love. The core beliefs like enlightenment. Also we're into purpose and answers.

			Honestly, do try to gain some personal experience about what your trying to describe to your audience. 
<br />

<br />
Additionally, with all due respect, your ignorance shines clear in your reference to the &quot;Wiccans&quot; as the second primary group to what you associate to &quot;New Age&quot; belief. You've never heard of the Hermetic Society of the Golden Dawn, the Antiquus Mysticus Ordo Rosae Cruxis, Astra Argentum, et cetera? 
<br />

<br />
I strongly suggest you do not attempt your speach without futher research on your part; I know full well how a half-cocked oratory can misfire and cause more harm to the cause than good. 
<br />

<br />
A psionicist is a person who calls himself a psionicist. Its that simple. Their attempts at wisdom or power are no different from any number of orders or mystical organisations that have existed for millenia. Therefore, it is useless to attempt to categorize them, while it is more important to discuss the root of the issue at hand.[/quote]

			Instead of going very deep into all this, I did some research to explain what Wicca and Psi is as well as how the two have progressed. Then I gave examples or reasons people practice the two and what their goals may be. Plus, I do have experience with one of the two and put that into my speec as well.

			Personally I find the two as completely different topics having little to nothing to do with new age. You can't put Wicca and Psionics in the same group. Psionics is primarily a scientific branch that focuses on the capabilities of the human mind and it's interactions with energy, and Wicca is a very old religion. The two aren't similar at all. I find the idea of them being grouped together, especially under the title of &quot;New Age&quot;, a term I also dislike, distasteful. It's not that I don't like the idea of a speech on psionics or Wicca, but putting them together would be forming incorrect stereotypes in the minds of your listeners. I would focus on either one or the other, not both. The two do not fit together at all. If you were to have groupings like that, focus on two things like Wicca and Paganism, or Psionics and Quantam Theory(which, because quantam theory can figure into the scientific aspect of psionics, would be easy to tie together.) I have nothing against Wicca, but incorporating psionics with Wicca at all would bring even more hostility against a practice and science already looked at warily by the general religious public.

Again, Psionics !=Wicca.    If you're grouping the two together, you're going to make yourself look like a fool to anyone who knows about the two.

I'm not sure what gave you that impression......  or if you could link to your sources that'd be great...

btw, when was Psionics considered &quot;new age&quot;?    I must have missed that memo...
