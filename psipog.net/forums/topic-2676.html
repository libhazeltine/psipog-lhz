			Most of people became skeptics after actually trying to do pk etc. and after failing a lot they just give up and became skeptic cause everyone thinks they are special.. its only natural and then when u notice someone would be more special than you you get pissed and start writing some stupid stuff to those who can do psi stuff :S i kinda feel sorry for skeptics and kinda hate 'em.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I feel sorry for them that sometimes it takes too long to even make a psi ball, I hate them for their ignorance and trying to spread it to the whole damn world that it does not exist.  Look, if you can't use psi for some unknown reason, then that sucks; try to say that it's fake? then i'll get annoyed.

			these two people think they are so intelligent and are so arrogant it sickens me.  they have this &quot;card predicter&quot; that apparently predicts what card (out of 5) you chose &quot;magically.&quot;  you can post how you think it works when you are done, and they are so confident that they post everyone's-even those who figure it out-replies.  i figured it out and sent them my answer, and they still haven't posted it (that was months ago.)  i guess that they're pissed because a &quot;stupid ignorant psion&quot; figured out the secret to their little trick.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />
