			&quot;Cut&quot; an object, like say a piece of paper, with TK?  All you would have to do is try to move atoms of a very thin strip one way and then try to move the atoms next to it an opposite way.  Or in other words, put alot of energy into the object and focus it into two very thin lines that are close together on the microscopic level and make them move in opposite directions, or vibrate in opposite directions.
<br />
If you have any opinions or ideas on this I would like to hear them.

			It's an interesting concept. But you're talking about <span style="font-style: italic">tearing</span> an object. If you have one half of paper moving one way and another the other way, it tears. It's trying to pull apart the pieces with force. Cutting it in two neat pieces without ragged and uneven edges, like with scissors, you'd need to displace the atoms at the &quot;line&quot; of where you'd want the paper to seperate. But &quot;cutting&quot; this way seems incredibly difficult, at least, more than tearing. With a piece of paper, you'd just need push and pull one way. Even that is difficult, and I'd wager only a very skilled psion would be able to do that. Really neat thought, good topic <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  I'd also like to hear some other thoughts too.

			this is possible, since you are manipulating matter.  the method you stated would accomplish this goal, and it would be tearing like how lasher stated.  this would be difficult nevertheless, and would require great control and finess in sliding, since in a way you are sliding the atoms apart, i believe.  i would like to see someone do this though!
