<br />

<br />
My opinion on each of the poll options, +'s, -'s, and cautions/comments.
<br />

<br />
===============================================
<br />

<br />
0-4 (Before and shortly after consciousness):
<br />

<br />
+'s:
<br />
~ Teaches them while still young
<br />
~ Allows them to grasp the idea in simple terms
<br />
~ Gives toddlers a head-start, rather than later in life
<br />

<br />
-'s: 
<br />
~ It may be too early an age to try
<br />
~ may cause social problems with other kids
<br />
~ kids may get ahead of themselves (imagination/crazy ideas)
<br />
~ kids may try to hurt others (self control is not very high at this age)
<br />

<br />
Comments: Parent's perspective
<br />
~ A good way to avoid social problems is to tell the kids to keep it a secret between you and him/her.
<br />
~ You could try disciplining your child for trying to use it for harmful means (As compared to the website - we strongly discourage psionic attacks, and the like.)
<br />

<br />
===============================================
<br />

<br />
4-8 (The Early Years)
<br />

<br />
+'s:
<br />
~ Children's brains are still learning, allows this to be more hard-set in the child's brain
<br />
~ As people age, it becomes harder for them to learn...I don't have all the details, but I think this is the best time for them to learn
<br />

<br />
-'s:
<br />
~ Children still have low self-control
<br />
~ Possible social problems
<br />
~ Attention span. Speaks for itself.
<br />

<br />
Comments: Parent's perspective
<br />
~ Basically the same as 0-4, except with a slightly different mindset. I think that the 'learning capability' for children this age is at its highest, kind of like a sine wave...and 4-8 is at the peak.
<br />

<br />
===============================================
<br />

<br />
9/10 (...Couldn't think of a better title. But I couldn't group everything from 4-10... 7-10 are hard to classify, as people develop their personalities at different ages, sorry)
<br />

<br />
+'s:
<br />
~ More sense into the child, they may be able to get a better understanding on how it works
<br />
~ Develop their own analogies
<br />
~ Easy to persuade kids this age to do stuff...
<br />

<br />
-'s:
<br />
~ Not as easy to persuade as with younger children
<br />
~ Still low self control (as to the fighting issue)
<br />

<br />
Comments: My perspective
<br />
This was a confusing age for me, when I was classifying it, because the ages between 7 and 10 are when they start developing their personality...I mean, there are 7 year olds SMOKING, so I kinda set this as the bottom age... But I was confused as to what to set the poll too... It really comes down to specifics, but I tried to keep it as general as possible.
<br />

<br />
===============================================
<br />

<br />
11-18 (School/Highschool):
<br />

<br />
+'s:
<br />
~ More knowledge
<br />
~ Would ask more questions of the parent
<br />
~ Easier to grasp concepts, and more complex concepts
<br />

<br />
-'s:
<br />
~ Stubborn nature of teenagers, with puberty and all
<br />
~ Puberty is a weird time for the brain...there were things I was really good at before I hit it, but then had to re-develop after, although I never used them much anyways. 
<br />
~ Very prone to violence, depending on what direction they take in life...
<br />
~ Still, low self control.
<br />
~ Lazy 
<br />

<br />
Comments: My Perspective
<br />
I think this is the worst age to get started with it. This, is, me personally, though.  As I said earlier, puberty does weird things. Plus, if the child takes a 'wrong turn' in life, what the hell is going to happen, is anybody's guess. I think, though, that instilling it in the child BEFORE puberty hits, and for a long time before that (i.e. at least 5 years of experience), the child would have enough knowledge to 'redevelop' psi again, in case they lost their abilities.
<br />

<br />
===============================================
<br />

<br />
19+ (Uni/Coll):
<br />

<br />
+'s
<br />
~ Mature
<br />
~ High knowledge of concepts of life (assuming...)
<br />
~ Would have CHOICE of taking psi
<br />
~ Thus, giving them more of a chance, and an acceptance of it beforehand, rather than 'forcing' it on them.
<br />
~ SELF CONTROL! Finally. (At least...I'm assuming it <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />)
<br />

<br />
-'s
<br />
~ Would not be discouraged from using it for fighting
<br />
~ May develop social problems
<br />
~ May not discover psi
<br />

<br />

<br />
Comments: My perspective
<br />
It's either this, or in the Early Years that I believe is the best. On one hand, the child would be given the advantage of a head-start. On the other hand, the adult would have the CHOICE of taking up psi, but the biggest problem would not be to discover psi at all. I'd rather not take the risk, and go with the child. But, assuming that the adult does know about psi, having the CHOICE of learning it would give somebody so much more incentive to learn...and learn fast =D
<br />

<br />
If there's anything I missed out, tell me.
<br />

<br />
AND REMEMBER: This is MY PERSPECTIVE, the ones that say Parent's perspective just means it's what I think a parent would think about it. You don't have to agree, or disagree with it, after all, I'm not trying to change how you think, but know what you think.

			I would say around 4-8 would be best, but any age would do.
<br />

<br />
so what they might have social problems, if they become a offspring of me, that is destined, now, as for low control, you hit them with a stick or teach them self-dicipline which might require a stick(not beating, just a simple smack) which will contribute to the attention span.

yeah, my views in parenting is a little harsh, but that is mine problem and not yours!

			I was thinking along the lines of strict discipline for the child to only use psi for good, and NEVER for bad.

But, not too strict - or they'll grow up resenting you, using a facade, and learning 'bad tricks' (couldn't think of a better word right now &gt;_&lt;) behind your back, and when they grow up, and away from you, they'd use them.
<br />

<br />
Then again, you could find out just by going into their mind and having a look around XD (assuming you're skilled enough)

You don't druckenly beat them without reason, that usually makes them turn on you, you do it for their own good and with a swift smack, and no more, tell them their mistake and show them that it's can be advoided agian in life.

bah, Knowledge leads to Mental Blocks, no way of spreading around, surpress by one's knowledge. Self-control, that feels like a opinion more then fact, my dad is 40 and he's destructive like Mr. Bean.

			I chose 0-4.  That's when personalities and such begin to develop at their lowest levels, so make it a part of them early.  All of the other ages, with the exception of 4-8, would probably have too many mental blocks for kids to be as good as they really could.

The problem with 4-8 is just the general attention span of children. (or lack thereof)  Sure, it would still probably work, but I still think 0-4 is the best one.
