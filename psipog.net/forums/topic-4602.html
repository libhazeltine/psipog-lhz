			I recently posted a bout a friend of mine who was gonna commit suicide. I posted in the Applied Psionics forum, but the topic was quickly locked.
<br />

<br />
However, I tried to save him anyway, and succeeded, I think.
<br />

<br />
I remembered reading the remote viewing and remote presence articles once, but I just kinda leaned back in my chair and winged it, pretty much just taking it as I go.
<br />

<br />
I can't really describe what I did, but I tried to leave my body if you will, or at least move my perception to where he was so I could stop him. Oh, and I was also focusing the voices of his friends (including my voice) in my head and making them say things like &quot;don't do it&quot;, &quot;don't leave us&quot;, etc. Except I jumbled them up a bit tried to broadcast this overwhelming jumble of voices to himm, all trying to convince him not to do it. And some time into it, I made mine clearer and had it say &quot;Don't leave them. They need you. We all do.&quot; or something like that. Well, back to what else I was doing.
<br />

<br />
I didn't actually leave my body or view some other place. I wound up doing something else. I was... sitting in my chair still, and I could visualise his arm in front of me, holding a knife. It was positioned as if it was my own arm, though my arm was resting on the arm of my chair. I reached up as it approached my own neck with the knife and grabbed his wrist, and I visualised my grip on his wrist, and caused myself to feel psi in my hand to grab it, so the visualisation wouldnt pass through my hand. I grabbed it and pushed it away. I had to keep doing this a few times, because it kept coming back and trying to bring the knife up to my neck. (his neck)
<br />

<br />
When he came back online a few days later, he told me some surprising things. That he had heard my voice, and his friends' voices, but that mine was the strongest. He told me that there was a stranger's voice too, probably the one guy here who decided to help me when the topic got locked. He told me, also, that he felt something grab his arm and pull it away from his neck, because he was going to slit his throat.

			98% of people who say theyre going to commit suicide are just seeking attention, theyre not actually going to commit suicide, its just a manipulation. They know as soon as they say 'im going to commit suicide', you have people flooding in tellling them not to do it, i mean whats a better attention grabber than 'oh im going to kill myself', im not saying you didnt telepathically tell them not to do it, im just enlightening you on the subject.

			Yeah, I doubt he was really gonna do it. But still, some of the stuff he told me, like hearing voices (mine being the loudest) and feeling his arm get pulled a bit... It's either coincidance, or he felt, and recieved, what I attempted, at least in a way.

Well, like, 999% of the time all your do is post skeptical comments. No one is ever going to have undeniable proof, okay?

I haven't really read a post by him that's &quot;skeptical&quot; nevermind &quot;999%&quot; of the time. Healthy skepticism is good, be wary, ALOT of people lie.
<br />
I'm not too sure if this is true, but you're a damn good guy for helping him out.

			Your genuine desire to help someone else sparked the beginnersm ind where you had on expectancy and just wanted to see what was gonna happened.

You channeled your desire to save your friend along with focus and technique and achieved your goal through a psionic means.

JustOwnin,

<br />
How on earth can you prove that?
<br />
Many people say they will commit suicide, but its almost always an attention grabber. In this case, the manipulation worked.

			well a year ago I wanted to commit suicide. I never told anyone because I didnt want people to think I was a freak or something. Obviously I never ended up doing it. The reason I stopped is because I found someone to live for. Unfortunatly (did i spell that right?) she dosn't know that. It's a long story but I will explain in PM if anyone wants. 
<br />

<br />
In other words... I never wanted attention. At times I feel depressed but not near what i felt last year some I'm ok. The only thing that kept me from doing it before I found something to live for was fear of going to Hell.

But what your saying is kind of hard to believe unless your a VERY good psion or a certain someone was at your side...

			Most religions say that if you commit suicide, you will go to hell. I have most reason to believe this is false. I would explain in great detail, but i would be pressing on the No Religion rule.
