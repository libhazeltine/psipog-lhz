			Hi, I'm 13 and new to this forum, but I'm not new to psi related stuff, however until yesterday I hadn't been able (or tried) to get a psi-wheel to move!
<br />

<br />
Although it's about a 1? years since I first heard about PK, I haven't sat down and seriously attempted it for over 6 months.  I haven't really been trying PK, but I've been experimenting with psi-balls and other things.  Thing is, I was browsing the net and I came across this forum, and used your techniques...
<br />

<br />
&lt;Struggling to contain myself!&gt;
<br />

<br />
Thankyou!  Thankyou!  Thankyou!
<br />
To everyone!
<br />

<br />
What have you guys' first experiences been like? 'cause the exhilaration is only just starting to wear off! - and it was only a subtle movement, but I was so excited that I lost concentration.
<br />

<br />
Thankyou again to everyone for your ideas!

			lol, that was exactly my position too.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  The first time I did it was over the f'cking moon! I was just like &quot;ohhhhh yeeeeeaaaaaahhhhhh!&quot; Then I turned around and looked at my psiwheel and it started moving again. hehe. I still love it now.

			About three days to grasp it fully. Before that I was only reading about it and had never actually properly attempted it. But ion those three days I started to have real goes at it. And it worked. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  Now I'm moving onto pencils and bigger things. The &quot;three days&quot; ago was about 2-3 weeks ago now I think. Since then I have been playing around and fully mastering my psiwheel.

			I've been feeling really drained today.  It might be unrelated (I went to sleep really late 'cause I was excited).  Does anyone else feel strange after PK?

			I also felt drained the few first days after I started Telekinesis.
<br />

<br />
Two hypothesis:
<br />

<br />
- Your not trained at it so your exhausting quickly.
<br />

<br />
- Your asking too much (too complex or unnatural associations) to your subconscient, he is confused and it drained you.
<br />

<br />
Maybe a combination of both ideas.
<br />

<br />
I suggest you to listen to signs that your body gives you. Stop before it is too late ( like eating  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> ). 
<br />

<br />
I suggest you not to try to control movement by visualisation. Seems to me that visualisation is very complex to associate with movement for your subconscient. (I suggest a technique in another post. NI give other techniques that seems very sound to me too.)
<br />

<br />

			Thanks, yeh, maybe I'll give it a few days before trying again.  I think I just used my own energy, rather than getting it from somewhere.

			Well, when I first tried, I became so pissed I decided to end it all by levitation...hand went numb, nothing happen.
<br />

<br />
Then one day...one day, during 1st period of school, I said in my head &quot;Why am I getting the feeling that I can slide objects, that it's might be easier.&quot; so, I tried with graphite and it worked, I wasn't excited or anything...actually, I was a bit...unaccomplished or something, so I decided to slide more and more objects..and yet, I still dont' feel accomplished yet...bah, I have too many great goals.

			The first time I spun my psiwheel...I thought something along the lines of 'Hey! I'm <span style="font-weight: bold">NOT</span> crazy!' I also felt REALLY lightweight, like some big stone was cast off my shoulders. I felt like I could almost fly.(Should've tried.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> )
<br />

<br />
Now I can spin it all the time w/o glass, and I've spun it once under a glass.

			I've been feeling the opposite; it feels like I'm under pressure, it's like all the energy has been sucked out of me.  It might just be the weather though.

			I remember the first time i spun the psi wheel i tried with some of the techniques posted on here but had no luck in moving it, then i came across Not_Important's article (<a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html103" target="_blank" class="postlink">art-outline-to-shielding.html103</a>) and what do you know it worked, my reaction was simular to most of your reactions, something along the lines of OMFG I ACTUALLY SPUN IT!!! OOOMMMMGGGG!!!! I CAN DO PK!!! and ever since i have been addicted to improving my psionic skills. 
<br />
I dont think a day gone has gone by without me checking this forum for new ideas.
<br />

<br />
I think the more you practice moving the psi wheel the more energy you have your mind will learn not to get so tierd (if that makes any sense)

			Simply put, I was jumping with joy. I MOVED WOW I MOVED IT WOOOOOOOOOH!!!!!!!!!!
<br />

Unfortunately, I slacked off and no longer do PK <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> . Sucks since I don't really have any plans to go back to it.

			well, today I watched a few videos to see how they made the psi wheel, and seeing people actually move it, even inside a glass jar, made me want to try even more. After i made my psi wheel. I succesfully moved it a few full rotations, after a few failed attempts. This surprised me so much that i forgot what how i was focussing. i kept trying visualizing after that. trying to shed my doubt. but i was still happy i moved it at all. begginers luck i guess. I've been doing a lot of PK under blacklights. Psi balls and such. So far the results have given me some interesting visuals. When i whip up some videos I'll be sure to post em. I made this cool psi wheel with flourescent markers. maybe some art will give my subconcious a boost. Good luck to all. ~and peace as well~ Billy

			Yay!!!
<br />

<br />
I made a psiwheel out of foil, and it spun almost immediately!
<br />

<br />
I can't control it yet, but I now know I can do PK!
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, it's not as exciting as when I first did it <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
It seems to turn without me doing very much (whereas before I would sit staring at it for up to half an hour), is this natural?
