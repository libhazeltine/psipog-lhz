			For a lot of my psi techniques i barrow things from anime series (why? maybe i just watch too much anime. XD) one technique I found that works pretty good is this one thing from the series &quot;fullmetal alchemist&quot;. In this show, there is one person who can make things in the air combust into flames by snaping his fingers (because in the show the spark sets off a chain reaction and hits the desired target in the air). when i do this, i snap my fingers and then imagine fire rising up from the ground engulfing my target. Sometimes when me and my friend are &quot;sparring&quot; with psi, I will use this technique on him (dont worry, im not good yet, so it does almost nothing) and then upon snapping my fingers i can see a kind of cringed expression on his face sometimes. However, i dont know if this is because of the technique or because he already knows whats comeing (I have told him about this technique). SO in a way, this post is kind of a question too: do you think it is affecting him because he knows whats coming, or because it is a good technique?

			1. Paragraphs = Good. They help readers make more sense of your post.

2. Psionic Combat = Bad. It gets people hurt, and it gets topics locked.

3. In my humble (and correct) opinion, any <a href="http://www.animesucks.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">anime</a> is too much <a href="http://www.animesucks.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">anime</a>.

			I highly doubt pyrokinesis can in itself create fire onto something unless your one heck of a PK practicer, are practicing on a flammable liquid, or something close. Creating it out of air is probably impossible unless there was a flammable substance in the air itself, like gas from our stoves, even then you'd have to be very very good at Pyrokinesis.

PSI COMBAT = BAD

now i could see your interest in psionic combat, i will admit i have thought about it,but if you are interested i would do it on inatimate objects and remember to only use it for defense and NEVER offense

			PsyKiller, Sparring falls under combat, and this is NOT a combat forum, so take your mindless posts elsewhere
