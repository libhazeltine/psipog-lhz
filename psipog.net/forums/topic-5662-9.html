Good point. Unfortunately,I don't have much time this week. My English research project is due Friday or Wednesday I think <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />. So I'll only be able to provide tidbits of info. right now to keep you all interested. Here's one:
<br />

<br />
I think that the psionic city could be trying to get parts from other countries to create a TPS machine that amplifies a person's TPS power's immensely. Or it could just multiply all of a person's powers immensely <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />. So I guess other countries would try to protect the parts. Ushima could be like a double agent with a double life: One minute he works for the psionic police (or works as an elite guard; whatever works for the story) to gain info. on plans for stealing parts, assasinating leaders to get to them, etc. and the next he kills key members of the police/military, protects the parts (all while in ninja garb), and stuff like that. The terrain would problably be a city surrounded by a forest (maybe on the coast). I guess the psionic city/country and it's opposing nations could act friendly in person but conspire against each other. 
<br />

<br />
To Jameson:  Tanks and psionics sounds good <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />. Dinosaurs...no <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

			Sorry to burst your bubble GWN, but have you seen the cartoon G.I Joe Sigma Six? Mechs, underground networks, trainning facilities for ninjas, and yes, Ninja who was taught psi abilities.

Shit and fuck!! I'm basically screwed (in a way). The good thing is that it isn't a manga. Yet I must make distinctions between my manga and that similar cartoon. Here are the distinctions:
<br />

<br />
1. Ushima is at no point a head honcho
<br />
2. Ushima will not have a brother (or at least an evil one; he could have one that works beside him and gets killed maybe)
<br />
3. Ushima is not taught by a relative (at least for the most part), he is taught by Master Hatama (the highly gifted ex-elite guard for the dictator)
<br />
4. the underground (network) stuff probaby won't be like the stuff in the G.I. Joe cartoon. It won't be like underground facilities and shit. It'll be more like a gardening shop with a secret bookcase and a little soundproof psionic dojo behind it <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
That's all the stuff I can type up for now. Another day another few sentences! Bye.
<br />

Well I've only seen a couple episodes and the ones I did were based on the ninja guys and their past. They aren't really the MAIN guys for each team but they're the main NINJA's for each team. And their psionic abilities didn't really have that much emphasis on them. Like I saw one read someones mind and they were both doing some pretty crazy stuff that noone else on the show can do. No PK or anything like that. (Although i've only seen couple episodes.) Their story just seems VERRRY similar. Add GWN's list of psionic abilities to the show and take out the other characters and you have Ushima television.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

Can you tell me the similarities of the story? And, would the psionic abilities I listed be fine to use?

No. Because I don't know all of them  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> . I just know they were both trainned at a young age by the same guy(relative), something happened to their parents, then something else tragic happened and they became separated, each moved on and became &quot;top ninja&quot; for the good and bad teams, and now they've met to &quot;settle the score&quot;...I don't want to comment on the powers because I haven't watched enough to know what they do. I just saw a little bit. The use of the psionic abilities though is nothing like what you plan to do. I'm sure yours will be fine.

Good. Next week I'll probably be able to type up a refined and more complete story line for you all. When that time comes I'd like you to tell me if you think I'm in danger of being a copycat of G.I. Joe <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />. 'Till next time.

P.S. What the hell's up with the quotes?! It ain't working right!

			I should have a better description of the storyline sometime this week or by next Monday or tuesday. I thought it over and want Ushima's twin to live. But remember they're both good, it's just that Ushima's brother is a double agent (a good guy under cover in this case).

P.S.  SFG saw and episode of Sigma 6 <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. I want to see it myself and tell you how similar I think my manga would be to it, derrickthone.

			BTW everyone, I have changed my mind about posting the story description here <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. I'm sorry if I have dissapointed anyone (I doubt it though, lol) and I must let this thread go. It has been too much work for me to keep up. I actually was typing up a description yesterday but somehow (must have been involved with ctrl+a) deleted it all at once by accident. I got really pissed off so I decided not to do it again! If anyone is interested in reading my updated version of the description just PM me asking me for it and give me your e-mail address. If you don't want to give out your e-mail address just say so and I could just copy it from a word document and send it via a PM. It's been fun while it lasted, but it's time that I started focusing on what matters. If I ever make a thread related to manga again it would probably just be to post some really good drawings I've done so you can all tell me how well you think I am progressing and whether or not I'd have a chance as a manga artist.
