			hey, i wanted to know, anyone who can or can't do pk, did u tell anyone abt that? especially ur parents? if yes, wht were their reactions and if u didn't, y didn't u tell? one of my friends knows that im practicing, i told him because i tell him everything, we're really good friends, i can move the wheel but i can't controll it that much, i didn't tell my parents yet because if i do, they will say &quot;ok, let me see u move it&quot;, then i won't be able to move it tht much, i just need more practice.

			I didn't tell anyone and I'm certaintly not planning to.Why? Well, because people are very sceptic about everything they don't know and they can be pretty provocative about it unless I prove them otherwise which I'm not going to.I started doing TK and other psychic abilities to learn something new which can also help improving my life and not because I'd want to show off in front of my friends.People think TK is impossible or that only some people posses those 'super powers'.Who am I to argue with the crowd? Let them think whatever they want to, I know it and so do people from TK forums.I rather spend time discussing with them online than explaining TK to people around me.

			I only tell someone if I can prove it on the spot. I've told probably three of my friends and my mom. Each time I made a psi wheel, turned my head away, and made it spin continously in each direction. They were real confused and I gave them a crash theory course. My friend tried it on the spot and made it work (but then again it most likely was my subconcious).

			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
When I first started to learn/practice PK, I did keep it to myself. As time went on, I had gotten better and better. I slowly decided &quot;Hey, I can do this and no one else can, why keep it a secret?&quot; and started to amuse people during class and at work. 
<br />

<br />
Last summer, students personally asked me to start to teach them how to practice PK. I gladly accepted and started to have practice sessions with the members after school. As time went on, more and more people started to come and wanted to learn. 
<br />

<br />
A teacher of mine approached me and asked me about this. After telling him, he asked me &quot;Why don't you start a club?&quot; I replied &quot;Great idea!&quot;. To make a long story short, I started to teach PK in a classroom every Wednesday. I did so for around a year until I needed to stop due to lack of time with school and work. 
<br />

<br />
So no, I did not keep it a secret. I started to teach students willing to learn. I was thinking of beginning teaching again, however I really don?t have the time. Perhaps next year in college, I'll start something similar.   
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />
- JoeT

Hello FuryX721,
<br />

<br />
Yes, many of my students did succeed in learning PK. A lot still practice today. 
<br />

<br />
Take care.

I got a friend of mine into practicing too so i guess most people just accept it, at least the people i know accept it but are still skeptical.

			Once I get to the point where I can move something heavier than a piece of paper, I'll probably show my mom. As it stands I'm hiding it from her, which means I have to hide in my room whenever I want to practice, and sometimes I practice for a very long time.
