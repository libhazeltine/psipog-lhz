			Hey this is just a little theory I've had but really I can't say for sure since I have'nt exactly been successful at pk. Hope this helps somebody. 
<br />

<br />

Well, I've been working in psychokinesis for some time and I've still had zero sucess but later I started to do both normal pk and pk with electricity and it seemed to me that I had less sucess doing normal pk because I did not get that feeling in my head. However once I changed my field that problem seemed to get less although not totally fixed. So my point is that apparently the state or characteristics of your field can impact what type of pk you can do. Based on my observations it seems that the more solid or connected or ordered your field is then the better you can do normal pk, while the more scattered or dynamic your field is then the better you can do pk with electricity. I don't know abou other pk's however because I have'nt tried them. I believe that the reason for this is that elevcticity is a dynamic thing hence a scattered person can work with them better while normal things are more solid hence a more connected ordered person can work with them better.

			Well this might be some good news for you! Electro-Pk is the exact same thing is psychokinesis. There is no such thing as electrokinesis or pyrokinesis, you are just using psychokinesis to manipulate electricity. So you <span style="font-style: italic">are</span> doing pk, but you didn't know it ^_^. 
<br />

<br />
If you still don't understand let me explain. With &quot;pyrokinesis&quot; you can use pk to speed up the molecules in something, which will make it hotter or do the opposite and slow down the molecules in something to make it colder. You are simply using psychokinesis to manipulate different kinds of matter/energy.

			I know, thats what I'm saying, that it might be harder for different people to maniupulate different types of matter.

			If such ideas as psi is particles or photons, I think it'd be difficult to move objects with tiny particles or photons. (without having massive amounts focused on a certian position) Telepathy be easier since it's not really moving matter around, nothing over a gram. Also mental blocks for some.

There are many varibles on why, but what I stated would be more ideal. However, I know some would disagree.
