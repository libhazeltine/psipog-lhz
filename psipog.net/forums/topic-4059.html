			I'm hoping this question doesn't seem too newbish, but regardless I'll carry on and hope for the best. Also, I'm not really sure where to post this... I think of it as being along the lines of shielding and constructs was the closest thing on the forum I could see(IMO anyway). Moving on <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />, I've been studying/practicing with energy off and on for several years now.. can't honestly say why it hasn't been a constant thing. A couple years back I moved into a new apartment. After living in a house a few years I wasn't use to living around so many people. After moving in I could feel so many beings around me and it was slightly over whelming. This feeling only came after I was all moved in and started to relax/open up. Eventually I ended up doing a sort of shielding on my apartment to block out all these other beings I was feeling. It's not so much that I feared them, just that feeling so many people around me all the time was a bit creepy. Anyway, on to my main point. After doing that I've noticed my awareness/sensitivity has declined. Could this be from the shielding that I did? Could it have been more of a mental shielding and not the environment as I intended? Not really being sure, I've tried to dissolve any mental blocks that may exist, but with not much success. Anyone ever experience anything similar or have any suggestions about what I should do about it? 
<br />

<br />
I hope this is appropriate for the forums.. just a little worried since the shielding I did was based mainly on wiccan beliefs and not just energy. Hehe, if this isn't appropriate then please keep flamming to a minamin or issue constructive critisism. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			so you think that because you where shielded so long that your sensitivity has gone down because then you couldnt feel everything auround you and stuff? i dont think it could be because of shielding..maybe, but i think it was because of lack of practice, you even said yourself that you didnt practice a lot...so....practice... <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Well, I didn't stop practicing completely; was still doing shielding and minor energy manipulation. None the less you may be right. Thanks for the input and for taking the time to replay. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Remember that it takes energy to keep a shield up.
<br />

<br />
If you keep up shields that you don't need you'll get quite tiered, maybe.

Just thought I'd note that to you.
