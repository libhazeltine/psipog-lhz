			Daydreaming is fantastic.  It's usually a tool to help drown out the droning of your dreadful teacher but I've also noticed whenever I'm daydreaming of spinning my psiwheel or of that &quot;happy place&quot; everyone has my PK grows enourmously.
<br />

<br />
Lately I've had a lot of trouble moving the wheel,  I'd get very frustrated which would turn into a horrible circle *gasp!*.
<br />

<br />
So on several occasions i've needed to take a break from concentrating, I just relax and daydream.  After a few minutes, I get up and remember my practice.  So still in a &quot;daydreamy&quot; state of mind I look at my psiwheel and with hardly any effort at all I can spin it like crazy.  
<br />

<br />
I don't know what you make of this (remember it's happened numerous times).  But it'd be interesting for everyone to try PK while still in a &quot;daydreamy&quot; state of mind.
<br />

Banana.

<br />
That is all.

			Your mind is like a computer. It needs 100% (or a very large percentage) of its Ram to do PK. When you're thinking of other things, you can't dedicate all that Ram to one action.
<br />

<br />
When you exit a &quot;daydreamy&quot; state of mind, your mind is clear and able to focus everything on one action.
<br />

<br />
People meditate beforehand for this reason.

			PK_11, I'd like to disagree.  I agree that it does require a lot of brain power, but I don't believe that 100% is required.  I've spun the psiwheel and held conversations on AIM at the same time.
<br />

<br />
Daydreaming about spinning the psiwheel may, in fact, be causing your subconcience to actually practice while not actually doing it.  Allow me to explain.
<br />

<br />
In the millitary, fighter pilots train in a flight simulator, which creates a beleivable world where they are pressed up against similar, real life situations.  Perhaps daydreaming is a way for your brain to enter a sort of simulator for telekinesis, and practice without actually doing it.

I agree that is sort of runs a &quot;simulation&quot; in your subconcious that practices.

			Your daydream state is very much like a meditation session: it relaxes and focuses you.

			When PK doesn't work, I try making something else like starting a video game. So I play a bit, enough to get in the game(dream). Then, I stop playing and I return to my practise and it works better.
