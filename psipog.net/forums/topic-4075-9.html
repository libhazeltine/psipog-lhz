I actually know a person with eyes that are two different colours although he was born like that also if you dont like being stared at i wouldnt reccomend it as the person i know hates it when people stare at him for half an hour then ask &quot;are your eyes two different colours?&quot; or &quot; do you have coloured contact lenses in?&quot;

			[quote=&quot;Redifin&quot;]That doesn't explain:
<br />

<br />
1. How it works.
<br />
2. What the side effects are.
<br />
3. If it's scientifically possible.
<br />

<br />
quote]
<br />

<br />

<br />
Ok so -
<br />

<br />
1. You subconcious wills the msucles in the eyes to change the way they reflect. Simple as that. 
<br />

<br />
2. Possible side effects here are permanant colour disfiguration.
<br />

<br />
3. Eye colour is determined through two things Pigmentation and muscles. Thats why you will notice at certain times of your life or day your eyes will be a different shade or what ever. This is because the muscles have relaxed or tightened changing the amount of light that goes through to your eyes to the retina then off to the brain. Bottom line here is that the colour is a result of mucles positioning themselves in such a way it reflects light. It happens naturally and thus, with practice you can will it.

			Gee I have not been in PsiPog lately, anyways I tried this about 2 months ago after I asked PazarX about it.
<br />

<br />
3 weeks passed when I first started it with the method(on page 1)
<br />
I was aiming for a gray-ish color, my usual brown eyes had a noticable
<br />
lighter color then after. Here comes the distractions, so I was not able
<br />
to keep up my usuall &quot;eye color-changing&quot; routine due to lazyness, school, and other things that caught up my attention....
<br />

<br />
A week passed just after I had stoped my routine, and my eyes turned back to it's original darker brown color.
<br />

<br />
Oh well, I need to try again I guess maybe tonight or tommorow...
<br />
... btw I had not encountered any of the stated side-effects. 
<br />

<br />
Nothing much to say, just wanna share it <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			this may be a bit off subjuct but it is about the eyes. i think one can change the colore of ones eyes with enough will and time but i was wondering if one could alter the retina. if you could alter the eye to pick up uv or even infared, that would be cool and useful.

I think you need to consider what is normally in the realm of human ability.  They can have different colour eyes.  They <span style="font-style: italic">can't</span> see UV or IR.  What you can perhaps do is will your eyes to work better than 20/20, but that is entirely speculation on my part.

			Well, I've been giving it a try. 
<br />

<br />
Slight aching of the eyes, but no eyesight compromises yet.
<br />

<br />
I'm going to keep trying. 
<br />
I want purple/violet irises, because naturally, this shade is extremely rare.
<br />

<br />
This shade of purple - Note that it isn't an extremely bright shade.
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://img108.imageshack.us/img108/1882/blackeyepurpleda7ld2.jpg" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />
If it gets too much, I'm going to turn back and go for blue eyes instead.
<br />

<br />
For those who are curious, mine are currently this colour:
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://img68.imageshack.us/img68/4076/asfdsadfasfasdfadsfdt5.png" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />
I know, the quality isn't great. But you get at least a vague idea as to what my current eye colour is. Which is better then nothing.

<br />

Lizndax, do you really think that you can improve your natural sight with psionics? If so, do you have any clue as to how? I'm getting more short-sighted each day with my constant use of computer, and the idea to get my vision better sounds really sweet. Do you think that's possible? How would you do it?

			I'm trying my own style and hoping for results, at first I wanted to make my eyes white. But then I thought &quot;hey why not rainbow color!?&quot; because I couldnt choose one. Does anything think rainbow color is just plain......gay? Should I go with white? When I first aim for white my eyes felt funny.
