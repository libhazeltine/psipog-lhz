			we are all here because we want to better ourself, show off to friends, or feel the sense of power.  most are a combination of the three.  but we are just throwing theories around and trying things out.  we aren't doing anything note worthy.  no scientist would dare touch this topic because he would be ridiculed for his seemingly pointless attempts at something that barely anyone believes.  because of this, there is a lot of mystery as to where this all comes from.  there aren't many sources for research.  i do a google search, and all i come up with is some old lady's website claiming she can see into the future.  and as a result of all of this, we aren't making many strides towards what we want to achieve.  what do you think?  i don't feel that we are getting anywhere with this forum, and that we need some credible and informative sources to truly excel in psionics.

			If you wanna do something go for it, but this sight wasn't created for a bettering of society, or proving to society, or anything of that sort.  It's just a place to learn psionics.

Make a new forum for what your proposing, I'll be there.

			No, there are some scientists that would touch this, they are classified as psuedo-scientists. However, I think psionics is a bit more accepted than the past since the daily advances of technology and science. Either way, what can this site do? Not everyone in the forums are geniuses.

			You may not be running in the proper circles for finding 'real' scientists studying psionics.
<br />

<br />
At the Psionic Social Club, we have a Research Library that references studies being done.  We have a few of the 'real' studies regarding psionics.  The direct link is <a href="http://www.psc-online.org/sections/view.php?id=8" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.psc-online.org/sections/view.php?id=8</a>.

Have fun,
