i read in magazin that man from family called el krety say he and his family have strong tk that he and his family can move the pyramid from its place  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> and what make me get shock that i find people out side egypt know that story and here in egypt they use him in archoelogy&lt;&lt;(i dont know how to write it <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />) . and he say he and his family learned that power and its method to do it from his big grandfather .
<br />

<br />
but why here in egypt they did not ask him to teach them or interview him and talk about that or do any researches on him or even any other country invite him to thier country and try to learn from him ?
<br />

<br />
edit : maybe the pharaohs themselves use tk to build the pyramid

While I could believe he may be able to move a single brick form the pyramid, I doubt he could move an entire pyramid.

Well, the mindset of the majority of the world is that PK simply doesn't exist and it's all a hoax. Of those that don't think it's a hoax, a good dela of them would rather just not think about it because it opens scary new possibilities in their world - possibilities that they don't understand and can't control.
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if someone HAD asked him to teach them but due to any number of factors, it just wasn't possible. Who knows, maybe he has students (at least his family) that he does teach.

No, the pyramids were built through much more mundane channels and at the cost of many, many lives. And even if the Pharoahs were the living gods they were touted as, why would they waste the effort when they could ust order thousands of people around? (from their perspective anyway).

			i heard about a guy in the states that claimed he figured out how they were made.  He ordered big marble blocks and with out equipment move them into different formation and on top of each other.  He said it had somehting to do whet magnetic grids.  But he didn't tell anyone, and died.  Idk i heard that from my friends so it maybe all bull.
<br />

<br />
I relaly have no idea how they were made.  I'm not even sure what the mundane ways were.

He was real. He knew. Man was not yet ready for his secrets, which is why he took them to his grave.

Do the research yourself, there are some good links, and some bad links. I've read most of em already. This is one of the better ones for general info, I would say:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/coralcastle.html" target="_blank">http://www.crystalinks.com/coralcastle.html</a>
<br />

<br />
There are others with different information.

<br />
What Edward Leedskalnin <span style="font-style: italic">would</span> leak of his secrets, was that the Electromagnetic Grid that covers the Earth was the key to anti-gravity. AKA Psychokinesis/Telekinesis.
<br />

<br />
Here's another google link for information and diagrams of the magnetic grid:
