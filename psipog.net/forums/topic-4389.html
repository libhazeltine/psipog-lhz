			I'm not sure if this belongs here but I don't see where else it would so...here it is:
<br />

<br />
I've just recently started trying to get an OBE. I started about a month and a half ago. I think after about two weeks (not that successful, heh)
<br />
I noticed that these weird '...............' (in other words I don't have a word for it right now) started to occur to me. They are kind of like:
<br />

<br />
- a very quick sensation
<br />
- not really a feeling
<br />
- not really an emotion
<br />

<br />
I'll call it sensations for now, but just know it isn't really like that. Basically they pop up at random intervals. All of them have this kind of 'nostalgic' (but not really, again, hard to explain) kind of feel to them, like I've had this 'sensation' before. They are also very sickening. Not like perverted or OH MY GOD ITS A BLOODY HAND sickening, just like---you want to kind of get away from it but you aren't really in a hurry, you just want to see what it is first even though it is so gross. 
<br />

<br />
The sensations occur for about 3-4 seconds, the longest one I've ever had was approximately 7 seconds. 
<br />

<br />
These are some of the times where they've occured. If you look you'll notice they are absolutely random (at least as far as I can tell)
<br />

<br />
- When I was taking a drink of water
<br />
- Combing my hair
<br />
- Doing math
<br />
- Looking out the window at a cloud
<br />
- Sitting in a car listening not really listening to a conversation
<br />

<br />
Anyways, the idea is that I really want them to stop. &lt;_&lt; They aren't very comfortable to have and they're just absolutely annoying. If anyone knows what they are, could they please tell me? It is quite distributing mainly because I don't know what they are and they keep OCCURING. Makes me sad. :/ Any help is appreciated. I've stopped trying to get an OBE but they still are continuing. I don't really know if the two are connected or not but I'm just putting it here as a piece of information.
<br />

<br />
Note: I haven't been able to identify what the 'sensations' actually ARE. They aren't like anger, fear, jealousy, love, etc. It is just identifiable. Also sometimes I feel suffocated (not like hand to neck) but like just I want to get away because I'm being choked by something that FEELS like an emotion but it isn't identifiable.

 I've never heard of this before.. You could always try putting up a shield, in case it's someone attacking you..

			those activities seem to be associated with the left hemisphere of the brain, or frontal lobe (anyone can correct me if i'm wrong).  that could have something to do with it.
<br />

<br />
question:  do these &quot;occurances&quot; seem, or feel like a dream?  does it feel like you are dreaming at all?  i get intense instances from time to time, but for the most part, i always feel like i'm dreaming, or that life is fake, like a movie.  if this is simmilar to what you are feeling, look up the work nihilistic, or nihilism; the<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic"> psychological term</span></span> that deals with delusions, not the literal term.  that could help a bit.

			I get the exact same feeling.
<br />

<br />
What I feel is exactly what you said its like. Do you feel like somethings wrong? You entire world seems to change in an instant when in reality..it doesn't. Its a slightly dizzy feeling but at the same time..its not. And you can't shake it off either, you have to wait for it to go away. I've only recently gotten this too. And its funny that you mention the feeling you something grabbing your throat 'cause that JUST started happening to me last night.
<br />

<br />
In my opinion, either its strong empathy telling you something is very wrong somewhere, or some form of energy is &quot;attacking&quot; you.
