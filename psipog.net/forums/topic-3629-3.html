I would contend that neither the subconscious or conscious mind are fully physically only partially so.  Both expresses natural drives and impulses which are directly recieved from the body but there is also the added elements which are seen as &quot;what makes us human&quot; as opposed to primal beasts.  The source of such abstract concepts is up for debate and has yet to be found.  We know it correlates with the fact our brainwaves are incredibly ordered and coherent but we don't know the mechanism behind this coherence.  It may be physical or it may not be, we'll see once the Neuron Dogma has undergone the changes it's undergoing now (which could take years <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />).

			To know what is the true difference from humans and animals even on that level would require of knowing of what is &quot;human&quot;. Which I believe none of us can answer that. But some of it I do agree with you.
<br />

<br />
I don't think a solid dimensional level of that can ever be reach, everything is normaly connected one way or after even if it small. Somethng about the whole thing seems to fishy to me to be true, So I'm going to think over it and watch this discussion move on some more.

			Hi Dan, for something that can't be perceive, you can read my post on dark matter thread.
<br />

<br />
Machines results are also flawed picture of a reality. Dosen't mean that they are not usefull. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: indigo">&quot;And can't a subjective thing see what something is really like? I think it can.&quot; </span>
<br />

<br />
Again, very presumptuous. A subjective approach allows a subjective results. The &quot;thing&quot; you study will be really like the way you study it, it will not &quot;look&quot; like it really is.  
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: indigo">&quot; What in reality can't be categorized, studied, measured, etc?&quot;</span>
<br />

<br />
Nothing else of what you can think of. But a category is already a human choice and it will give only a perspective view. 
<br />

Well, that's the easy way of living.  Unfortunately most people do live in such ruts of reaction and without true spontaneous action.  But just because people are lazy and are secure in their mediocre existences doesn't mean all people are that same way.  Nor are those mediocre people incapable of true spontenaity.  Of course proving or disproving your point has a catch because you assume &quot;Well, some stimulus MUST have caused that action.&quot;  and then look for reasons to back up that assumption.  You'll always be able to find reasons for something but whether or not that's the driving force behind every single decision you analyze is hardly something that can be verified.  So it seems such a point can only be brought to a stalemate by logic, only experience can show the difference.

			It doesn't have to be an external stimulus.  It could be an internal stiumuls.  Hell, the stimulus could even be another thought!

I tend to find that instinct comes from emotional valures of the subject themselfs that past on from there parents. I also think emotions comes from a deeper root of logical processing. All rooted down to the main element, memory.
<br />

<br />
The human brain is much larger then most animals and it seems that the only reason why we have surpior intellect is memory. Of cource thats not close of what is needed.

I'll just leave this information unanswerd, lol
