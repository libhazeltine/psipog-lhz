			Hmm, I can only think of one kinda funny time. My friend usually has a fire during the summer or winter, when ever. Oh, these fires are camp out, smoke out, drinking get togethers. People sit and smoke and just hang around... by the way... it's bad. My friends hot boxed the car I was in with none other then weed. The smoke was so thick I couldn't see but I didn't want to get high because I can't use psionics for a while after that then and I couldn't get out because I would've upset people. I decided to make a force bubble and filter out the THC from the oxygen (umm not sure,... I just wanted to breathe in freash air) so I wouldn't get high. After I walked out of the car about an hr or two later my friends asked me if I was stoned or got anything. *I should've been burnt considering I don't usually do it*. I was completely fine and they wouldn't stop asking me. For a week or two they would ask me, wow you really didn't get anything off that? And I'm very happy I didn't  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> . Bad story not funny but useful pk. Oh and I blocked the smoke from the fire so it wouldn't get in my face.

<br />

<br />
Back in my college days, I worked part-time in this office where I basically helped out the secretaries there.  Usually they didn't have any work for me, so I would sit alone in the copier room.  I used that time to practice PK.
<br />

<br />
So one day, I had like a 4 hour shift, and practiced PK the entire time... playing with the pinwheel, and thinking about how it could work, and what's going on.  Finally my shift was over, and I went downstairs to go to my next class.  I was walking towards the door, when I thought, &quot;Screw the pinwheel, I should just try moving big things!&quot;  Seeing the door ahead of me, I walked up to it while focusing on opening the door.  To my surprise, the door actually opened!  For about an entire second I was freaking out... until I realized that it was a motion sensor door <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.

But Sean, you <span style="font-style: italic">did</span> do PK!!!!  PK is mind over matter.  You used your mind to move your body (matter) and therefore, in effect, the door opened.  YAY SEAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			During 9th grade geometry my friend Ashley, who sat behind me, had her pencil half on her desk and half off. She was trying to move it and so I watched her. Then, I decided to try and move it too. It turned and she like slammed her hand down on it and we look at each other kind of laughing. Then, we did it again, but this time it spun towards her and it fell off the desk.
