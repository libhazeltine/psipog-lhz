   Okay, so you believe that Indigos are normal people with an Indigo aura, right? Then why are you calling yourself an Indigo person? Just because your aura is Indigo? If you're going to call yourself an Indigo person and not use the term then you're just going to cause confusion. EVEN IF you put down what you consider an Indigo person to be.

   There is no &quot;individual realities&quot; or any of that trash. Reality is reality regardless of how you see it. Stop thinking otherwise. If that was true you'd never have been born in my reality. I'd be god. If you were born I'd have you killed in a freak car accident caused by a comet colliding with Earth and sending it off course into the moon. Unfortunately reality doesn't work like that.

   Sorry, I forgot to add the quotes. I didn't mean problems, but I'm too lazy to find the proper word to use.
<br />

<br />
   Anyway, I sort of know how autism works. I'm autistic myself. What parts of the brain do some/most autistic not have that requires compensation? Oh, it needs to be something that is actually used by another part of the brain. Not all Autistic people are as smart or smarter than everyone else by the way. Some are retarded.

looks like psipog needs to get a new moderator lol... but to answer your insults and ignorance, i shall say... im not ashamed of having indigo in my aura... so why wouldnt i tell you that OTHER PEOPLE consider me to be an &quot;indigo child&quot;?
<br />

<br />
ok
<br />

<br />
as for creating a device... well sure, why not, do you have the money to pay me to create it for the laziness of people that dont want to develope the ability? i could get the information needed to do so, as i already have information for a different device we will need later in the future.
<br />

<br />
furthermore
<br />

<br />
if you dont believe in multiple realities, then why is yours defective according to the whole picture, you only see a pixel at a time, you dont look at the whole picture... so if you go by your theory, then what you think is reality is missing 85% of what is in reality
<br />

<br />
its something along the lines of the sailing of columbus... the indians didnt see the huge ship... didnt see it at all even standing right next to it... it took weeks of the old wise man of the tribe to study the contours in the water to finally be able to see the boat.... and the rest of the indians had faith in what the wise man said and they too seen... so... if they werent able to see in thier reality, but columbus was on the ship in his reality... whos reality what real?
<br />

<br />
the reason the indians did not see it is because they had nothing to reference that was on such a grand scale... , they saw the lights from the lanterns, and heard the voices of the people on board... but nothing else.
<br />

<br />
but anyhow... im done talking in circles and getting the meaning of what i said wrapped around into nonsense when you know precisely what i was talking about... or maybe you dont, i dont know... but it seems you are trying to aggrivate me which will be impossible to do <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
so now, 4hours after i got out out of college, im going to bed, when i wake up, ill be expecting more comments from you daniel... twist the meaning of what i say... think id just ignore it though since i have more fun talking in circles with a bible thumper.
<br />

infinate peace to you, as you need it

   Why does PsiPog need another mod? Is that a personal insult or something? By the way, I don't think I said having an indigo aura is bad. Maybe I did and I forgot. I doubt it though. I don't believe in auras. Anyway, if you hate the term so much why label yourself as one? I think you did that.

			i think auras may exist.. well for me it's a possiblity.. but i never tried aura vison or whatever that has anything to do with it.. i heard in our lesson about the EMS (electromagnetic spectrum) that energies have certain colors depending on the frequency that it's producing.. well dunno if i got that right.. but that's how i remember it..

I've said it before, you CANNOT love everything! It's not possible, if you love everything you need to stop suppressing your real feelings, trust me, I used to try so hard to love everyone and everything, and it put me through hell, it's not humanly possible OR beneficial to love everything, I'm still recovering from all the emotions I repressed, trust me, it can't be done, and the more you try the more you'll suffer, it will cause health problems including problems with your mind. I used to have big problems with my mind, guess when they started to heal? about the same time I stopped repressing my negative emotions. negative emotions are just as valid and just as much a part of being human as positive ones, so next time someone smacks you on the cheek, smash him on the other. Look at some porn, get laid, and beat your enemies to a friggin pulp, trust me, you'll feel much better afterward.

			The first thing that crossed my mind when I read the wikipedia article on this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_children" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_children</a> (is: HEY! That really describes me...

we have pure love for ALL beings.
<br />
::<span style="font-weight: bold">It seems this way with almost all children because children haven't developed the &quot;OH FUCK THAT&quot; additude, they are willing to try anything once... </span>
<br />
They seem antisocial unless they are with their own kind. If there are no others of like consciousness around them, they often turn inward, feeling like no other human understands them. School is often extremely difficult for them socially. 
<br />
::<span style="font-weight: bold">Most kids only are friendly with their 'friends'.... it makes sense. School is never EASY for any childe socially... thats one of the main things they make kids go to school is to show them how to &quot;Get along&quot; because they don't instinctively know how.</span>

Seriously people, before going &quot;ZOMG IMA INDIGO CHILD!!1one&quot; look at it logically and it can be explained with simple logic. And if you think your child is an 'indigo child', don't use this as an excuse for bad behaviour. Its your *DUTY* to teach your kids manners and right from wrong. If a *doctor*, who went to medical school and studied these disorders as a major says that your child most likely has ADHD or ADD or whatever else, he has a better chance of being right then you or an online article on wikipidia.

			Edge, children aren't as &quot;innocent&quot; as everyone thinks. Little kids are usually the ones that make fun of people the most, and they can be quite mean. Probably because they haven't entirely been taught so-called &quot;good and evil&quot;, but they don't have &quot;pure love for all beings&quot;

			Hey you guys. I'm an indigo child too.
<br />
I can.... see things.... strange things. I can see grandma even though nobody else can. I can see the pain of the entire world. I can see what you're thinking too.
<br />

Also, one time when daddy was hitting mommy, I got so mad his head exploded. He dosen't hit mommy anymore.

Again, I do not believe in auras- nor Indigo Children. Children/adolescents who develop psionic abilities have a hard time, that I understand. I spent all of middle school developing empathic abilities and having no idea what was going on. Does that mean I had it any harder or that I deserve any kind of special privilege? No. Society is based on the fact that people adapt to function in that society. People or children with psychic abilities, no matter how strong, are in no way exempt from having to function in society. If parents coddle children with abilities, or believe that they are 'extra special' and 'destined to change the world', all we will end up with is a bunch of jerky little telepaths that everyone just wants to kill. I've baby sat bratty kids, I can't imagine how much worse it would get if the parents were telling them they were fated by god and the color of their aura to change the universe. Everyone has qualities that make them unique. None of these qualities makes you exempt from needing to function in society. Deal with your problems and stop trying to explain them away with elaborate terms like 'Indigo Children'.

			i am new here but im not a newb especially to this topic of discussion.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
i too dislike the term but i dont know how else to describe myself other than indigo. this is what i beleive is why he called himself an indigo ,daniel H.
<br />

<br />

<br />
the doctor diagnosed me with adhd when i was a kid but never medicated me, because he is an old school doctor who didnt beleive in turning kids into zombies without first allowing them to try to be a real kid first.
<br />

<br />
im glad i was allowed to grow up &quot;RX&quot; free because i now look back and can see all of the other kids that were part of the &quot;RX Factor&quot; and im glad i wasnt.  drugs in any form are not good for you illeagal over the counter or even prescribed. but people would rather take a pill and fix everything rather than condition the mind to not have these problems.
<br />

<br />
White raven no disrespect but i too have love for every living being on this planet. not just because im what i am but because im also native american. and you can have love for everything within this world but yet hate some things. just because you hate somthing doesnt mean you cant have universal love for it. im sure you're familiar with the way monks love all living things thats much like what we or at least how i feel. im not sure if that makes any sense but i did my best.
<br />

<br />
no matter what people arent going to beleive if they dont want to. 
<br />

<br />
whether its people saying: criss angel is just an illusionist (i admit hes an illusionist but why be so hypocritical if we can do psi why cant he?),  that psi isnt real, that auras arent real, oh hey maybe even that souls arent real, that chakras arent real, or that god isnt real.
<br />

<br />
i mean at one point somone had to challenge the thinking that the world was flat or that our planet wasnt the only one in the galaxie or that our galaxie isnt the only one out there.
<br />

<br />
what im sayin is dont doubt the possibility for anything because you could be proven wrong tomorrow.

			Not to be presumptious and I may be completely wrong--I am only human--but these claims of &quot;Love for all beings&quot; and &quot;unconditional love&quot; strike the wrong chord with me.
<br />

<br />
Not to be disrespectful, but I found that some of these posts written by those claiming this type of love contain overtones of things not very loving at all.  For example: impatience, presumptious, slightly haughty attitude, lack of openness toward others...
<br />

<br />
I really don't want to quote here, but if your love is so pure what's with the sarcasm, angry, impatience, etc?

1).  You would have to be very highly evolved when coming onto this earth and having &quot;love for everything,&quot; especially maintaining it through your teeange years.  (Based on the jargon you're using, such as &quot;newb,&quot; I'm assuming you're a teenager.)  This might be true, in which case I am impressed.  The problem I have is this native american business.  Heritage doesn't entitle you to make claims about having love for all beings, at least in my opinion.  I could be wrong, but hey.
<br />

<br />
2).  Oh please.  You can't love and hate something at the same time.  Love for all things is so pure, so intense, so innocent that there is no reason to hate anything!
<br />

<br />
Once again, I could very well be wrong.
<br />

<br />
And that's all I'm going to say.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			like i said i was trying my best to explain it. for me the only way i could possibly describe what im trying to is much like what ive already said its like coming to this earth with already a monkish feeling twords all living things to have understanding and to be able to be passive with anger.
<br />

<br />
 for example ive been blasted in the head with a fist and i turned and i looked at him and laughed i wasnt mad it was more of a feeling of sadness that somone would have such feelings tword me this has happend to me twice i was blind sided both times and when i turned and just stared at them they instantly knew that i was ready to throw down if need be but never was mad and never did have to fight. i didnt hate either of them for what they did mostly because i thought it was funny.
<br />

<br />
another example I was about 13 when my mom remarried and when she did she remarried a very abbusive guy. and yea i was abused by him and every time i would just smile at him or laugh. alot of the time that drove him crazy because he wantto make me mad. ive been mad at him before but i dont hate him for the things he's done to me. i just feel sadness that a man as full of energy and love as he was would act this way behind closed doors.
<br />

<br />
im not sure if this explains or makes things worse but this is my personal experience.
<br />

<br />
for your second question if your not native american you just wouldnt understand. but i will try to explain. its mostly an inner feeling or &quot;connection&quot; to the earth. but its hard to explain without bringing religion into it and i know thats not allowed. but ill sum it up in one phrase and i hope that is alright with the moderators. &quot;native americans were put on this planet to take care of (protect) all living things on this planet.&quot; we havnt failed, its just been refused. 
<br />

<br />
im sorry if ive broken forum rules but i was simply answering a question.
<br />

<br />
im not really a teen im 20 years old, close enough though huh?
