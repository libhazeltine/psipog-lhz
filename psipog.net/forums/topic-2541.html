			Can Peebrain or someone with the priviliges, create a forum section dedicated to files related to psipog-ish-topics (files as in: Videos, pictures, flash presentations, online books about psi, and stuff?)
<br />

<br />
And make it so only members with 100 posts or more (or some post minimum) can enter that section? That would get a lot more members. And a lot more publicity to the psipoggers that create their own vids

			The only problem I can see with that is that as well as increasing publicity and enthuesim about posting, it could also increase the tendency to create short, small posts, as well as random &quot;bumps&quot; by noobs, just so they can get to that minimum.

			Good point. Maybe you shouldn't be able to see your amount of posts. But that would bug the hell out of me.

			Also, if that section contains videos, wouldn't all the noobs and others need all the inspiration and confidence lifting they can get? It wouldn't be fair to say to them that they need to get &quot;x&quot; minmum of posts to see the stuff they really want and need to see. I can see that they will be so anxious about seeing them that they will practice to get results to see for themselves, but it would seem like we are trying to cover something up. 
<br />

<br />
Maybe creating a system that anyone who reaches 100 posts has to make a video or them doing something. For example, some one gets 100 posts, they have to make a video to <span style="font-style: italic">show</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">prove</span> that they have been progressing and not just lingering on the forums to just have a place to talk to people. It's a simple system, no programming needed. And then, afterwards, they make a video for every 100 posts. Or possibly 50.So its a regualr thing. It would be like giving something to help the community. A debt that is owed to psipog. Simply because psipog provides this priceless info, and people must use it rather than using just the forums and effectivly cheating psipog. Maybe a bit of programming could be used that suspends any posts they do make until they make a video. e.g. they cant make any more posts/post count until they make a video at 100 posts. If they post, the post count will still be 100, not 101, or 102. Personally, I think this could actually work.

			However, alot of people would not be very good with pk, and hence, would be unable, or simply by technical problems, what if they are without a camera? I know that a majority of people I know, have not got webcams, or any way of filming such a thing. I think that, in an elitist sortta view, yes, its a good idea, and I could comply, but I don't think we need to send the message that if you can't do it, you're no good, or even, &quot;If you don't have a webcam you're no good.&quot; Sorry to be so critical, but, thats just cold to tell people they must use the information in one way, and not however they choose, it makes this site much more like a club than a library, and I think it should be like the latter.

			hmmm... yeah I understand the problem with the camera. I myself, don't have a webcam or video cam. But the whole point of it is to progress. If you suck at pk, well, you should practice so that you can show off your skills. I can't wait till I can make videos. I don't mind you being critical, but I do think that some people need to be doing rather than talking. Although, Apollo has loads of posts and videos. I don't see so much as proving but showing what they can do becasue they have tried.
<br />

<br />
 If someone can't make a video, then they can be excused, or if they can't do anything like pk or psiballs, then they can too. But it creates targets for people. It's a way of tracking progress you have made. This could even be an optional thing, not as it is now, but rather a video making group of people that do it on a regular basis. Either way it can encourage new member to practice. 
<br />

<br />
Or maybe the posts count can be upped to 150 or something as to not push or enforce the idea. btw, I didn't mean it in that way of &quot;pushing&quot; people to make videos, just as an idea to help people do rather than think about doing it.

			right now, a lot of the videos are either located on the main site (under media) or at <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=2299" target="_blank" class="postlink">THIS THREAD</a>.  Why would only people with more than 100 posts be able to access it?  Psipog's goal is to let everyone learn if they are interested.  That is why membership is free and one does not even have to make a membership to learn all the stuff.
