There was also an experiment done in china (look back about 10-20 pages in the psychokinesis forum for a thread called &quot;teleportation&quot;) where multiple children managed to teleport objects and living things (flies) through cups and other things.
<br />

But yeah. The matrix quote says it all

			Yeah, Wingmakers may be a fluffball site in itself, but as all its content is pirated and plagiarized (sp?) from solid sites (I heard there was even a PsiPog article on there), the intel should be pretty good.

			yes, there is an article about shielding on wingmakers called common and not so common shields. it's from pog. I think it's peebrain's article.
<br />

<br />
i think the teleporting article is legimate and, if I ever get a lot more extra time, I will try it every morning for a week or two and see if I get any results.

			Well this is certainly relevant so I figure I should post it.  It's a short story or anecdote of recent events.
<br />

<br />
So let me start by saying that my dad has just had serious knee surgery and so moving around takes considerable effort since he requires crutches to get around.  This is especially true for when he has to go up stairs and so he has a special cane to help him go up the stairs while he's recovering.  Now my father was downstairs, watching a movie when he had to go to the bathroom (which is upstairs).
<br />

<br />
So he is in the bathroom then he notices something.  Neither the cane nor the crutches are upstairs and he can't remember himself actually GOING up the stairs.  Quite a feat when doing so without any aid would have been terribly painful and tiring.
<br />

<br />
He knows that I've teleported so naturally, his response to all this was to phone me up and tell me about his little experience lol.

			I've had experiences with ...I'm not sure I'd call it teleporting but I definitly could say I went somewhere else in space and time.
<br />
Basically it feels like going through some timewarp.
<br />
I'll be talking to someone than instantly i'm somewhere else in space and time.
<br />
Then I ask myself...how long was i gone for (the experience only lasts a split second but seems like quite some period of time I had just witnessed)
<br />
I snap back into &quot;reality&quot; asking myself WTF how long was I gone for only to realize the person is in the same word of the same sentence as when I left.
<br />
Anyone else had this?

Serious knee surgery, eh?  Could he possibly be taking medication?  Painkillers perhaps?  Something to make his memory a little fuzzy?
<br />

<br />
Assuming he teleported without first addressing the more logical, pertinent facts is madness.

Uh, yeah, that's called &quot;spacing out&quot; and everyone does it.
<br />

<br />
I once drove all the way from home to school (a 15 minute drive), and when I got to school I couldn't for the life of me remember any of the drive. I quite literally got into my car at home, turned it on, drove a couple of feet, parked my car at school, got out, and said &quot;huh?!?&quot;.
<br />

<br />
It's completely natural and has little to nothing to do with psionics.

			I disagree.
<br />

<br />
When this happens.....No time passes....yet I just witnessed an entire scenario flash in front of my eyes. Clearly in your scenario time did pass.
<br />
Also there is a precognitive behaviour to the sudden timewarps,
<br />
Its like going through time being somewhere else then coming back to the exact same moment in time you left.  
<br />
My theory is I quantum leaped mind states from beta ( fastest oscillation rate) 
<br />
to delta (,lowest frequency range) and  while in delta your mind is moving so slowwww that you could capture large amounts of time in literally no time.
<br />

<br />
thats just me though.
