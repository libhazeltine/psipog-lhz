			Hay guys  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  ,

Do you think that doing emapthy would influence our behaviour?I mean if we do a lot of this empathy-stuff,could that influence our mind and change our behaviour into a bad one ?Also,does doing telepathy result in cases like dual personality or multiple personality (as explained in psychology) ?

			Hey,
<br />

<br />
I think Empathy brings great dangers. I mean, with empathy you can feel how another person feels. If the feelings of the person aren't very nice, then it won't feel nice feeling them yourself. It might be too, when you don't understand the feelings of other persons, that you become unsure or make false interpretations and therefore act in a way that can be very bad in specific situations. Just don't try too hard and take it slow and do what makes sense to you. That would be my advice. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I find that when I don't pay attention to my empathy I start mindlessly absorbing the feelings of others. It's not helpful, but I wouldn't call it dangerous.

			I know what you mean fieldmouse. But what i mean is something different. It's like getting stuck in the feeling of others and forgetting the own feelings. Still it's hard to do that but it can happen.

			If you can deal with your own emotions effectively and aren't constantly looking for ways to &quot;vent&quot; and don't dwell in one headspace for too long, then others' emotions will have a similiarly minimal effect on you.  Work on yourself then open yourself up to the issues and feelings of others.

			Others emotions are no problem for me(I have a lot of shields) but even without shields they don't bother me much..If they do I can always just vent it through music so I don't consider it dangerous...

			Other emotions are no problem for me either, but if you want to understand the emotions better you have to get deeper into them. And that can be hard.

			there are some risks involved with empathy. crowded malls are one. you begin to be aware of everyone around you. i call it &quot;opening your eyes again&quot; (thanks terry pratchet for this good analogy) it's really freaky and if you don't learn to shield, you can be really anxious, nervous, or scared in a large sense.

However, my experience with empathy, is that the feeling is not dangerous at all, because even though you feel someones emotion, lets say misery, hate, disturbance, sadness etc, somehow it does not feel as if it is your own emotion, simply because it is not. Another very important point, is that these people with these emotions, suffer from it on a long term, while you just experience that specific emotion as if it is an object of observation, and afterwards, it is gone. You do not remain miserable about it. If you let the emotion come, and go again, then it is just an object of observation. the emotion is not coming from something you experienced or deal with. So I would say no it is not dangerous. However, you should at least have some self-knowledge as Lightbringer said, so you avoid inner confusion. You should always have a clear mind and be able to go back to your own &quot;Self&quot; again, your centre of focus.
