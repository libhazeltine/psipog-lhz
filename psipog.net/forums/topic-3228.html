			<span style="color: darkred">Around 2 months ago, I could move the psiwheel with ease, and I could control the direction, but after I learned control and whatnot, I started to get headaches while practicing. So, I stopped just for a day. The next day, when I tried to move it, it wouldn't budge. Not even a little. I have been practicing since then, and still nothing. I have tried the same method that I have used in the past, and even new ones posted on PsiPog, but still nothing. Does anyone have any suggestions, or anything that may help me.

How long have you been trying?
<br />

<br />
Are you in the same spot as before with the same psiwheel?
<br />

<br />
Try watching the psiwheel videos as you are doing it... what method are you using?

			Ok if you pushed the maximum of you abilities, in such practicing beyond the head ache it is possible you could of caused damage to your abilities, that is why its heavily reccomended that you stop at the headaches, not only that but they can persist and be _very_ painful for some time after.
<br />

<br />
Hrmm, have you tried other fields of psionics to see if those are still in function, it could may well be a elapsed down period for you, it also could be due to outside stress or problems imposed on you. When I was going through a derpression after my ex and I broke up months ago I saw a damper in my skill untill I got over it, then it was back to normal.

<span style="color: darkred">I always stop at headaches. It's just that I just stopped for a day to rest and I just couldn't spin the psiwheel anymore. I believe that it probably is stress or certain problems.... </span>
