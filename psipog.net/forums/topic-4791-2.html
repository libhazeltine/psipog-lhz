Just because you're two years younger doesn't mean you can't make a comment man.

I was never really happy aobut giving my age out online, because honestly, I think the number is complete bullshit. I know kids at the age of 12 who are much more mature that alot of adults I know.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

			See I woulda said &quot;I'm a mechanic!  What kinda car?  year?  Can you take me to it?  I'll give it a look free of charge!!! As long as you tell your friends about me!  It's a deal!!  Mikes auto!  Never had any problems EVER!!  So what was your IQ when you dropped outa high school and joined the ranks of gang member?&quot;
<br />

<br />
no I woulda just said &quot;i gtg to the bathroom&quot; and call the cops in there.  And if he tried to follow me, I'd say I get stage fright and have to be alone.

			i've been in situations like this before, and they are scary.  it's easy to say what you would've done, but wait til it happens.  i've had a couple of experiences like this.  one of them really sticks in my mind:  i remember i was at a dance with my (now ex)-girlfriend.  i was told by her friends that some guys were looking for me, and wanted to jump me.  i didn't care, i was with some friends and i wanted to have a good time because i had a feeling that she was cheating on me, but that's another story.  anyways, when my friends went outside to smoke, they walked up to me, three of them.  they started saying shit to me and reaching in their pockets.  i was smaller, but recieved pride and courage from my dad (the way he raised me).  i just told them to get the fuck away from me or i'll kick all their asses, and they left.  sometimes you have to be ballsy for people to leave you alone, other times it won't work.  if they were different people, they might have shot me.  i was lucky.  sorry you had that experience pantsparty, but now you are wiser.  and if it happens again (hopefully it doesn't) you will be a bit more knowledgable of what to do.
