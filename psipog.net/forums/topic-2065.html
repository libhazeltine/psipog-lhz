			This article is concerning Float's video &quot;R21 Mirror&quot;. Most likely he just used a magnet because if you noticed the coin only jumps up on one side indicating that the coin has been magnetized and has seperate  poles. also it did not show his other hand(which was probably under the table using the magnet) I am just bringing up a point so float please don't get mad.<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"></span><span style="color: olive"></span>

			check the anti-skeptics movie, scroll to the part where I use a magnet on a coin. only moves it around on the table, does not lift it up
<br />

<br />
And, if you magnetized it, it would slide across from the table, a magnetic field is NOT one directional, it's oval-shaped, therefore pushing the coin.
<br />

<br />
How do you magnetize HALF a coin? wtf.

			i trust Float.  As Mattz said, how would a magnet move part of a quarter? how is a quarter magnetic?  It is made of a type of bronzeish stuff (i cant think of the name right now) hence the bronze color on the side of it.  that is not magnetic.

You <span style="font-style: italic">can</span> purchase magnetic coins in magic shops.  I don't think Float used any magnets, but just keep it in mind if someone tries showing you a wishy washy video.

			the question still stands, though, if he had a tall glass thing on it (like he showed), where would he have put the magnet?  To the side? It would move the quarter over to the side.  Under?  It wouldnt raise up.  on top?  Not strong enough to do anything.

While it is probably one of the only videos that actually impresses me, a magnet could produce the effect.

Magnets can be incredibally strong, even from very far away. He could have also used string. Under a glass? Of course. That's the whole point of illusion - it looks real. If David Copperfield can walk around the inside of a glass box, and Criss Angel can levitate, anyone can make a quarter appear to lift up and move under glass.

			Float has been in the psi world for a while. He wouldnt last that long if it was a joke. He would get bored if he was fake. There is no doubt in my mind that he is real.

It is good to be skeptical.  That is what runs the human race.  No need to appologize to him.  You displayed your skepticism in a nice and mature manner.  I thank you for that.

			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
I can assure you all that Float does not fake his videos. I've known Float for a long time now and I can assure you that Float is not only is skilled with PK, he also enjoys helping others. I've seen and talked to many people that took the advice of Float when dealing with PK and have succeeded. 
<br />

<br />
Now I understand that anyone can fake a video and state that it's real. However, Floats students have had results with PK under his guidance.  Now, would a fake be able to instruct people to have a successful PK experience? No. 
<br />

<br />
You may be able to fake PK results by showing fake videos. However, you can't fake results coming from other people. Think of it like teaching a history class. If you don't know anything about World War 2 how are you going to be able to teach a class of twenty students? This is just an example, but it gets the point across. 
<br />

<br />
I can understand your skepticism however, I think you should learn more about someone before you stereotype them. 
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />
- JoeT
