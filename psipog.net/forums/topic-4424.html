			don't mean to doubt you on controlling the temperature, but did you think that what you had done was actually just foreseeing you checking the temperature, only to find it was 72?  your subconscious could have noticed it, and gave you the temperature of 72 when you tried to affect the temperature...

well dark.... that is a possibility. i mean, either way it's being successful at some sort of psionic skill. it doesn't hurt me either way. in the end it tells me that i'm progressing to where i want to be, which is a skilled psion whether it's seeing the future or doing pk
<br />

<br />
oh and btw, it did feel colder, when i started concentrating last night. whether or not i was tricking myself or if the temperature actually dropped is beyond me, but it doesn't matter to me one way or another.

			Precisely what i explain to my friends. I may have not done exactly what i thought i did, but whatever the case i did SOMETHING that was beyond the average opinion of normal. However it got there, i dont care, as long as its there.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

This sounds very unlikely for a beginner.  It may be that you just FELT colder.  This happens to me aswell.  And did you consider the fact that it gets colder as it gets later?!?

			yes i've considered all of that, you must take into consideration though that im not a beginner at psionics. 
<br />

<br />
through my experiences i've learned other skills without practicing them. i would learn them by practicing other skills. i practice telepathy and have just recently found that i can see a couple of seconds into the future. 
<br />

<br />
so i think that by practicing other things, i am able to begin practicing other skills without starting rock bottom first. do you get what i mean?

			I get what you mean, but i disagree. Even if you have advanced telepathic skills, that will most likely help you no way in telekinsis. Maaayyybe it will help increase your &quot;energy reserves&quot; or your &quot;psionic endurance&quot; or whatever the crap you people call it these days, but thats about all i see. Then theres stuff like 'geisting. That can happen anytime and probably helps with your TK, but its on accident. You can do it while trancing or meditating or playing pong on your computer.
<br />

<br />
My overall suggestion/advice: Try forms of PK ACTIVELY. Chances are you did nothing (AKA a coincidence). And your definition of &quot;so frickin hot&quot; and my definition are most likely very different. Mine is about 120 degrees F, or about 49 degrees C. Where i live it doesnt even GET to 72 this time of year. we set the thermostat to 80, and thats our summer &quot;chilly&quot;.

			well i think i should also add that for the past few weeks i have been changing the way i learn. i've been training myself to quality learn quicker.
<br />

<br />
what i was sayin with that is if you're practicing one skill, your ability to learn others is helped. with a combination of this and the other 'mind over matter' conditioning i've been doing with my learning abilities, i believe that's helped me to learn pk a bit faster than usual.
<br />

<br />
then again, none of this rules out the possibility that i may just be a bit gifted when it comes to pk. not saying i necessarily am, i dont like 'tooting my own horn', but its a possibility
