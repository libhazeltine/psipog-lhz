			Martial Artist, I too would like to believe that you can teleport, pass through walls, multiply etc. Because I have read all the scriptures and sutras and texts which detail stories and hint at powers. I also believe (at least similarly) that concentration is the only key factor to having utmost supernormal powers. I like to keep these ideas and fantasies but unlike most other people in this forum I lack actual experience in trying. I think before you even joined this forum I had already to divised a plan in which I would cultivate the six higher Buddhist powers and then roam about the world having fun and flying. Sadly I realize that at least the people in this forum try and I have not. So I'm getting the feeling that you are clinging to fantasies and have not even tried teleporting or flying. It seems you are keeping them far but not to far so as to learn them whenever you like. The truth is, you have to start now and it's not as easy as you think.

I have already started.
<br />

<br />
Again: You (in general) do not have to practice psionic skills or higher powers to perform them eventually. That's my whole point: Why practice on one single skill in specific and cling to that when you can instead train the source of all these skills and master them all..eventually? That is why I indeed keep them far but not too far. I use them when necessary or when my intentions are honest and fit the moment. I lack interest in these skills to dedicate my time in practicing one specific skill. My goal is the highest I know of: full liberation. That is my only true desire and everything I will gain along that path is nice but nothing of lasting value.
<br />

<br />
I think your post was subconsicously directed more towards your self than to me. We often reflect ourselves upon others. So I would say: why wait with the practice if you feel that you have to start now because you think it ain't easy? My goals ain't the siddhi's so I see no lasting benefit in practicing any specific one of them. If someone wants to develop one certain siddhi, then yes I would advice you to practice that siddhi alot. However, if you want to master them all, practicing a certain siddhi will not suffice IMO.

I think you don't have to search or work for anything in order to find it. There's no need. Buddha seemed to having thought about that similarly, because he taught something like desire is the cause of suffering and cessation of desire will lead to reaching a blessed state. The elemental understanding of existence was in Buddhas view suffering. So...

Do you want to satisfy your desires or go deeper into the rabbit hole?

It is really hard to point something out with words so that everyone         understands it the way it is intended.

I understood completely what MartialArtist was saying/wanting to say, he is wise. 
<br />
I too have experience with directing lightning during storms, it is all about willing and knowing what you want to achieve.
<br />

<br />
My experience with lightning control was together with a friend, it was during a lightning storm a few months ago (october or so). I was outside in my garden and we wanted to try to controll the lightning strikes. What I did was just &quot;willing&quot; the lightning flash to be at a specific place in the air. My friend at that moment started counting down from 3 to 1, at 1 there was a huge flash exactly at the place I was intending it to appear. We did this a few times the same night, and everytime it happened exactly at the place we wanted it to strike.
<br />

<br />
As MA said, you do not need to practice for ages to master anything, as long as the intention and attention is there it will happen, whether you practiced for years or just a few days.

Of course vagueness doesn't stop you from expressing yourself. But, what is the point when you are not expressed in full bloom?

I think that pretty much sums up the relationship between MA and the rest of the forum's members. Those who understand his words (ie. those &quot;with ears&quot;) get great usefulness and wisdom from them (ie. they &quot;hear&quot;).

That's great, but logically, I've seen no way to end desire. As long as we have wills and needs, we will have desire. Here's how it goes. Your goal is to stop desiring things, so logically, you must have a reason for having that goal. That reason is a desire. Be it inner peace, mastery over the self, ending your suffering, all of them are a desire. Instead of trying to eliminate desire, try to limit it to only things you need. Food, water, air, and shelter first and foremost. Followed by other things that aren't as important and might not be necessary for some but are for others, and can help you to remain psychologically sound. Things like companionship (a pet, a girlfriend, a sibling, whatever), something to fill your time with (maybe meditating, since we're talking about inner peace, or practicing your psionics, since this is Psipog), and some exercise to keep your body healthy, which in turn will eliminate lethargy, which will help you to stay motivated.

Now, moving on...

<br />

<br />
Basically what MA is stating here can be expressed mathematically.
<br />

<br />
I = Intention
<br />
A = Attention
<br />
P = Maximum Psionic effect
<br />

<br />
I * A = P
<br />

<br />
Where I and A are both decimal numbers between 0 and 1, 1 = 100% and 100% is considered achieving the goal. If your Intent is zero, then you have no goal, and you cannot achieve a goal that you do not have, so P ends up as 0%. If your Attention is zero, none of your energy will be directed at the goal, and without energy, nothing can occur, so P ends up as 0% once again. The higher both I and A are, the higher P will be.
<br />

<br />
Now, i have to disagree with his statement for a few reasons... 
<br />

<br />
One reason is that everything has its limits. This is not a theory up for debate, this is a fact. Steel will break after a certain amount of force is applied, and will melt after gaining a certain amount of heat. A given amount of copper can only transfer a certain amount of energy before it overheats and melts. The human body is no different, neither is the human mind. If your arm is hit hard enough with a monkey wrench, it will break, and if your mind deals with too much stress, you will have a mental breakdown. If you are trying to transfer too much energy psionically, it can hurt you. Now, granted, everybody's limits are different. It would take a different amount of force to break my arm than it would to break MA's, and our minds both have a different amount of resistance to mental breakdown. Similarly, differences in genetics, body chemistry, etc... means that MA and I would have different limits to the amount of psi we could handle without getting hurt.
<br />

<br />
Another reason is personal experience. Now, if I meditate and/or go into a trance, I can hold my mind clear long enough to focus on a goal (and by clear, I mean there is NOTHING going on. When I clear my mind, I go all the way. No doubts, no fears, no beliefs, nothing. So shut up about how I was &quot;doubting myself,&quot; because I wasn't. It's actually useful for controlling nervousness), and to attempt to achieve that goal. Now, having an IQ of higher than your average fork, I can also formulate a goal, which would be my intent. Applying my freshly cleared mind (A is at 1), and my goal (I is at 1), I should be able to achieve that goal (P should be at 100%). However, I cannot.  If I were to meditate right now, then try to make a green psi ball, I would be unable to. And I'll wager that if those of you reading this that cannot already make a flared psi ball were to try it right now, with perfect Attention and Intent, it would not work. It's not that I don't believe in you, or that I think you're a psionic version of a wimp, it's the cold, hard truth. Psionics takes practice. You're not gonna go read some magic text, and with some focusing, show up at school the next day and show that bully what a 1337 s0rc3r3r you are. You're not gonna flip out and go on a psychotic psionic rampage and take over the world. End of story.
<br />

<br />
Now, while I disbelieve that anyone here has actually called down lightning, I do believe that it's possible one of you might have subconsciously predicted when and where the lightning would strike, and then formed that into your intent, thus making it look like you had called down lightning, when you had merely predicted it.
<br />

<br />
Last, but not least...
<br />

<br />

<br />
Directing the lightning is not the same as calling it down. Directing it only requires that the potential difference already be there and that you move around the electrical charges. Granted, moving around that much of an electrical charge might not be easy, but it's a lot more plausible, as you only have to make the target a better spot for the lightning to hit. Calling it down would require building up the gigawatts of electricity, then directing it as well. I know, I know, &quot;it's all about intent and attention!&quot; Yeah, that's great, but physics is still involved. Something has to cause that lightning to strike. The process you go through mentally might not have anything to do with physics, but physical effects are still happening. You used PK to knock over a can? Force was applied to the can, knocking it off its center of balance, and gravity pulled it down. You heated up a bowl of water? The water molecules were &quot;excited,&quot; causing them to vibrate, creating the heat.
