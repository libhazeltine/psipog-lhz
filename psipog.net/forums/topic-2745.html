			1. I hate wasting. I do not want any part of my mind being wasted. I want to be able to push the barrier and achieve the most healthy and active mind possible. A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
<br />

<br />
Not to mention, the practical and life-saving effects PK can have. Imagine if you or a loved one has a serious illness, one can cure it with PK. Imagine if you were locked out of your car or home, you can use PK to get unlock the door. Imagine if you or one of your friends were being attacked by someone, you can protect yourself or a friend with PK. Imagine if you are in extreme heat and cold and under normal circumstances you would freeze or burn to death. You could use PK to warm or cool yourself. 
<br />

<br />
The possibilities are endless.
<br />

<br />
Also by practicing PK, it improves other areas of psionics and my regular daily life. After beginning my practice of PK, I've gained a much greater awareness of my unlimited capabilities. I've been able to sleep extremely easily. I've become much more calm and relaxed, instead of stressful like the society of today. It has helped improve my life.
<br />

<br />
2. There are no limits. Only the ones that we create ourselves.

			1. It's a good way to relax the mind and learn more about the universe we live in. I want to be able to do the &quot;impossible&quot;, and convince skeptics that telekenisis is real. Plus, I've always found it cool, especially when you see it in movies (E.g. X-Men).

			I think this thread is a little weird. Everyone has this weird Idea about &quot;limits&quot;. Does it seem to you all that limits are some unpassable thing? If so, it appears you are viewing life in a very black/white manner. Think about it as running. If you can't run a mile... Then that is your limit FOR NOW. Get it? So far the largest thing I've moved is a pencil, so that's my limit. If I decide to practice PK again, I will be back at my limit ready to challenge/push it.
<br />

<br />
It just sounds childish to think that you can move ANYTHING. Stick with your limit, and push it up slowly.

I guess that would make this thread boring though, wouldn't it?

			1.)Why do you want to have telekinesis? 
<br />

<br />
- I've always believed in it some what when I was little. Since I'm a cartoon fanatic I loved watching cartoons that involved super powers, usually those of lifting thigs and throwing them. Telekinesis. It always fascinated me. So doing it now is like a dream come true at this point, I couldn't ask for anything more but just to succeed in it.
<br />

<br />
2.) Do you think we have limits? move a car? a person? or just little things? 
<br />

<br />
- No I really don't think we have limits but it seems like it would 
<br />
take a long time to be able to move a car, I would be happy to slide paper around as most of us would be. I'm happy for what I can do currently and what I have done, even though I question myself if it happened once or if I'm unsure. * just read sheepkings message*. Thats the whole idea of building up your tk muscle which you put quite nicely, by the way.

I disagree. There's evidence right here on these forums that proves this, specifically JoeT's experiment. 
<br />

<br />
Many people have difficulty moving the psi-wheel when it is put under a glass, which is because it seems more difficult to move, since any wind movement is entirely impossible. In JoeT's experiment, he took someone who was blind and had no knowledge that a glass was placed between her and the psi-wheel and she was able to spin it just the same as if there had been no glass.
<br />

<br />
I believe that experiment proves that we just set limits on ourselves. I imagine with enough practice with PK, that one would be able to move any object once he/she is well experienced. I myself, find no more difficulty in moving a flag, than I do with the psi-wheel. I'd imagine once I mastered several objects, learning to move other objects will come quickly and then eventually I can let anything move.
<br />

<br />
I'd like to compare it to moving to a new place and having to start relationships and friendships all over again. You start out slow and you have difficulty, but after awhile you gain more confidence and you feel comfortable with the new setting.

It is harder to move a psiwheel under glass because people make themselves think that there is a barrior between the psiwheel and them.  They, therefore, think that they have to try and move the psiwheel harder.  When JoeT made that experiement, his friend has no idea that she was trying to move it under glass.  She therefore did not create the idea in her head that a barrior was there and she did not stress more.  Everything is possible to move.  The mind just knows of weight, barriors, and size.  If you see a car, you will automatically think of heavy, etc.  As Neveza has discovered when he first started (hope you dont mind that i am using you as an example, neveza), he could move a pencil and other things before he tried the psiwheel.  This is because he completely pushed the idea of weight and size away from him.  Is it harder to move bigger things and heavier things than lighter and smaller? Yes because of basic physics.  But most of the problems with newbies trying tk and people stuck on the psiwheel is because they have this big idea of size and (especially) weight.  Unfortunatly, getting rid of the sense of weight and size is pretty much impossible because of human nature.  Yes, you can say to yourself &quot;weight doesnt matter&quot; but that does not change what you believe deep down (and what your Sub-concious believes).  That is just an obsticle that people have to get around.  Hope this helps.
