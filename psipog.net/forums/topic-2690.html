			I recently took up PK and even though I've only been training for a few days, I've had massive success and I can move the psi-wheel. Last night was the first time I was able to successfully move the psi-wheel and I did it while meditating on a song (the song was actually still playing while I was moving the wheel). I had little control and the movement was inconsistent and volatile.
<br />

<br />
Last night, I was able to look directly at the psi-wheel while doing so, but tonight I am having trouble looking directly at the wheel and moving it. I only get little movement while looking directly at it, but I can get much more powerful and enduring movement when I don't look directly at the wheel.
<br />

<br />
Any suggestions/tips on how I can fix this? Might this just be an &quot;off-day?&quot;

			Might just be having a half off day.. ya know, your mind just might be a little exhausted from the last time.. it's like running without any exersises, hope you don't pull a muscle ^^ I don't think you did but sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad. Don't stress over it, relax, practice practice practice!

			Yeah, that's what I think it is too. I've been practicing PK for much more time than what I suggested, so I think I just may be exhausted. I put a link to the journal I've been recording in my signature. Hopefully it can give you guys a better insight into my experiences  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
