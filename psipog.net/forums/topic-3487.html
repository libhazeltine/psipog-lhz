Oh wait, and im a skeptic....yeah....im sure thatll go over well here. I was referred to this site by a good friend, you may know him as Great White Ninja. Cool kid. Now thats it.

			*rolls on the floor with laughter* ....Bananna! Lol. I can't believe you chose that for your username <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />! I thought that was strictly to be used for our e-mails! I thought you'd go with my suggestion of calling yourself Great Irish-Nazi Ninja! Well anyway, I'm glad you're here. I'm sure you will bring much wisdom, intelligence, and banannas (*WTF?*) to the forums. But like Pyroman 098 said if you want to become less skeptical you should dabble in psionics yourself. Remember &quot;survival training&quot;. I'll give you a little training and knowlege about the forums to help you in a PM sometime. I also recommend you check out some threads in general discussion: the user above you is in jail, some more about....you! (this way you can everyone can find out how awesome you are!), don't you hate when don't you love when (I can't wait to see your posts on that one. lol.), and what's your favorite joke? Ofcourse there are a lot of other great threads out there but I haven't checked out that many. By the way, do you know how to use the private message feature yet? See you around Jameson. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">TO EVERYONE ELSE</span>: Although he is a skeptic he is still a relatively nice and understanding guy. I'm sure he will be open-minded enough so as not to give anyone a hard time. <span style="font-weight: bold">ADDED</span>: I made him unknowingly do a psi visualization exercise once and he did feel the energy. (but he's got a long way to go from there <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />) Perhaps if I can move an object with a mass greater than that of a psi wheel he may become less skeptical. 
<br />

<br />
P.S.  I obviously voted that you're cool. Creating a tie with bananna (at the moment). Do you like my avatar? You said Rock Lee was your favorite Naruto character right? Speaking of avatars, yours is as random as your user name! It's kind of like Sgt Psion's since it involves the military.

			Rock Lee does kick ass. Do you know how hard it was to find an avatar? ITS FREAKING HARD! It is hard...boohoo. Yes, I will be open minded, Im not some douche who shows up on forums just to bash people for their beliefs. PM me with the tips on surviving in this harsh wilderness.

Yeah, Rock Lee suits me very well. We both kick ass <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />, work hard, are very determined, very punctual, and have bushy eyebrows! As for finding avatars, I just found mine on google image search. If you want to find anything to do with ninjas or Naruto characters that just might be the place to look. I trust you will have no problems getting along with anyone (unless of course you come across some jerks yourself). I might not even be able to PM you this weekend. I'm very scared right now because my mom's fiance is wondering what the hell I've been doing on the computer. If I get up early enough tomorrow I may be able to PM you the tips but if not I shall send them to you on Monday. Cya.
