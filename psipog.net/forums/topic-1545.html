			Salutations,
<br />

<br />
Another subject that I have seen to be rarely touched on is Lucid Dreaming. So in an effort to try to bring all the topics into play i've formulated this post.
<br />

<br />
The question here is how often do you have lucid dreaming, the type of lucid dreaming, and if you wish to tell us about the lucid dream or rather one of them.
<br />

<br />
Now then I do have a tendancy to spread Lucid Dreaming into two topics, I dont know if they are official or not but it helps me atleast spread them apartl, my apoligies to the Staff if this is offensive just as the false Kinesis terms are. Though let me explain the difference in my point of view.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Lucid Dreaming</span></span>
<br />
This is the state in which you are in total control of the dream and have realized it to be a dream, you still feel all the things with your normal senses as it does with any degree of lucid dreaming.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Semi-Lucid Dreaming</span></span>
<br />
This is the state in which you are conscious in a dream but you are not aware it is a dream, all your senses are plugged into the dream though so you can still feel and touch things and get a response.

<br />

<br />
i usually just use lucid dreams to have fun in my dreams.... yep.. thats it.
<br />
AND also, i discovered lucid dreaming even before i found any of these sites. i discovered it on my own

			I've been semi-lucid before. Or, I've been in a state where I knew that what was happening wasn't real, and gained control of eerything, but never even considered that I was dreaming. It didn't last long though. BUt anyway, whenever I realize I'm dreaming I think &quot;wow!&quot; and start telling people in my dream. And fall back into it. Or wake up. Most often I wake up

			Hi,
<br />
    I had lucid dreams when I was 8 or somethin' . I thought it was only happening to me and never told anyone. Then when I got the net, I one day searche and found lots of sites including Psipog and thats how I started off with Psi. Nowadays I do have lucid dreasm but don't have much control. I DO know its a dream but I can't think clearly while in it. It is also sometimes very difficult to see in my dreams  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			I have the weirdest dreams when I'm lucid. once in a dream, I, before i realized it was a dream, look at a clock and it was blank. I realized that a clock cannot be blank. shortly afterwards, i went into a bakery and ate a whole lot of german chocolate(i love german chocolate. i am not fat, though.) the best part was that i tasted the german chocolate.
<br />

<br />

<br />
i hadn't had german chocolate for a couple of months before the dream and had totally forgotton about the stuff.
<br />

<br />
I'm suprised if i DON'T have a lucid dream.

			I seem to go in phases with remembering my dreams so I cant be sure but I seem to have them quite regularly, the usual pattern is either I get angry and it triggers it or something in the back of my mind thinks &quot;hang on this isn?t quite right.&quot;
<br />

<br />
My biggest problem in them is I don?t have much memory of my waking life.
<br />

<br />
I've had a couple of weird moments in lucid dreams, like one time I told a woman in a dream that she was only a part of my dream and she got all philosophical about existence. Another time in a regular dream I dreamt that I went to sleep and had a lucid dream (does that eve count as a lucid dream)
<br />

<br />
The main problem I find is if you don?t hang onto the thought ?I am dreaming? you tend to forget and get obsessed about following what ever your last thought was. It can be amusing in a twisted way remembering yourself get obsessed about something really dumb and unimportant. (A good example was when I wanted to kill myself in a dream to see what happened, for some reason I latched on to the idea of crashing a plane with me still inside so I spent the rest of the dream looking in vain for a plane <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> ) 
<br />

<br />
I dont know about semi lucid dreams they sound like a regular dream to me.
<br />

<br />
do people here dream in colour and with sound? because I have heard some people dont

			Something I find interesting is I have three extremely lucid, i.e., it's not clear to me at all that I'm sleeping, dreams that I have had at least three times.
<br />

<br />
One, I am in a schoolyard of an old-time brick school. I've never gone to a school like this. I can fly and I'm confused that others can't. However, it doesn't seem to be a big deal.
<br />

<br />
Another one, I am sitting on a hillside next to a highway watching cars going by. Again, I am convinced I am there.
<br />

<br />
Finally, there is one that I have had more often, that I recall when I wake up and an hour later cannot for the life of me remember it. I am always &quot;happy&quot; to have had the dream and I have had it a few times. But for whatever reason I can't recall it later. I have put pencil and paper next to my bed after it happens but it happens every several years and I simply stop bothering after a while. So when it happens again it seems to be completely unexpected and, of course, I'm not ready for it.
<br />

<br />
Since I was 8 I've realized I can control my dreams. I was 8 and we went to see the movie Jaws. I had quite the nightmare after that! My parents said I didn't have to worry; that dreams were something I was in control of and since that point have always had fun with dreams.
<br />

<br />
But these ones are different. I can never control them and I always wake up disoriented.  It's like I'm confused to not be in the schoolyard, on the hill, wherever. At the same time, they're dreams I would look forward to again.
<br />

<br />
Well, I'm not sure what that would do for anybody other than me but there you have it. Is this what we're talking about with lucid dreams or are there different characteristics that are important?
<br />

<br />
Thanks.

			Lucid dreaming...a topic which i have read many an article on. I get lucid dreams probably about once every month or so...not very often, but I have vivid dreams almost nightly, and I'm able to remember dreams almost all the time too...If you guys are interested in this, a really good site is  <a href="http://www.ld4all.com" target="_blank" class="postlink">www.ld4all.com</a> They have a few articles that are a good read, but the real gem is the forum. Very active, even more so then PsiPog. I hope I'm not just repeating a link somebody else has already dropped. Coincidentally, I found PsiPog through LD4all.

			i had a realy sweet one the other day, i was in a building in the middle of a red desert surrounded by black mountains backed by a purple sky.  I was super lucid and i whent up to a man in the dream and said:  &quot;excusme me, Do you know that at this very minet you are in a dream?&quot;  He looked at me like he didn't understand. he just stared at me.  i have done this before and no one has ever said: &quot;what? holy crap! this is a dream? i thought this was real life&quot;  lol anyway its fun to mess with the dream people.

I dont even want to think about what you were dreaming about. You probably only continued the lucid dream because your subcincious and yourself liked it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			I seem to be picking up a phase of lucid dreaming again, my last 2 dreams since the one that I made a topic about have been lucid.  Only problem is that I start to control my dream then it completely takes a different turn and something else happens and I forget until later.
<br />

<br />
I don't think I've ever been in full control, a lot of times I try and control it and either it happens very subtly and takes a while, or it just doesn't work at all, even though I know that I'm in my dream.  I can also think close to perfectly clear, until I lose myself in the dream again <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
I have also noticed, for me anyway, that it is a lot easier to remember dreams that you have had in the past while in a dream.  I've also had it where I remember an old dream, I wake up and I realize that the dream I &quot;remembered' never occured...
