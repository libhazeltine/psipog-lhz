			Monroe describes vibrations as being key to out of body experiances. A few background notes/info: When I move a lot of psi through my hands, they feel kind of dry/smooth, and warm. This happens almost always without exception whenever I move enough psi. Now, the other night, when I got the vibrations, after they dissapted, I felt the exact same feeling. Now while this may not be much evidence within itself, It got me along the thought of: what exactly ARE the vibrations. I'm going to pull an &quot;ockam's razor&quot; and just guess that these vibrations are a large concentration of psi. What are your thoughts on this matter, as to what the vibrations are?

			well, i've experienced them, so i can wager a guess.

it was kindof like my Physical and my non-Physical body were out of phase with each other. like my non physical was orbiting around my physical very close to my center and very fast. it was a bit of a mind f*** at the time <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			I think that the vibrations tie into quantum physics. According to quantum physics, electrons are a wave and not a particle, and that everything in the universe, like density, heat, sound, light, mass, etc. are determined by vibration. I don't see why psychic phenomena would be any different.

			Sorry to burst your psionic bubble, but these vibrations are just sleep paralasys experienced on a concious level. It's basically when your brain is getting feedback from your body, which is asleep, so all it gets is static. Your brain still tries to translate it. It comes through various senses, such as vibrations. You go through sleep paralasys every night, just usually not conciously.

			Ahhh, that's a very plausible explanation, I can live with that one! Especially becuase it means I am really close to getting out of body... thanks for the info. And don't worry, not much of a &quot;bubble&quot; here anyways, was just wondering what other people thought. And your explanation makes much more sense then mine.
