Today, Bristol-Myers Squibb, the pharmaceutical monolith that charges nearly $1,000 for a 30 day supply of one of its HIV/AIDS medications, is donating $1 to the National AIDS Fund for each person who simply visits their website and &quot;virtually lights a candle.&quot; The tally is just over 1,000,000 now.
<br />

<br />
Please, please take a minute to &quot;light a candle&quot;:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.lighttounite.org" target="_blank">www.lighttounite.org</a>
<br />

<br />
This really will take just a second!! Please forward this on to other friends!
<br />

<br />
Lets do all that we can and try to reach 2 million!
<br />

<br />
Also please answer the poll so i know how many people here lighted a candle.

No, you failure to reason, 
<br />

<br />
HIV destroys the immune system, then AIDS kicks in and then attempts to kill you. A simple...common cold could kill you after your immune system's gone.
<br />

<br />
Do you know ANYTHING about medicine at all?
<br />

<br />
RIGHT FUCKING HERE:
<br />

<br />
In 1990, the World Health Organization (WHO) grouped these infections and conditions together by introducing a staging system for patients infected with HIV-1.[16] An update took place in September 2005. Most of these conditions are opportunistic infections that are easily treatable in healthy people.
<br />

<br />
Stage I: HIV disease is asymptomatic and not categorized as AIDS 
<br />
Stage II: includes minor mucocutaneous manifestations and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections 
<br />
Stage III: includes unexplained chronic diarrhea for longer than a month, severe bacterial infections and pulmonary tuberculosis 
<br />
Stage IV: includes toxoplasmosis of the brain, candidiasis of the esophagus, trachea, bronchi or lungs and Kaposi's sarcoma; these diseases are indicators of AIDS.

			who are you responding to?
<br />

<br />
HIV is the virus that leads to the syndrome AIDS.
<br />

<br />
&quot;When HIV kills CD4+ T cells so that there are fewer than 200 CD4+ T cells per microliter (µL) of blood, cellular immunity is lost, leading to the condition known as AIDS. Acute HIV infection progresses over time to clinical latent HIV infection and then to early symptomatic HIV infection and later to AIDS, which is identified on the basis of the amount of CD4+ T cells in the blood and the presence of certain infections.&quot; - from the wikipedia article.
<br />

<br />
...but I still have no clue what the heck you are talking about, who you are responding to, why you are writing what you are writing, etc. etc.

I had not noticed Felix_the_cat had posted inbetween when I had first and secondly posted - therefore, it looksed as if I had responded to him instead of the one who called me ignorant.
<br />

<br />
I know my facts, and I have presented them as such with a link for those who cared enough to read.
<br />

<br />
Shitheads in the term that people don't care and thus, they should be killed.
<br />

<br />
but hey, if you don't care that you're going to die in 10 years, at least do something to help those who aren't you and have the same problem.
<br />

<br />
as it is, satire and irony take a great deal of intelligence to recognize and acknowledge. it takes none to be insulted by them, which most of you have.

What do you mean, people don't care? I'm not sure who you are showing prejudice against here. Promiscuous gay men? IV drug users? People who receive tainted blood transplants? People who use protection, but it fails? Africans? Indians? People who got the virus from their mother?

I agree with your 100% how can you call someone a shithead? most people don't go looking for aids, it just happens to them.  also the people that do go &quot;looking for it&quot; are so screwed up from the drugs that they also didn't necessarily do to them selves, it just happens.  Things happen in this life that we don't plan on happening they just happen.  I feel sorry for you.  I really do.

			You actually think donating money will do anything? Africa is screwed. AIDS/HIV is not curable at this moment. Giving them money lets them live their horrible lives for even longer. I'm sure they appreciate it.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Maybe if America didn't spend hundreds of billions of dollars for our military defenses and instead put that money into AIDS/HIV research we would have a cure by now. But no. If you ask me, donating money to Africa is actually bad. Think of Africa as one big disease, okay? Now, then some of the disease gets out. Oh no! Where will it go. Hmm, here and there. Now more of the disease is out. Yay! People have tried to help Africa for years. Some things can't be fixed. 
<br />

<br />
AIDS/HIV is actually great for some people. It's just another way to make money. Why do you think it's been around for so long? People don't want to cure it. It's a money maker. Just like cancer. Ha ha ha, look at all the types of cancer! For all I know, they are actually making it on purpose and putting it in our food so they can get more money from us. Hospitals are owned by corporations. Hospitals make loads of money off of patients with cancer, AIDS whatever the case may be. 
<br />

<br />
I think the best thing we can provide are condoms.

Yes I'm sure they do, because everyone who knows they won't live for much longer really appreciates how great just being alive is.  I'm not saying they won't be glad to be out of their misery, but a few more days is still worth it.

Maybe if America didn't spend hundreds of billions of dollars for our military defenses and instead put that money into AIDS/HIV research we would have a cure by now. But no. If you ask me, donating money to Africa is actually bad. Think of Africa as one big disease, okay? Now, then some of the disease gets out. Oh no! Where will it go. Hmm, here and there. Now more of the disease is out. Yay! People have tried to help Africa for years. Some things can't be fixed. </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Well not living in America I can't really comment on that.  However, just because you pour money into research doesn't mean that you will find a cure at the other end.

AIDS/HIV is actually great for some people. It's just another way to make money. Why do you think it's been around for so long? People don't want to cure it. It's a money maker. Just like cancer. Ha ha ha, look at all the types of cancer! For all I know, they are actually making it on purpose and putting it in our food so they can get more money from us. Hospitals are owned by corporations. Hospitals make loads of money off of patients with cancer, AIDS whatever the case may be.

I think the best thing we can provide are condoms.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

See my point above.  Lots of people want HIV to be cured - everybody who has it!  And it's not as if we can leave it alone because there are no sufferers in the Western world (there are people suffering from AIDS over here).  Just because America charges people for their Health service (one thing for which I DO NOT envy the USA) doesn't mean that people don't want to cure it just because they are making money.   Heck, they would make loads of money from selling the cure, and for infinitely higher prices!  The problem of AIDS is a problem here in the UK too.  We have an N.H.S. which is being funded through our taxes.  They do not charge each patient each time they have an operation.  What would be their motive for witholding a cure?  None!  The situation might be different in America, but I can't see why they would withold the cure over here.
