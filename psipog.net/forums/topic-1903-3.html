			Token will go to jail for the following scenerio,
<br />

<br />

<br />
Upon leaving a liquir store he gets excedingly drunk on the way home. While walking home he will encounter a few people who he will beat down with the beer bottle unsuspectedly. After which he will gets pocket knifes off of them then run off to a police officer down three blocks who is giving a ticket to a fellow for driving with a tail light out. He will stab the officer in the Jugger from behind and take his gun holding the person getting the ticket hostage. After many hours and much public exposure by the press he will sober up and realize where he is and what he is doing, upon which he will let go of the person and drop the gun. When he does such the cops will shoot him with a sedative rush over and beat his drugged body relentless then handcuff it. Upon putting him in the car they will tazer him for the hell of it, because the police love to use overexcesive force.
<br />

<br />
He will get tried and convicted of attempted murder, assault and battery, disturbing the peace, druken and misordely conduct, and somehow tried for wounding an officer.
<br />

<br />
He will get death by lethal injection, being deemed a &quot;danger to society&quot;.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Mmm, overexcesive detail.

<br />

<br />
1.Eating someone
<br />
2.Allegedly shooting someone
<br />
3. Eating and shooting someone (in that order)
<br />
4. Sending his Winter Wolfy on a hit mission to kill
<br />
5. Using his gun to power the TV
<br />
6. Claiming the entire Internet over his tyrany <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> 
<br />
Now I have to start getting creative...
<br />
7. For breaking a copy of HaloStrike
<br />
8. Allegedly breaking copy of HaloStrike
<br />
and, of course
<br />
9. For being an awesome man eating wolf
<br />

<br />

Thankyou so much.

To Psi Ninja:  I know you're not a ninja. Neither am I of course. But I still have a great interest and respect for ninjas and samurais. I also woudn't be one bit surprised if I was a ninja or samurai in a past life. And my brother and I invent our own awesome martial arts moves. All this sums up the reason I call my self Great White Ninja. Do you have a reason for calling yourself Psi Ninja?
