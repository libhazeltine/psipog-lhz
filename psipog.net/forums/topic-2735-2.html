<br />
Nothing can exist without a balance of good and evil.
<br />
Generally, we try to seek the positive and stray from the negative, but if there was only one, good or evil, then the universe would collapse. Which leads me to think that there is an evil side to Psi. What do you think on this matter?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I think George Lucas could sue you right now.
<br />

<br />
I also think your theory is hogwash. &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; are not inherent properties of matter or of the universe. Even if we could objectively agree on a clear dividing line between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;, with no in-betweens, the universe would behave exactly the same for the &quot;good&quot; as for the &quot;evil&quot;. Gravity is the same, thermodynamics is the same, chemical reactions are the same, the speed of light is the same.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; are neither properties of matter nor energy. Let's assume that we can all agree that Adolf Hitler was evil. What made him evil? Were the carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms in his body &quot;evil&quot; atoms? Were the water molecules in his body &quot;evil&quot; molecules? Was the energy radiated by his body in the form of heat &quot;evil&quot; energy? No; his carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, water, and energy was exactly the same as Gandhi's carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, water, and energy.
<br />

<br />
It's very simple to prove that your theory is wrong, inasmuch as it is possible to prove a non-scientific theory wrong. &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; are defined in terms of social interactions among people. Assume, for the moment, that the Earth is the only life-bearing planet in the universe. Now rewind a couple of billion years; life has not yet formed on the Earth. The Earth is full of lots of inorganic matter and energy. However, there's no life; there's certainly no people. Where is the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; necessary for the universe's existence now? Is that particular rock over there &quot;good&quot;, while this one is &quot;evil&quot;?
<br />

<br />
Sorry, it just doesn't work. Thanks for playing, though.

			Call it what you want. Negative and Positive probably fit in better.

Dualism was coined by Descartes for his idea that the universe existed as a physical world and then a non physical world where our minds experienced things and made thoughts. Stupid people just made it mean that stuff. You really can't use Wikipedia as a source anyway because people write it and 1 out of every 2 people is stupid. I made that up btw, hehe. I guess dualistic thinking really is the best way to describe good/evil composition of the universe though. I guess I didn't really prove the brain wrong. I got damn close. About your crap az whatever, the universe is and it probably won't always will be. You can't characterize the universe using human ideas because most of ours are total crap. Good and evil don't exist anywhere except earth (or with aliens(highly unlikely)). Negative and positive don't fit either. The universe is showing signs of relatively imminent destruction so there obviously is not a balance between positive effects and negative ones. Anti gravity isn't calencing out gravity because things are still make black holes stronger. The point is, the universe is. You're trying to find a reason that seems to make a balance but the real thing to do is to try to find the chaos. Everything seems to be ordered in the universe. Even human thought. That's the point though. Human thought could be a chaotic factor that's random and uncontrollable and thus through chaos theory the whole universe is in a random state. The first half is to find order or chaos in the universe and the second to find meaning. For now it has no meaning, it just is; think what you want from that statement. Remeber to keep your mind open too. Read the sig!

			Here's a little list of counter points to your claims Niushirra, because I can't seem to be able to put these facts into coherent paragraphs:
<br />

<br />
Anti-gravity (dark energy) is actually cancelling out gravity and then some, which is why the universe's expansion is accelerating rather than deccelerating.
<br />

<br />
What makes black holes grow is simply the amount of matter they consume, so more matter means bigger black holes because of the law of conservation of matter.
<br />

<br />
Black holes are actually constantly decreasing in size due to Hawking's radiation, matter consumption merely delays this inevitable process.
<br />

<br />
Also, I believe we give meaning to the chaos, we're not simply swept up in it.  This requires actual order to one's own thoughts though and few people (at least in Western society) bother to sort themselves out in this area.  So yes, human thought is chaotic, but only because no serious attempt has been made by these people to organize themselves, control their impulses and emotions, etc.

			Personally I believe the concepts 'good' and 'evil' have no existence beyond our perception of whether things harm people or benefit people. The Sun has no need of good or evil, it just is, it goes on burning away whether it gives you skin cancer or allows your lettuces to grow, it still just is. There are reasons Hitler was the way he was and Germany went down the Nazi path, it had nothing to do with Evil. Eeeeeeee-vil  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Psi can be used to benefit or harm people. It is not necessary for the existence of Psi (or anything else) that there be a light-side and a dark-side. 
<br />

<br />
Discarding the concepts of good and evil does not make you amoral though. Personally I see things in terms of harm and benefit to others, the world, whatever. If I get drunk and drive my car that's not eeeeee-vil, but it will potentially harm myself and others and is the wrong thing to do.

I forgot about the acceleration in the universe is gonna do the nasty and kill us all with a rip in the dark matter infastructure. Yeah I really made myself look stupid and look at the small examples when really anti gravity and gravity are acting on the large scale of the universe. I really did make a lot of mistakes. Human thought is actually not chaotic. It follows strict chaos theory variables. Chaos is not the right term actually. More like randomness. We don't control what we think or do. It's all just a bunch of variables clashing together making the best possible outcome. Of course there is some seemingly randomness to it that could be there. I do not know if it is actually random yet. It seems logical in my mind. Personaility is based on variables to at birth and throughout your life. I hope our minds are more then just senses and memories clashing together but it's just logical. Whenever I talk about this I really can't explain what I mean fully, hopefully you guys can get the jist.
