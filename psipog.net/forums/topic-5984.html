			I thought I would post this gain sometime in the current Psipog forum. I posted my same experience a long time ago in the old Psipog foru but no-one shared similar experieces. 
<br />

<br />
My dream isn't exactly a dream per se but It does usually happen during sleep. It is odd and quite difficult to explain so please bear with me. The way I will explain it might make me sound like a crazy unstable but anyways. The experience is as follows:
<br />

<br />
In my mind there is just a sensation. This sensation is of infinity or nothing, usually appearing as white or black respectively. When I say a sensation of infinity or nothing I feel as if my essence, existence is everything or nothing. Within these two sensations will 'appear' further 'points' of infinity or nothing. When this happens the sensation becomes quite 'unbearable', should we say. It can either feel as if:
<br />

<br />
1. A point of nothing somehow existing in infinity/everything.
<br />
2. A point of infinity existing within nothing/a void.
<br />

<br />
From there more points can appear within one of the original sensations, or one of the new sensations so eventually it can become:
<br />

<br />
An infinite amount of existence/essence somehow  crammed into absolute nothing (imagine trying to cram a jumbo jet into a tin can). Or an infinity crammed within a nothing, furthermore, somehow expanded into everything.
<br />

<br />
Sometimes millions of these infinity-nothing-inifinty existences will appear at a single time in which case my mind feels as if it is about to explode. When I 'see' it with my sense of sight it looks exactly like static on a TV. When I 'hear' it with my sense of hearing it sounds, also, like the static of a TV.
<br />

<br />
****************************************************** 
<br />
This is it.  A few points I might add for those who are interested:
<br />

<br />
This process usually starts when I am asleep but if I wake up it still persists for quite a while. I also sometimes feel it when I imagine two contrasting sensations at the same time (e.g. the feel of pavement gravel and fine silk).
<br />

<br />
I have not had one in a dream for quite sometime but I do occasionally get such sensations while awake or asleep. I find that when I do get it nowadays it is when I am very sick or under mental stress. When I was pre-5 years old I would usually have these dreams every night.
<br />

<br />
So, please posts your thoughts, oppions or questions if you want to.

But, I think I may have the same thing. You explained it so oddly though. 
<br />
Does it feel like you just fall in your head into infinite? 
<br />
I am sorry, I couldn't pull in all of your information. I will be back. 
<br />
I think you have the same problem as me.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Okay, I am back. Yes, what you describe sounds like the same thing I experience. At first I too found it to be unbearable but, you must allow it and you will go deeper and start to be intrigued by it. At least, that is what has become of my feelings with this experience. 
<br />
I will usually have my eyes closed and then it just feels like I fall into my head which does feel like infinite. And I think it did originate from dreams from when I was little.

No, it isn't. If you are referring to us doing drugs, I don't, I am not sure about him though.

First of all, I recommend pepsi boy sees a professional immediately. Pizzas are a finite objects which cannot have the properties that I have mentioned. If you are getting such easily differentiated concepts confused; it could be terminal. Oops, I just gave him some medical advice, would someone please moderate this part of the post

No I have experienced this 'falling into infinity in your head' sensation before and I can tell that they are not the same. By the way, if I am relaxed then I too can 'fall into infinity in my head'.

			When I have a fever, I experience about the same thing as you. Except that what I experience is that I'm in this huge blank dark place and there are giant floating gears moving everywhere, causing a REALLY loud sound...
<br />

<br />
And i hallucinate when i have fever, I'm dangerous~

			OMG i was just about to say the same. When i am sick with fever i sometimes have this feeling - when i was a child even more often. It is hard to describe but i guess that is one way. But this is a really strange felling, sometime happens in my dreams, sometimes it lasts even alitle when im waking up etc.. But this contrast BIG-small, the feeling of me beeing so little and at the same time so big, i see some objects in that state as well sometimes.. but mostly just the void of nothingness and everything.. it is very hard to describe, but it feels very intense and very uncomfortable with my own self... man i was wondering were those just halucinations, but since i get them sometimes when im not fever-ish, and since i see other people have this also it must be something..  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />
