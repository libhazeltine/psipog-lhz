			Hey guys, I was wondering?I have read posts about some of us being able to move the psiwheel without any concentration,like as soon as you look at it.Do you think it is still tk or could it be an air current that blows coincidentally as soon as you look at it.I read that you have to have a pretty good link with the object before you move it.Is that true or does this happen because the mind already knows what it must do???

			hi LoneWolf 
<br />

<br />
for me i can move the psi wheel without feeling the connection and i dont know how to make the connection or how it feel like but i can know when i can do tk and when i cant . 
<br />

<br />
about the posts you read it is right you can move the psi wheel without concentration and sometimes you can move the psi wheel better then when you concentrate but that rare happen , sometimes when i concentrate i hardly make the psi wheel spin and then the phone near me ring then i answer it and look at the psi wheel and i see it spin crazy ( fast none stop) . but i prefer concentration because you do tk when you want to do it not leaving it to chances happen or not to happen and by the way concentration is better it always stronger than not concentrated .
<br />

<br />
when i try to do tk on the psi wheel im completly sure no air and no window is opened because i dont want anything to make me disbelieve that what i done is not tk .
<br />

<br />
by the way i can move the psi wheel when i just want to do so that mean you dont need think that there is connection . all you need is to free your mind from the disturbing thoughts like that and the other thoughts.

Well I always work in a room with know current of air. All doors windows shut. Just as ahmed1 had said. I just started working with the psi wheel as of yesterday. My first try at moving it wasn't succesful. But the second time I tried I almost didn't think I was trying, and it moved around two full rotations. I moved it again this morning. But under different conditions. This morning I was working under blacklights instead of white light, This shouldn't make a difference. I also drew on my psi wheel with highlighter. Which I noticed is distracting at first. But I was listening to music as well, for the first time with working on psi wheels. It actually helped my to free up faster I guess. I moved the wheel around almost three full times then it stopped. I keep loosing how to hold the link, or connection with the wheel. Maybe i'm focussing too hard... whatever I'm doing I think I'm going to adapt. Once I can hold the wheels movement for an extended amount of time. I want to see how long I max out at.  I noticed that I moved the wheel with little thought or focus.. maybe just less. In either case... I'm sure it's just keeping your mind clear enough to hold the process in motion. Whatever that feels like for each person. It's undescribable I suppose. But it will be through your inner self. Peace ~
