			Okay, I've had a theory I thought up a long time ago, and heard about online as well.  I won't go into too much detail, as I posted it way back when the forums were up a *long* time ago.  (Peebs made a reply, he might remember it.  No idea what my old account name was though...) 
<br />

<br />
It basically entailed that most paranormal experiences involving ghosts are actually residual effects of psychic activity.  Sicne most of us here believe that everyone is at least capable of psionics, than it only stands to reason that when a normal person is put under &quot;extraordinary conditions&quot; they might manifest some random psionic effect.  So i mean that when a person is killed or just dies, thye might manifest some kind of psionic effect that leaves their &quot;imprint&quot; on the area (ghosts repeatedly walking up stairs, or standing in a specific doorway etc...) And I feel that such extreme conditions are usually necessary for a ghost to be created by accident, because of this: how often do you hear of ghosts of specific people that didn't die in some gruesome way?  Not very often I'd wager.
<br />

<br />
Basically, if this is true, then it means that at least most ghosts are a byproduct of psychic activity.  That also means that you shouldn't have to be dead to make one.  I have heard of an experiment (if anyone knows what im talking about, and have more info please post it) in which a group of people allegedly made a ghost, and named it (cant remember the name) and it was supposedly capable of poltergeist activity.
<br />

<br />
Thus we come to the point of my post.  If someone would be willing to volunteer their home, would it be possible to us to create a ghost (i guess they are just constructs) in that persons home to do ghostly things, via online?  (move stuff, make noise, the works)  Maybe if a coalition was made, and everyone participating could see pics of the home and people within it?

On a serious note: I doubt Psi would cause &quot;ghosts&quot;. I'm not saying it couldn't cause ghost like affects, as it might. But, I've been practicing for a pretty dang long time now, at least in my eyes, and I've really gotten nothing close to a ghost like poltergiest effect, or something like that.
<br />

<br />
Only time anything like that happened is when I was doing Remote Presence, and felt like I got &quot;stuck&quot; traveling through the door. There was a knocking on it for some time.
<br />

<br />
Another thing, that just came up in my head... How many people who are &quot;haunted&quot; intentionally tried to make themselves that way? Or, how many people would intentionally create a &quot;huanted&quot; place?
<br />

<br />
*just wondering*
<br />
I have an open mind to this idea.

			A typical haunted house is usually rumored, therefore someone is all like omg theres ghosts in it, and then they have that stuck in their head. But say someone said this place isn't haunted? would they still see them?

If ghosts don't have anything to do with psi, then what are they XD

			I've had poltergeist phenomena happen to me a lot ever since I can remember. It tends to be day-dreaming &amp; strong emotional-states, amongst other things, which &quot;activate&quot; it. The knocks you describe SheepKing, to outright bangs and things moving voilently. I'm aware this will be laughed at, but that's not my problem. - And I really don't know what else there is to say about it, it just happens. 
<br />

<br />
As for intentionally making yourself haunted... Well, I doubt anyone with a reasonable level of intelligence would. Similar to uncontrolled telepathy producing an overload - I doubt anyone intentionally induces one of those (not twice anyway!).
<br />

<br />
Ghosts could apparently be electromagnetic phenomena, psychic bi-products, astral bodies caught on this plane, hallucinations... the list goes on. Credibility of said options and which you believe in, however, are different matters!

			I've occasionally come across a construct-like thing with intelligence, and irratic programming. Perhaps where the ghost legends came from? Naturally occuring constructs maybe? Or reproducing constructs that eventually had programming that is more like a mind than a program?

			ok.. so my g/f was having trouble last night. I sort of got her to talk about occult things. She says everytime this happens, a cloud thing with a face on it appears. The cloud is grey and the eyes are red. I tried to tell her that it was a figment of her imagination (meaning an object her imagination created) and that she could make it disappear. She studied witchcraft way way back in the day so her head was filled with some shit.
<br />

<br />
I was talking on an mIRC channel with someone who supposedly dabbled in magick. He stated that entities (in his opinion) were just self made constructs by people that were programmed unknowingly by them with conceptual programming. After long enough time, this construct would take a shape and even form a mind of its own. He also went on to say that posessions were actually these constructs being further progamed conceptually with the expectations of the victum. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
It wouldnt be weird if this thread hadnt been made... im very interested to see what happens in this guy's house... could you mabye do a 24/7 webcam thing? It would have a hell of alot better use than those ghey ass reality webcam shows you see from time to time.

			I would be very interested in setting up something like this.  I personally am involved with a ghost hunter group, though not a really active one.  I have stayed in a haunted house several times, slept in the be dof a woman who died within the house, and even had a still-born child in that bed (most comftorable bed in existence btw, lol, fell right asleep) adn it doesn't really bother me.  I personally wouldn't have any problem dealing with this kind of thing if it were to actually work, i don't know about anyone else though, adn I can see what you're saying Aether.  
<br />

<br />
I mean seriously, I would love to have a haunted house.  All the crap you see in movies about them being dangerous is a load of bull.  Blows it way out of proportion.  Not to say you can't be physically injured, but in those cases it usually ends up in the form of some small scratches.  Its the fear that causes the most damage, but if your used to it, then theres nothing to worry about.  Unless of course we're talking about the swords in my bedroom being geisted around, lol. (might want to move those, or tape them down...)  In fact, it might be interesting to try this in multiple members homes, just to see if it works better around certain people.
<br />

<br />
Doing so over the internet would present  asmall problem, for isntance: time zones.  We would need to synchronize the times in which we all made the attempts.  My suggestiong would be to use the time on the PsiPog website, and use that to sync up.  It says its 9:24  right now, and is actually about 10:30ish where I am.  So i know that its an hour ahead of me.  See?  So that way everyone could find out what the difference is between the websites time, and our own, and get it working that way.
<br />

<br />
The next problem would be deciding exactly what we would want it to do.  Im no expert at programming, but i hear its pretty important to have a clear idea before you begin.  It would take quite  abit of teamwork, but I think it can be done.

Could use my house over here in sunny Scotland  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

My 5 year old wee brother picks up on alot of stuff like that, so don't scare him  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />
Interesting theory though.

Only one way to find out?

			Hmm, it seems like plenty of people are interested in this at least a little.  Would anyone here be willing to participate?  I unfortunately have little experience with constructs, so I am of little help with this.  We would need ot get some people that are at least somewhat experienced with it to work on it, I'd say at least 3 or 4, who would be willing to devote some time, fairly frequently, to make the attempts.
<br />

<br />
Maybe we should make a poll to see who's interested in helping, and whether or not they want to be an observer or creator.

			Thats one thing that would need ot be worked out.  We would need to decide on exactly what it was we wanted it to do, like move things, make noise, or maybe even become visible.  However, we need ot get people willing ot try before we can do that.
