sorry.
<br />

<br />

<br />
this will be a little long, I got it in an email from one of my friends.
<br />

<br />
Are you a Democrat, Republican or Southerner????
<br />

<br />
&gt;  Here is a little test that will help you decide. The answer can be found 
<br />
&gt;  by posing the following questions:
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  You're walking down a deserted street with your wife and two small
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  children. Suddenly, an Islamic Terrorist with a huge knife comes around 
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  the corner, locks eyes with you, screams obscenities, praises Allah,
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  raises the knife, and charges at you. You are carrying a Glock cal .40,and
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  you are an expert shot. You have mere seconds before he reaches you and 
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  your family. What do you do?
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  DEMOCRAT'S ANSWER:
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  Well, that's not enough information to answer the question! 
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  Does the man look poor! Or oppressed?
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  Have I ever done anything to him that would inspire him to attack?
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  Could we run away? 
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  What does my wife think?
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  What about the kids?
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  Could I possibly swing the gun like a club and knock the knife out of his
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  hand?
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  What does the law say about this situation?
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  Does the Glock have appropriate safety built into it?
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  Why am I carrying a loaded gun anyway, and what kind of message does this 
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  send to society and to my children?
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  Is it possible he'd be happy with just killing me?
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  Does he definitely want to kill me, or would he be content just to wound 
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  me?
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  If I were to grab his knees and hold on, could my family get away while he
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  was stabbing me?
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  Should I call 9-1-1?
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  Why is this street so deserted?
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  We need to raise taxes, have a paint and weed day and make this a happier,
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  healthier street that would discourage such behavior. 
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  This is all so confusing! I need to debate this with some friends for few
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt;  days and try to come to a consensus.

I'm sorry but thats so stupid. First of all it was so OBVIOUSLY written by some republican that likes to steriotype. Reason being the only person that comes out looking like they even have a small amount of judgement in that is the republican. The democrats look like hippies and southerners look like white trash.

			Actually, you don't have to be any age to be either. They're just a set of beliefs with names.
<br />

Like I stated previously, my political views are Libertarian. However, my moral views are for the most part Republican. I have nothing against Democrats. I refuse to be affiliated with either side politically. Both Democrats and Republicans want to outlaw something or another, for some reason or another, while preserving the right to something else. I just say they shouldn't make anything a crime if it has no victim other than the one committing the crime. Guns should not be outlawed, because we have a Constitutional and natural right to have them, so long as they're not endangering others or interfering with their rights (i.e. a rifle or a pistol is okay, but a nuclear weapon is not). In a similar vein, gay marriage should also not be outlawed, because it is a religious issue, and there is supposed to be a separation of church and state. I know it's not natural, but they're not hurting anyone, nor are they interfering with the rights of others, therefore they should be allowed to get married. Adoption, is another issue, however. Until a conclusive study is done on whether or not being raised by a married homosexual couple negatively affects a child, it should not be allowed, because it's better to be safe than sorry.

			I would vote Republican personally (except when Clinton was first running for office because he did good and his platform did illustrate how he would do so, even if he was a gross man-slut).  My views tend to be quite evenly distributed on the Republican and Democrat sides, but as Fakiti so eloquently illustrated, the Democrats suck balls at making snap decisions, or even making slower decisions based on their supposed principles.  Both sides play too many political games, but the Republicans do it better (I personally think it's due to so many Republican congressmen and senators being very realist, cut-throat, self-made businessmen). The Democrats end up trying to play catch up in the political arena and have less focus when it actually comes to making changes and implimenting policies.  So either I could vote for 50% of my views and decisiveness, even if it is sometimes misguided, or I could 50% of my views and never even get those implimented with any meaningfulness.

			This is why I don't like political threads. There's always someone that will have to start an argument, though even I was able to resist arguing with someone (which, given my current mindset, is quite a feat, I've been ranting and raving all day). To be fair though, I almost never argue about beliefs, unless I go into why I believe certain things, and then the person presents another perspective that doesn't make sense to me, but even then, it's a nice calm debate, not an actual argument.

There's always someone that will have to start an argument, though even I was able to resist arguing with someone (which, given my current mindset, is quite a feat, I've been ranting and raving all day). To be fair though, I almost never argue about beliefs, unless I go into why I believe certain things, and then the person presents another perspective that doesn't make sense to me, but even then, it's a nice calm debate, not an actual argument.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

True we do, but the EU is hardly the model to follow if we're to solve those problems.  For example, the EU pushed very hard for the Kyoto Accord to be signed by as many nations as possible, they ridiculed those who wouldn't sign it mercilessly, and then didn't follow it themselves.  Political hypocracy is still a problem in Europe, and whether they're TALKING about whether the entire EU should have standardized toilet designs or what to do about globalization (or if anything should be done), it's still having the same outcome because it's just talking.  Frankly, the EU embodies to a greater degree the reason I don't vote Democrat.  Talking does not equal action, nor will endless talks yield a perfect, fits-all and pleases-everyone answer.  Something has to be done, at least then if we fuck up, we'll accept the blame then decide on a new course of action to fix it rather than talking somemore about whether we were ever to blame.  Oy...

What he said.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">Wow, you're both stupid. Think about how civilization started in the first place. It came from anarchy and the most powerful taking over. That's exactly what's going to happen to you. Unless you're a big persuasive meathead that can beat people up or tell people to beat people up, I think anarchy is gonna whoop yo ass. Also, lightbringer, I like how you vote based on who you think is best for the job. Washington did not want parties and wanted a state where people voted for their favorites. Now it's turned into a bunch of idiots who just say AHHH we can't let the republicans win or AHHH those damn liberals are taking office. Surprisingly, we have very few people like you left. Leads me to think that instead of dealing with problems over the war and international shit, we should work on repairing our soceity or america is gonna go to hades in a handbasket.
