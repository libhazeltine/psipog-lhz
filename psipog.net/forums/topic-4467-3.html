Your problem is that you are basing your opinion on things you heard/read.

Other people here base their opinion on their self experience.
<br />
IMO self experience is like many times more interesting, relevant and valuable.
<br />

<br />
Else then asking from people to back up their self experiences with sources, I think the policy should change and people, if there are interested in commenting on other's self experiences, should first try the things for themselves.

I won't totally disagree with what you're saying. Just to say a bit more on that, on the way I see things: it sounds to me a bit like a skeptic of my type wouldn't be able to experience such things (could be phasing, TK, obe, etc...). So, I agree that if I would let's say try and try and try and focus myself on doing so, that maybe it would then work, or should I say it would make me believe it works... notice the difference. 
<br />
There's not one of those videos I saw that can prove me that all of this is not only coming from people's imaginations.... and on the other hand I'm not ready to f00k up my own mind with that... in those days it's hard to have a normal living if you're complelely f00cked up inside your head. IOW I don't wanna be the guinnea pig. 
<br />

<br />
btw I am glad some of you wants to try and contribute to research in a sense... 
<br />
If some of us are like this, trying to know more and know the rationale behind (because there's must be some!), don't feel offended, but take it as another way of contributing. If we were all sure about those things, there wouldn't be any debate and there would be no point. SO, I say it's good the way it is.

Self experience doesn't mean shit to me too often. The mind is prone to failure and I might think something that isn't going on is. If I believed what I felt then I'd believe that I was floating in the air or space when I meditate. No thanks.
<br />

<br />
People should set up experiments every once in a while. They might have more credibility that way.
<br />

<br />
And... you're the blind guy. As you said... &quot;IMO self experience is like many times more interesting, relevant and valuable.&quot; Yes... because something is interesting it MIGHT just be true... what, you think what you feel is more important in the way of proving things than what others say? You are blind.

			Just have to ask : What if you DanielH are wrong? What if everything you disagree and don't believe in is true and can be done? What if during meditation man can levitate? What if there would be some day some kind of &quot;source for your needs&quot; that proves everything you thought is fluff or whatever? Why people do things that they know for themselves are totally correct and can be done, like pk, I know I can do it, but if you can't, isn't proof that it doesn't exist? Why everything has to be proved scientifically or something like that? Gravity haven't been proved, but still exists? Doesn't make any sense to me, that someone really is that negative and keeps on blaming people for believing in something that you don't believe [if I read correctly between lines <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />]
<br />

<br />
Would be great if you just stopped being an a**hole to everybody else and let them do what ever they wish and stop whining. Everyone believes in what they see, but they might still trick your mind somehow like David Copperfield and guys like him.
<br />

<br />
This wasn't too an offence, just wondered out loud and by curiousity, I want to know why you're acting like you are now <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Thank you for your answer(s) and nice autumn anyways.

			Hello
<br />

<br />
First of all. DanielH, as i figured out in this thread you want that if we talk about things we can't be sure of, we should use good reasoning, instead of just saying our opinions or stating our experiences, right? If not correct me please. I ignore your wish to get sources when making a claim, because the sources that you want is in a way reasoning too, but just from other people. 
<br />

<br />
So, if one wanted to convince other persons of his own viewpoint, which is supposed to be a good one, ( at least you should see it as good or &quot;better&quot; than the other person's, because it would make no sense convincing other people of a bad viewpoint) the thing one had to do would be use good reasoning to convince the other person, right? Correct me please if i'm wrong. 
<br />

<br />
Now you should tell me please what is in your view good reasoning. In my view good reasoning doesn't imply being ignorant towards the people that you want to convince. In my view good reasoning doesn't either imply saying something, without knowing that it is true. You speak of people in other places of the world like in the &quot;Eastern World&quot;, but as far as i can see your claims root in information that you got through media.
<br />

<br />
If you cannot recognize that media (Internet, TV) doesn't serve you the truth on a silver tray, i must honestly say that you are very far from understanding. I guess you have never been to some country in the &quot;Eastern World&quot;. Correct me please if i'm wrong here. 
<br />

<br />
In addition to that i must say that your sources are very limited, too. I've been to countries in the &quot;Eastern world&quot; and according to your view of it, which i derive from your posts and the sources you posted, everything there seems to be in crisis and all the people unhappy. (Maybe a bit exagerated but basically this is what you wanted to say i think)
<br />

<br />
As i said I've been to some countries there and i feel so free to say that this is not the truth. People there are happier than people in the &quot;Western World&quot;. (I've been to many countries there). Of course not all people are happy. 
<br />

<br />
I don't know what your definition of happiness is, but mine isn't yours. 
<br />
Yours seems to be a harmony or some sort of peace with your surroundings, which i don't think is bad, but the way you want to achieve it, seems very crazy for me. You always want to prove things to other people. Why? And why do you always want that something is confirmed by someone else by giving sources? 
<br />

<br />
I like to say too, that you can't barely say anything without speaking of  experiences and without giving opinion. How could you do this? Tell me please. 
<br />

<br />
I tell you what your problem is. When someone talks about stuff that is unknown to you, you don't understand or don't want to understand then you try to trample the other one down, saying the same things over and over again and giving sources, which should confirm that what you say is true, because of your own inability to convince the other person of your own viewpoint. Apart of that i find it very intolerant not to accept other people's opinions like MartialArtists, who always tried to talk openly and politely to you up to the point where you edited his posts. 
<br />

<br />
What seems strange to me is that you partially seem to believe stuff like Psychokinesis, but then just plein ignore or see over other stuff like in this thread here.
<br />

<br />
Now, the last thing i want to tell you is that you don't seem to want other people. Or just some kind of people. Like MartialArtist. Are you afraid of them? Because they could break your view of the world and teach you something? Are you afraid of advancing? Are you afraid of getting more knowledge over yourself or over other people? If yes, then i say to you that you shouldn't. There's no reason why.

			It's kinda funny watching these post ferment.
<br />

<br />
The best thing that can happen in this thread right now, is to try and understand each other.  There is absolutly NO point in trying to 'save' each other.  Just trying and understand each other's thought processes.  It would be way more rewarding.  Why?  Becuase no one is switching sides, i'll gawrentee it.  heh
<br />

<br />
Some thing's I'll comment on:
<br />

<br />
Yoga: definetly a science of the body.  All the asana's the guru's go through does somthing great(if done right) to your body.  My guru/friend was taking anatomy classes and while she was teaching she would tell me what was happening inside my body when I did each asana.  And it is true that the ancients did do this for the good of your body, they perfected it so that you can stay heathly for a VERY long time.  They did it to cure aging pains, and to keep your body heathly.  It is a CHOSE to become slow and rickity because of age.  The ancients experimented with things to keep themselve happy and healthy to thier death, and yoga was the answer to many.
<br />

<br />
Saddness of the &quot;East&quot;:  In 8th grade I watched a documentery in history about the brothels in Cambodia.  It was the sickest thing i've seen at that point in my life.  And yeah it's bad, shit happens, blah blah, it's severly sad.  And then my teacher concluded with the fat: &quot;the US has the largest prostitution ring in the world&quot;
<br />

<br />
to everyone: chill, just talk.  Stop with the smashing other people's qoutes.  If something just doesn't make sence ASK!  Just dont go, you full of it, you just contridicted yourself.  chill  Talk, like humans.  It's how we've gotten this far...

Sad but true. Why i wrote this long post is because i was really sick of the way how DanielH talks to other people. It's just a forum in the internet, but this way it's really no fun.
