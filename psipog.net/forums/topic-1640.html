			Seems to me like whenever i do anything psionic, i can only do it for a little while (10 mins max) then i get reallly tired and unfocused and can't go on. 
<br />

<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions other than to keep practicing? Any techniques or routines i could use to increase my endurance? Or maybe if you could just tell me what i am doing that could be causing this, i can formulate one of my own. Thanks in advance.

			In my own experiences, stamina comes with time. Like running, the more you run, the more you are able to run longer without tiring out quickly. There is no instant stamina boost, but it grows with your practices. Don't push past your limit, that'll only hurt you. You are using &quot;mental muscles&quot; they have a limit, but they can gain more endurance as long as you keep working at it. I tired very quickly at the beginning of my first few practices but after a while of regular practice I got more &quot;in shape&quot; Just make sure you aren't straining too hard. Don't push, it'll come in time.
<br />

<br />
Hope that helps.

			Meditation is a good recommendation, but the main part of it is to try to see how long you can go before you wear out.  You may only be able to go ten minutes in todays practice, but go for 11 tomorrow, and more the day after that.  It is a matter of available energy and mental stamina.

			in my experience the first two weeks were the times i felt this &quot;drain.&quot; But it was brought to my attention that, that is an illusion. So i just illimunated that illusion from my train of thought, and now i can practice forever. Just illimunate that illusion.

			Yeah, I agree with musicain.  I usually just starting thinking to much.  And then i cant really do PK anymore.  Usually a lil meditation or  short break stops that.

			Would running everyday help? all are energy comes from the mitochondria and up to my knowledge, running increases the number which increases the energy one can handle or use or whatever.
<br />

<br />
either way, psi stamina can be attained through practice.

			well, some people do martial arts, and it seems like they are much more adept at producing better psi results.  Martial arts is all about discipline and stuff like that, so I think it would link to mentally flowing psi around.

			Ever watched Star Wars and the Yoda? Like how he stops a large piece of metal falling on some good guy? Thats psionics. They only call it the &quot;force&quot;. As good as todays christians calling it the force of god.
<br />
Like me, Im FAT, literally. Im fat. I havent done any workout for ages. If I move a little, my muscles ache the next day. Now if ill work out every day, my body will get stronger and ill be able to do more lenghty workout. Same with mind. Funny thing is, ive been doing macro PK for 5 days and I can move a psi wheel made from paper. Its actually easier to move a psi-wheel made from tinfoil. So... work-out and have a brain diet. What is brain diet? Brain diet means keeping useless thoughts off your mind.
