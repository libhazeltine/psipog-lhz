			I keep having a weird sensation every now and then, like I feel a precog  episode coming on, and if i trance out when I feel the time is right, I get a precog, which is accurate more often then not.
<br />

<br />
Anyone else have this feeling like you have an impending precognative episode?

			The title of this thread gives me an idea for a variation of SunTzu's precog construct. Instead of sending you the precog constantly, it could just store them so you could scan the construct to read your &quot;messages&quot;. Heh.

			yeh i totally understand what you mean. personally i think that precog i like instinct, heres one way of looking at it:
<br />

<br />
&quot;you hear a car coming around the corner before you see it&quot;
<br />

<br />
precog is much the same, you get the feeling before it happens, and like you said, you trance into it to get more information.

			I mean of course I do precog all the time, but I sometimes get a feeling like something I'm supposed to know is like &quot;...you've got mail!&quot; and I trance out and relay the information to someone who's helping me (because I remember maybe 10% of what I get when I precog).
<br />

<br />
Just wondering if anyone else has the &quot;impending precog&quot; phenomenon.

			Precog dosen't exist. It's your subconsious being smarter then you and making good guesses. It dosen't tell you how it does it, just the answer so it looks like precog.

			Explain to me how people are able to have dreams of a whole scene of something that happens before it really does if there is no precog. Like a car accident. Every detail is percise and then it actually happens all the same. Our minds are not capable of this without something else being there. If you do not belive this then please believe what I am about to tell you because I do. My half sister was going to go on a road trip with some of her friends. They had it all planned out and everything. But when my half sister got in the car she got this bad feeling, almost like being sick but more of a mental feeling and one described &quot;I have never had before.&quot; She got out of the car almost as soon as she got in and said she did not want to go. So her friends went on without her. She then told me about this feeling as soon as she walked back inside. The next day she got a phone call that three of her friends had been in a car accident and only one survived with injuries. One of the two cars that hit her friend's cars had hit the very spot where she would have been sitting if she would have gone. This was a more of a feeling precog as it sounded from what she told me. I know this is true because I was there right when she got right back out of the car. I hope you can believe that there is more to us than just our normal human minds whether or not you believe this. Personally I don't care if you believe what I have told you but I do and I hope it has helped you. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Does anyone know how to use their pm's? I didn't when I started and Apollo had to help me out. Please use pm's for things like: yes i agree. or: i dont understand.  
<br />

<br />

<br />
Anyway, I have something else to say about this subject. Somtimes I am able to get a precog coming on when I am doing a limited activity such as watching TV. This is kind of cool because someone else was talking about how they could start remote viewing while playing video games. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
