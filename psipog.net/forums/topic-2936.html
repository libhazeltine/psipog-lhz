			Hi, I can have OBE, although lately I haven't got any. However yesterday I had many dreams, and one of them felt lucid. It was about me learning psiquic abilities with a group of people. They were teaching me how to use telepathy.
<br />

<br />
One of them told my mind the world &quot;ringbell&quot;, and it had a realistic feeling to it. Then I communicated to another one, in his mind, and he agreed he got my message.
<br />

<br />
I don't know what this means, but it felt very real, like if I had really learned telepathy, although I can barely make psi balls.
<br />

<br />
Any ideas?

			I think we need a disambiguation sticky on &quot;lucid dreaming&quot;, but I don't feel up to the task. I think a lot of people are slightly confused as to what is a lucid dream, and what isn't.
<br />

<br />
avillax, were you actually <span style="font-style: italic">aware</span> that you were dreaming while in the dream? Were you able to do whatever you wanted to do in the dream? I'm sorry for putting you to the question, but your &quot;one of them felt lucid&quot; comment makes me think that you are misinterpreting the term &quot;lucid dream&quot;. In my experience, if a dream is lucid it is quite clearly lucid - none of this &quot;feels&quot; or &quot;maybe&quot; or &quot;might have been&quot; stuff that I've been seeing a lot of in the forum lately.
<br />

<br />
That's not to say that your dream is not useful or interesting. It may be, though the dreams that I've had about psionics have not been very helpful. But I want to ensure that we're all on the same page before we start using the term &quot;lucid dream&quot;.

			About 2 or 3 months ago, I said to myself &quot;I'm going to learn how to do PK really soon.&quot;
<br />
A few days later, I had a dream that Marilyn Manson (lol) taught me how to do PK. I woke up and a few hours later I moved my psiwheel for the first time.
<br />
It was weird.
