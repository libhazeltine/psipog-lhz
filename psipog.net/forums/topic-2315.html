			I'm not sure how many lucid dreamers are here, but have you been able to use telekinesis in dreams in order to practice with them. i'm not talking about just willing it to move, like you can in lucid dreams, but actually activating the area in you brain that deals with telekinesis and using it in lucid dreams. i'm wondering if anyone here has had sucess with that.

			yeah i read about that before.  You can set up an astral santum to do this.  Your own little plot in the astral world, it can change or get bigger, do w.e you watn it to.  It did sat that practice in this &quot;realm(idk w.e)&quot; helps now, never relaly tried it though.

			I've been a lucid dreamer for 4 years. It's good stuff. I have thought about, but have not practiced TK in my lucid dreams. I definately believe it would help someone increase their skill faster, but I only have enough energy to focus on one major mental aspect a day, be it lucid dreaming or psychokinesis; not both.

			I wish I could do psychokinesis like I did in my dream. I was opening and closing doors with fast speed by opening and closing my fist and rolling and moving cans, pencils, hell even my monitor...It was awesome, but then I woke up.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />

			I'm not sure where i read this but it mgiht have been on a forum. Anyway, it was about this guy who made his own realm in the astral plain and he also made a password like thing so anyone can get to it. You can try this if you want, but i havn't a clue whats in there because iv'e never visited there before. Probably just a hangout place where anyones welcome. 
<br />
To enter it you have to spin round three times (while anywhere in the astral world) and say &quot;follow the yellow brick road, follow the yellow brick road, follow the yellow brick road&quot;. Then a yellow brick road (tadda!) will appear with a door at the end. Also, it said that if you want to learn how to make a realm too then go ask for the person in charge when you get there and he will chat with you about it. oh and if the person who mentioned this is on the forum and reads this, just spreading the word. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> don't blame me if you get kidnapped in the realm, i don't know nothin.

			Erm, The only use I can see for Lucid <span style="font-weight: bold">Dreams</span> is to increase the rapport with your sub-conscious, and possibly convince it that these things are real. (However, the I don't think that 'belief' is required, while it may help some people.)
<br />

<br />
You're not atcually doing TK unless you actually move Matter - in the physical. Unless via lucid dream / astral projection, you can affect physicality - I wouldn't say this can increase your telekinetic skill, in itself.
<br />

<br />
But maybe I'm wrong.

			If dreams are the gateway to the future, I don't ever want to sleep again.
<br />

<br />
xD.
<br />

<br />
Let's just say my dreams are not...normal.
<br />

<br />
All this does is increase your belief in Pk/Tk/w/e...

<br />
Even though you're not actually moving anything, you're getting the concept right.

			Well, I've had a few lucid dreams about me having telekinesis, and I always ended up telling someone and getting in trouble. ^^ Oh well.
<br />

<br />
But that theory of yours, 3000, is pretty good. Maybe I'll try it the next time I have a lucid dream!
