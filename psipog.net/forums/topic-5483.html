			Can anyone help me with an idea on how to make objects levitate? I've been having minor success with basic pinwheel telekinesis, but I figure if I jump on levitation I can break any possible mental blocks early on. Thanks in advance.

			Um... I would really not suggest that.  You will get frustrated and leave.   Any levitation is not harder because of a mental block, it's called Gravity.  If you can't roll or slide an object then you won't be able to levitate anything (well maybe a balloon but probably not).  Sorry to shoot you down like this, but it's true.  With patience and practice, you will levitate objects, but for now... just beable to spin the wheel and slide a straw.
<br />

<br />
Good luck,
<br />

			Right, thanks. But as for my thoughts on the levitation mental block, I think there're really two blocks for me. The first being gravity (but if you know you can overcome gravity, then you can right? Thus it is a mental block to think you can't), and the second being that I'm locking myself into horizontal movement. I'm a little worried about that, but if you don't think it'll be a problem, I'll try not to.

			Systic, he's saying that levitation isn't going to destory any mental blocks...I think..I dont' know, pepsiboy spews crap most of the time.
<br />

<br />
But levitation is difficult because of the gravity. I recommend you to do 80% psi manipulation and 20% PK of your daily training, everyday. Then maybe you could levitate objects, but it's probably won't help break any mental blocks if there is any.
<br />

<br />
The only way I break a mental block is not to believe in a mental block. I don't really believe any exists, just a matter of skill.

			Heh, well if that's the case I need to work on psi manipulation about 7-8 hours :p I probably should give TK a break for a while. It's just so much fun. Todays the first time I moved the psiwheel and I can't get over it :p I'm probably rushing to levitation too fast.
<br />

<br />
Off-Topic: Well does anyone have any tips for me to work on control? I can usually make the psiwheel move when I want to, but I can't seem to be able to control the direction it moves in.

			To levitate an object, set the object in your hand and then move a buttload of energy to your palm and push it into the object. If you do it right, then, after practice, you will be able to make it float up into the air. Hopefully <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
But what you need to do to break mental blocks is this:
<br />

<br />
1. get a dvd of starwars episode 5. (the second original one)
<br />
2. rip it onto your computer and edit out the whole video and all the audio except for yoda saying, &quot;size matters not&quot;
<br />
3. put the sound on loop, with a few seconds of silence between each &quot;size matters not&quot;
<br />
4. put it on a cd or an ipod
<br />
5. listen to it every night when you go to sleep, and leave it on the entire night.    <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Pfft, lame, Star Wars is lame. Be best if you practice..I mean, mental block is just a stupid crutch in my opinion...seriously, if you cease in thought of mental blocks, then it'll never bug you. Just do it.
