			I was lying on the sofa watching Tv with my mum and dad, when i heard my mum say &quot;What time is Deal or No Deal on?&quot;, so i picked up the sky remote and flicked over to channel 4 to see what time Deal or No Deal was on. Then i said &quot;its on at 5:45&quot;, and my mum said &quot;what is&quot;, and i said, &quot;you asked what time Deal or No Deal is on&quot;, and she said &quot;no i didnt&quot;, so i asked my dad if she had said anything and he said No. Do you guys reckon this is Literal Thought Reading, or has a logical explanation, because those words she thought sounded exactly like she was saying them to me.

sorry about the poor grammar, ive currently got an IBS attack, bloody thing.

			This is funny because I'm having the same problem, but the opposite. Where everyone I am around hears my thoughts and then pushes me away from the idea when I ask about it. I've asked many times if its true, so much so my parents put me in a hospital because of it. I've looked up the facts also and I've read that up to 50% of the people alive can talk this way they just don't say anything about it out loud; I wonder why. I need help here cus its messing me up, any suggestions?

			So you are supporting the fact that all these people know what I'm saying? I've never heard of psi until recently, you would think that all these years my family and friends who of said something about it to me; and would support me when I ask them about it.
<br />

<br />
Beyond that I'm having trouble learning to shield, I'm reading the manuals written but I still can't really notice anything happening. Any suggestions?

So they can read your thoughts?  Perhaps they want you to stop asking.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Thats funny, it could be true. I have a feeling its more on my end then on theirs; like some neg attack or fear manisfestation; or me just being plain old stupid with what I hear. I have this naggin ring in my head that doesn't stop. I believe that is part of my problems, seeing as when I mess with the noise I hear people complaining in the background. I'll have to deal with this.

			sad to say I have the same problem.. i think i just have an higher inclination to telepathic projection than reading their minds... I hate it coz i so want to read and hear their thoughts. instead I get to manifest certain thoughts at them or even at some point manipulate.. Like when i was depressed and my classmate was like talking to me, since i was out of the mood, she suddenly felt a sharp pain on her heart. She couldnt explain it and she told me that it suddenly happened for no reason. Another is that when Im really thinking so hard... just contemplating on stuff, lights and even tv sets dims all of a sudden and then sometimes I could give those people around me headaches all at the same time... 
<br />

<br />
I kind of conduct a research as to where I am really good at, whether in receiving or sending... so I observed every detail of what I could do in tp. Although I could get thought concepts randomly, my telepathic sending ability surpasses my receiving skill, like when I practiced with a friend with TP... I sent a clear image of a shape and color game. Another member here also whom I practiced with told me at the end of the session that he perceived the colors that I sent very clearly and brightly... (of course when my full attention is with the practice session because sometimes I do get distracted) 
<br />

<br />
I'm just bummed because I so wanted to increase my receiving ability but instead Im prone to telepathic projection... could anyone help me as to how I could help progress my receiving ability?
