			I have a few questions about shields, i've made a few before. I made a shield on my friend, and it lasted until i got out of range, is there a way to program it to stay alive without me? Also, can you make a shield stong enough to protect from rain? Im not trying to protect myself from any attacks but just from rain for fun..

			What do you mean out of range? Anyway... Try making a psiball and tell it to stay there. See how long it lasts. Now make another one and program this one to stay around longer and see how long that lasts.
<br />

<br />
It can be any number of things from a lack of good (or any) programming... too little energy... or... I'd say that's about it.
<br />

<br />
As for the protection from rain thing... you're looking for force bubbles. You have to be pretty decent at PK to do that. Go practice PK.

			Fov: It's possible. Like Dan said, look up force bubbles. Difficult though.

			What i mean by out of range is...During school I decied to put a shield on my friend for fun, it lasted for like about more than an hour, then i went on the bus to go home while he was still at school, and the shield died about 10 mins after i left for school...make any sense?It could be the programming and the amount of energy, and thanks for the adivce  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I tried to make a &quot;prepetual shield&quot; by forming a plug in that goes directly into the earth, like an outlet for electricity.  That plug would supply a shield around my computer chair ^_^, i worked on the shield for probably 4 hours to see how long it would last. It seems as if i really, really suck at shelling, I tried to make a plastic orb, ya know those plastic tube slides in playgrounds? I remember being inside there, feeling the plastic, and all that stuff. Maybe i didn't make the plug existant enough, near the middle however, I could lean on it a little and it could actually support me! Anyway I slept for a few hours, and i'm not sure if it's there anymore... I shall keep trying!

			I don't know were to put this since the physical harm topic was closed, this doesnt talk about killing spiders though, just repeling them away from me. Alright, apparently were I live its spider season or something, because the past 3 nights I keep waking up with spider bites all over and they itch like crazy so its really annoying. Last night I attempted to make a shield to repel spiders away from me so they won't bite, I think it worked! No new spider bites this morning, either it workerd or I got lucky, im going to try it again the next few nights to see if it is really working.
