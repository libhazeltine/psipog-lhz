			Hi, My name is Cory, but most people on the web refer to me as &quot;Avy, Av, or Avvie&quot; (abreviation of my Screen name). Im 19 and a college student at UW Madison.

I've been interested in psionics for a very very long time. When I was little i used to write stories about psychic aliens and all that fun kid stuff. However, i've always liked to think, so I've always been curious about the things not in my textbooks. To me, there's always been unexplainable events in the world. Things like mothers that wake up in the middle of the night knowing their son just died in combat, strange coincidences, and amazing tales. I've always suffered from chronic sinius pain, so when i was ten I taught myself a form of crude, uh for lack of a better term, mind healing. I would sit down and think that i was not in anypain, try to feel the network of passages and vessels that were pounding and then feel them open up and release pressure. It didnt cure anything, but it did lessen the pain some. Since then I've always been convinced that the mind has an incredible amount of control over the body.

I'm also a fairly hardcore martial artist (Kyokushin-kai if you're curious about style), and as such i've grown up with a lot of talk about meditation, focus, and the concept of ki. I have no idea if the martial arts concept of ki is simply a meathod of aligning muscles in the body to perform more efficiently, or something more spiritual/psionic based. My sensei taught that the ancient japanese who developed our karate believed that the core of the body was the first to form during pregnancy, and as such, was where the soul existed. Thus, they believed that strengthening the muscles in this area and flexing them during exertion had a spiritual effect on the body, as if tapping into something greater then yourself. I cant vouch for either side, but I do know that the techniques do have a noticable effect, and as such, its something that intrigues me. I also find it curious that in alot of the articles written here about basic energy control, pooling psi into the core is a common instruction. Granted it IS the center of the body, but its a cute coincidence that makes me smile.

As for pure psionic stuff. When I entered highschool, i had a short run with empathy. Nothing major, but i began to feel extreme emotions during converstaions with people, some on the internet. These usually manifested as an idea of color and temperature. It's hard to explain... but say someone was really angery. When i talked to them, i would somehow sense the color red at the base of my neck... I could see it, but i couldnt, and the same area felt hot (the thought, not my actual body). I've always been an extremely empathetic person, but sometimes i feel like things cross beyond psychological empathy and into the paranormal. It usually only worked with extreme emotions and I had to have direct contact with the person somehow (an instant messenger chat window, line of sight, they're withing my hearing, ect). I think i might have encountered an empathic overload at school one day, I felt like someone had a remote for my emotions and was mashing buttons. I dont remember the event too clearly, i just know that soon after that, i typed a search into google and found the &quot;Playful Psychic Preperation&quot; Book found on psipog. I quickly ran through an energy tutorial, then, every night, tried to throw up an empathic sheild. I never had a second occurance of the overload, but as happens in highschool, things got busy and stressful and i stopped having episodes entirely. Only recently has what i think is empathy resurfaced, but only in EXTREME cases and in close physical proximity.

I've dabbled in PK and psi manipulation a bit and had some success feeling psi moving around, but school and social things interfered in my development. A few years back a met a person that was similarly interested, though much more skilled then I. During a conversation once she accidently sent a large amount of psi my way which i felt almost like thick air rotating around my body. It also felt warm and made me kind of tingly. It was actually kind of fun, but it only happened once. Through conversations with her, she believes that i exhibit traits of being gifted in a sort of subconcious precognition. I get gut feelings about things I shouldnt that turn out to be true and I experiance Deja Vue ALOT. So far I've predicted a tornado that hit my hometown about 30 minutes before it did (though it wasnt a blind prediction. I saw a radar and knew the storm was tornadic. The weather reported said it would miss us, but the resultant vector of the two storm cells seemed to point at us. Plus i just had a sinking sensation about the storm, it just felt like it was going to be bad. I saw a cloud that looked wrong to me and watched it for half an hour. Finally I called my dad over and the damn thing dropped from the sky. He attributes it to understanding physics, cloudshapes, and me wanting a tornado to come (always wanted to see one), but I just have a feeling it was something more *shrugs*). In truth I actually am terrified of this ability and dont want to develop it any further, if thats what it is. The future is not meant to be seen by me. Maybe someone else... my belief of fate makes future viewing impossible and I'm terrified of seeing something like death or disaster and not being able to stop it.
