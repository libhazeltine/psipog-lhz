			Well over the last few months after I got into OBEs and the like, every so often I will wake up and something weird will be happening with me. Besides the fact that my eyes are open, I can not move my body but my mind is fully functional and after a few seconds of being awake I will feel like I am sinking away from my body. I always get a buzzing sound in my ear while this is going on and my vision goes blurry but I can see and am aware of all that is around me (hard to explain...). The buzzing sound scares me alot for some reason so I always force myself to move, just a twitch of the wrist or something but if I don't actually get up and walk around, my body reparalyzes and the whole experience happens again.
<br />

<br />
I am confused as to if this is the start of an OBE or is something else wrong with me? And if it is the beginning of an OBE how do I get rid of the fear to let it happen?  
<br />

This is sleep paralysis. Some people get it; most don't. Sleep paralysis can be accompanied by hallucinations and accounts for many reports of aliens in peoples' bedrooms immobilizing people and then disappearing.

Sounds like it could be the beginning of an OBE - or it could simply be a sleep paralysis hallucination.
<br />

Because it's a new phenomenon and you aren't used to it.
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody"> so I always force myself to move, just a twitch of the wrist or something but if I don't actually get up and walk around, my body reparalyzes and the whole experience happens again.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Try this. Next time you get this, do the twitch of wrist or whatever. Then, lay your arms flat by your side, not covered by covers. Raise your forearm so it is pointing up. Now lay there, clear your mind, and think about nothing, or do whatever else triggers these phenomena. Do not think about holding your arm up. Do not think about your arm at all.
<br />

<br />
When your arm falls, it is a signal that you had just entered the hypnogogic state - the state between sleep and wake where sleep paralysis occurs. You may also notice this buzzing starting in conjunction with your arm falling. Your arm falling will of course wake you up - but it serves to let you know when you entered the hypnogogic state, so that you can become familiar with what it feels like, learn to recognize it, and become comfortable with it.
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">I am confused as to if this is the start of an OBE or is something else wrong with me?

You get rid of the fear by experiencing it many times. Each time you will become more accustomed to it, until you simply think &quot;oh, this again&quot; when it happens. The exercise I suggested above can also help.  
<br />

<br />
Perhaps also read up on some exit techniques and try one of those when this happens. If it works, then this is indeed the beginning of an OBE. If it doesn't work, it doesn't tell you anything - but it doesn't hurt to try.
<br />

Hope that helped.
