			I was hoping for this site to stay around longer.  I went into a new direction in psionics through this site and I found techniques that actualy work.  Sean, I have to say, thank you for making this site and allowing people to recieve the information of psionics.  Even though they already said it, I speak for everyone when I say that this site will sadly be missed but if you want to go to go strictly towards OBE, do so.  Your a good person and I hope you have a long healthy life and succeed in your plans with OBE.  Good day.

			Psipog has given many people a wonderful site on psionics but I think that it's time that we try and lead ourself like many of the people who run this site. Psilinks seems like the next site to move to since it has some good articles but Psipog will be the site most people thank the most for their success. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Ok, I don't know whether this has been asked or not cus I only read about 6 of the 8/9 pages. This is to Peebrain: Would it be ok if (because the main site is shutting down, and assuming that there won't be any archives or anything like that) I were to copy all of the articles and keep them in word documents for myself? I promise I won't post them without saying who the correct author was and so on, neither will I edit them or say that I helped with the making of it etc. It's just that seeing a site like psipog that has so many good articles go, I don't want that to go to waste. I would also like to put them into txt. format and keep them on my iPod so that if I get bored I could go over them and repolish some of my skills and techniques.
<br />

<br />
Don't worry, you can trust me <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> But I will understand if you say no.
<br />

<br />
Also, yeah I'm pretty sad about psipog going down too. I learnt all of the basics here and it was also where I first got good results with pk. The forums gave me a lot of confidence and was a good place to come home to after a school day. Thank you Psipog! <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Welcome back PM,

The entire site gets archived. Only the interactive parts will cease to exist. All the articles and Q&amp;A up to now will be archived. So there is really no need to copy everything.

			Dear Peebrain...
<br />

<br />
Thank you so much for the site. You've put a lot of effort into it over time, and psipog has become one of the biggest psi-related websites in the world. Even archived, it will hopefully be something you can look back on with pride.
<br />

<br />
I do feel a bit disappointed that you don't seem to want to explore the geiger counter idea further. Objective proof of something at last? If it were me I'd be trying out other instruments and seeing whether we could begin to discover what psi actually is, and how it behaves. Whereas, as I see it, you've chosen to end your scientific journey at a whiff of proof and voyage instead in the direction of things like consciousness, which are ... less amenable to hard scientific study.
<br />

<br />
Of course, it's your choice, and I wish you the best of luck and life in whichever direction you go.
<br />

<br />
Thanks again.
