			in NI's article he said to meditate, but if you meditate every time before you do tk but then you try to do tk without meditating after a while will you be able to? or will you not be able to because now you NEED meditation to do tk? what i'm saying is if you meditate a lot before doing tk, will you ALWAYS need it to do tk from now on? like when people start using their hands for tk...now they need their hands...

			Yeha, I have thought about that recently. It sort of develops a habit of the brain. A need. That's why I'm a bit uneasy about meditating before pk.

			i'm sure not meditating before attempting pk will create some sort of mental block, but it's nothing you can't get over.  the covered psi-wheel presents a mental block, but plenty of people have gotten over it.  it just may take some time and patience, but i'm sure you can get over it (not meditating).

			In a way, day dreaming about moving the psiwheel is a form of meditation. It helps you get over mental barriers easier and your mind accepts it more. So maybe if I think about moving the psiwheel and pencils may work better than meditation. After all, most of the time dreams cause people to be able to do it. Usually, when people talk about that almighty feeling that they can do anything, they said they had a dream about doing it the night before.

Try it for a week and see what results pop up and then try doing pk without meditation beforehand. The only risk with this is that you might either depend on med/ or go back a step and work back up to where you were before without med/. Bit like cold turkey I guess.

^^ this is very true, it also helps establish more of a belief that you can do it.  i was referencing to more of a &quot;hardcore&quot; meditation.  where you meditate for a half hour on moving the object, feeling the psi flow around you, clearing your mind and what not.
<br />

<br />
yeah, meditation is fine.  i encourage what psi_manipulator_3000 said, that works for me as well.  i was just saying that if you get into the habit of &quot;hardcore&quot; meditation everytime you're about to attempt pk, it might become a mental block that will take some effort to break.  but all of this does depend on the person.

			So the best thing to do is to as Psi Manipulator said &quot;Whatever floats your boat&quot;?

I was also wondering, is it best to do with or without hands?

			I've tried meditation, didn't work for me. Personally, I think meditation is for some people and no others. Some people can do it just fine without the meditation, like me for instance :]
<br />

<br />
But I say if you try meditation once and it works better, then it wont hurt to do it again; even if it does form a habit.

			i think if you meditate always before tk to do better tk , you maybe program your mind that tk need meditation before it do tk , so meditate then do anything before tk but try to stay in relax and have little thoughts then after that while go to do tk .
<br />

<br />
i think NI said that because he want the people that will do tk at first time to succed so meditation will help them alot to move the psi wheel .
<br />

<br />
you can meditate before tk but dont do that always for not to program your mind .
