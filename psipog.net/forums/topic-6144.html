			As it seems Psipogbb is on its way out (being archived) I wonder: where will you go? If there are other, similar messageboard communities, I'd be interested. Simply put, I'd like to follow the rest of this community, as I've met some friendly and helpful folks here.

Both PsiOnline and UPC are very good communities in my experience, one of them should be acceptable to you.

Yes. All things change in a dnamic environment. your effort to remain what you are is what limits you.

			For the most part I've stopped psionics except for the stuff that I did  so much that they almost became senses like bits of DMILs(healing) some scanning, manipulation and small bits of pk but I don't practice anymore so I guess I'm pretty much done. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Quite the contrary, actually.
<br />
I've learnt alot of things about myself in my time here, about myself and what i'm capable of  doing/explaining. This is in no way a quit, but i feel that maybe i've obtained all that i can from my four years visiting psipog.
<br />
I've gained alot. so no. this isn't quitting. this is moving on. 
<br />
What you have to realise is that change is inevitable. The sooner you realise that the sooner you can grow beyond constraints.

			Twice now you've made statements that assume an awful lot. You assume that I am resisting change, and my development is stunted by it. You don't know me, please don't make such assumptions. I've only been a member of this community for a short time, and though you may see your psi-related journey as complete, mine has only begun, so it is the start of many new changes for me.

			Who said my journey was complete? i'm going to be researching into the effects of psychoactives to try and look deeper into myself with them (MY choice). perhaps it will one day lead me back to a psionic community. i don't know.

also: i was talking in generalities before. (i tend to do it alot...) it wasn't intended to be personally directed at you.

			Wait so sparkz, you're gonna trip your ass off on acid and then do psionics? Sounds fun. There's a lot of information out there about what drugs do to you. Like, acid makes you crazy. Go read some of peebrain's articles about talking with your subconscious. I believe that's a good way to &quot;look inside yourself&quot; without getting scary flashbacks for the rest of your life.
