			My Tae Kwon Do place was great. my instructor didn't care about how fast u went to what belt, all he cared about was how well you know your stuff and how well you can do it. quality was the name of the game. he didn't like doing tournaments but he would if u wanted to. we where just getting into energy and stuff when i had to leave.

In Gongfu, they would be Sifus, not senseis <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Traditional Gongfu teaches the principal of Qi, but not its use.

Marrox- that would be a Qi ball... in my experience, Qi and PSI are different, and I've studied both, they feel different-related, but different.

			Well i do tai chi, it is a martial art but its not mainly used for sport. more for bettering yourself, all the moves are slow and relaxing but when you do them fast they are deadly, it takes about 5-10 years to master the art i have only been doing it a year  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> i dont think i have ever seen this art in sport but would like to.. i voted yes

			I do martial arts because I love fighting. It's not so much self defense for me as it is a way to keep in shape and have fun doing what I love to do. I don't consider it to be a way to better myself in any way other than physically. I want to start doing Tai Chi, but only because of the physical benefits.

			I do Aikido, and I love it for all aspects. It takes a long time to become proficient in the martial aspect of it. (not as long as tai chi, thankfully) but there is also a philosophical/spiritual component to it that I wont go into any further. The way of harmony is the direct translation of Aikido, to give you an idea.

			I completely agree that martial arts are more than a sport, rather they are a way of life. But where you go to learn determines everything. I spent 3 months at a Kung Fu (Shoalin Do) McDojo and got to green belt...I learned nothing. No practical street defense, no philosophy, nothing. I started reading and learning about Hapkido from an instructor at my community college. But, I'm getting more into practical martial arts I can use on the streets, like Karate and weapon oriented arts like Escrima. Either way, martial arts completely change your outlook on life, but it's important to go to a good gym/dojo.

			Martial arts do not require any form of religious belief system. You do not have to try and be a better person if you do martial arts. Hitler would be a martial artist if he did martial arts.
<br />

<br />
Martial arts are just systematic ways of fighting is all. The definition of &quot;martial art&quot; does not include anything other than that. They can be used for any number of reasons from killing others for fun, protecting others from harm, physical discipline, fighting for money and a belt, and so on. I'm atheist and I am a martial artist.
<br />

<br />
Yes, it's that simple.

			I personally feel that at the very least, martial arts gives you a mindset that is useful in a combat situation - you're already used to seeing someone swing a punch at your face, and you *don't freeze up*, which can potentially be the worst thing to do in a real fight.

			Martial arts is definitely much more than a sport. In China, when Kung Fu began to develop, they began in Shaolin (Buddhist) temples. Many Korean, Okinawan, Chinese and Japanese martial arts find their origins from Kung Fu. The three purposes of Kung Fu are to bring peace to the mind, develop spirituality and provide a method of self-defense. 
<br />

<br />
Martial arts don't really involve religion anyway. If you take buddhism at its essence it's not even a religion. Martial arts concentrate on being spiritual and bring on personal growth rather than worship deities, though there are certain sects of Buddhism that are more religious based. 
<br />

<br />
I have been independently studying martial arts for about five or six years and now I'm studying White Crane. Hopefully I'll be starting Northern Shaolin.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  Excited.
