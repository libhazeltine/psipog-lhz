Pants mentioned albinos. They have pink/redish eyes, so it IS possible to have that color. I guess it'd be total or near total lack of melanin. I ought to try that now.

Keep in mind that people with oculocutaneous albinism type 1 tend to have serious vision problems though

			Ah! Big words. Well, I have blue eyes, which are great and all, but I think that green eyes have a much more asthetically pleasing effect, so I'm going for that. I can't wait to shock all my mates at school.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: I'm almost speechless. I did the other technique that Kaiandy listed, and it worked immediatly. Like...I haven't even done it a whole two days yet...and it worked. It's not permenant yet, but if I concentrate, my eyes can become green. So, thumbs up.

			I'd like to point out something to people trying for red eyes.
<br />

<br />
Yes, people with red eyes do exist.  Most people with albinism have blue eyes but a few of them have red.  This is due to there being nearly no pigment in their eyes (so they are truely a very very light grey), but because they are so thin the red you see are blood vessels.  People with albinism are very susceptible to skin and eye damage, and many are nearly blind because their eyes are so weak.
<br />

<br />
So the next time you try for red eyes, think twice.  You're probably trying to darken them when you have to in fact lighten them, which could explain why so many of you have been getting severe headaches <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.  However, unless you want to blind yourself, I'd reconsider the colour you're going for.

			Yea, I'm definantly stopping. I'm getting a mild pain that someone previously explained (I also get that pain when I wear glasses for prolonged time because of my lack of use of my left eye and I never have a prescription on it.

			You might be getting the headache because of the color you are trying to get. Pink isn't by any means a natural eye color, and you may be trying to manipulate Melanin (sp?) to get a color that isn't possible. It seems that only the ones who are trying to gain an unnatural color are getting these headacdhes.

3rd day, I feel the progress, even thought the visible results are slow in progress.

			just for the record, the eye color is determined by how much malenin is in the front iris fibers and the back iris fibers... not pigments lol more malenin = brown, less=blue. and yes, i believe it is very possible for it to work, not sure about the technique, but i know changing of the eye color is possible. as you could probably see for yourself even, without doing anything, when you first wake up, your eyes always appear lighter right? and then they darken as youre awake longer...  or maybe its easier for me to notice because i have brown eyes, and usually when i wake up , i have medium-dark green and then they go to brown after a while. so im sure if you find the right method to work for anyone, im sure it would be easy

			I've decided on changing it to as bright a green as I can get. Been at it for around 2-3 days and I've noticed a bit of a change, but it still looks blue.  Only time will tell.
