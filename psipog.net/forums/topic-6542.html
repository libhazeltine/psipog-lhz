			Hello everyone.
<br />

<br />
Some of you may not know me, but I have been a member of this site for about a year now.  I have dealt with psionics for about 11 years now; starting at about 3rd grade, now I am a freshman in college.  Psionics has been a passion for me my entire life, and I am glad it has been for so many of you as well.  Most of the time I have focused on helping others, including on other forums, and it really makes me happy to see so many of you wishing to continue your practices in psionics, it is truly an interesting lifestyle.  
<br />

<br />
Lately, I have become so overwhelmed with work and school, I haven't truly practiced for about 7 months and I find it difficult to perform most psionic tasks.  I would like to let you all know that psionics is an ever-growing practice:  there are always new things to learn, and if you don't have the drive to learn them then the journey will be difficult and unsatisfying.  For instance, I have practiced PK off and on for 5 years now, and because I didn't have the drive to practice just a little everyday, I can barely move a psi-wheel now.  I don't want to discourage any of you, but if you truly wish to get good in psionics you have to practice--a lot.
<br />

<br />
Psionics has been my life for quite some time, and I am truly happy that I have found this awesome talent that most people don't know about or care enough about to read about it.  I have moved objects with my mind, I have journeyed outside my body, I have read other people's minds, and I have barely scratched the surface of what psionics is all about.  It is a very fun practice that can enlighten you about how things work, and inspire you to search for knowledge about anything in the universe.  
<br />

<br />
However, I feel as if there is something more-something bigger about psionics that we don't know about yet.  There are so many mysteries in this world, it is arrogant to think that we know everything about this mysterious practice.  Because of this, I will no longer be on these forums (although they are closing soon), and I will rarely be on the psionguild forums.  I wish to make up the lost years of hard practice and really boost my abilities.  It is a shame that I wasted time laying around watching T.V. when I could have practiced, especially due to my &quot;natural&quot; inclination to mental abilities.  There is a fine line between obsessed and passion, and trust me, I am not obsessed, just extremely passionate lol.  But, in contrast, I hope that none of you spend all of your time practicing and not hanging out with friends or living life, because there is more to life than psionics, so try to balance the two.  I also wish to gain more knowledge about everything around me because this is the world I live in, and I feel that if I know more about it, I will appreciate it more, and learn more about myself.  I don't just mean the environment, I mean the metaphysical and the psychic as well.  
<br />

<br />
I know that because of my experiences with psionics, I percieve things a bit differently than others.  Better?  Not exactly.  And you all are the same.  We share in common the interest in psionics, and it may be due to our individual psychologies and interests, but it may also be for a different reason, one with an underlying meaning.  None of us can know for certain.  
<br />

<br />
This site, and the guild's site have both helped me out tremendously.  Whether it was giving me guidance on PK, or letting me know that there are others out there who are experiencing the same thing (such as overloading at a mall or school because of all the people, or creating power outages when you are stressed) and that helped me cope with what was going on.  This was a great site, but without all the awesome people here, this site would be crap.  Seriously.  And I'm not trying to flatter you all, you are all great people and if no one can see that about you, they are blind.  If you feel like you are worthless, I have been there.  I was suicidal and depressed for 10 of the 19 years of my life, but now that is all behind me.  I have a fiance' and I am excelling at school in the nurse-anestesiast program.  What I am trying to say is times change, people don't, and it will all get better from here.
<br />

<br />
I'm sure you are reading this long (my personal longest) post and wondering &quot;ok, where's the hook?&quot;  Well, there is none.  I didn't know that I was going to create a thread.  I don't know what I'm going to say next.  I don't even know what I'm saying now, or trying to say, and that's the beauty of it.  This is coming straight from the heart.  I just wanted to reveal some more of myself than you may already know, I wanted to give my last bit of guidance before I start my own journey in psionics and self-knowledge, I just wanted to tell anyone who is depressed or hates themselves that it will be alright, I just wanted to give my goodbye before the site is archived.  As you can see, my post is very scrambled and that's how my thoughts are:  they are random, but not idiotic.  And, since I'm not thinking before I type, that's how my post will be.  
<br />

<br />
We are all meant to do something, and you will see that in your life.  Your friends will grow apart, your family and friends will go their own ways, they will live, and they will die, just like all of us.  We have a short time on this planet, and you need to make the best of it.  Don't spend your time worrying about things, spend it living.  You only get one shot, so don't screw up.  And by screw up, I mean get old and have regret in your life.  Don't be the old man/woman on his/her death bed wondering &quot;what would have happened if I would have asked johnny/jane out to prom?  Would we have got married?  Would I have still died alone?&quot;  Don't leave room for regret.  Most importantly:  spend time doing things you love.  If you love psionics, then practice psionics and be the best damn psion you can.  If you are only practicing psionics to get some 1337 DBZ skillz, then go do something else.  I don't want to seem like I am lecturing you all on life skills, especially since I am only 19 as of Januarary 11th, but these are things that I think of.  I want what is best for my family and friends, I want to protect them.  And since you all are my family, I want to protect you.
<br />

<br />
So........my last paragraph on Psipog.....this is very weird.  But exciting.  The rest of my life lays before me, the rest of my psionic journey is in front of me....My chemistry lab is tommorow, and my first anatomy test is this week....Most importantly, a new begining....Quiting smoking....Moving bigger and heavier objects....reading people's minds.....more advanced combat practice....Living and dying....Afterlife.  We are all on a journey in life, to a destination unknown.  Suprises lie at every corner.  A mix of bumpy and smooth patches of road, and rivers that we must cross.  Checkpoints where we will see how far we have come, and how far we have to go, into the sunlight, on the highest peak of the mountains, in the deepest fathoms of the oceans.  The world is ours, and we are the future.  And someday, our paths may cross, friends of Psipog...and on that day, we will enjoy each others company and stories of our experiences.  So until then, I leave you with a saying...One that has been in my signature since the begining, and one I will remember until the end of time:

I don't know who thought up the idea that &quot;life is short,&quot; but if I had a time machine, they'd be one of the first people I'd hunt down. Now, let's assume there is no afterlife. What are you gonna do that's longer than life, exactly? And what are all you people doing that takes up so much of your life? Now, let's assume there is an afterlife. If there is, it will probably continue into eternity, in which case you'll eventually forget about this terrible place known as life anyways.
<br />

<br />
I'm actually seeing the exact opposite. Every time I've tried to move my life in a particular direction, it's failed. Every time I tried to let my life move into a particular direction on its own, it suddenly stopped moving.
<br />

<br />
The rest of your post, however, makes sense to me. Good luck with your life, and try not to run across the line from passion to obsession.

No, you would still probably feel regret. The way most humans live their lives will most certainly end up with regrets. 
<br />

<br />
I'm not going to say anything else to you though.

Except one thing!

That last name, that first name, that age! I wonder if I know you...

Do you have a little brother named &quot;Jordan&quot; by any chance?

Really? Have you even talked to the elderly? The vast majority of them do not regret past mistakes, yet the mistakes they might've made, but had never took the chance to find out. You realize when you're old there was no reason, not to take that chance and put yourself out there. <span style="font-style: italic">Missed</span> opportunities are what most will end up regreting.

I don't know what position you are in to say &quot;vast majority.&quot; But I have read things about this subject. But in &quot;normal&quot; terms, I agree with you.

Maybe when you are in your deathbed, you will see what I am talking about. Unless, you want me to show you now...

No, you would still probably feel regret. The way most humans live their lives will most certainly end up with regrets.

Really? Have you even talked to the elderly? The vast majority of them do not regret past mistakes, yet the mistakes they might've made, but had never took the chance to find out. You realize when you're old there was no reason, not to take that chance and put yourself out there. <span style="font-style: italic">Missed</span> opportunities are what most will end up regreting.

Well how about being a volunteer in an old folks home for a position? Also, there was a nation wide survey recently done, with exactly this topic as the question (What you most regret?) which solidifies my point. A HUGE majority of the elderly/older person's stated what I said. It was over 90%.

I don't know what you think you can show me......PM me....but it better not be nonsense.

			I just wanted to say that I was a bit overdramatic with my post...I was in a weird mood (a very weird mood) and just started typing everything that came to mind.  With the closing of the forums approaching I just want to wish everyone good luck, thanks for all the help I received, I'm glad if I helped anyone, and hopefully I will &quot;see&quot; some of you again in the future.  So, with all that said:  Have fun, good luck, hope to &quot;see&quot; you again lol.
