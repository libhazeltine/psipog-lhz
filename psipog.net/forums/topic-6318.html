			Hey, what's wrong with noobs? Maybe they wouldn't be noobs if you'd stay here and teach them instead of abandoning ship.

Unless they truely believe Naruto stuff is real, there's nothing wrong with them.

EDIT: Also, if you're leaving, good luck with your future psionic practices. (Fine, abandon us, dang psions...)

It is not about mastering Psi, it's about mastering the mind. Noobs are people going around shouting about stuff they have no understanding of, and yes PsiPog has become overrun with them.

On the other hand, newbs are respected (most people respect them atleast). They are eager to learn and do not go around shouting stuff they have no understanding of, lie about experiences etc.

Noobs/Newbs, it's kinda different.
