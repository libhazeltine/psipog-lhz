			I had the weirdest experience; this happened not only once, couple of times actually.  The first time I was sleeping in my room, then woke up some times at night, but only thing I can feel is my eyes... I can’t move any part of my body??? I freaked out, I had no idea weather I was dreaming or was I awake... every thing felt so real, I can see my room , out side was dark, I tried to scream, then I found out I cant even move my lips ?! I calmed my self down closed my eyes?! When I woke up in the morning I was ok lol , second time was in the living room during the day, am a light sleeper, I never fell asleep during the day . but that day I was tired, got home then fell asleep on my coach , same thing happened this time, I opened my eyes, I saw the clock moving, TV was still on, but I coundt move my body ?? So I tried to calm down then closed my eyes, next thing I know is I woke up and feeling all fine. It was very weird, any one has any idea what it is ? or am I sick ?

			I tried to astral project last night. First time I've tried in a couple years. I don't know if I was close, or what but I did have a weird, cool feeling...feeling through out my body. It was tingly and I kinda felt like I was starting to float up, but was being held down, like I was tied down. My eyes were closed but I felt like I could vaguely see the room around me anyway. I mighta just been tired though or my mind was creating thinga based on expectations.

			Called sleep paralysis, your mind wakes up but your body is still asleep. That's pretty much all it is, you've got something good there for inducing OBE's if you can force the state to happen.
