			well i have been thinking for quiet some time now, and i think if you really want to get good, dont look at articles....
<br />

<br />
  The reason i say this, is because when you are reading an article, you are reading how someody else did this. it is just what another person did. the other person is comfortable with the way of teaching their mind. (now if you are fine with articles that is all fine and great, disregard everything i am saying), but i think that making up your own techniques is the best way to learn. over my time of psionics i have tried articles and failed, but when i make up my own technique, it helps alot.
<br />

<br />
What i am trying to say is, when u are out there, searcing for some good articles... sit down and think how you could accomplish this task... a way that is familiar to you. because if you do something that u like and are familiar with, then your mind will learn easier, and you will succeed
<br />

<br />
This is what i do to learn and i have had great success. You should at least concider this post, and try it out once. i would love to hear peoples feedback.

			Somewhere on Psipog (probably several places), it says that if those techniques don't work, you should come up with your own. The articles aren't supposed to be read like encyclopedias, they're more like guidelines, meant to give you an idea on how to accomplish something. And from what I've seen, the techniques presented in the articles work for a lot of people. They work flawlessly for me. It really depends on the person.

			yea, like i said , for some people this does work easily, but i think that it would work alot better if you made up your own way before looking at an article.

			Yes i agreee, but as Eldibs said, The articles aren't supposed to be read like encyclopedias.
<br />
When you read an atricle by one author about moving a soda can, then you read from another author about spinning a psi wheel, the chances are very high that those two authors have different techniques. lets say that one author said (to move the soda can) that you should imagine a hand coming out from your head, that pushes the can. Then , the psi wheel article says that to move the psiwheel, you should become one with the object and move it like one of your body parts. The next thing you learn will be harder, beacuse now you have gotten used to two different techniques, and you wont know which one to use.
<br />

<br />
The more things you learn, the harder it will be to get used to all of the different techniques.
<br />

<br />
All i am saying is limit yourselves to how many articles you RELY on to learn. 
<br />

<br />
Also dont get used to any techniques other than your own. This is my way of succeeding. If you agree great, if not thats great too, because then you are not listening to what i am saying, and making your own way, therefor you did get something out of my post.

			I read articles only to see some creative thinking to improve my own methods. I know your own methods is the best way, its how I been doing it. But I still think its a good idea to spread ideas.
