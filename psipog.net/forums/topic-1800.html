			Salutations all,
<br />

<br />

<br />
Well demoralization is starting to sink it, for it seems almost like my abilities of Psychokinesis have been sucked from me. For the longest while I had a down time on my psychokinetic abilities, not being able to hone them as I once had. Now I cant even seem to move the psiwheel with ease.
<br />

<br />
I had chalked it up to being in a slump and then a session of depression just dragging out the slump but its been far to long. I also tried chalking it up to 'locking' my mind on a psiwheel but even my normal psiwheel is seeing a diminish when I try to use my abilities, let alone my spare changable tops.
<br />

<br />
Though I have noticed time and time again my abilities work in odd ways, at some points in time my skill in some fields will just drop suddenly, then some time after the initial drop I start to get subconsious, or unintentional, spurts of another ability of psionics. Though usually once the spurt is done things will level out to normal, odd no? Anyways the spurt of my little precognative &quot;episode&quot; is done, also the few little &quot;almost OBE&quot; happenings as well, but my abilities in psychokinesis and clairvoyance still remain diminished... This worries me since its heavily diminished.
<br />

<br />
I've tried practicing and keeping at it but not much help is happening there. Also I have not diminished my belief of Psionics, given the control I had over the psiwheel, I do try to tell myself &quot;No no, see this is easy to do, come on you can do it!&quot; and simular things, but it seems to be of no accord. Does anyone else have the same kind of issue or can anyone lend me some advice or what not? I wish to get back to where I was, but it seems even my innate ability to comb over my mind and solve internal issues isnt helping much, so I turn now to experience, if infact others do cope with the same perdiciment i'm in and have been in.
<br />

			I've tried doing it in a very relaxed state not caring about the outcome, all I accomplished was a wobble for a bit. Also some messy and interval movements to point an edge at my chosen finger. It's why I concluded there may well be something else in the works, but as to what I am clueless. 
<br />

<br />
Do note this isnt a one day thing, this has been happening for a while now, the depression was well over a month ago, I'd say this has been happening for a month and half, just about that long.

			Shadow Wolf, there are some days I can't bend spoons and my acquaintance, Uri Geller, will tell you the same thing. I don't know how to solve it. My fingers will actually start shaking, as if the energy is trying to push through an energy blockage. My advice is just to be patient.
<br />

Peace as always

			Yes some days, but a rough and very quick estimate of time has pointed this orgins at a month and a half as i've said. I am well aware of &quot;off days&quot;, but this is turning into &quot;off months&quot;. I know a few days of bad practice isnt anything to ask on the forum about, but closing in on two months is. Double this with the fact that there was a two month period where I didn't practice psychokinesis at all and I still retained much of the skill I had when I stopped. This was a sudden drop off and remains for the time I stated above.

			well, i cant say that I've been through the same predicament as you, but I've taken longer breaks from PK, probably about 6 months at the most.  Still when I began practicing again, it would at least wobble and maybe spin every now and then.  I just started practicing daily about 3 days ago, getting better.  
<br />

<br />
I can't say I've had any off &quot;months&quot; though.  I've gone through quite a few depressions the past year and a half though (more than I can ever remember)  If you're still depressed, it would probably be a good if you just let your mind get out of the gutter.  But anyway.  That probably wasn't of much help.  All I can say is dont get your hopes down, maybe try that suggestion of other PK related things.

			ShadowWolfX I have the same here now for about 1 month but I just take a break for a week(this week) and just meditate longer(without any psionic practice)
<br />
and at the end of this week I'll se if it worked.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> 
<br />
something I have noticed is I have A LOT MORE energy then before I can literally fell it in my fingers(mainly) and I was &quot;extremly much energy left&quot;
<br />
after some training(sport)else I uasally get really tierd after that but some how I just wasent so tierd..
<br />
maybe try to listen to some (&quot;calm&quot;?) music while having some pk practice? <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
good luck!

			Try changing your technique of transferring energy. I had a similar type of slump, I used to be able to move the wheel by &quot;pointing&quot; at it with 2 fingers, but now I don't seem able to: I can however move it by cupping my hands around the wheel, like a radar directing all the energy from my hands into it.

Also I have tried many different techniques, hand anchorings, visualizations and the likes but none seem to be working. I have also taken breaks on practices during this long time but nothing is showing any improvement.

Very sure, as I can do it the same with one hand - and if I'm feeling good I can do it by pointing again, even from a few metres away.
