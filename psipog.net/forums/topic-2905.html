			Okay, I have been trying OBE's since the beginning of this year and I just can't do it!! Let me tell you my method and then you tell me your comments on it. First, I lay down, close my eyes and try to put my body to sleep. I get the vibrations and then I just can't get out of my body.
<br />
My questions to you are:
<br />
   1. Do you close your eyes when trying to OBE?
<br />
   2. What do you do when trying to exit?
<br />
   3. How many minutes (or hours) does it usually take for you to get 
<br />
       thrown out of your body?

			I don't think i've OBE'd yet but I have a pretty good idea on what i'm supposed to do. 
<br />
yes you close your eyes.
<br />
I try to visualize my astral body shaking away from my physical body, I start with my hands trying to move away from my physical body, and then the rest eventually after.. I don't know.

0. Yes you can do it. Saying that you &quot;just can't do it&quot; is your major problem.
<br />

<br />
1. Yes.
<br />

<br />
2. Nothing, or an exit technique.
<br />

<br />
3. Varies depending on my level of mental background noise. Between 15 minutes and 2 hours. After 2 hours I'm usually asleep.

			I've been practicing OBE for a VERY long time, I still have much trouble doing it. It feels like my head never gets out, and when it almost does it, I lose focus and go back. It's a hard skill and you can't go past a certain limit by just trying, you have to actively look for your weaknesses and solve them. Try to feel what goes out, experiment as many methods as you can and find the best one. Think about what you're doing wrong. Hope this helps

			ive tried obe long time too...
<br />
first it was like this : you must be not lazy...keep practising and you will succeed.I tried long long time ( 1.5 years..almost 2 years ) and now i know that its not a technique...Its your inner skill.
<br />
drop this idea to go feel obe.When you will be ready - you will simple wake up in dreams and you will be conscious and safe ( you wont be scary of ghosts, you wont loose concentration about that you are here and now )
<br />
thats my opinion.

			One small extra: Robert Bruce reccomends taking off any metal next to your body (rings, necklaces, body piercings, etc). He says that the metal can prevent you from exiting.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I've never had trouble OBEing while wearing a ring and necklace.

			pyro: obeing is a high level skill. it comes more naturally to some than others. i wouldn't be surprised if it took about a year or more. I'm not bashing your skills when i say that, but it seems to me that that's kind of the average. 
<br />

<br />
it all depends on your mental ability. don't fret though, the more you do it and the less you stress you WILL be able to do it once you just let yourself do it. just let go and let it happen.
