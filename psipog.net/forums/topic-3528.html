<br />
This part is just to give you a little background about my experience in telekinesis and how I got started and what led me to my technique and theories.
<br />

<br />
When I first started I had to practice 2 hours a day (1 hour blocks morning and evening) for 3 weeks straight until I saw any results.  I got better and better at the psiwheel (could only do the foil psiwheel for a long time as it seemed much easier) but I had a hard time moving on, and to build my confidence I would relapse into spinning just the psiwheel and conforting myself saying &quot;well, at least I can move this.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I have moved on from that mentality, the best I can hope to be with that sort of thinking is someone able to perform parlor tricks to amuse people, and I don't have much of a want for that.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Theories</span>
<br />
A belief alone that you can move large objects does not make it so.  The good news is that there is one sure fire way to convincing your subconscious to let your conscious mind use more advanced telekinesis, and we use this technique everyday...that is practice.
<br />

<br />
You must understand the way your subconscious works, many times communicating with it and building mental translators for the feeling it sends you is useful, but ultimately I find that I cannot &quot;convince&quot; my subconscious of much except what I show it that it needs.  Just like building up a tan, though it can be enhanced psionically, the most sure fire method is to be out in the sun.  Such it is the same with telekinesis.
<br />

<br />
When you understand that the more you try to move small tiny objects, the more your subconscious says &quot;ok this is what we need to move, and this is the results he expects&quot; then that will be your realization.  This is my humble theory and so far has led me to gain telekinesis ability much much faster than when I started.
<br />

<br />
Citing a reference by NI in his advanced training manual it says: &quot;There is an easy law I've figured out during my research: You won't have 100% control over the psi-wheel if you can't move pencils . Maybe it sounds stupid, but that's the way it is. To accomplish a level you have to be already on another, more difficult, level.&quot;  For full article reference please click <a href="art-fire-and-ice.html0" target="_blank" class="postlink">here</a>.
<br />

<br />
What this quote means to me is that the BEST way to advance in telekinesis is by NOT moving objects.  That is to say, by attempting to move something very large your subconscious makes that object its goal and works towards moving that object rather than something smaller.  Once again to repeat, this doesn't mean to say that if you only realize that you can move anything that you then have that power, because that is fluffy bullshit.  You must practice, practice and practice.  I believe the mind has the power to move any matter, but whether your subconscious allows you that ability is up to you and how much you work at it.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Experience</span>
<br />
So now that you have heard my theories on the subject, let me share with you some of my experiences.  Personally every time I tried to move on to a bigger object, it was always &quot;hard&quot;.  By hard I mean that it didn't move like the smaller object did before, infact it usually took me a long time even to move it a little.  I feel like I have the same problem even when I try to move a different object that is &quot;about&quot; the same weight, in other words, there is a similar learning curve after I have been practicing with a single object and then try to move onto a different one (it does not seem to matter if it is larger or even smaller!, although I admit smaller or less heavy objects do &quot;seem&quot; easier).
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Backwards Technique at Work</span>
<br />
My technique is simple, practice is the key to my success at larger objects, so I practice on large objects and the more I do so, I gain mastery automatically on smaller ones.  It seems so simple, and I guarantee you...it is.
<br />

<br />
I can't really comment on if it works for everyone, as most of my friends believe in telekinesis, but aren't that interested to practice themselves.  I'd be very interested to hear of the results from others that have tried this method.
<br />

<br />
Goodluck in all your studies, and remember:  You can take from life whatever you wish, as long as you are willing to do the work to get it.

			It seems like it should work, people who do sports sort of do the same thing. Long-distance track runners run, like, eight miles just so that they could have the endurance to run a two mile race. I see no reason why this wouldn't work  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

There is no reason why this shouldn't work. I'm gonna try it out!

			If you guys wouldn't mind documenting how long it took you to move from stage to stage before this method and after that would be really cool.  That is one thing that I didn't do myself and I sort of regret it.  Kind of like a before and after picture <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I have been thinking in the same  myself. Some people start straight on pencils, for instance, and seem to have some luck with that.. Your posts provides a vague explanation of why that is. You have motivated me to practice on bigger objects. ^^

Yes that definately has been working for me.  Sometimes I can't move the psi wheel at all so I try moving something bigger like rolling a pen.  Haven't moved the pen yet but after a while of taking turns with the psi wheel and the pen the psi wheel will start to spin when I'm focusing on it.
