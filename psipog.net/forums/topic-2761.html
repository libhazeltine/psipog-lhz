			Could the practice of psionics cause a sleeplessness, strange dreams (almost sleepwalking), and headaches?
<br />

<br />
1)I never have headaches, but in the last week I've had so many! It could be a weather change, or it could not be...
<br />

<br />
2)All night I'll wake up from a dream, tossing, turning, and very uncomfortable (more than usual... much more).
<br />

<br />
3)My dreams are the strangest. I usually sleep VERY soundly. Nothing will wake me. But I'm lucky if I get a couple hours in now. Especially in the last week, I'll sit up and have a conversation for 5 minutes before I realize I'm awake and not speaking to anyone. I've dreamed several times in one night (for example) that I was laying next to someone with my arm on him, and he wouldn't move or respond to things I was saying to him (yes, I was talking audibly). I touched him and said, &quot;Hey, what's wrong?&quot; With actual concern he was angry with me, or ignoring me (my point is the extreme realism of these dreams). It took me many moments to realize I was looking down into the empty darkness of my bed and a pillow.
<br />

<br />
The other night I dreamed that there were the tiniest pieces of worms I dreamed I left on my bed (the thing is, is that these dreams are all things I MIGHT have done, or DID do, with a little weirdness added in --- I was taking care of a baby bird and feeding it worms in a tupperwear). Well, I dreamed I left the tupperwear on my bead INSTEAD of putting in it the fridge (like I did) and that I dumped th em over. There were worms squirming all over me and my bed, and a friend wouldn't pick them up off of me. I was begging for them to be taken off but he/she wouldn't. I woke up, angry, and frustrated these dreams kept occuring (I dreamed about the worms several times) and woke up hitting my bed.
<br />

<br />
They are so real it takes me a long few moments to realize they aren't around me. Or anything I dream about!  It seems all these come in between a state of awake and sleeping.
<br />

<br />
This is so unusual for me. These dreams are not nightmare-like, and yet I wake up from them just as afraid. They are happening every night, including last night, and I decided I wanted to ask ya'alls opinion on this one. If anyone would know, it would be you guys.
<br />

<br />
Could this altered state be an affect of the practice of psionics? If not, what could be causing all this?

			I'd say stress. And practicing Psionics can cause stress if it takes forever to do something right. If you are stressing, take a break.

			i think that the headache is just you unlocking that area of the brain. If you think of it like a muscle, then if you first started lifting weights, it will hurt your arm at first. If its serious migrane type headaches, then ya, take a break. But, dont worry about them.

			Also, for the headaches, I've been in that situation.. Shielding will help you alot with this.. Ask Bob Stew if you need help with that kind of shields <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> It really did help me <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Yeah lately when I start doing anything related to it, I start to have headaches.. on the side I have been trying to start up Lucid dreams, and OBE's, so maybe it's just in the pain of trying to get it goin. Eventually it should. I hope.

			Just relax when youre practicing.  It shouldnt hurt. I've been doing it for 3 yrs and when i first started my head hurt.  You're just starting to let out the power and i WILL feel uncomfortable unless you just let if flow out. dont push it, dont rush it.  You rush You might get hurt.  Depends on how much your mind can handle. It can get dangerous if you dont know your own limits. <img src="images/smiles/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" border="0" />

<br />
The dreams.....hmmm....i really dont know much about dreams...but it might help if you meditate before going to bed.  Try that. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Good Luck

			i think its an energy drain problem. i myself have been having a constant headache since after my first time practicing and on that first time i was able to do semi advanced things (such as constructs and psipets) easily but not exactly powerfully. 
<br />

<br />
i didnt start having this headache until after i stopped using psi. i think im constantly using it and im just so drained that im expericing negative things.
<br />

<br />
just last night ive been waking up from dreams(as in waking up all through the night) about me practicing psionics with others and controlling things. usually in a group making a gaseos blob inside the circle we made that was similiar to what you see when looking at extreme heat( like a mirage) I wake up discovering my hands swirling around as if i was making psiballs. 
<br />

<br />
go to my vampirsism article it seems to have helped me and it may be the cause.
