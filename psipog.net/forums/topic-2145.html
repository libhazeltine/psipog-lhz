			<span style="color: green">   I have barely made the psiwheel move however I think I am on the right track. I was trying Apollo's laser shot method, imagining a stress/force-like substance spontaneously hitting the psiwheel. I felt the stress/force of the substance hitting the psiwheel in my hands and it was not doing anything. (I know this method is not designed for the psiwheel, but i was trying anyway.) 
<br />
   But then I remembered from NI's post the advice of &quot;letting go&quot;, so this stress was there in my hand I was holding/generating it there. Then in a relaxing feeling I let go of the force/substance off from my hand to escape at my finger tips. The idea being almost like a psiball, except the the psi goes from the hand to psiwheel instead of the other hand, and it's like the psiball you feel; you just &quot;let go&quot; it in the direction you want the wheel to move. 
<br />
   I've gotten it to work 3 or so times, I think it doesnt last long and barely moves because I'm visualizing it leaving too quickly. 
<br />
    <img src="images/smiles/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" border="0" /> I just realized Apollo's method says to feel the force hitting the object, could that be the same thing as &quot;letting go&quot; of the force? Because to feel it hitting is not-feel you holding it (i.e. it was let go). 
<br />
Well I just thought I'd share what I did, it combines energy manipulation and TK methods.
<br />

<br />
I was very careful to keep out wind, all A/C vents closed, door closed, including I was wearing a bandana on my face to keep my breath from ruining the effect and I wasn't moving my hand at all. 
<br />
I did notice a slight movement when I felt like I was letting go of the force.</span>

			when the psi hits the object, what i meant is that all stress and force from that psi shot should disappear into the object (ie letting go).  I am glad it worked for you <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Yeah we're on the same page then, &quot;let go&quot; is a good concept. I've been practicing wrong until i figured out what you guys are actually thinking. However my technique is still amateur and needs practice(it barely moves!)and I shall <span style="font-style: italic">definitely</span> practice.  I'm definitely gonna keep it in mind for energy techniques also.

			I'm trying to slide/roll a ball of foil, I can feel the ball totally in my hands, as if I am holding it. I feel it moving, but it doesn't move.
<br />
Should I let the feeling of the ball go in one direction?
<br />
I tried the laser shot technique but it didn't work.

			You probably should jump around differnet methods like that.  Stick with one for a while, see how it goes.  Pick which you get the best &quot;feel&quot; for.

			I used to be jumping around techniques, but its important to understand what our teachers understand from it. From what i understand Gonzo if you let the feeling go in a direction, you're still holding it(still feeling it). The feeling should just leave and you should imagine it going into the object or direction, don't feel it going there, I think that will hinder you. But thats me
<br />

<br />
edit: also note how Apollo says to look away and do a math equation or something, i think it helps the feeling to disappear and the force of the feeling to disipate into the object

			Just wondering, but cant the laser shots be creating a link? Like, when using telepathy? Maybey the releasing or let go method is simply giving the object the info. I know when i do pk, i tend to feel intense preassure like dense air around the object. Lemme know what you guys think. It could be psi.

			I think it would be just the same as using psi directly from your hands, because i can put my hands right next to the psi wheel, and it will spin right away.  It could be that you are flowing psi out of your sub-c, and instantly sending it to wherever you are wanting to TK something... like a lazer. bang.

thats what i feel, but in &quot;let go&quot; method you drop your attention on the pressure, I can feel pressure but it doesnt do anything if I don't let go. Some people don't need to let go I guess. As for a substance called Psi, it may only be in our minds, it may not be measureable. Other PsiPog experts have not neccessarily believed Psi the substance is real, its debatable. Some momentum transfer happens that's for sure, but how it happens who knows. I know Psi is good metaphor for something you feel in energy techniques

Letting go is meant as let the pressure you feel in your hands when connecting with objects go to let it move, not about letting stress go.
<br />
To get rid of stress there are other techniques like meditation or yoga but thats not what this topic is about.
