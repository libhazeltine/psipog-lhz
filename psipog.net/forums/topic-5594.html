<br />

<br />
Ok to me this is strange and I wondering if anyone can explain it
<br />

<br />
Ok on a game I play, when I think of it I think of this place with a hill and a parking lot
<br />

<br />
For psionics I see a shop center by the mall
<br />

<br />
Lots of other things too
<br />

<br />
When I think of a certain things I think of different places or colors that seem to have no significance with what Im thinking
<br />

<br />
Its starting to bother me, can anyone explain it?
<br />

<br />
My grammar is probaly off but Im tired

			I have that also. We all have I assume.
<br />

<br />
I believe it is just that we have associated some things with certain places, sounds, smells etc. There probably has been some sort of relationship between that game and that parking lot in the past.

			Well the strangest thing is that I dont even know this place. Again I think it is the parking lot is by the mall and the mall is a hill. Maybe theres something special about the mall. Maybe its because their is so much energy because all of the people.

			Sounds like a type of synaesthesia to me. relating certain things with other visual or aural things. for example, one person with synaesthesia would get different flavours in his mouth depending on what words he heard.

			I'm overjoyed when I hear about things like this with people. Although i have not yet experienced anything besides this constant intense shaping of my chakras I'm beginning to basically understand that
<br />

whenever something automatically starts happening without your trying that means your body is making it a habit and your gettting more and more powerful. You should begin creating training expercises around using that skill and increasing it and see how far the rabit whole goes.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I dont know the exact answer to your question. But in general, that is what usually happens when telepath X or clairvoyant y starts experiencing random shit for no reason. Your getting more powerful. Be happy.

			TheTelepath dosen't know what he's talking about; don't listen to him.

Your subconscious makes links of certain things to certain other things mentally. Like for the letter A alone I link to red or B to blue or Z to grayish black. For you the connections seem to be nonsensical and very vivid. I would suggest doing any number of techniques to reach your subconscious directly such as communing with it or lucid dreaming and manually rewriting certain connections or just telling your sub. to stop being stupid.
