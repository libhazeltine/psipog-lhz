			Most of the time, you can't feel them physically, it's more of a &quot;sensing&quot; feeling.  Make your own psi balls, see how they feel, have someone else make a psi ball and try to feel it.. is this thread in the right forum?

			Touch something, memorize the feeling. Then go over that feeling in your mind. Then think, how would that next object feel. Then just start mentally grasping objects around your room and _feel_ them in your mind. Then just find a good visualization for scanning or sensing. I usually visualize a huge radar beam sweeping across my apartment and all things psi will make a hole in that beam. Then i know where they are. Then i just grasp that psi thing and feel it. I get a lot of information about it that way, i just sense it's shape and color or even if it's hot or cold.

			Its a &quot;feling&quot; like when you sometimes you &quot;feel&quot; like this is not right or its not wrong...or like senesing something there? if that has ever happened to you. that could explain it more.

			all this talk about feeling things made me walk around my house, and use all my 5 senses on anything and everything i can find. Since this psi training started, i've gained a way better understanding of matter, textures, feelings, energies..
<br />
Thanks Psi! XD

			I use 2 of my 5 real senses to detect psi. 1st i use tact to detect disturbances in the air, also i use my eyes to detect psi constructions (like an auric vision). However its really difficult to distinguish a psiball(for example) from the energy that glows around your hand. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />
<br />
Also you need some kind of 6th sense to detect psionic energy. You can't see it with your eyes cause its a thing that hasn't shape, you can't really touch it cause isn't physically there. So you will need to sense it. Try this. Stay at home sit down at floor or in a chair Now try to sense all the things that are around you, the television the table the air the shape of the chair the sounds of your neighbourhood, the birds that pass by near your home. When you really can sense or distinguish some of this things you also would be able to distinguish psionic energy cause its like a buzzy element.
<br />
Anyway I've problems detecting psi. Its really hard to detect the form and those things I only can say if its there or not  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
