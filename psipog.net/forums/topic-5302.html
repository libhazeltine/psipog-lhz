			Well yeah kinda what it says.  I cant remember many other dreams from the night but I had two in the morning.  The one I remember is after my mom woke me up and I went back to sleep.
<br />

<br />
Ok well it was kind of weird.  The first part of the dream i was really small and somehow in the mall of america because I saw the mighty axe and stuff.  Then there was this guy who could make nightmares out of your dreams I think.  Anyway, later on, somehow there was a &quot;portal&quot; to another dream that was above my head.  The first time i sqeezed in I got kicked out because I knew it was a dream.  The second time, I was able to stay in.  What was weird about it though is the dream I KNEW I was in was in essence a lucid dream of the first dream reality.  So in a sense I wasn't actually having a REAL lucid dream, I was in a dream lucid dream. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  I did have control over most things but some things I couldn't control.  (oh ya I had to fight that nightmare making guy too, pretty sweet)

			It's really weird, but it's something similar to what I've got this night too.
<br />
I just was dreaming and suddenly something like &quot;I'm lucid, I can control this dream&quot; came in my head, and I start being in a sort of lucid dream.
<br />
I could controll most things but not everything, and I stayed in there for long enough I think (I was flying in the night over my city <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />).
<br />
Hey, this is my LD-like I've ever had  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />
The funny thing is that I really didnt care about doing a LD, it just happened  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
