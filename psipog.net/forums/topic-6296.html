			I understand how Fire/Ice PK works, it's just how fast the molecules are going basically, but how exactly does Electric PK work?
<br />

<br />
I think a lot and I've come up with a few theories on different things, but I really don't know how this works. If someone could explain it to me, I'd be greatful.

That would be the best guess.  Seeing as how that's what electricity IS, the movement of electrons... yeah, Electro-PK would most likely have to do with that.
<br />

<br />
And for those of you who don't know, electrons are those tiny little negatively-charged particles that swarm around atoms, which are the building blocks of life.  There are, in a perfect atom, the same amount of electrons as there are protons, which are positively charged, and reside within the nucleus of the atom along with neutrons, which have no charge.
<br />

<br />
By the way, if you ever look at a periodic table of the elements, the atomic number of each respective element tells how many protons are in the nucleus.  Which means Hydrogen, at Atomic Number 1, has 1 proton and 1 electron.
<br />

<br />
But anyway, to sum up, electricity is the movement of electrons from one atom to the other.  Which is easier for some than others, particularly with molecules such as with polymers, i.e. rubber and plastic, which are very resistant to the flow of electricity (and heat).
<br />

<br />
Also, electricity does NOT conduct easily in completely pure water (i.e. distilled water).  It needs the presence of electrolytes, such as salt (which breaks apart into ionized particles in water).
<br />

<br />
...It's all very complicated, and I don't feel like going farther into it.
<br />

			and, playing with electricity is a risk to yourself as well. not only will it fry your neurons, but can calcify your bones making them brittle and cause muscle spasms. not a good idea.

			Yeah, I'm assuming that the mind has a mechanism regarding electro-PK that protects the body from self-electrocution. No idea what that self-preservation mechanism is, but I'll look into it if I ever get the chance.

			yeah,I think working with electrons is the best way,but visualize electrons moving in the opposite direction because that what really happens.Of course,you may know about that,but as you know,your PK won't work if you tried to move electrons the direction you want.Even if you don't know,you will know it someday...Chances are.....you know...So,just keep this tip in your mind.

			Actually, <span style="font-weight: bold">to my knowledge</span>, they haven't determined whether electricity is the holes left by the electrons moving, or the electrons themselves moving. I would think it would be the electrons moving, myself, because that just makes more sense. How can you deliver energy with emptiness? (Before you say &quot;Put the energy in the emptiness...&quot; if you did, it wouldn't be emptiness anymore) IIRC, Electronic Engineers generally think it's the electrons moving, while physicist generally think it's the holes moving. I guess it is possible that the electrons moving produces energy in the opposite direction, but technically, the holes still wouldn't be producing the energy, the electrons would.
<br />

<br />
Also, you say to visualize the electrons moving the opposite direction... if you're used to the idea of the electrons moving in the direction the current flows, I'd say visualize them in the direction you want the current to go, since that's what would make sense to you. The visualization doesn't have to make sense to anyone or anything but you. Actually, if a donkey standing on top of the circuit is what you associate with electricity, then visualize that.

			I like to think of it this way. Your brain/nervous system naturally fires of bio-electric signals to control your body's movements and reactions. In my opinion, that's PK in itself, manipulating electricity by willpower alone. So, if you can do it within your body, what prevents you from doing it outside of your body?
<br />

<br />
I dunno, just how I always thought of it.
