			Well, I'm sorta new at this stuff and I've been reading about it and I'm really interested in it. I started reading aobut empathy and how it was the ability to view and/or feel people's emotions. Well as long as i can remember I've been able to sense people's emotions from just being in the same room as them, you just get this vibe from them, you know? So I was just wondering if this is normal in everyone or just a few. Thnx for helping a newbie.

			well i finally realized it when i would give my friends advice and know everything they say before they say it because i knew what they felt. more and more of my friends would come to me and talk to me because i understood a lot of everything. and then it hit me, &quot;how do i know these feelings?&quot;. so just practice it and you'll know by really sitting down and talking to a person. if you can get in deeper then ever and they open up because you understand everything they feel, you got a lower level of it developing.

People often give off their emotions empathically, many times the stronger the emotion, the easier it is to pick up on it.  But there are other things such as body language that everyone responds to and everyone does that lets people know silently how we are feeling.  The point you can completely separate empathy IMO is when you are not in the same room but can still feel what others are feeling.  That doesn't mean it does not exist at other times, just that it can be other things that send signals as well.

			I don't tend to discriminate between telepathy or empathy. I have no problems knowing the emotions of someone, though technically I am a telepath. I know few natural telepaths who can't also pick up on thoughts.
<br />

<br />
I imagine the difference is that while empaths actually feel the feelings of others, telepaths tend to think the thoughts, and &quot;know&quot; what the feelings are. That's only a guess, though, as an angry person or a sad person can get me angry or sad, all the same, just by proximity.
