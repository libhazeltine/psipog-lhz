			I'm having a problem with the psi wheel.  I've gotten it to budge, rock back and forth and spin just barely (1/4 turns) i can't get it past this point.  I've noticed after i get the most movement out of it i'm done, i'm unable to even make it budge again.  I'm sure some of you have had this problem before.  What did/do you do to break this plateau?  i will admit some focus is broken and i start to concentrate on the wheel when i see substantial movement...  It moves just enough to excite me but not enough to remove all self doubt- then again i feel like all doubt is gone before i start... otherwise it would be a waste of time.  Maybe i think too much.

Also, how long do you usually meditate/relax or whatever it is you do before starting TK?

			this happened to me aswell when i worked with the psi wheel.  you just have to believe you can make it spin and dont think about anything.  just try to connect with it and have full concentration on it.  Check out NI -not importants tk article he talks about focusing.  its kinda hard to explain you cant concentrate to hard but not enough either.  well you'd understand better by reading the articles by him.

			I agree. Those articles have helped me a ton personally. Also, meditation is a very important factor, so spend enough time on it. I myself use a technique when I was in Shoalin-Do (Kung Fu), called <span style="font-style: italic">empty mind</span>. The name explains it all. You are focusing on dumping all thought out of your mind, and allowing your mind to blot out random thoughts that can break concentration.  This helps me keep connection and maintain focus. After 20-30 minutes of doing this, I can usually spin the wheel for a full turn and sometimes a turn and a half effortlessly, in any direction. And like honn5 said, concentration and connection are vital too. Go check out those articles, they'll help you.

			yeah i have actually read through his articles a couple of times.  what i'll do is close all doors and windows as well as air registers so there is no air flow.  Count down from 100 at a steady slow pace and each lower number signifies in my mind that i'm more and more relaxed, almost like i'm telling myself i am, so therefore i am.. make sense? by then i'm usually relaxed enough to have some &quot;focused inattention&quot;, then i proceed to see all things in the room with exception of myself and the wheel as white, the two of us are blue.  I visualize myself spinning the wheel mimmicks my movement.  When i stop it stops and so on.  Studying the texture, size, placement and overall shape i think have helped me as well.  I've never tried with the foil wheel.  I think i'll do that instead.
