			Many of you may have already heard of this, but this continues to be truly interesting acheivement. This is basically where monks attain such an unclouded state of mind that they make rags put on them (in cold temperatures too!) steam and dry off by increasing body heat.

heres an article. Theres prolly a myriad of others.

This is what makes me believe in potential of the mind. Its been on Discovery channel lots too.

			It bothers me that breakthrough discoveries about psi-energy never get the attention they deserve. Research like this go on all the time, yet you never hear about it. Is it because psi-energy is just one of those taboo topics that no one talks about? Is it because people dismiss the possibility of psi-energy even though there is solid scientific evidence? Parapsychology definitely deserves more respect than it is given.
<br />

<br />
I was watching the History Channel today and researchers conducted an experiment on telepathy. They did this with a large group of people, I'm not sure how many people or if they were experienced with psi-energy because I just caught the end of the show as they were presenting the results of the experiment. They said at the end that 33% of the people (targets) involved in the test were able to acurately recount that information that was telepathically transmitted to them and that 75% of musicians were able to do so.
<br />

<br />
There were 2 test subjects. Both subjects were in separate rooms and one was to transmit his/her thoughts to the other. They showed a video clip of a helicopter flying and in combat to a person and then he/she would link with a target in an adjacent room and send the images to the target. Many of the targets were able to provide an accurate recollection of the helicopter flying and of it shooting missiles.
<br />

<br />
That's some food for thought.

			Though it is pretty cool, it isn't sure evidence.  They said that they monitored hightened activity in metabolism and blood pressure when they meditated.  I'm sure they they will follow that till they come to a dead end before they even consider things like energy.  So,  we'll have to wait...again...

			Oh, psshaw.  Many religions talk about &quot;miracles&quot;, powerful &quot;divine&quot; individual  s and the like which psi could definitely explain.  Saying that monks are able to do something is not preaching an ideology because Taoist monks as well as Hindus have developed body warming techniques.  If this is simply an example of an ability not specific to one religious group, then where's the problem?
<br />

<br />
Personally, I've been looking around for exactly how one meditates to the point where they are able to influence their body heat.  It's certainly a useful and nifty bit of biofeedback in the least.  Anyone have a clue how this is done?

Meditate on something that your mind asociates with heat. Sometimes when it's cold outside, I meditate on the flame within. I let my mind be absorbed by the flames, like the flames produced by a campfire. I focus on it in the solar plexus area, which I associate with the sun. So focus on something that produces alot of heat, and get obsorbed by it. You should become the fire. Not just <span style="font-style: italic">you focussing on the fire</span>, because then there is still a seperation, instead you should not focus on the fire, just <span style="font-style: italic">be the fire</span>. Do this with the intention to actually physically heat up the body.

Awesome advice.  Definitely resonates with my past meditation experiences.  Thanks a ton.

			hmmph...I can totally do what those monks do. I am so good, I won't just make it steam, but I will set it on fire. Just joking, about the fire, but seriously I don't find heating up my body to be too difficult. Maybe I should test...
