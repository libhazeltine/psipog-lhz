			I think this may be possible if you use micro-pk to speed up your body, you could move the atoms in your body so fast that everything else looks like it?s slowing down or even stopped . Please tell me if you think it?s possible or not I love to  these posts and seeing other people ideas.

youd be lucky if you could keep it going for more than a few seconds though lol

			yeh i know it would take alot of energy to do it for even a second but if you could accelerate and change your atomic frequency so you would stay at that frequency until you changed it back. just an idea but would love to try it.

			Time distortion cannot be achieved by speeding up your molecules. That would probably just make you go faster. If you want to distort time you need to speed up the rate that your brain recieves sensory perception.

			Like flies. You want to know why its so hard to swap them? Because they pick up incredible amounts of sensory perception at incredible speeds. Thats also why they can seem to dodge it when they are not even looking at you.

			time distortion is just one way to stop things, what i was origanally talking about was speeding up your molecules so that everything around you just seems to stop but it's moving at the normal rate.

			I know precisely what your asking cyro, yes it is possible. The one time that occured to me that I can think of where this applied. 
<br />

<br />
I got on a school bus, started to walk toward the back and tripped over some people's feet. I was falling down at the regular speed to appearance of everybody else but my perception of it was completely sped up so the entire fall in reality only took about .5 seconds to me it seemed to take about 4-5 seconds. My reaction speed was adjusted accordingly as well so when I let myself get near to the floor. I reacted by putting my hands out and there were some people watching me at the time, and later mentioned to me that my hands moved instaneously from my sides to directly below me, and when I had pushed myself back up. They also said that it was kinda like seeing me as a basketball the way I pushed myself up with my normal strenght but since I was still in this oddball sped up state that there was lot more strenght involved hence my beinb back to my feet in a snap.

			if every atom in your body started moving a hundred times faster than your perception would make everything seem like it was moving a hundred times slower so a person running would look like they were barely moving, and if you were accelerated enogh other people couldn't even see you because their eyes can't keep up with the speed your moving at.

			I know this is silly but I have been playing my n64 emulator, and I run it at unlimited frames per second. When I stop playing, i'm still in the hypermode where I react to everything like its moving fast. I can read alot faster and react faster to stuff, the game works like a form of hypnosis (makes it hard to sleep tho)
