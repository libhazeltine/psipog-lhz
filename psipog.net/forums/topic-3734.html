			Motivated by a post on another thread I decided to search psipog on google because there was another site slaging it off and I wanted to see. After scanning it down the page I came across this theory of how pk could work, and personally, I think this may be how it works, it just fits:
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Some of the videos are fakes, I hate it when people slip through the cracks. For the majority, that site is real. I know it for a fact because I have done the 'psiwheel' experiment several times. It is not a breeze, or the house being shaken, I can spin the paper at about 6 turns a minute, but begin to lose concentration after about 3 minutes. It fits logically into science, the things you are using to do this are pulses fired by the synapses in your brain. These travel across your nervous systems from birth, so it is completely natural to move your arms and the like, but you can trick your subconscious into sending these pulses outside of your own body. By envisioning an arm in front of you, like a third arm, and 'feeling' the arm move, by really acting as if you have a third arm, and pretending to move it, you can trick your subconscoius into sending the pulses outside of your body, to where the 'arm' is. After you begin gaining control over the direction of these pulses, you can send them without tricking your subconscious. This is how telepathy is done, by sending these to a target, then reatrieving them with information sotred in them, by sending mass numbers of them, you can achieve telekinesis. &quot;
<br />

What are everyones thoughts on this?

			I'm not limiting it to one, I was just stating my opinion on it. I think it makes sense. Maybe a technique could be applied using this. Perhaps visualizing that third arm, and the brianwaves could help. I'm gonna try and develop a method from it.

			Not sure thats a complete explanation, I would <span style="color: red">see</span> no <span style="color: blue">physical</span> connection between a neuron pulse and a psiwheel.  But inside our mind, the world is sending thoughts to us. Have u ever stared at someone in a crowd and then suddenly they turned their head at you, its because they felt like they were being watched (its a true feeling)
<br />
Thinking about something or someone, you're mind is instantly there and you receive information if your mind is clear of bias or clouding.  Also where your  mind is, the location has a physical impact of your mind being there. People say they are 'connected' when they do PK on an object, I believe its their minds thoughts are connected.  For physical connection, just analyse what scientists discovered of two identical quantum states: one influences the other (i know he's talking about atoms and particles etc) its a.k.a. Entanglement. 
<br />
When someone thinks of something, they're 'entangled' with that thing.
<br />
I always thought entanglement was the greatest analogy to PK, but it's not scientific proof only an anology. It ties in RV and PK imo.

			While I agree that TK is likely quite possible (I've never actually had physical proof that it does, so I'm sort of skeptical. Yeah, yeah, I'm working on it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> ), I think that the theory presented here demonstrates some significant ignorance in regards to human physiology (please correct me if I'm wrong. I only had a semester of pre-med work before I switched majors.). If what you pulled from the website was a direct quote, psi_manipulator_3000, the author made some fairly major errors: 
<br />

<br />
Nerve impulses, which originate in the neurons* of the brain, come from a change in ion concentrations on the inside and outside of a part of the neuron called the axon (a long &quot;tail&quot; off of one neuron that leads to the body of the next, creating a chain that leads from the brain to the rest of the body). This change in concentration produces a switch in electrical charge on the surface of the neuron, and propagates through the nerve cells toward a specific muscle/muscle group. When the change in charge is eventually passed onto the muscle cells, it causes them to contract and producing physical movement. Whew. How's that for a day of an anatomy class packed into a paragraph? <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
In short, the type of impulses sent through the nervous system from the brain could not travel if there were no nerves to serve as a pathway. And there most definitely aren't any neurons stretching from your brain into the piece of paper on the psi-spinner in front of you. And even if there were (a pretty nasty thought, really <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />), the paper wouldn't move with those particular signals, since they're meant to cause muscle cells to contract. And paper isn't made of muscle cells. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
*My warning bells first went off when the author of your article claimed that nerve impulses originated in the <span style="font-style: italic">synapses</span> of the brain. Synapses are actually the tiny, tiny space between one nerve cell's axon and the recieving node of the next neuron. Impulses are merely transmitted across synapses, they don't originate in them. 
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure how telekinesis works, and I apologize for not being able to produce a counter-theory. What we have here, however, smells distinctly of home-brewed pseudoscience (read as: B.S.). Again, though, I do have to give the disclaimer that I am far from an expert on the human body and psionics. If we have any doctors or biologists hanging around the boards, they should certainly the be ones criticizing this.
<br />

<br />
Cheers!

			tyler i'm sure everybody knows that your brain controls your arms through nerves, but what i think the article alludes to is the process of &quot;envisionment&quot;, not the process of nerves. How the <span style="color: red">mind</span> works is completely different from how the <span style="color: red">brain</span> works. 
<br />
He was using an anology to sound correct, you're right its not scientific, but viewed from the point of view of the mind (the envisioning) it could seem plausible. People often mistake the brain and the mind, they are connected but not the same thing. The brain is not connected to PK object, but how about the mind? It is something we cannot simply say we have absolute knowledge of.

			The brain is the physical structure of the mind. What we think of as the mind has more of a subjective meaning. Since we don't really have a scientific way of measuring pk, it's still hard to say we know what goes on, but I've always agreed with this theory. As I think it's the body that actually does the pk, where the mind tells the body what to do. I started to believe in this more when motions became natural to me, I can reproduce them without much concentration. Which is why I can spin a psiwheel with one hand and maybe try to roll something with the other without focusing at all on the psiwheel anymore.

			With knowing little knowledge of the mind, or any sort of neuron stuff, this is my way of explaining it. I think that it seems to have to do with the frontal lobe, as the pressure grows within,  strength of the tk is morely present. I can feel as if there is literally an eye in the top of my head.
<br />
I don't know how it can influence physical objects, but it probably has to do with very strong pulses in some sort of way. When you think that any method of your own would work, I come to the conclusion that your sub-concious does it all.

			Hmmm... I was pondering this theory yesterday and I have come to a conclusion that I don't think that's how it works. Brain waves can't go across the other side of the world, can they? Unless teleportation is involved...
<br />
I have spun psiwheels in america just from looking at my screen. You could probably go into huge scientific explanations that everything is equal and has a reaction and I'm really just affecting the video, but in turn, if the video is being affected, then the wheel HAS to move because of a certain law that binds everything together. Or else it wouldn't work right. 
<br />
But there are still major flaws in that idea. Light waves can't go through walls, but then again, we can't see brain waves, unless that is what psi is, and flaring constructs is just tuning the mind into seeing them, like tuning your hearing into hearing ultrsound or something, in turn, beacuse you can see the construct, everyone else can. This can go on for ages. 
<br />

<br />
It's all just a question of whether it is a spiritual means or physical means. Psi has always been considered spiritual, yet it can move physcial objects.

<br />
Many energies have little or no mass.

<br />
On the other hand, creating inequalities in static electrical fields can cause motion, as A is pulled towards B, and you control the motion of B.

			The explanation for PK depends on how low-level you take it.
<br />
If everything is made of energy, then energy can easily interact with energy.
<br />

<br />
However, looking at it on a higher level brings all sorts of questions; how can something with no mass interact with something with mass.  Just like understanding computers (and why Microsoft made their software so crap).
