			hey I've been practicing for a week now and I really havent felt anything, only that magnetic feeling which I can get easily but I now understand its just my muscles tightening up, basically I was just wondering if anyone has any other methods of making a psiball because nothings really worked for me so far....

			Sure it's your muscles? How long does it normally take you? If it's more then 10 minutes, then I might agree with you.
<br />

<br />
Try this, make one in one hand, then try to feel it with the other, if you still don't have any results...then post your method so I can think of alters that might work.
<br />

<br />
Do what you feel is right in your visualization.

What's your method? Well, I suppose the one that peebs have up. Just move the energy to your hand without all the fancy channeling and stuff and see if that works.

			For some reason, it feels you're being too skeptical to yourself.
<br />

<br />
All I can say, is play around with your method and keep practicing and accept the feeling you receive. Eventually you'll make a psiball in seconds and that would never bother you again.

			yosh! wassup with channeling? is it grounding of sorts?
<br />

<br />
if it is, better practice it before making any psiballs......newbs have low psi capacity and can suffer burnouts as they cant control their psi that well....
<br />

<br />
but then again, channeling might be something else...
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
once u are sure u can make a psiball in at least 5 sec using Peabrains method......i'll teach ya a much faster and better way (100% burnout proof, no grounding needed)

			Something I learned from peebrain and a lot of other people that, for some reason, don't seem to be able to put this principle into words that I could easily understand, it may be able to help you.
<br />

<br />
When you &quot;visualize&quot; the psi, that's really just a way of getting your mind to move it. If you can move it without visualizing it, you can free up that part of your mind and focus it on moving it more efficiently. I'm going to try to explain the process here in as few words as I can...
<br />

<br />
You know the feeling when you move your arm? Just sit there for a minute and flex your bicep like you're doing curls. Pay attention to what you're thinking subconsciously, basically your brain sends the signal and your arm reacts. Try to get a feel for what that process feels like. Then, imagine your psi, try to become aware of your entire body (by feel only) at the same time, or if that's too much for now, just start at your feet and work your way up. Become aware of them and how they feel. Then reach out and grab the psi with your mind in the same way your mind grabbed your bicep to move it. Try and replicate that thought. Pull all of the psi gradually into your solar plexus (the place that hurts a LOT when you get hit in the middle of your chest; the highest point in the middle of your chest where there are no ribs) or somewhere else if you prefer, but I think psi has to do with nerves, and there's a nerve cluster there. Just give that a shot, then start pulling it from the rest of your body in the same way. Keep concentrating on keeping that clump of psi in your solar plexus, though, otherwise you may lose it. After that, just use that same command as your bicep curl to move the psi into your hands; You may feel it accumulate in your solar plexus and then move. Then just spit it out of your hands.
<br />

<br />
I admit, I'm not really good at this, but it's worked a heckuvalot better than anything else I have tried so far. And I think it's the principle everyone has been trying so hard to explain with words. I may not have done such a great job on it, but I tried. Maybe it'll help some other people understand.

			u do not store psi in the solar plexus......although it is plausible....it is not practical.......
<br />

<br />
it is better to store the psi in the dantien (and the many other names that come after it)..... it is 2 cm below the naval, the center of gravity of the human body...... the &quot;centre&quot; already suggests that it is a great place to store psi
<br />

<br />
also.....just think about doing it.....no need for long excercises.....just believe in it....and think
