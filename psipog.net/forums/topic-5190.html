Chronokinesis is the power to slow down or speed up your perception of time. If you slow it down you will appear to others to be moving at superhuman speed and your talk will sound like gibberish but to you it will be like everything is slow motion. If you choose to speed up time, everything around you will seem fast and you will appear to be in slow motion.
<br />
 
<br />
First get a clock that ticks on the second and find a relaxing place. Then Listen to the beats and begin to realize that time isn't real. Now listen to the beats getting slow or faster. Do this for a few minutes and then listen, if the beats are closer or father apart you've done it. Practice this enough and eventually you won't need a clock.

			Chronokinesis is not an acceptable PK term.
<br />
Many people will react in a manner which is...detrimental to learning if you use other -kinesis terms that aren't on the list below. Fair warning.

			Wingmakers sounds like a psionic religion.  It is complete fluff.  However, changing the overall preception of time seems possible, as reality is only a universal preception.

			I've heard of something similar, but it included 2 clocks. One was placed near the person attempting the technique and the other was a control clock in the other room. The guy claimed that the clock near him was a lot behind the control clock in the end of session, and gradually caught up with it. He explained it with something like a time warp bubble or similar...

I used a technique like this before, &quot;Faster learning through time dilation&quot; is what I think it was called.
<br />
Unfortunately, This is not psionic. Not this technique anyway.

			This is essentially not a kinesis. Everyone's perception of time rests in the speed of the brain to process things, such as what's around you, etc. Ever notice that sometimes while half asleep time almost goes slower? (I have.) The only way to speed up or slow down time is to be in complete control of your body's speeds. Also, as stated in another one of my posts, the only way to effctively speed up your brain is to completely cut off communication and, for that matter, perception. You need to think and only think.

Well, sometimes when I'm working out, near the end of my workout when I grow extremely tired, time seems to crawl to a near standstill.  What seems like ten seconds to me turns out to be only two or three in realtime.
