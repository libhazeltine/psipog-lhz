<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">By JoeT</span>
<br />

<br />
	Have you ever had a dream that you loved so much that you wished it never stopped? Ever wonder what would that dream be like if in fact it really took place, or have really been to there to see what it would really be like? Well then maybe Lucid dreaming is the thing for you. Lucid Dreaming is conscious dreaming and it is an unbelievable technique to learn and experience. 
<br />

<br />
	So lets start off on what you can and cannot do in a lucid dream. Lucid dreaming tends to be more realistic than a regular dream. In that I mean using all of your five senses and even more. In a lucid dream you can do whatever you want. Its your dream you?re the boss. The possibilities in a lucid dream are endless, however there are some flaws that we will discuss later in this article.
<br />

<br />
	There are some problems you might have while in a lucid dream such as staying lucid (Staying in your dream), nightmares, etc. Although these are some flaws the can be avoided or changed if they happen to you. So lets start off with staying in your dream and not waking up once you become lucid. Many new lucid dreamers tend to have a problem staying in there dream once they become lucid. One of the reasons why this happens is because they get too excited. This is probably the most important thing you need to learn if you want to stay in a lucid dream. When you become lucid it is important to control your emotions. Lucid dreaming is very exciting and it will be hard to control your excitement but nevertheless you need to stay calm. Do whatever you need to do, take a deep breath, count sheep, etc. Now while in a lucid dream you will start to see changes happening all the time, this happens especially to new comers, that is normal and it isn?t hard to get control of it. A simple way to have control of you surrounding?s is be aware. Know that you are lucid and where you are while your lucid.
<br />

<br />
	Now lets talk about fear, There is no need to fear lucid dreaming because it is your dream, If you don?t like anything in your dream you have the power to change your surroundings at will. So lets say you become lucid in a nightmare, simply visualize your nightmare disappearing while your surroundings change into something you feel comfortable with. You can also standup at your fears and challenge them head on. Remember it is your dream, you can make yourself have unnatural strength or have special abilities such as the people in X-MEN do. So be creative and have fun. Remember it?s your dream, you control everything and absolutely  nothing can harm you.
<br />

<br />
	Now lets talk about what you can do in a lucid dream. While in a lucid dream you can do just about anything and I do mean anything. Imagine being a world where you are in total control. Here are a list of things I have personally done in a lucid dream.
<br />

<br />
1) <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Fly-</span></span> Most people simply learn to lucid dream just to enjoy what It feels like to fly. Flying in a lucid dream feels so real that it?s indescribable to say. You?ll just have to experience it for yourself. 
<br />

<br />
2)<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"> Transform into anything-</span></span> Sounds farfetched but its possible. You can change into anything, animals, movie stars, television characters, anything. Although I have only had one experience with transforming into a bird, I have talked to many people that have changed into so many things such as the listed examples above. 
<br />

<br />
3)<span style="text-decoration: underline"> <span style="font-weight: bold">Meet anyone you wish-</span></span> If you ever wanted to meet anyone such as your hero or a movie star, you can. Although it will not be really that person, you probably wouldn?t be able to tell the difference between that person and that dream character. This is a personal favorite thing to do while in a lucid dream.
<br />

<br />
4) <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Teleport-</span></span> While in a lucid dream you can go anywhere you wish, and teleporting is the most common way to get around. Now you may be asking yourself ?Why not just take a car or fly?? Well that?s simple, Unless you have great skill of staying lucid for a long period of time, I would suggest you get to your destination ASAP and teleporting will get your there. 
<br />

<br />
5) <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Talk to dream characters-</span></span>  When you lucid dream you will see people there walking around like it was a normal day. They are called dream characters or DC?s for short. They are made up people that you would think would be there if you were in fact ?really there?.  They are really interesting to talk to, Ask them for anything and most of them will give you an answer, Some might totally ignore you but that?s normal. So if you get the chance talk to some dream characters they might just have something to say that you may find interesting.
<br />

<br />
Those are just some examples on what you can do for fun while your lucid dreaming. It?s up to you on what you wish to do but be creative and have fun. Now that we have talked about what you can and cannot do in a lucid dream lets finally talk about how to do it. These two techniques are very effective but like all things they will take time to learn.
<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Wake back to bed method technique-</span></span> This is a very common way to lucid dream. Things that are required is an alarm clock and the ability to wake up earlier than normal. First set your alarm clock two hours earlier than normal, So if you normal wake up at 8:00am to start your day then set it at 6:00am. Get a good amount of sleep that night. When your alarm clock starts to beep wake up and stay up for a good 15 minutes. Do whatever you want to occupy yourself while your up. Go on the computer, take your dog out, grab a drink etc. After you have been up for 15 minutes then go back to bed. When your in bed you should still be a bit tired and ready to go back to sleep. While your in your bed close your eyes and imagine that you are walking down a flight of stairs. While visualizing yourself walking down those flight of stairs start to count down step by step. I usually start from 100 and count down. So basically your visualizing walking down 100 stairs counting them. This helps relax the body and focus the mind which is both required. Now start to say in your head 1 I?m dreaming, 2 I?m dreaming, 3 I?m dreaming etc. With all luck you will fall asleep and while sleeping you will become lucid.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Wake induced lucid dream-</span></span>  This is the technique I personally use most to lucid dream. Robert Bruce calls this ? A mind blowing experience?. This technique requires concentration and good visualization skills. First start by going to sleep at a normal time. When you are in your bed do whatever you need to do in order to relax. After you are relaxed and in a focus state of mind simply get comfortable and get into your position as if you were normally going to sleep. Then visualize yourself at the location you wish to lucid dream to. A good place to lucid dream to is a shopping mall, school, any public place will do fine. Once you have the location you want to lucid dream into start to fall asleep but keep your mind on your target. When I first started I kept the location in my mind and I visualized myself standing there saying ?I?m dreaming, I am in a dream?. If you followed the directions correctly you will suddenly be in your dream. That is the reason why Robert Bruce called it a ?A mind blowing experience? because it really is. Once second your in your bed and the next your standing in your dream environment. 
<br />

<br />
When you first go into a lucid dream for the first time please do not get to ahead of yourself. When I say this I mean don?t loose focus and control your emotions. Although hard to master they are both required if you want to spend more than 30 seconds in a lucid dream. These skills are not easy to learn so practice daily because it is really worth learning. I hope you all have good luck learning this amazing ability. If you need any help please private message me on the forums or you can talk to me in Psipog?s chat room.

			Awesome article-post-thingy <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />. I have two comments:
<br />

<br />
I'm a scaredy cat, so when I first started to try to have lucid dreams, I was kinda scared. But like you said, Joe, it's your dream, you're the boss, and you can do whatever you want. To elaborate, a lucid dream is basically enhanced imagining. You're sitting in some boring class at school, and you just start imagining yourself somewhere else, doing something else. We've all done it, I know! That's all lucid dreaming is, only... better  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
Also, after learning about psi and lucid dreaming, but before ever learing about the Wake Back to Bed Method, I noticed something kinda werid. I am VERY lazy. So, my school bus comes at 6:55 am. I set my alarm for 6:45 am. I'm a girl. Most other girls look at me like I'm crazy when I tell them this. THEN, I don't get out of my bed until 6:51 or 6:52 am. Then, in a sleepy stupor I get dressed, brush my teeth, bring a hair brush with me, and venture out into what is usually pretty cold because it's early in the morning. So anyway, back to the topic, I get on the bus and have a nice 18 minute nap on the way to school, and I find it very easy to slide from just thinking to being half asleep to being close to a lucid dream at this time. If I had more than 18 minutes, I think I could LD every morning on the bus, lol. My biggest problem when I try to have a Wake Induced Lucid Dream is that I just can't fall asleep unless I'm REALLY tired; and if I'm really tired, I just go straight to sleep and can't keep my conciousness. Early in the morning, once you've been up for a few minutes, it's so easy to fall right back asleep, and, if you're thinking about it, not too dificult to have a lucid dream.
<br />

[Sorry if that second comment seemed kind of long and pointless, but some people might be interested, lol.]

			I've gone lucid before and kept control of my emotions and all that.  Thing is:  I was in the middle of a dream with a plot, and I went lucid while in a conversation.  So, when I started talking again...  Well, it came out of my physical mouth rather than my dream one.  That's always what happens when I go lucid for some reason.  I've stayed lucid ONCE, and it was awesome.  Absolutelly awesome.
