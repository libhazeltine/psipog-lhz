Good idea. We could go to PsiOnline, which i believe i am still a member of. I also like PsiStudies, because there arent a lot of skeptics or noobs their, so it is pretty much fluff free. (only 1 skeptic so far, and he didnt believe that anything was real (such as the earth, air, or anything))

If you want to get someone who can program a forum for us, then try to. We have 5 days until this forum is gonna be closed. In the meantime, if you want, i could make a temporary forum with Takeforum, or Forumer.

Can someone please help me think of a name for the forum? they will get to be a mod! im not good at thinking of names for forums or sites...

We could always just get donations or something, or use a websites affiliate program (where every time you click on a link, it makes the owner (of the page who has the link on it) a little bit of money from the person who's site pops up) (im really bad at describing)
<br />

i have around $40 to start it, but im not sure if that would get us along for long enough. could an affiliate program give you money that you could cash in for...well... cash?

			Well, I've found a webhost that offers 5GB of space, but I'm not sure how the 8MB file size limit would affect things. Also, it only lets you upload three files at a time. I'm currently testing out the web host as I type this. It appears to have automatic installation of phpbb2.
<br />

<br />
For a domain name, perhaps we could find a free webhost that has an easy to remember subdomain system, and just put an instant JavaScript redirect to the page on the preferred webhost. It's not the prettiest method, nor is it a real domain name, but it's certainly less expensive, and effective.

			Why don't you guys wait around a bit to see what Sean is up to. In all likelihood the new site will have a lot of the old psipog members.

Not that it's a bad idea, as long as this different from all the other forums. It sounds like it's going to be based around old psipog members, but perhaps adding another niche would help.

			True, but his new site won't have the same content that Psipog has, nor the same focus. We'll have to wait and see what it's like. However, if we don't find somewhere to replace Psipog soon, then we might lose contact with the community.

Maybe we can add something that PsiPog doesnt allow. Maybe some c****t (i know we arent supposed to talk about it, but if you dont like it you can just edit my post. Dont close the whole topic.)

Actually, i have met some pretty advanced people in chat rooms for it. But it might also get some others to go away, so we don't HAVE to, but it would be a nice addition.
