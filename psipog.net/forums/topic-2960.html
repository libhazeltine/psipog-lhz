The effects were more intense with people who were already skilled in energy and metaphysical training. Some of the benefits they observed were:
<br />

<br />
- The ability to easy see energy patterns in their environment which appeared as transparent waves in the air with slight traces of illuminated color emanating from objects and people. With a little focusing they were able to intensify the spectrum of observable color.
<br />

<br />
- The ability to sense or &quot;touch&quot; their environment without using their hands or physical body.
<br />

<br />
- Reports of being able to feel EMF (Electro-Magnetic Fields) emanating from computer monitors, cell phones and other electrical appliances. Some reported slight discomfort while using cell phones for periods extending over 20 minutes.
<br />

<br />
After adjusting to the new sensory of being aware of electro-magnetic fields they all reported a sense of accelerated learning. One person working with accounting stated that while he was mentally tallying numbers he found he was able to increase the speed and ease of his mental calculations.
<br />

<br />
Food became a challenge as one person explained they no longer enjoyed certain foods because they were able to detect chemicals, fats and salts in their food. They found themselves limited to a diet of more organic foods which, coincidentally, also helped them (much to their delight) lose nine pounds.

Just wanted to know if anyone tried this before I'm very interested in it.

			Quite interesting. I would actually love to buy them, but everyone would get the idea that I'm cheating... <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />  And since I really suck at sensing (why I don't practice psi balls that often anymore) it could help me get back on track. I was hoping it was this exercise that you can do at home without paying for  stupid tablets. <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />

			I saw the ad on PsiPog a while back, and I think it is probably complete BS.  Although I did get a kick out of their graphic of little cells (or whatever they were) aligning to a magnetic field.  The fact of the matter is, even if their product does all of the scientific things that they claim, it may not boost psionics.

Possibly.  I'm guessing links for this placebo show up among the Google ads on Psipog.net.  That really can't be helped because of how Google selects advertising links for certain webpages. If I'm not mistaken, they go by keywords found on the site.  In this example, they may see &quot;psychic&quot; and display advertisements for astrology and these supplements.
<br />

<br />
It sucks, but oh well.  Psipog is privately owned and operated and generates a lot of bandwidth.  Bandwidth costs money, and we can't expect Peebs to bankrupt himself to maintain a free website.
<br />

<br />
I have serious doubts as to the effectiveness of any supplement that claims to enhance psychic functioning.  You'd probably be better off taking a one-a-day vitamin supplement.

			Word of advice for people taking any kind of pills or supplements: never, ever, take too much.  Seems like common sense, right?  Too bad that's a little lacking nowadays.  Iron and potassium are known to help stimulate neuron growth, so what's wrong with taking vitamins with those in them, right?  Not quite, taking too many will kill you....yes, vitamins can kill you.  Too much potassium is deadly.  Now I'm not saying that vitamins are bad, I take them myself, but there is too much of a good thing.
