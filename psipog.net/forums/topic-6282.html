			I'm not too knowledgeable on Micro-PK but from what I know part of it is being able to influence random number generators in computers.
<br />

<br />
I would like to post my experience with possible Micro-PK interaction in counter-strike:source,
<br />

<br />
It was a few days ago, and I was in a situation that didn't require me to pay all my attention on the games objective, someone recently commented on someone else using hacks and that got me thinking about micro-PK.
<br />

<br />
So I tried to influence the sound the players footsteps made, I didn't make the game but I assumed that at specific times during the players models animation it plays a sound based on what the player is standing on and a random number. So what I tried to do is to get the same sound to play repeatedly, to much success I was able to get the same sound to play around 5 times (on more than one occasion).
<br />

<br />
I also recall getting multiple dodges in RPGs (not MMOs unfortunately).
<br />

<br />
I'm open to the fact that they could've been coincidences.
<br />

<br />
Has anyone else influenced games using Micro-PK?

			Well, the Micro-PK Cannon I made for Unreal Tournament 2004 is fun, even though the Redeemer missiles occasionally hit each other, so if you're really good at Micro-PK, and bad about standing still while shooting, you could accidentally blow yourself (and anybody nearby) to pieces.

The Source engine has several recorded sounds for various things in game, such as footsteps or glass breaking. Then, when that thing comes up, it picks a few of the sounds randomly and mixes them... so it can be affected by Micro-PK. It sounds (no pun intended) like you succeeded. Keep practicing, though.

			Pokemon was ruined for me at about the time they came out with Pokemon Yellow. They took a creative game idea, and ruined it by over-merchandising it.

i had many experiences with pk in videogames i think........ 
<br />
if i play a level over and over and i keep loseing and dieing i somehowjust suddenly win the next time i try. i tryed something like that in real life to make my bus go faster when we wente over a bumb and my head hit the roof. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

...You mean &quot;settled?&quot;  No, I don't think you did.  I actually love Pokémon.  I still find it a highly enjoyable RPG, and it was what got me interested in even more RPGs.
<br />

<br />
I've tried using it to catch Pokémon easier, though I can't say either way if it's what did it.  I also don't really know if PK is possible (or even necessary) in a digital form.  Just my opinion, heh....

			I can't do any psychokinesis very well, except maybe DMILS, but I came up with a way to use Micro-PK on CS source to improve your accuracy.
<br />

<br />
You see, how it works is, there is this &quot;cone&quot; coming out the barrel of the gun you're weilding, called the Cone of Fire. (or CoF) This cone shows all the possible paths for the bullets that you shoot, because the gun isn't 100% accurate. The path of the bullet is influenced by whether you're crouched and stuff, but it's still random, so if you could Micro-PK it, then you could strafe, firing full auto, and still get a headshot  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Although you might get accused of hacking, hehehe mind hacks.

			In games that have random battles I can often influence the types of enemies I get to fight what I want to fight.  I can also get higher crit and dodge rates, and influence which random attacks hit who.

			It still suprises me to think that not many people realise (or maybe just don't talk about) the fact that it's not just random number generators that you can affect. If you can move a mouse on your screen, then you can affect the way a character moves in a game. Any input can be affected with pk. Outputs I don't think can be affected. You don't need random number generators people! Screw them! Try doing other useful stuff in video games, because you can. 
<br />

<br />
If you think about it like this: Your brain/psi can affect the way random number generators work yes? Well, do you know how to affect it to your desire conciously? Probably not. So, if you can do that to number generators subconciously but with intent, it shouldn't be so hard to do it for inputs if your brain obviously has that knowledge. 
<br />

<br />
I can affect the download rate for my computer and that's definitely not random. At least I hope (lol). I got it from 20kb/s (which it had been at all day) to 109kb/s in a matter of minutes, and then back down again. So this basically means that if you were a micro-pk master, you could do anything on a computer, including writing code for games even if you don't know how to code, controlling virus issues, sending emails, drawing stuff on design programs that you can't use. This of course would only be for pk masters though.
