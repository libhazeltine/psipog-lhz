			I saw this thing on TV today that was very odd. 
<br />

<br />
This man was a parapalegic, and had a microchip implanted in his arm. He was able to &quot;think&quot; and the TV would turn on/off or change channel/volume It was some study... doors would automaticly open for him when they picked up the chip's frequency. 
<br />

<br />
tword the end of the show the scientist that came up with this chip had one installed into himself, and his wife too. they where going to do a study on i guess what you would call &quot;artifitial telepathy.&quot;

It's all a question of nano-technology. It's already very possible to wire a digital-wire to a bio-neuron, but the problem is making enough connections to a good enough external-body-part.
<br />

<br />
Things like a remote controlled leach attached to a PC -- this has already been done. The pentagon has been experimenting with mind control chips/devices on things such as sharks, insects, etc., but the technology is not advanced enough yet for these things to work very well -- it's basically [today, 6/19/2006] at the level in which it can work, but not work very well/be very usefull yet -- compared to glorious future prospects.
<br />

<br />
I was talking about this with James the other day. An example of military application prospects in the future would be:
<br />
A genetically engineered, remote controlled hornet that had a sionide-filled-stinger...
<br />

<br />
This would make assassinations rather easy.
<br />

<br />
Also, technology is advancing &quot;expotentially&quot;. Technology is picking up momentum, advancing faster-and-faster. 20&lt; years from now expect to see some big changes!
