			What made you so sure that it was real? (In other words.) Tell me a story of one time, you got telepathy right.
<br />

<br />
As for me, I have some natural telepath in me so I can get it real good at random moments. One time I tried pinging before I knew the actual term. I stood outside the mall and connected with one guy walking buy and I gave him the signal to turn around and look at me. I actually felt a really strong signal processing through him. Without fail, he (from about 200 ft away) stopped his convo with his girlfriend, turned around and stared at me for a second (the same way someone would react to being poked on the shoulder), and then turned around and continued on.

			When I was I think 9 or 10, my mom took me aside and explained that it's customary to wait for people to ask the questions verbally before answering them.
<br />

<br />
This was also around the time that I realized I would have to actually speak outloud to get people to hear me...I'd been doing it for a long time, but I hadn't realized that most people can't answer questions we think. I had figured that since I could, everyone else could. Ah, childhood.

			This occurance wasn't what made me know it was real, but it was one of those &quot;I can't come up with any type of alternate explanation&quot; situations.
<br />

<br />
One of my coworkers and I were trying to get some computers to work.  I was in one office, facing a corner looking at a monitor trying to figure something out.  The other guy was in the adjacent office located directly behind me.  I turned around and said, &quot;Yes?&quot;  His response was something along the lines of &quot;How'd you do that?  I hadn't said anything yet, but I was about to say your name!&quot;  I simply chuckled and said, &quot;heh... I must be psychic.&quot;  
<br />

<br />
Because I used to tend towards the gullible side of things, I tend to try to come up with a more mundane reason for something to have happened, but this one was too much for me.

			The oldest telepathic experience I can remember was when I was about... 15 or 16 I bet.  I was hanging out with my friend, and I asked him a question about a pocket knife he had.  I heard the answer in my head... I don't remember exactly what it was, but it was something along the lines of &quot;Well, I don't think I've sharpened it in weeks, but oh well.&quot;  My friend replied with a very short answer, and I was disappointed that I didn't hear the correct reply.  Then a few seconds passed, and my friend said, word for word, exactly what I had heard in my head earlier.
<br />

<br />
Not sure if that's telepathic... could be precog, or whatever.  Things overlap.  Either way, that's what I remember.

			I discovered it through many experiences, many of the common ones that most people have, like knowing what someones going to say next, answering someone who only thought of the question etc. ive always believed in things such as telepathy but the above experiences really convinced me that it was real.

That's empathy, not telepathy
<br />

<br />
Myself, I tended to catch thoughts withought realizing it. If I were, say, rearranging movies in my dad's collection for him, I would suddenly get an idea as to how I should organize them. Later, my dad would tell me that I did it exactly as he wanted without him telling me how to arrange them.

I'd not classify that as empathy, actually.  Seeing someone and responding to their current state of mind is on the &quot;normal&quot; side of communication.  Even if your sister had been sad previously, and you laugh, she might have ended up laughing.  And almost everyone, when they see someone not feeling well, feels bad for that person.
<br />

<br />
If we're looking at paranormal communication methods, the experience needs to be outside the range of normal communication.
<br />

<br />
You may still be an empath, but those wouldn't be examples showing empathy skills.
<br />

			I've always been telepathic and empathic, picking up other people's thoughts and emotions even as a very young child, but I didn't know what it was called untill I was in Jr High School.
<br />

<br />
When I was 15 a good friend of mine died at a school event and I not only saw him die, but I felt him.... it was kind of like my empathy drew me into his mind as he was dying.  This event, and the church I was going to at the time which was telling me that telepathy was satanic (sorry to mention religion guys), made me burry my abilities and shut them out for a while. Denial is a really powerful thing.
<br />

<br />
I didn't fully let myself use my telepathy and empathy again untill my Jr year in college, and because I hadn't used them in a long time and had never practiced with shielding and stuff I was pretty out of control for a while. It was a pretty scary time... I'll spare the details.
<br />

<br />
After a lot of practice shielding and stuff I have pretty good control over my abilities now. My telepathy still kind of happens when it wants to sometimes, usually when its least convenient for me... I tend to project. I also find myself going into other people's minds without even knowing I am doing it until I am. I can also see through other people's eyes sometimes... I don't know how else to describe it, but I have confirmed it with others and am pretty accurate. It's kind of disorienting though, and I don't like doing it.

Sometimes, people ask me how I know natural telepaths when I see them. Here's a good example. The way this is structured, even if it's something I might consider &quot;informal,&quot; reeks of a telepath. Our heads work differently, and this is how it goes.
