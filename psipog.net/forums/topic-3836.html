			List of herbs that [are claimed to] boost psychic power.
<br />

<br />
* Borage
<br />
* Hazel
<br />
* Heliotrope
<br />
* Lemongrass
<br />
* Mugwort
<br />
* Yarrow
<br />

<br />
So if you've got a special project you're working on, or if you're trying to do something that's really hard to do, take a shot of a few of these herbs as a herbal tea before you start your work -- maybe it may give you that boost/edge that you need to do something new that you could not do before.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Most of the time it's like people just practice with eachother or alone -- no tools or supplies other then the body. But, let's say a friend is really sick, then what? Curing that illness may not be so easy, thus you may need a boost.

			I recommend making dried mugwort into a tea; it induces a lovely dreamy state conducive to telepathy and clairvoyance work. Some claim just leaving it under one's pillow is enough to aid dreaming, but I find this inaccurate.
<br />

<br />
However, the tea does induce much more vivid dreams, as does smoking it (though it is a harsh smoke).

			Ah, okay, I haven't tried any of these herbs personally, I just listed them from different sources/claims/lore, by name.

I'd not smoke it, lol. Tea is best.

Orange Juice is high in potassium, which is burned during the energy working process. While it won't really give you a &quot;boost,&quot; it will help prevent a burnout or overload, or if it's too late for that, it will greatly improve the recovery time and cut down on the negative side effects.

			Any idea what exactly it is in mugwort that has this effect? 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Mugwort contains thujone, which is toxic. Pregnant women, in particular, should avoid consuming large amounts of mugwort. The species is little used now due to toxicity concerns, but has a number of recorded historic uses, both as a herb and in herbal medicine.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
from wikipedia^
<br />

<br />
Is it sold in many shops or is it more of a specialty item? I would guess its fairly rare, but if I could get some, dreaming is something I do and it would help.

The Thujone is the theorized mechanism, but we aren't sure about it. Reading &quot;toxic&quot; there, don't think &quot;it'll kill me.&quot; Lots of things are toxic. Alcohol, for example, is toxic, as is nicotine. Regardless, thujone can be dangerous, as it can induce seizure. Predosing ethanol seems to reduce this effect.
<br />

<br />
I ordered mine online - it's legal. I like <a href="http://www.alchemy-works.com/" target="_blank">http://www.alchemy-works.com/</a> but there are many other good places (bouncing bear botanicals comes to mind). I imagine in bigger cities, specialty shops would have it. The natural store where I live has wormwood, which is mugwort's &quot;big cousin,&quot; but not mugwort itself. Wormwood has higher amounts of thujone, but I have not had the same experience with it.

			While I know that herbs can be beneficial to a lot of aspects of psychic stamina, before you start using them, please make sure you knownhow to take them and it what kinds of doses. It's just as easy to overdose on things like herbs as it is certain drugs. Just because something is natural doesn't mean it's healthy. I'm not saying not to use herbs- but be careful when you do and consider maybe just eating a banana or drinking some juice before you think &quot;Oh, I should use a magic herb to heighten my abilities!&quot; They have the same stimulants as most energy-boosting food.
