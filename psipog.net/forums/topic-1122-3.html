			woah peebs, from what I read of the emails they posted on their own sites, they made themselves look like idiots...  honestly, these are the kind of people that bring humanity as a whole down...  And since they avoided telling you anything really, I'd say it's a big fraud too, a clever one at that, because you can never prove them wrong, because they can just lie through their teeth about everything... Bah, blatent ignorence should be a capital punishment.

He wants to show up fakes right? Well just do magic tricks until you get in to the actual experiment (making sure you have an independent observer of course) then go wild <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />, he would'nt know what hit him and it would serve him right <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

He would have a tough time weaselling out of it

			What you do?
<br />

<br />
Get 2 videocams, from 2 different angles.
<br />

<br />
Then, perform 10 minutes of 'tricks'.
<br />

<br />
The second camera's there to prove he's a fucking dumbass and that all his claims about people not being able to perfom psi is because of 'blar balr blar'. Except, when you show the second camera with a timestamp, he'll be proven wrong.
<br />

<br />
Aaand...then everybody hates him.
<br />

Everybody wins ^_^

			You show the first videocam so he can bullshit his way through it, then show the second camera. And provide evidence that it was taken at the same time as the first camera, thus disproving him of his previous claims - and making him look like an idiot.

			how would that change anything though?  it would just be a different perspective.  He could still call it a trick.

<br />
I dont think you people understand.  Randi pretty much MAKES people fail his tests.  That is why he probably does not have the money hence the incident with peebs.

			you could have multiple cameras, being filmed in the CIA, for fuck's sake - anything to make that dipshit cower into a ball in the corner and admit that he doesn't have the money, and he's a fucking liar.
<br />

<br />
Just post one videocamera at a time....hahahahaha... When we get to 5 cameras, it's hard to still hold onto it. Because, the most perspectives you have, the more chance there is of seeing somebody didn't hit somebody else.
<br />

<br />
Try the alt-cameras in most action movies...they don't REALLY hit each other.

			I think the conclusion of that very long arguent on Randi's forum was that he does actually have the money, althought it constitutes more than half of his assets.
<br />

<br />
For the record, although Kramer is a jackass and Randi seems to be too (although he's allowed... what, he's old! <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> ) I somewhat understand why they would be hostile that way.  Peebs, you have my respect for not insulting them or turning them into vegetables (I don't know... can you do that? don't answer that)

Which is Sean? Do you consider him a sincere applicant, or do you consider him a fraud? You are certainly treating him like you consider him a fraud. For the life of me, I don't know why.  
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Form your own opinion from Sean's latest email:
<br />

<br />
Dear Kramer,
<br />

<br />
I was unaware that you were posting messages. I do not wish to pursue this matter further.
<br />

<br />
Incidentally,after looking around your site, I find your work very interesting, and I wish you luck with refuting claims that are not valid. A great deal of progress that has been made in our world has been made from people such as yourself who have said &quot;No. That is not true. That is absurd.&quot; There are certainly a lot of off the wall things being said on your website.
<br />

<br />
Would you kindly take my messages off of the internet? I thought that the messages were going to be kept private. I see that you are very tough with people who cannot back up their claims, and I respect you for it. The world needs someone like you bury kooky ideas and claims.
<br />

<br />
Please e-mail me to confirm that you have taken the messages off.
<br />

<br />
Good luck in your endeavors to refute the absurd!
<br />

unless I'm very much mistaken, that looks like a phantom e-mail, this phenomenon occurs when idiots make up e-mails from other people.Parts may be real, but at least part of it is made up, because Sean knew Kramer was posting his e-mails. It doesn't surprise me one bit that that moron Kramer would say that, though. You could get him arrested for that, Sean, I think it's considered a 1st amendment violation, but I'm almost positive it's a felony.
