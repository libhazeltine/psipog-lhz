			Meh, evolution, biology, genetics, and so on...
<br />

<br />
Think about it.  In the animal world, all but one female species give birth to their young (the odd one out is seahorses).  These caretakers are generally female, and need to live the longest to care for their offspring.  The fathers usually just &quot;fertilized the seeds&quot; then leave, which requires no extended longevity on their part (except for seahorses).  So, if you do believe in evolution, a logical explanation could be:  Females live longer due to the need for their nurturing of offspring.  Since males aren't the dominant caretakers (instead they are providers), they don't need as long of a lifespan (evolution wise), and therefore die faster.  Also, men are more suceptible to heart attacks, high blood pressure, diabities, congestive heart failure, and certain cancers to name a few.  I'm no biologist, so I can't explain why, but there is an explanation.  It's just a trait passed down.  Same reason why men have tunnel vision: we were the hunter-gatherers, so we needed to be able to focus on a fine area target.  Tunnel vision helps in that aspect.  (Ask any girl you know about this, they can look at your face while staring at your crotch...It's like peripheal vision, but vertical).  Men are also stereotyped as mechanics and athletes.  This is because in the old days (dating back to the time of the wheel invention) men were the blacksmiths and other primitive &quot;mechanics&quot; or &quot;engineers.&quot;  We are seen as athletic since we were the ones that hunted, and fought in wars, and skirmishes of other sorts...I could go on about this, but I'm quite tired, and have to get up for college in six hours.
<br />

<br />
Long story short, my opinion is because of evolution, and if you read that whole paragraph, then good for you!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />   You can also see it's a fair trade.

			First of all I think somefatguy could have thought of a better topic...If this turns out of the battle of the sexes this could get ugly (No offense guys but I'll go with the females). I know a importent difference from the X and Y is that the X has 1500 genes while the Y only has 57 (somewhere in the 50s but you must amit thats a pretty small number).
<br />

<br />
I once agure with this guy about a sryum thats changes a human sex into a male--&gt; female or a female --&gt; male. He told me its easlier for a woman to change into a male and that the reason why it never made it into stores it because of some reasons. Seeing our genes it must be easlier to dumb a woman down to our leve. He says its because of a chemcial called Equitly (Or I forgot the name But it starts with a E) is mostly in the sryum. It was a fun agurement, he told me the sryum played around with the subject chemcial system. That the human body final dissicion on the sex is based on the chemicals after growing out of a baby. 
<br />

<br />
Personaly I heard of babies changes sexes while matureing but I thought it was a rumoner. He told me that while we are babies we are in a balance of two chemicals, don't remember the chemicals...but one starts with a E and looks SOMEWHAT like that. Well he agure with me that as a baby we are 50-50% of these two chemicals. And when we mature we turn into either 100-0% or the other. He said sometimes its 98-2% in our bodies making us gay or tom boys...Of cource I strongly agure with this on some grounds. I told him I believe the human brain can be program regardless of this. It was a fun agurement....I miss that guy.
<br />

<br />
I once watch animal channel about the &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; thing in the animal kingdom. It turn out women won, with a lizard in the Az desert. This lizard is only populated with ONLY females. There able to reproduce copies of them selfs in there reproduction system. A few flaws in this is that you end up looking exactly like grandma. Also signs of evolution showed that for the lizards to make a baby they have to pretend to have sex. The reason why I brough this up?
<br />

<br />
Simple some experts believe that in about 180,000 years the male genes will contuine to get smaller. So we go away in the human speices. I read that the male center nerves system is often link more to the left side (or was it right...I think its left) which is the logic side of the brain. Honestly beleive it or not females feel more anger then we males do, however there able to control it to a better degree. I think its best for a great mind to grow they must confront both sides. So yes cry my manily men! Or as my football team in my old highschool once siad.
<br />

<br />
REAL MEN WEAR PINK!!!
<br />

<br />
I heard of Azmans warriors that slaved men and screw up there culture just as much as men. So screwing up all of civilation knows no gender. Just seems because males averange strenght is about 10% greater then women just seems to be enough to often come up on top..........that didnt sound right......
<br />

<br />
I have no idea what I'm going with this.......sometimes I feel I have to give a lecture over things I myself dont completly comperhend.
<br />

<br />
Women live longer becaues big boys dont cry.............so my manily men........remember this saying and live longer!
<br />

			Hmmm, lots of interesting opinions guys. It's getting better. I agree with men holding back emotions but crying isn't the only emotion we have. 
<br />
I like this topic, it shouldn't turn out to be a battle of the sexes if we are mature. 
<br />

<br />
Women can see my crotch and talk to me at the same time!? *gasp* 
<br />
But I can see many things at once as well, just not with 100% detail. 
<br />
Still no votes for the sexual energy eh....

			in general i think its because women are natuarly build tougher than men. Without being perverted can't you see what an amazing natural feat the femal body is. Its sleek and built like a rock. For god sakes they need to give birth to a 5-7 lb baby on average and are expected to do alot more these days. Growing up in a house with all women (including my dog and hamsters) i could tell how weak men were compared to women. Sure men are superior stength wise on regular but mens thresh hold for pain is nothin compared to women. I'm sorry but male body is obsolete

Pain does not tell how strong someone is, pain is only an illusion created by the mind. Pain cannot be measured, pain cannot be told, pain cannot be seen, pain is not exsistent. 
<br />
Women have a larger pelvis, so now they are built tougher?! 
<br />
They are <span style="font-style: italic">different</span> is all. 
<br />
There bodies are obviously designed for birth. 
<br />
Other than that I don't see any superiority.

There's a show on nowadays called battle of the sexes.  It's pretty interesting.  It isn't really competative, it just shows how differently they think.

There is so much in your logic that disrupts mes...I do think women are going to win in the end (even though I'm a guy) but you have all the wrong reason!!
<br />

<br />
First your being sexist saying all men are perverted! That right there is sterotyping. The brain is the most powerful muscle in the body, even if the male is born sort of like a pervert it can still adapt itself.
<br />

<br />
Build like a rock? Are you kidding me? There are still some things in women I find unnesscery compared to men. I learn that women often hold on to fights more often. For example when you hit a guy in the back of the head they often forgive you a moment later and even forget it shortly. But a woman tends to remember small annoying details such as slapping in the back of the head. I seen of &quot;used&quot; to be girlfriends to hate each other as emenies just because of something small like this.
<br />

<br />
Growing up with my mother and 4 brothers I can see how women can be stronger while riseing a child. But my mother thought me that the one who contuines a fight is just as much to blame as one who starts the fight.
<br />

<br />
I left something out on purpose when saying my last post on the human DNA, (I often do this for you people to fingure it out). Is that SIZE DONEST MANNER!
<br />

<br />
I could go on with what you said! But I find that be pointless on some levels.....

Think about it.  In the animal world, all but one female species give birth to their young (the odd one out is seahorses).  </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Please remember that not all animals give birth to live young.  It is only mammals that do this (with a few exceptions, such as the Duck-billed Platypus which lays eggs).  You don't give birth to an egg.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

If this world was full of only women then it would fall and the aliens would take the planet in 6 days. Neither sex is ever going to &quot;<span style="font-style: italic">win</span>&quot; We need each other. We're not lizards. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  Even, if we were, then where's the love in a women-only world?? <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> .

<br />
And why is a woman's pain thresh hold much higher than a man's? Men usually can take more pain than most women. We could probably give birth if we had bodies built for it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />  Anyway, it's not like women just lay there and give birth without screaming and crying. It's not like a man has ever felt the pain of birth, either. We could probably handle it as well as women.

			Fakiti, women totally have a higher pain threshold then men. It's been proven in several studies, plus, note some sport events. A guy playing football gets a nasty cramp and gets carried out on a stretcher crying. A woman goes through bad cramps once a month and still does everything she needs to do and then some. And as for childbirth, men do not have vaginas. You can not say you think you could handle the pain of childbirth. What a woman goes through during childbirth, for you, would be roughly the equivalent of trying to push an artichoke through your penis. Sorry if I'm getting a bit graphic, but though I agree that in some areas physically men have a one up on women, in this one, we take hands down.
