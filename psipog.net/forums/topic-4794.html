			Since teleportation could possibly be a form of psychokinesis, I created the topic here. With that out of the way, I have something to discuss with you all. I am, let's say, in a situation where I am desperate to travel somewhere. Due to low financial status and expensive transportation fees, I was thinking how I could get to the destination and teleportation came to mind.
<br />
Now, I have been thinking about teleportation before, amongst other things. I have been out-of-practice for awhile and although I have always wanted to OBE, I think I'm going to make teleportation my new project. This is where you all come in. I am volunteering myself as a teleportation guinea pig. Any teleportation techniques you have thought up I will glady try to conduct.
<br />
Whether the technique is for teleporting an object or myself, I will try to use that technique and performt he desired results. I hope to achieve teleportation soon with the amount of practice I plan to put into it and I am open to suggestions for techniques. Now, good people, the floor is open to you.

			wouldn't it be better if you just save some money? at least, i think it will take half the time compared to practicing with teleportation (which will take years)..  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  and, well i dunno really but i think teleportation hasn't been done yet.. well not that i know of anyway, correct me if i'm wrong..

			I've heard of people doing it. Yes, I am actually finding ways to save money now. But if I can do something like teleport, than I would like to try. I just have no clue where to start. Best bet is the Wingmakers site but I've heard all they have to say is crap.

Here's a technique:

Keep in mind, this is advanced kundalini yoga...so. Maybe try some of the other exercises and such on that site. Like charging your chakras. Or other things.

			Actually, just most of it is crap. The stuff that really works probably accounts for 1% of the total content, and it would be nice if they just took out all the crap, but it's pretty easy to tell the difference. For example, things that sound star trekky like &quot;blank slate technology&quot; and all that other BS is clearly, well, BS. I think the teleportation technique is legit, as well as one or two levitation techniques.
<br />

<br />
PS: Don't bother talking about whether or not levitation is possible in this thread, it's very annoying.

Truepsion, you do understand potential risks. Might be far worst then phasing...actually, rumors are that teleportation is part of Phasing.

			Yes I've read teleportation may be a sort of phasing. Logically speaing, you phase through the physical plane, dematerializing in other words, and then quickly go to a desired point through the astral plane, and then phase back onto the physical plane. Speaking from my point of view of course. I do know it's risky but my reasons for wanting to transport myself this quickly are personal and serious.

Not sure of that. Paramhansa Yogananda, from what I know teleported to another location close by, but none-the-less  teleported from mountain top to mountain top. Also I think Babaji did too.

that's probably the easiest to prove of all the stuff on this site.

i'll go check that Paramhansa Yogananda guy for the sake of it... but that sounds really IMPOSSIBLE to believe to me
