			I thought this would be an interesting topic.  Psionics is just too fun to keep a secret.  
<br />

<br />
I'll go first.  Well, I practiced psychokinesis for a few days before I showed my best friend.  I practiced until I could reliably move the psiwheel in the direction I wanted.  Well, I prefer the straight forward aproach.  I invited him over, and I showed him that I could move the psiwheel.  He became very interested in psychokinesis, and I showed him this website.  I showed two of my other friends pk at a campout that was conveniately on the coming weekend (boyscouts).  I used the same straight forward method.  I just showed them that I could move the psiwheel without touching it or blowing on it or anything.  They tried afterwards, but none of them could move it lol, yet one of them still blames it on air movement.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Sooo, how did you tell your friend or friends about psionics, or did you tell them?

			I usually start off with the topic of lucid dreaming. If they're responsive to that, I move on to all the different things that the human mind can do. Then I show them psionics. (usually by showing them psipog)

			lol, what I do is just create a fairly strong psi ball and then tell them to feel over my hands and ask em what they feel without telling them what they are suppose to feel for. As a result, they tend to be more open to the possibilities of other branches of psionics.

			I haven't done it, nor do I intend to show it to anyone for that matter &lt;.&lt; I deal mainly in TP-related stuff, with the motive of applying it for practical purposes. The only one who knows that I'm into psionics at all is my brother, who once caught me practicing in my room. But I don't plan to tell anyone else about it.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Yeah, I know that this thread was for people who HAVE done it, but still, I want to see if we can maybe discuss in a polite way regarding people's purposes to tell others about their practices. I don't intend to offend anyone.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Well a couple of years back when i was in highschool I never actually went through the phase that everybody goes through where they want to tell people.
<br />

<br />
The people I began training under and the community I was envolved with knew all to well the secrets that society deem untrue to be real. The person who got me going was my sisters boyfriend a couple of years ago. This guy was a martial artist, rapper, DJ, super genius. I thought he was the dopest person ever.
<br />

<br />
He showed me speed reading. Later when I checked the internet I found photoreading and from their i asked the quesiton what more our brains could do.
<br />

<br />
I was taught that a problem must be solved at a higher level of thought than it was created. This, I was told by Makalani, applied to convincing skeptics as well. You needed to give them an example that involved not only their thoughts but their emotions as well to prove it to them. If you did not have such power, and the person need not the technique that you knew. Then simply don't mention it.
<br />

<br />
So I've never really had suck problems, and never went out of my way to convince someone. The strong belief of not waisting my time doing such things and the pointlessness of doing such under certain conditoins was drilled into my head since the beginning. Because I carry myself so well, even when I reveal such things since i have that aura of mystery about me. They'll just assume that I'm some super talented super genius and I'm one of those 1 and a million people able to do such things.
<br />

<br />
Actually out of that respect is what  brought about the birth of my team.

			From what I've experienced, the first question you should usually ask is this;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Have you experienced anything abnormal?&quot;

It's a good starter question.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
