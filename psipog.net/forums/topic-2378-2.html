			What im asking is if anyone has experience with filtering thoughts through inner programming? 
<br />

<br />
That was the direct question still searching to be balanced.
<br />

<br />
Keeping it simple is solid. One sentence sums up your points when aimed as a tool. Focus on the positive possibilities that language is alive.  When wisdom is shared add your own verse.  &quot;what you can't control&quot; is the predominant ant on the hill of past. Once you believe something is right or wrong you roll your intelligence from the summit of understanding improvement.

			meh i think he is pretty clever. just because you cant understand it doesnt mean he doesnt know what he is talking about. he uses metaphors and weird tenses. i do the same thing some times. due to my inconsistancy, you probably wouldnt beable to understand me outside of this forum either. (IRL i mean)
<br />

<br />
The only thing you wont beable to control is the emotions strengths, but then all you would have to do is build your stone to compensate for this. Its not that hard really. Next time when you feel the overload comming on, notice how it feels. By doing this you can already determain how strong your stone (intention) needs to be. Your mortar (commands) remain the same. To keep your stones in place and to make your sheild self sustaining. When you know how strong your overloads are then it will be easier to calculate how strong your stones must be.

			good insight.  The technique ive used the past couple of days is to relate all ideas to the ocean. Then positive energy feels like im just floating with the sun. The negative energy creates waves which I surf. Real time surfing gives me a clear mind. And if by mistake i eat sand alls you got to do is paddle back out. 
<br />

<br />
Just had the crazy idea to surf lava and incorporate a solid rock shield as the board. Why not give the board a laptop? neo silver surfer meets thing

So moving on today I found it interesting to unfocus my eyes a bit (cross-eyed) while relaxing. Energy seemed much more visible and self awareness meditation intensified exponentially towards simplicity. Taking this exercise to class auras had new clarity. When talking with someone their energy changes with visible feelings however self awareness says detachment follows (i=we) ergo a subconscious finds itself.

			dont cross your eyes perse', just relax them. They really dont need to be anywhere. Just pick a spot and let your eyes go their. Or perhaps dont even pick a spot, to avoid the compelling feeling to put your eyes back to that spot. Your getting the hang of it... How did your sheilding aganst overload go BTW?

			Diminishing semiloads now. Thoughts only have control when connected with other then past. The moment feels safer as we relax to draw near. In life infinite questions match with infinite answer however masters comprehend each side of that coin spins with peace and harmony.

A key which is a great help to we has been having a family wherever need be. Trick is to will family/warriors with your shields. Our personal counsel protects us and guides incoming thoughts with security and wisdom.

			Taking my own advice of keeping it simple I'll turn the stove down a notch. lol Ok ok ok...Now as for what I was saying about family I think you should now that it's is very useful. Let me explain why by showing you an example.
<br />

<br />
You?re in a situation where the world is telling you to be a certain way. You on the other hand believe that you?re right regardless. A tool to gather enough confidence to deal with the world is finding family. Now finding family means finding energy; when the concept of energy it's placed in the context of family an inner-connection with communication appears. So this family I'm saying helps with communication because multiple points of views are always guiding while loyal to you. Your imagination let's go of right or wrong while observing the realms of possibilities. Consider this; a family (flexing the mental muscle to know) could consist of 20 points of view. Now if you?re thinking why would anyone need that many I will explain. Take a king, now that?s one point of view, however he only handles the most challenging questions (the questions that take the most mental power). Then the king has people below him in order of mental abilities. 
<br />

<br />
Relating the king to you imaging a question?  (Take a second)
<br />

<br />
Would your confidence in answering this question rise if you had 20 points of views to choose from? Of course, now would you save energy by choosing the most efficient view? Yes
<br />

<br />
To help this large thought seem simple just think simple.

			Ok you can piece together confusing metaphors, but can you GET THE VERB TENSES AND SENTENCE STRUCTURE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE CORRECT?

Has anyone here read Skywriting By Word of Mouth by John Lennon?

			Since proper english seems to be the focus on a psi forum ill keep writing my way, however the question of me understanding the view-point of others emerges with 3 possibilities.
<br />
1. My wisdom is solid so grammar is their only competition
<br />
2. They are unintelligent
<br />
3. They are trying to show knowledge
<br />

<br />
Now Im hoping for #3 so if theres a clever way to open my eyes don't blink.

			Instead of finding ways to circumvent a problem, simply attack the problem. If you are getting negative effects from your memories, can't control your empathy, do not find ways to merely calm yourself when the episodes come. 
<br />

<br />
Did you ever really have a question?
<br />
----
<br />

<br />
Thought I'd add a little bit to this. Memories and experiences we have are not dictated by some metaphysical means. You are not &quot;overloading&quot; empathically, because you are have negative memories and experiences. You are &quot;overloading&quot; physically/emotionally, as an affect of psychological stress caused by these experiences. Your solution then, is most likely not Psychic at all.
