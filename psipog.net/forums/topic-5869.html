			A while back, I posted about the creation of a system for the formalized description of a spell or construct.  Since then, I have been working on the creation of one.  Here is what I have so far, though this is faaar from complete.  In order to depict a spell, you need graph paper.  Though you are representing a three-dimensional (or possibly more) construct, it can be drawn in two dimensions like a blueprint or schematic.  More on that later.
<br />

<br />
The most fundamental unit is the circle.  This could be your entire construct, if it was to have no attributes, and no function.  The blank circle is simply psi, with no determining attributes, and is the fundamental building block for any construct.  (note that in constructs using energies other than psi, all energies are represented using circles)
<br />

<br />
The next critical element is a connection, represented by a line.  Note that any two elements of a construct can be connected, regardless of proximity, type, complexity, whatever.  A connection influences a spell's shape and function.  These lines move through boxes.  I'll mention structural lines later, but those go on the lines of the graph paper.
<br />

<br />
A square represents an actionable function or pattern.  Generally, a square will perform actions with circles.
<br />

<br />
Triangles represent a designation.  They are a very broad-purpose tool, which can be used for any number of things.  You use designations all the time when working with psi.  Any visualization is a huge composite of designations- how things look, feel, etc.  You should strip those down to the bare minimum for the purposes of the construct.  It becomes more energy-efficient, much faster and easier to make, and also portable to other people using different techniques or internal designations.  So if you use a visualization of your hands heating and then sprouting flame to generate heat, you may just want to include a designation for heat.  Whoever is reading your schematic will have their own method for producing heat, and will use that to insert heat into the construct at the directed point.
<br />

<br />
A plus sign represents an input into the construct, while an X represents an output from the construct.  A minus sign represents a direct drain from the construct, such as filtering energy through the construct to keep it stable without actually accomplishing a task.
<br />

<br />
Structural lines are exclusively for the shape and integrity of the construct.  You might use them to indirectly channel psi, apart from using a connection.  Though not strictly necessary for a construct to function, any form of resilience in the face of entropy comes from organization and expenditure of energy.  When you place structural lines, you are representing energy used to constrain the construct in any way.  They can be coupled with circles or squares to accomplish any number of tasks, as well.
<br />

<br />
Arrows can be used to represent forces, such as physical forces, forces to make the construct function, or abstract forces which the construct can use to do fancy things, like change its shape and controlledly rearrange itself.
<br />

<br />
Regions are structurally distinct areas of lines, or segments of your construct the way different organs are distinct parts of the human body.  The interior of regions can be programmed with their own functioning rules.  So if you want to create an area which generates light, you put all the necessary functional components to creating light inside an appropriately-sized region.
<br />

<br />
Advanced programming elements, such as conditionals, step processes, and sophisticated actions can be represented also, but I'm still working on the best way to do that.  Branching lines with a triangle around them, discrete boxes, chained elements, whatever.
<br />

<br />
That's all I have for now, but it's surprisingly flexible.  The major flaw with it is that you have to describe the various components.  It's easy to use a different symbol derived from the necessary one (a circle with a spiral inside, or a star, or whatever), and have a reference somewhere to what those symbols mean, but I'm working on a better way.  Try and guess what this spell does, just from the schematic.  If you can't guess it, make it:
<br />

<br />
Note that many of the symbols I talked about above can't be made in ASCII.  So I'm substituting as best I can.

*The spaced minus signs in the middle are to prevent the forum from automatically formatting the more-than-two spaces between the elements down to one space.  Also, imagine a fourth side to the structural line box around the construct on the right side.  In order to actually put it there, I would have had to fill the box with minus signs.  I figured this was easier.
<br />

<br />
This is much easier to understand on graph paper than in ASCII art.  Try and make one, it's easy!

			Basically, your mind takes two inputs to produce anything.  It needs energy, and a direction to put it towards.  With a thought, you need energy to have it, and something to think about.  With constructs, you need psi, and a concept to fulfill.  OK?
<br />

<br />
Normally, you form the concept of the construct you are going to make completely within your own head, and then follow through on it.  Due to the unreliability of the human mind, this may change from time to time, so no two constructs you make are &quot;identical.&quot;  But, when you can write it down, it becomes possible to make more complex constructs more accurately.  Think about a book.  Writing allows you to create a very long and detailed book, without needing to hold the entire thing in your mind at any given time.  And you can read it off as you need it.  Hopefully, this means of opens up a whole new avenue of huge, intricate constructs with awesome powers
<br />

<br />
Another advantage is it becomes possible for two different minds to use the same concept from their own perspective.  No two people create constructs the same way, so any attempt to give straight directions is doomed to fail.  But using a set of tools and components that are universally understood, it becomes possible to share any invention that you may have.  Now we no longer need to reinvent the wheel countless times, once for each of us.  One of us invents it, or another construct, and posts it.  Now we can all do it, and know it has been done, and can build off of it, and improve it.
<br />

<br />
OK so far?  Good.  For those of you who did not figure it out, the construct I wrote before is an automatic psi collector.  It takes in energy, specifically sunlight, and uses it to produce psi.  It then stores this in an output reservoir.  However, keep in mind, that this is a representation of a concept.  It need not actually have that shape, the diagram is a means of telling someone else how to create it.  It could be a point, or a very large square, or whatever.  Though I find it useful to actually picture it created that way, you can do whatever you need to do.  As long as you organize the concepts presented in the diagram in the connected and encapsulated manner that they are, you will end up with the same functional construct.  Your methods for creating any component of it are irrelevant (as long as they work for you) as far as the diagram is concerned.
<br />

<br />
The only fundamental components of the rune system you need to really understand are these: 
<br />
1) circle = energy
<br />
2) square = action
<br />
3) triangle = thought/visualization
<br />
4) line = connection
<br />

<br />
That's it.  If you can get that, you can make a huge variety of constructs.  Other stuff can be added in later, when you have mastered the fundamental four.

			OK, I've been experimenting with writing out the constructs.  And I came up with a couple other notations that might be useful.  Some are redundant, but I'm not going to put those here.  However, some are powerful in their own right, and even led to their incorporation in the rune-like one.  I'll only provide one here, as it incorporates into the mainstream diagram, and is going to be a little difficult to assimilate.
<br />

<br />
This is going to be a doozy.  First, let me give you a little background on my thinking so you will understand it easily.  Psi must follow laws, so those have been the most intense subject of my study.  Haven't gotten that far, but when I do, I'll post it.  Anyway, we know that psi cannot do more that there is energy to do.  This implies that psi, without space, can do work, but nevertheless must remain balanced.  So psi is, in essence, a value of energy.  A number depicting its quantity.  Now, in the current diagrams, there are no numbers.  This is a serious oversight, like telling an engineer to make a bridge without telling him how long it needs to be, or telling someone to go somewhere without telling them how far it is, just &quot;that way.&quot;  I came up with a very complex system with countless equations and variables.  And it works extremely well.  But I decided it was much too complicated to post about- maybe sometime I'll attach it.  
<br />

<br />
What I have for you guys is a simple version.  Firstly, the reference changes dramatically.  Instead of listing what each item does in a reference somewhere on the page, you only need to refer to the kinds of energy used.  The only kinds I think should be standardized are G, for general psi; K, for kinetic energy; P, for potential energy; and A, for ambient energy.  Capital letters represent classes of energy, lowercase letters represent properties.  
<br />

<br />
The unit of reference is the &quot;point.&quot;  This refers to an infinitely small particle which has all the properties of the body of psi to which it belongs.  The point's properties can be represented by its type of energy, and what properties it has in proportions.  So, Gh is psi with equal parts psi and a heat property to it.  2Gh would be half as potent as Gh, or &quot;weaker&quot; heat, but more energy.  G2h would be hot psi.  G10h would be VERY hot psi, like saying &quot;add 10 parts flour to 1 part water&quot; produces very floury water.
<br />

<br />
Keep in mind that these energies can be a little more complex than they could in the previous system.  For example, cold energy is a negative amount of heat energy (provided that room temperature is your zero, though I don't think that makes sense.  By the way, what SHOULD we use as a base for heat energy?  Absolute zero?  0 degrees Celsius?)  And then what happens when you SQUARE h?  Gh^2?  Or, better yet, make it the square root of negative h!  G(hi)  Anyway, there's some theoretical cud to chew.
<br />

<br />
Just to expand this thing's capabilities further, what about if we can define new kinds of energies by inventing a complex cocktail of other energies?  Like if we make a long string of general psi energy studded with heat energy?  You have just created a point-construct.  A large body of this construct would make a new and distinct kind of energy that you invented.  Add to this that there are an infinite number of possible fundamental energies simply by directly altering their properties, and we have ourselves an infinite creative outlet.  Define your own types of energy- go on, tinker.  Then experiment on it and see how it behaves.  After a couple hours' work I came up with one that's actually useful, here shown:
<br />

<br />
         vCjg
<br />
           G
<br />
Cjg&gt; G 0 G &lt;Cjg
<br />
           G
<br />
         ^Cjg
<br />

<br />
0 = space
<br />
G = general psi
<br />
K = Kinetic Energy
<br />
Cjg = Crushjogger (arrow depicting direction it's pointed, up in the subdiagram)
<br />
            ^ 
<br />
      G 0 0 0 G  
<br />
            K
<br />

<br />
Revamping actions; as you remember, an action is an operation that is performed on energy.  For example, the energy converter from last time could be 2A =&gt; G.  The compressor could be A + A =&gt; 2A, indicating two sources combined into one.  A more interesting one might be: h(G^3 + 7G^2 + 12G) =&gt; Gh(G+3)(G+4) which takes four inputs and produces three outputs (in the SAME spot) by factoring.  What I mean by this is that one connection leads away from the action, but it has three streams of energy on it.  One of which is heat, one of which is more energetic to a factor of 3, and another is more energetic to a factor of 4.  These can be interpreted as one stream, but will travel at different rates along it, and the most energetic will arrive first; (G+4), and the least energetic will arrive last; (Gh).  This can be taken advantage of to perform a task with three sequential actions, or whatever.  Keep in mind that this kind of ridiculous complexity is absolutely not necessary.  You can do pretty much anything with very simple forms, but this is just a demonstration of how powerful and flexible the system is.
<br />

<br />
Next up; triangles.  Before, they involved some description of a visualization or a designation.  They still serve the same function, but without the amorphous description.  Think of them as &quot;rules&quot; that all interactions within their scope must follow.  This can be the entire construct, a region, a single action, or whatever.  An example of a rule is: G = h.  This means that all general psi behaves and interacts like pure heat energy, within the scope of the designation.  Thus a Gh become an H^2.  NOTE: though this rule is simple, it will almost DEFINITELY screw up the working of your construct.  Don't use it unless you're sure.  Direct equivalencies are a PAIN.  These have endless interesting possibilities, though if you put the wrong one in the wrong place it can seriously screw up your construct.  More reasonable ones are transformatives on single actions, such as enabling you to convert a large point-construct into a different shape.  As an interesting note, though it may at first appear that this violates the laws of conservation of matter and energy, it consumes exactly as much energy to maintain a given designation that it would to maintain an action capable of performing the same action itself, because designations are a fundamental part of the use of psi.  You are, in fact, using them all the time for things you don't even realize, often in very large composites of designations.
<br />

<br />
Alright, that's enough.  I could go on for quite a while, but I bet nobody is reading by this point...  Aw, damn.  I'll post some awesome constructs later, created with this method.  And you can make em by following it.

<br />
yes, for those who play too much runescape and are wondering &quot;wth? rune alphabet&quot;.... rune is a language, something like helbrew
<br />

are u sure that tech u have there works? as in, is it from some ancient text or was it spontanous or did u sat down for hours to think about it.....

			Sorry about the extremely long posts, but this is pretty awesome stuff, at least I think so.  It may take a while to understand it, but when you do the possibilities for constructs open up endlessly.
<br />

<br />
This is artificial.  I made it up.  I have proved it to work, however.  So don't question it only because it doesn't hail from some ancient text.  How about we call it something else if the name runes bothers you?  Spellforms?  Just forms?  Schema?  Code?  Instructions?  Whatever, I don't mind.
<br />

<br />
Here's another useful mixture of psi:  This one can be refined from a construct I am still working on, but will release soon.  It is essentially an an ATP molecule for psi constructs.  
<br />

<br />
 - G
<br />
R H R
<br />
 - G
<br />

<br />
G = general psi
<br />
H = &quot;hard&quot; psi, constrains G
<br />
R = reactive agent psi
<br />

<br />
*still working on better way of describing fundamental psi properties
<br />

<br />
For those who don't know what ATP is, it is the unit of storage that all living cells use to hold and transfer small amounts of energy.  An ADP and a phosphate are combined with energy and produce an ATP molecule.  When the molecule releases its energy, it becomes an ADP and phosphate again.  This composite psi &quot;molecule&quot; does the same thing.  When its energy is released, the reactive agent psi is expent.  However, the basic structure remains, and can be reused.
<br />

<br />
Another cool all-purpose gizmo to add to your constructs:
<br />

<br />
      
<br />
 - G G G
<br />
G G R
<br />
 - G G G
<br />
      
<br />

<br />
G = General Psi
<br />
R = Reactive agent
<br />

This &quot;female socket&quot; can be used to constrain a reaction to only between two different reactive agents.  That's jargon for- make two things react with nothing else doing anything to it.  The &quot;male&quot; socket will change based on the function the reaction will have.  For example, you have a fantastically dense bit of psi that you want to &quot;blow up&quot; to get all the energy from.  The male socket might look like this:
<br />

<br />
 - G - G - G G
<br />
A T T T T T -
<br />
 - G - G - G G
<br />

<br />
G = General psi
<br />
A = Activation agent
<br />
T = energy transfer psi
<br />

<br />
The slots between the G's are for the energy storage bits above to fill, and receive their charge from along the T conduit, resulting from the A and the R &quot;blowing up&quot; when put together.  An example of these components at work:
<br />

<br />
______________
<br />
 O S     
<br />
 S © S         
<br />
 O ®-------Q 
<br />
 || ||
<br />
 D-D-D              
<br />
 D-D-D
<br />
______________
<br />

<br />
O = Pure general psi
<br />
® = Female Socket (with &quot;explosive&quot; dense energy)
<br />
© = Male Socket
<br />
S = Psi ATP
<br />
D = Reserve of dense energy
<br />
Q = Output Reservoir
<br />

<br />
This should probably be wired to something which synthesizes the dense energy, as by this model it will exhaust its supply and then do nothing.
<br />

<br />
Note that the symbols in the last drawing indicate a sizeable pool of energy, each &quot;particle&quot; of which is one of the molecules defined above.  Yes, this is inspired by chemistry.  I'm working on making this sistem more suited to this particular field.

			OK, the major problem I have found with this system so far is that it is almost impossible to nail down exactly the nature of the psi intended to be used in a construct.  I am addressing that right now.  Though you may not like the strictness of the system, keep in mind that the possibilies are endless, so although each energy is VERY specifically defined, if you need something different you can simply cook up another.
<br />

<br />
Defining the nature of an energy is the most difficult part of this entire system.  Though the system itself is three steps, or levels, it has become a little convoluted so far so I will summarize it here.
<br />

<br />
1) The most fundamental level, this is the definition of the energies involved.  This will be addressed in this post.
<br />
2) The creation of point-constructs (better name necessary), which are functional units of psi similar to molecules.
<br />
3) Construct wiring.  This uses pure energies, molecules, actions, etc. and connects them up to perform a task or to create an entity.
<br />

<br />
Essentially, a definition of an energy is an in-depth description of its characteristics.  I have found that the average form of energy can be perfectly described in about a half a page.  If this sounds like a lot, keep in mind that once someone learns to use this energy, they will never need to refer to that page again (unless they forget).
<br />

<br />
To describe the traits of an energy, think of it in terms of its fundamental laws, strict definition of traits, and its basic structure.  General psi has no traits save three fundamental laws: The Law of Equality, the Law of Action, and the Law of Change.  This means it has no mass, no volume, no nothing except those three fundamental laws.
<br />

<br />
I haven't yet decided if entropy deserves a place on a fundamental law of an energy, or whether it is rather a fundamental law of the universe.  But it's a fact for all psionics, so deal with it as you will.  In any case, you must derive any energy you &quot;design&quot; from a different form of energy.  General psi is perfect because it has virtually no characteristics, and is therefore almost infinitely malleable (however, keep in mind that nobody can produce &quot;perfect&quot; general psi, or even come close).
<br />

<br />
My standard method of defining an energy is to have a very short description of its function and intended purpose, and then its laws, traits, and structure.
<br />

<br />
Here is an example definition of a light and simple energy;
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Structural Energy</span>
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Description;</span>  
<br />
This energy, derived from G, attaches itself to G and can use G to reinforce itself when it is depleted by the natural forces of entropy.  It also does not erode or deteriorate as quickly as G.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Laws</span>
<br />
Attracted to G 
<br />
Attracted to structural energy
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Traits</span>
<br />
Still.  Its particles do not jostle each other chaotically.  Though reducing their functionality to... being there, they do not expend their energy as quickly.  (testing in progress.  I believe these to last over 100x longer than G)
<br />
Integral Repair.  Its basic traits are similar enough to those of G that the two can mix integrally, and their attraction accomodates this.  As the structural energy fades (slowly) it is replaced by G.  Though it can still serve the same structural function as long as this holds out, the G erodes at its normal rate, which means the rate of decay increases exponentially, with the limit being the natural rate of decay of G.  This makes it do its job for a lot longer than G would, however.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Structure</span>
<br />
Six single bonds.  Two must be connected to either other structural energy, or nothing.  Up to four may be to G or another energy.
<br />

<br />
Note that this energy of course follows the same laws as general psi (or G).
<br />

<br />
These are abstractions which your mind uses to synthesize the necessary energy (as my best theory goes).  These are not the actual physical directions to create such an energy, which not even the top scientists in the world could tell you what it looks like with any degree of certainty.  Also keep in mind that, although you could (and perhaps should) reduce this entire thing down to a set of laws only, that would be complex and cumbersome.  Keep in mind, psi is so flexible that any attempt to use it is a classification in and of itself.  Change this at will.  Tinker, improve, whatever.  Tell me what you find worked or works better.  The best way to do something never gets made on the first try.

			Work in progress indeed...as for the rune language thing, someone once said that math itself is the language of god. Don't want to get any religionish or anything but was refering to the universe. I think I may be the few who read through all the ....possibilty unnesscery lost posts. I think you should have slow down and let some people catch up first.
<br />

<br />
Years ago I made a few runes mayself, why?......Don't know why but I feel like there my &quot;mark&quot;. I like how you made it look like a circirt bored and a little boliogy. I don't think I personaly don't want to call any of this proof just yet. I'll try it out just for fun though.
<br />

<br />
As for the entropy problem you have, I think I should add that entropy is just the affect from the 2nd law of thermodyamics. I think heat and entropy are simpler and shouldnt be split in two. But that is just me. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			I came into this forum to post something along the lines of, &quot;Hey guys, we should make a standardized form of construct blue prints, ala electronics.&quot; It appears that was uneccesary.
<br />

<br />
When you finish this, you should definitely host a site, or put up an article on it, I believe this could be one of the first steps to a logical format of psionic constructs. I know I'll be using this, or something very similar, in my journal from here on out.

			This all just strikes me as a repeat of Omnimancy.  I'm sure you came up with the idea yourself but the fact is, it's already been done and by far more accomplished magicians than yourself (they claim they're not psions, but I have no idea why since they are simply practicing direct magick a.k.a. psionics).
<br />

<br />
It's been created, is constantly practiced and improved upon.  Maybe you should check them out.
