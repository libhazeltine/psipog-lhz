			After reading an interesting article on psionics I was immersed into the subject and I happened to find this website. I've been reading this site for about the past 6 or 7 hours. Well anyways, onto my personal experience. 
<br />

<br />
I've read a few articles about OBE's before finding this website, but I've never actively sought experiencing OBEs. However, I've <span style="font-weight: bold">frequently</span> had lucid dreams before even reading this website. I have also experienced deja vu on several occasions, in which an event from a dream (when asleep) or from a powerful passing thought (when awake) will actually come true.
<br />

<br />
Is this a sign of precognition/clairvoyance? 
<br />

<br />
However, let me describe a <span style="font-weight: bold">mind-blowing</span> discovery I made while reading this website:
<br />

<br />
My grandfather. Ever since I was a child, he has always talked to me about how he was able to perform things described on this site, not using the same vocabulary, but definitely the same concepts and. He's filipino and english is not his native language, so there has been a small language barrier (he can speak english fluently, but at a basic level, so he often has difficulty fully expressing what he means in English). 
<br />

<br />
He always tried to teach me about it and he'd often try to get me to read his books about the subject. However, I never believed him, since when I was a child my family has always associated him as being superstitious and things of that sort. One thing that immediately grabbed my attention once I began exploring this site is that I've always noticed I could often FEEL my grandfather's presence, even if I couldn't sense him with any of my five senses, as if something was trying to grab my attention. Which, I've discovered is described as a Ping.
<br />

<br />
One extremely vivid experience that I will never forget is from few years ago (I was about 11 or 12, I am 16 now). We were walking down from our house to a local drugstore to get food and a lottery ticket and he showed me something completely unbelievable. As we were walking down my neighborhood, a large dog started barking at us. He told me he was able to make the dog stop barking and then proceeded to demonstrate to me. He then held out his hand and was quiet and seemed extremely concentrated for a moment... and to my disbelief, the dog stopped. I quickly dismissed it as a coincidence, since of the superstitious label my family gave to my grandpa. Now, that notion of a coincidence has been completely challenged. 
<br />

<br />
I could tell a million more stories, but writing them all down in this post would give most of you (and me) a migraine and would take much too long to write.
<br />

<br />
However, I've been completely captivated by the information here, to the point that I haven't even been able to start my homework, since my mind is refuses to wander from the subject. This website has just changed my entire understanding of my grandfather.

Yeah, I just realized that when I went to check the thread haha. For some reason when I made the most I was thinking about remote viewing at the time, so I clicked on the wrong forum <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> Anyways, if anyone could move this to the dream forum that'd be great!
