			These articles take into account research from China in the 1960s.  Because we all know the Chinese Communist Party NEVER lies...

			There were just referencing information from the 1960's. As much as I dislike the communist party aswell, why would they lie about something as important, to them anyways, as tradition or the 'ancient ways'? The article is dated August 10th, 2003. This is quite interesting. It basically states that acupuncture should be a more widespread practice, or anything relating in the field of better energy circulation within the body. Personally, I just think it's the electricity in the nerves that creates the EM field. It is quite mind-boggling though how the electricity is actually generated. That'll be quite a discovery. Probably chemical reactions.

			Something about it sounded familer to me but I couldn't place my finger on it untill just recently. It was in a time mangnize that I read about a chinainze woman praticeing some of this. So I guess some people think its importent in some ways.
<br />

<br />
I don't tend to agree with Time, normaly I read pop sci or Scinetific America. I just read it to see what some people are thinking. 
<br />

<br />
(I like to get the stories from both sides of the coin)

			Sounds pretty logical to me. But i think it was like already proven by scientists. So it's nothing new to me. 
<br />

<br />
Though i find it very interesting. Your body generates electricity. With Psionics you are able to generate Psi. What is Psi? What is electricity? Both energy i guess. Psi = Electricity or Psi= Electricity formed by the mind? I don't know.
<br />

<br />
But with having influence on this generated Psi or Electricity or Energy Flow in your body you can do amazing stuff like Psychokinesis. It seems at least that we can do. Why it happens is still unclear. 
<br />

<br />
I think scientists have proven also that animals have an energy field around them and they can sense the magnetic energy field of the earth. 
<br />
So why should humans not? They are the same like animals in a way.
