			I was just going through the psipog.net site and i randomly saw somewhere that you guys tried to move large objects, the most successful being a chair (good group effort <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> ). 
<br />

<br />
But then that got me thinking. 
<br />

<br />
If you require good control, good focusing skills (i.e. blocking out subconscious, etc) to successfully move either a psiwheel or a coin or whatever, why is it that it is harder to move HEAVIER objects. Why is your psi power governed by weight?
<br />

<br />
With bigger objects i was thinking maybe it's something to do with the amount of molecules/atoms it contains. (If i anyone can enlighten me please do so  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> )
<br />

<br />
Maybe the weight has nothing to do with it at all? Maybe you just assume its more difficult when in reality it's no different.
<br />

<br />
Has anyone tried to move/slide/levitate a heavier, but small, object?

			I dont know...it really depends on your method of pk. Like, mine is weird. I pack psi around the object and it serves as a means of pushing or pulling the object. So for me I guess it would be harder to move large objects. But for someone who &quot;connects&quot; with the object, I guess its just a mind over matter thing.

			It would be like me asking why I can't lift things that weight alot more than I do...it's like another pair of arms that you have to work out with and become stronger..but pepsiboy has a pretty good point(although blunt) there isn't a definate answer. <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" />

			uh.. maybe it takes more effort because *gasp* it has more mass? *faint*

<br />
you could still be putting forth the same amount of energy but getting a lower velocity due to increased mass.

			I find lighter things harder to do then heavier, or at least, bigger it is, usually bigger = heavier.
<br />

<br />
But I'm losing my skills so, nothing is easy.... :'(
<br />

<br />
I'm hardly tired from doing any sort of PK or psionics of any sort, unless I'm already near the end of my waking stage, leading me to the land of sleep.

you just answered the very question with the very same issue i was questioning.
<br />

<br />
Is it really energy that controls the movement in terms of pk?
<br />
Does more mental control = more energy? not necessarily.

			From my vantage point, I perceive that there are electromagnetic energies around us. Moving certain objects requires your brain to alter or generate different brainwaves. As we all know, there are many levels of subconscious states, so to speak. So when you change the object that you practise on, you're exposed to a different aspect. The brain will have to adjust/acclimatize by generating a different brainwave pattern to affect the energy around the object, just like how you're getting used to a new environment. I hope this helps. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

<br />
well if you can get some way to move an object using no energy, google searches can make your life very rich indeed.
<br />

<br />
So are you asking &quot;how do you create more telekinetic energy?&quot;
