			Hey I just posted this on another thread but am making a new one because this is a serious matter. Long story short i slipped into a DEEP trance while performing PK (levitation) and out of nowhere my heart started pumping, hard. Along with mustering a mass or energy and what felt like adrenaline. It got to the point where i thought i was SERIOUSLY going  to have a heart attack. I've never felt control like this before...i knew i could slow my heart if i wanted but the PK was working 10x better...so i stopped after few minutes....but even during it i could still think sooo clearly and &quot;talk to myself&quot;( most of you know what i mean)...althought i was incredibly hot and sweaty i didn't feel spent or tired at all after it. I'd like to know if this is dangerous and please no fluff??...can anyone speak to me from experience?????
<br />

<br />
P.S while in the trance my breathing was incredibly fast short breaths (as if hyperventilating)????

			Well, If you're a teenager or kid, stop pk for a while, try something else like tp or psiballs. If you're an adult, unclog those arteries! Heh cut down on the greasy shit with lots of fat. And jesus, calm down.

			I felt something like that a couple times, but didn't noticed the TK being better, it was just the same to me. I don't think you will get trouble to your heart unless you have some problem that could get worse with the extra.

			one of the hardest things to learn with pk is being passive. you can train yourself to control your heartbeat and slow it down to a safe level.

			As far as I know there have been no records of health problems related to PK.  It does increase your heart rate but so does excercise. And yes i could see a problem develope if your arteries are clogged or you already have hyper tension. But other than that I wouldnt worry about it too much.

well, first of all, no giving medical advice, it's illegal, just warning this is a good thread IMO.  Also, Nina kuglina(sp, you know her).

			hmm true I forgot about her weight loss... I was focusing on her health problems like strokes and things.  And we cant prove that PK had anything to do with those considering she had a history of those health problems.

			i did a program all about bio-feedback while meditating and when i got to high meditative states my body did the exact same thing. i freaked out cuz i thought i was gonna have a heart attack and i had to stop, but the doctor said that its nothing to worry about its just natural and not dangerous but of course whatever makes u feel safest is best for you.

			i've been in a similar state twice while trancing before going to sleep...
<br />
heart starts beating for no reason, i knew i could stop at any time...
<br />
my body then started to feel like it was falling apart... dematerializing...
<br />

<br />
my breathing also was fast and strange :S
<br />

<br />
i always stopped after some time... because there haven't been much changes to that state, it was just uncomfortable
<br />

<br />
i don't know if it's anything similar to your state tho
<br />

<br />
i'll check out that state again and explore it a bit ...
<br />
maybe i come across some interesting things about it
