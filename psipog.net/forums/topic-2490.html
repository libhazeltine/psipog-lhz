			Pretty much same thing with psi manip. 20 mins, bored. Like.. 5 of my friends tried to get me into it saying it's so fun, so I gave it a shot.. I hated it when people would say &quot;oh you didn't take enough time to play this great game&quot;, the graphics and gameplay makes me wanna buy a square shaped turtle.

			It isn't bad. I think you just got bored because when you start, you really have no idea what is going on. But when you take the time, you get to have some fun. Being a member is especially fun becuase you have way better stuff to work with.

I have played it before, and I have to say, it's the worst game I have ever played and I have played Superman 64!

It was fun when I was 10-13, but now it's all about FPS or Diablo-like mmorpg's

Just knowing that you could buy a square shaped turtle would make me wanna buy one.
<br />

<br />
One of the main problems with RuneScape is that it starts off slow. A lot of players don't take the time to get into it. I think it's more of a game for the patient.
<br />

<br />
I wish someone would take the time to make a game that had RuneScape's awesome item crafting, and combine that with a better combat engine, like that of Neverwinter Nights or something.

			I like RuneScape. It has crappy graphics, I know. But you have to understand. It is just like playing marapets. You just have to get the next best item that comes out. RuneScape is not really about the gameplay, but how to get more money. And yes, I did think that the game sucks in the beginning. I actually quit one character, but then a friend told me to keep on playing because it would get better and it did. Just for some of you guys who think RuneScape is completely retarded because it is'nt. Well, thats just my opinion. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Runescape is-different. if you ask me, it is too hard for a noob to get anything, especally when the first thing he does it get killed <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> (guity)
<br />
if you ask me, it has too steep of a learning curve, and no skill is needed. i really dont like it. but-on the wild chance that im on, its &quot;Lance Fight&quot; (only becouse my name and backup were used, and i hate putting numbers at the end, and that &quot;Lancefighter&quot; is at the character limit anyways)
<br />
I play Starport Galactic Empires. 2d grafics-but you acaully need skill to do anything.
