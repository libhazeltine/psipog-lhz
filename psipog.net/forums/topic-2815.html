			've noticed alot lately that when i try to spin my psiwheel it seems like i'm trying to spin it both ways at the same time. It'll go the direction i want it to then quickly dart back the other way. Then it usually starts bobbing alot. It seems like i'm countering myself.
<br />

<br />
I usually spin it counter-clock wise. It seems now it only wants to spin clockwise. It seemed like i was trying to spin it both ways because i was. I can spin it clockwise with no effort at all now but when i try to spin it counter clock wise (which again is the way i always spin it) it just refuses and starts spinning clockwise.
<br />

<br />
This is just wierd.
<br />

<br />
any suggestions
<br />

<br />
(i'm also noticing when i try not to force or control it just starts bobbing like crazy, usually falling off the thumbtack)

			Don't you find it strange though?  Right now my big psi wheel spins clockwise with absolutely no effort at all.  All i have to do is look at it now.  I have no control over it.  It's very annoying.  (though i guess i should be happy that i'm spinning it easily.)

Oh I know, It's rather annoying...
<br />
But I guess that's part of gaining the control over the psi, making it at your command telling it what to do.

			Haha! I'm exactly the same. It;s pretty annoying when it won't go the way you want it to. It spins one way, then my sub-c acts like a b*tch and makes it go the other way and I'm like &quot;nooooooo!&quot;. Although I'm starting to come out of that phase. Two nights ago I made a record at spinning in one direction. 50 turns without stopping, I think it went anti-clockwise. I found that there's a certain feel you need to try and get when you make it spin one way continuisly. I'm understanding that thing about becoming one with the object and using it like a muscle now. It's like it's apart of my mind...
<br />

<br />
You just need to practice more and you will gain more control over it and know what to look for when &quot;feeling&quot; certain &quot;tugs&quot; in your mind in certain directions.

			I am also at that stage. Whenever I &quot;want&quot; it to go counter-clockwise, it goes clockwise.
<br />

<br />
However, with my right hand, it is exactly the opposite...its dominant direction is counterclockwise.

Start off by putting your pin wheel under a glass bowl. That way you can be certain that it's you who's moving it and not a slight breeze. It's logical that larger pin wheels would attract greater wind/breeze force, that may be why you think it's so &quot;easy&quot; to move. Tell us what happens when you cut off the wind circulation with the bowl/container. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Adding a container only adds another psychological barrier between you and the wheel. You can get great results without a container. 
<br />
In my case the wheel is just listening to me, instantly, draft or no draft. 
<br />

<br />
Just keep on going and you wil be fine. Give it at least another month. Practise is the only way to overcome this problem.
<br />

<br />
Your sub-c is just so happy it can spin that thing, it will do so as soon as you see it. Just to make you happy. Now it is your task to make yourself comfortable with it. So your sub-c has to find new ways in making you happy.
