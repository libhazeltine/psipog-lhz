			I've been trying to do TK but have only managed to move a tissue a little bit and rotate a piece of paper a couple inches. I don't have a lot of time to practice it so for now I'm just gonna put it on hold and move back to Psi balls. Now, when I make a psi ball I simply raise my hands and visualize energy in my hands and then they tingle. I then bring them closer and I can feel them tingle and get hot. So I'm pretty sure I've done it. The whole process only takes a matter of seconds. Ten at the most probably. So, if I've done it, then it doesn't take long to make them so I think I could move on. But I'm not sure what to move onto as I don't know what you can do with them. I haven't researched Psi balls as much as TK. What are the benefits? Any cons? And what is possible with psi balls?

			What is possible with psiballs? ANYTHING!  Psiballs/constructs can be used to do many things. For example, telepathy, giving you energy, tk, and many more things.  They can also be used for entertainment, by making a psipet and haveing it bite people.  Anyways, you should move onto shelling and programming.  Both these skills have articles on the psipog.net website!. Let us know how it goes!

			Okay. I'll try to shell em first. One thing though. I just created a psi ball and my hands felt...odd. I guess you'd say a sort of magnetic feeling. It was cool! Anyway, As I added energy, my hands started to push apart on their own. Is that normal or am I just crazy?

			you know why they push eachother apart?
<br />
cos both hands are facing each other and are releasing energy....thus, this energies collide and sort of repel eachother.....

and shelling is USELESS! check out my other posts

			I kinda thought that might have been the reason but it had never happened before (it happened everytime I tried it after that point last night) so I wasn't sure.
