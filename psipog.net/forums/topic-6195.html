			Earlier this year, I was pointed to a site (www.johntitor.com) that was supposedly the collective 'prophecies' of a 'man from 2036'. He predicted a civil war 2006-2010, Russia nukes us to try and end this war, and then in 2015 China nukes all our major cities. I got together all of my psion friends, and we decided to be better safe than sorry. So we made plans to hide out in the Idaho Mountains if a war broke out somewhere between 06 and 010. 
<br />

<br />
Don't know if anyone ELSE has noticed, but EVERYONE i know (psionic) including myself have noticed that psionic abilities are getting MUCH more powerful and easier to use, much faster than normal. 
<br />

<br />
So, one of my friends that i JUST asked about this earlier - According to him, when he lived in Europe years ago... He met an old man. Apparently a HIGHLY skilled psion... who had apparently delved DEEEEEP within his own mind, to uncover secrets that mankind isn't supposed to know yet. He wrote 2 volumes based on what he found. These books he passed onto Will (my friend.) Who didn't believe at the time. However, he DID try a technique (shielding) that the old man taught him. Later that year, a little boy walked up to him and said &quot;Mister, why do you have a blue ball around you?&quot; And he freaked out. He then memorized everything within those 2 books, and passed them onto that kid. Telling him NOT to pass that information on to ANYONE, except one person - who he would know when he met. Part of that information dealt with the &quot;Age of Faith&quot; and the &quot;Age of the Mind&quot;. Apparently, we had been in the Age of Faith since the formation of the Church (religious, bla bla) and this age was ending... and we were passing on into the Age of the Mind. Supposedly, within this (short) age, us Psions will get muuuch better at what we do- and for a purpose. 
<br />

<br />
Shortly after explaining this, i began to sense... things... around us. Ben and Will (the friends i was hanging with) both saw an Impish little psionic creature up on the ceiling... and then as we walked into the Teen Center, Will spotted (an apparently malevolent) construct/demon... and killed it with PSI. Which ben confirmed... and even I could see it sitting there. (both ben and will have Aura vision) I remembered Ben mentioning nightly battles with demons... which i blew off as Sleep Paralysis. But now i'm not so sure... 
<br />

<br />
And another thing that Will mentioned after this - He said that in the old man's books, it said that when demons began walking the earth freely, in large numbers... the Apocalypse is upon us. Which fit everything I had been studying PERFECTLY. Explained everything, including this odd nervous feeling in which my underarms and palms would sweat overtime (this generally happened at the YMCA... which is a congregating place for psions. I believe that these demons like to hang out around psions.) This explained it, as it would happen when a demon was nearby. After i put up a shield... Voila, gone. 
<br />

<br />
I also got to try out my psionic combat skills against a few demons while in Fencing class. On the way home, I was assaulted multiple times... And I currently have NO doubt that the end of the world is at hand. Thinking back on Titor's predictions, overlayed with (RELIGION WARNING) Revelation... the Four Horsemen (USA, China, Russia... and another participant in the war [the plan was for me and all my psion friends to hide in the mountains... and train to fight in the war. so maybe the fourth is us]) and so on... Surely the Antichrist could be anyone... but I sincerely believe he will show himself before long. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Damn. Long post. Uh, contains RELIGION my bad. I really needed to post this, as since I am 100% sure that it is coming... Consider this a warning. When (if for you) this all happens... You all are welcome to come hide out / fight with us. 
<br />

<br />
Took me half an hour to write that up, please read and honestly consider this warning. Religious or not, you can't possibly believe that this world will go on for eternity. Even if it doesn't happen (Hypothetically, i KNOW it will, and soon) its ALWAYS better safe than sorry. If you blow this off, and die because of it... well, your dead. If you heed my warning, and keep an eye out for signs, and get the hell out of the way... you should survive, and might even see what happens AFTER the apocalypse (Religion specific of course &gt;_&gt;)
<br />

<br />

I mean, if such demons were around and following psions, wouldn't everyone else be getting attacked? I mean, Everyone can do psionics, we're not a freaking specific race.

			everyone can do psionics- if they try it.  I mean, not everybody is a psion. I'm not sure if I completely believe this, but if there are demons, then they might be preying on the psions' more active psi.

			Well, I'm saying that those that CURRENTLY practice PSI (The majority of the population doesn't.) And, as it stands, they are just here. They can't attack us... Unless attacked by us. They are just moving into place ready to execute the plans of their master (you know who, if you dont, DEE DEE DEE). I didn't expect very many people to believe me, but exercise one of your own rules.. be a healthy skeptic, please. Scan around you, within your town, they are there i assure you.

			How do you know &quot;looking out for signs&quot; and &quot;heeding your warnings&quot; will do anything to prevent this war? How do you know where it's safe to be?  Do you think trainning in psi is going to make a difference when an all out nuclear war happens? So the four horsemen are the entire China, Russia, and USA governments, then, mabye a handful of kids practicing energy manipulation as the fourth. Also how do you know these &quot;demons&quot; your seeing haven't been around forever, and you could only see them now since you've been practicing psi? And you killed the &quot;imp&quot; creature with psi? How? You shot psi at it, so it died? 
<br />
You've been given scraps of information (which may not even be true) then filled in the bulk (proof) with your imagination.
<br />

<br />
P.S I doubt you and your friends would affect the outcome of <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> full scale world war. Unless you have psychic abilities like from x-men 3. Moving a pencil across a table or making a &quot;good psi ball&quot; won't sway the decision in a war.

You have good points to be honest. And apparently i wrote the sentence with the imp wrong... we didnt kill it, we left it be. However, a bit later we encountered a malevolent, much larger being, that we DID kill, by essentially shredding its insides with PSI... (as far as we can tell its what they are made of so its not hard to do) And no, the war is NOT preventable. It's going to happen. But psionics will help save us from the (for lack of better word) spiritual war that most will not realize is being waged. Besides, as i said with the Age of Mind (sounds fluffy, MEH) beginning, we don't know if psionics might flare in usefulness and potency.

Just because I believe a lot of science/scientists are beginning to recognize that there are a lot of things that the mind can do that cannot be explained by science. They are realizing how much more the mind is than previously thought.
<br />

<br />
I think it was MA who put it best when he(mabye not him) wrote &quot;If the outside world and the mind which percieves it are everchanging, then the unchanging truth ought not be found there. It must come from within; in a place independant of them both.&quot; 
<br />

I hope, at least, this is the age we are working towards.

This 'age' is more of mythical proportions, not scientific. Which is causing us (psions, psi users, etc etc etc) to be able to use our skills easier, and more efficiently. Which even before i knew about it, I was noticing.

			Maybe you should finally fucking unjoin because your clogging psipog up with fluffy shit.
<br />

<br />
I doubt that the age of mind could mean something as fluffy as little kids killing demons. I would think the age after the age of faith would be one where we stop believing in shit like this and get smarter. There's gonna be now war between russia and the US. If you hadn't noticed Russia sorta isn't that important anymore and won't really be a problem at all in the near future.

When you typed this up did you actually look at what you were typing or did you just shoot it out your ass on purpose?

I'm not even gonna touch the rest of it. It would take to long to deal with all this shit. In closing, STFU.

			ok.. im one of Mac/Finallyjoined's friend. and ive realized my ability has shot up. so when i read this i went and got my bible, and started reading revelations for the 500th time. Demons dont mean the apocalypse, if you read the Gospels (luke,John,Matthew etc.) youll see that Jesus was casting demons out of people. These Demons were <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sin</span> so maybe satan <span style="font-style: italic">wants</span> you to see them, to kill you. ive read numerous books in which highly acclaimed preachers were assaulted by demons. Theyre instant reflex is to pray, in which angels usually come down, and behead the demon. When you saw the demons have you tried <span style="font-style: italic">praying?</span>
<br />
now of course i know im responding with religion, but since ive noticed this board has kinda been doused with it, figured i might as well...
<br />
I believe the end of the world is upon us, but if GOD is coming to KILL the world...i doubt were going into another 'age'. 
<br />
from what i can tell on the subject, this would be my full response. but i dont always get the entire message the first time around (thank my dad for the horrid common sense gene 7_7)
<br />
anyway, this is kinda directed towards finallyjoined.
