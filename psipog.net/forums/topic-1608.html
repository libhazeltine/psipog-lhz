			Alrighty then, now we all know it is very possible to shape psiballs themselves into different geometric figures. As of late I have trying at my artistical side and forming constructs into more elaborate shapes and what not, like my newest project, PsiFang. Its an intelligent construct made to self power itself, it is made to maintian its shell and gather energy, and also use excess energy to try to flare itself.
<br />

<br />
Now then the question is can flares be shaped as well? Like my one goal here in the long run is to flare a psiball, or rather a psiwolf, to shape a psiball in the shape of a wolf and flare it to a color and have that hang around me.
<br />

<br />
Is it possible?

			Possible?  Anything is possible.  Practical?  I'm doubtful.  Demonstrable?  That can be debated.  Easy?  Hell no.
<br />

<br />
I've had very limited success gathering enough energy to cause a &quot;flare&quot;, or visual trace of the energy I've gathered.  However, I'm glad someone else out there is considering the possibility of forming a strong enough psi-pet to flare regularly.
<br />

<br />
They're bloody hard to photograph, as Peebrain has explained, but I've had some beautiful &quot;lens flares&quot; in odd places when having my picture taken.  Sadly, my most recent one is an outdoor image and has an over-exposed region that could very easily be attributed as the source of the lens flare.  I offer it only for amusement and maybe a bit of hope for your new project, so please keep in mind that I'm not interested in explanations of technical possibilities (indeed, probabilities) of the flaw in the following image.  Like the content of PsiPog's <a href="media.php" target="_blank" class="postlink">media</a> page, there are hundreds of way to fake it, and as I said, there's an obvious source (overexposed sky) for the unusual lens flare.
<br />

<br />

At the time I was taking this picture, I was up on Dragon's Tooth mountain in Virginia after hiking in partial meditation for several hours, admiring my psi-pet and just talking to it.  The thicker region of its body is roughly four feet long, which nicely matches the horizontal purple haze to my right in the image (left side of image, in front of the smaller rock).  I had visualized it laying crouched on all fours with tail draped across the rock towards me as it basked in the sun, looking off into the distance with me.
<br />

<br />
Oh, that reminds me.  I believe it's a good idea to make constructs, especially psi-pets solar powered!  I really don't think it'll mess with the sun too much, and helps keep track of them because you can feel their warmth when they sit on you!
<br />

<br />
I find it highly amusing that a &quot;lens flare&quot; occured precisely where I had visualized my psi-pet sitting while my picture was taken.  Certainly far from proof, but still fun.  I hope nobody minds my sharing.  I'll try and get indoor photographs that include the unusual glows...
<br />

<br />
I wouldn't expect your wolf to show up on camera with you any time within the first year, though I think it depends on your talent and dedication.  Confidence and persistence will be key to your success.  I've been working on mine for more than two years now.
<br />

<br />
EDIT:  PM or IM me if you want the pic.  I killed my bandwidth uploading these to the forum.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />

			Oh, thought I might add another image from a few minutes before on the same camera, with a very similar over-exposed region (but no purple glowing lens flare) to help you feel a bit more comfortable with the slight possibility that my psi-pet's flare was successfully caught in that first image.  It's at the top of the rock I'm standing on in this image, so it's not within the frame.  I've two more where it shows up, but they're poorer quality and not properly focused like these two.

I'm a persistantly delusional little bugger, aren't I?  Maybe the camera just doesn't like dark spots... and decides to add in purple?  *shrugs*  Still a fun lens flare!
<br />

<br />
At least I work good hours... *can't believe it's already 4:00am again!*

			There's a doughnut shaped flared construct in the media. Not strict &quot;PROOF&quot; but something to check out.
