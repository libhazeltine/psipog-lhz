			Hey Everyone how you all doing?
<br />

<br />
After becoming familiar with TK I have noticed that every object that I focus on and imagine &quot;Moving&quot; I can feel its energy, sometimes a tremendous amount of energy almost to the point of -If I could just push past this energy, I could move the object- . 
<br />

<br />
That's where I'm having some trouble.. For example, I can feel the energy of a toothpick and visualize it in my mind and I guess &quot;Feel the energy of the object&quot; moving, But cant physically make the toothpick move.
<br />

<br />
I'm wondering a few things..
<br />

<br />
1.) Why is it I feel the energy of objects around me, Is it because of my new experience with TK, or is it just normal?
<br />

<br />
2.) How can I push pass the energy or realease the energy built up inside me into the object, forcing it (and its energy) to move?
<br />

<br />

<br />
Thanks for your help
<br />

<br />

			DjWolf I feel your pain. I just had a new experience with pk and now I feel energy too, but not so much the energy of other objects, but my own energy, infact I feel full of the stuff, and must regular sessions to calm my body down.
<br />

<br />
Why does pk trigger all these strange changes (in regards to energy anyway)?

			I think its just awareness of whats actually around you. Since you mind figures &quot;Hey I can move this this way. Hey look over there I see some more of it.&quot; you know?

			Yeah I know the feeling. Im pretty sure this feeling is &quot;Becoming one&quot; with the object. Lol, and for a real rush, go into walmart and &quot;become one&quot; with everything around, then try to scan everybody there. (im kidding, dont).
<br />

<br />
I honestly think that the problem isn't using the object's energy to move itself, but convincing your sub-c that you can move that object. After you push past the &quot;reality&quot; barriar, your brain can figure out things on its own.

			This is something I tried (i ain't got much experience with PK, but it might help)
<br />

<br />
try moving the object with something hardly visible to you and &quot;examine the feeling&quot; of the object when it's moving
<br />

<br />
then look at the object (don't move it by physical means anymore)
<br />
and remember the feeling you had about it when it was moving in a certain direction
<br />
then somehow try applying that feeling to it... &quot;feel the feeling&quot; <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

<br />
Feeling energy of objects is your sensitivity to energy in the enviroment and everything around you. Some people are initially more sensitive than others. I'd wager that most everyone can faintly feel it, but until you practice with TK, you can distinctly recognize it. Before TK, I never really &quot;felt&quot; energy, but I could sense certain presences. It wasn't until I started practicing that I could sense energy everywhere often.
<br />

<br />
When using energy to move an object, remember not to be aggressive or commanding. You first problem is that you're trying to &quot;force&quot; it to move. Don't force or push. Ask and give. You're treating the object as if it's an obstacle, and the &quot;energy&quot; of the object is the goal. What you're forgetting, is that the object <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> the goal, because it itself already is energy. Focus on the toothpick, and build a connection. Imagine what it might feel like to have a skin of uneven and splintery wood. No arms, no legs. Things like that, just find a connection. I don't need to ask anymore, because I've trained my subconscious to &quot;ask&quot; the object for me; I simply request or tell me subconscious to move an object. When I forced or commanded the object, I lost concentration, and more importantly, the connection. So, don't visualize what you percieve as just it's energy; visualize everything. Let the object do it's own thing, but be there to guide it.

			Don't jump ahead of yourself. You're trying to move objects when you haven't mastered yourself. You have to work with yourself first, and practice, practice, practice. Work on the psiballs. If you make a psiball, then there is always going to be a <span style="font-style: italic">feeling</span>, there will be something there that you feel inside yourself and where you focus the psiball. If you don't feel anything, then you don't have a psiball. Throw out the preconcieved notions about what &quot;energy&quot; should feel like. Be receptive, and be patient. When you are successful, you will definately know because it is a very distinct feeling. Just try, and always practice.
