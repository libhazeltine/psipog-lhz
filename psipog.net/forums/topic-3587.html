			EDIT: This original post was made when I was half asleep and was pretty dull-witted, so I decided to change it into a more interesting topic. What are some of your experiences in which psionics has affected modern technology around you?
<br />

<br />
One of my pet peeves is my inability to hold a cell phone call. This would sound quite normal if one has an abscure network with a crappy Tracfone in there basement. But my Verizon LG 8100 (decent phone to say the least, on a carrier that clames to have the best network) will cut out repeatedly outside. And I live between 2 towers, each less than 2 miles away, at similar elevation. Not sure if it's psi related or just shit service, but no one else that uses that phone seems to have a problem.

			you can alter your reception if you really concentrate on it, maybe youre just using the wrong frequency on your phone that isnt compatible with your service provider ie 800/1900 950/900 look into that shit

			press menu
<br />

<br />
then &quot;0&quot;
<br />

<br />
Then enter all 0's for your security code (if not all 0's try 12345, 11111, etc.)
<br />

<br />
Your now in the programming menu.
<br />

<br />
I dont personally have this phone, but from here if you can get your hands on other providers carrier codes you can tailor your service to where you live.
<br />

<br />
Hope that helps.

AS for the psionic affects, Im no help there.

			I have a nasty habit of blanking video files and altering muxic playback on my comp w/o wanting to, so just having a heightened psi output does indeed have an effect on digital logic, as for cell phone reception you can change the frequency of your phone to closer match the freq. range of one tower and cut out the other. Also when two towers come close they often cancel each other out between the area, just a note. But you can use Psionics to aid instead of killing your calls you could use it to strenghten the pulses emitted from your phone like I did. You may be able to see the AC waves from your phone with Auric sight or feel the pulses coming from and entering your phone if you focus on them like I did, try to direct them clearer to one tower rather than the other. Just visualze it, Its always worth a shot or just ask for a better phone. Other than that ive no more advice XD

			I have similar but opposite experiances things that don't work just work for me I've always used cheap electronic devices but I seem to be able to make them work when they just won't work for other people.  Strangely enough I have even been able to somewhat stabilize dial-up internet when I concentrate on it mainly cause It had failed to download a file repeatedly when I would just wait for it to come where as when I concentrated I could get it to complete the download.
