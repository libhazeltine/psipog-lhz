			Hey guys sorry I havent posted in a long while (final year of high school jeez its hecktic) 
<br />

<br />
Any way the other day I ate a small meat pie in a real hurry and burned my tounge , it was realy stinging alot for a while, and during class I sat there and gathered psi in my abs then used a technique I've heard about for use in TK involving assigning colours to certain things. I pictured my whole body as a blue colour and my tounge as a red colour, then I moved the psi into my tounge and visualised my tounge turning blue as the psi moved through it. 
<br />

<br />
When I was done my tounge was tingling (but not painfully) and the pain and stinging was gone. 
<br />

<br />
I just wonder, was it actualy healing the burnt tissue or was it just making it numb?
<br />

<br />
This was my first attempt at Psi healing, what techniques does every one else use?

			I think if you were sending energy there it was probably healing it. I heal by putting psi through my hands into the place that needs to be healed and I just feel it becoming well. I imagine the psi green because I read that it's supposed to be that color (I don't know if it makes a difference). I'm really not sure <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> , but when I heal something it is healed, and not just numbed. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			When I use psi to heal I just picture the energy in the area that hurts. But I'm not sure if it actually heals.  When I use it though it eliminates whatever pain was there. I basically use it as a painkiller. I woudn't be surprised if you did heal your tongue, because the reduction of pain might indicate your body speeding up the healing process.

			a combination of pressure points on the body and psionic fire gathered in my hands and fingers relieves pain completely for up to 20 minutes. it works most of the time but i have had a few difficult cases. and it certainly doesn't work on people who don't want it. (can't even get close enough <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> just kidding)

			Hey, read about healing on psipog. Then, one day, I had a sore throat and wasnt feeling good. I decided to try it while I was watching TV. It kind of worked. I only tried to heal it for about 15 seconds and that helped the pain go away for about 30 seconds. I kept trying this for a little while until I got bored and stopped. It didnt really help the pain for a long time but it did for a little.

			I've been healing people psychically for about 2 years now, so I assume that qualifies me for a minute amount of expertise, but who knows anymore. I would say that you most likely didn't completely 'heal' your tongue that quickly, or else I would be running to you right now with all my cuts and bruises. Burned taste buds take a bit to regrow themselves, and regrowing them suddenly would take a good bit of microbiological knowledge. (Don't worry, I can't do it. I just know it's hard.)
<br />
            But you are well on your way to more positive healing experiences. You did relieve the pain, which I commend you for, as it is not an easy task, and I would urge you to continue practicing this skill. In my opinion, you most likely dulled the sensations of the nerve endings in the tongue with your energy, to a point where they stopped screaming at your brain of their demise. Psychic healing requires a vast knowledge of the human body to be done fully and correctly, so you might want to read up on biology and anatomy before any serious practices. But as far as relieving pain, I think that takes no more knowledge than the knowledge you used to manipulate the energy in the first place. I know it seems like I rambled on for a bit, but I'm very interested in psychic healing in general, and like to engage in any discussions of it that I can. Good luck in any future endeavors!

			I've only done minor problems, such as headaches or simple back pains or stuff. the technique I use is diffrent, I don't use my hands but instead I simiply imagine the region of pain or the area where the pain is coming from then I absorb it or pull it out, and I don't absorb it onto myself otherwise I would be in pain.
