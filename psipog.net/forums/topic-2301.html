			hellooooooo again, hehehehehehe
<br />

<br />
well let me tell you. I still cant move psiwheel, and the day before yesterday i went to train with the psiwheel and it didnt move, and i changed of object. I used a piece of foil, and after some minutes i balanced it, i was using my hands, and when i take out my hand close it, it balanced the same way, it was so cool
<br />

<br />
so i question: why i cant spin psiwheel anymore and i could balance the piece of paper????

uh.....um........what? Can you explain better please? You are talking about you can't spin the psi wheel, and on the other hand you're saying you can balance a foil??? This doesn't make any sense. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			My advice, is to not try and force a result.  You may want to spin the psi wheel, but let the psi wheel spin, suggest it to spin, don't order it around.  But then there are times where you are very determined and confident to spin it, thats okay too, as long as it isn't &quot;I will force the psi wheel to spin&quot; other than &quot;I will try hard to get a result&quot;, keeping in mind to not to force it. It's weird to explain when i re-read this.. Try hard to make it spin, but don't force it, and let it spin.  There are times where I have spun it one day, and the other day I haven't.  The best breakthrough is when I was tying to make it spin, then i looked down at the floor, and it spun..
<br />
This works for me, and this is how I think it works based on what i've gathered: the concious gets in the way of the sub-c when it tries too hard, so we have to calm the concious as much as possible, and then the sub-c can pass through and spin it much easier.

hehehehehe i cant spin the psiwheel anymore, but when i went to try with a piece of foil, i moved it. The hand is: using or not using the hand is the same. Dont worry about the hand.....but what i anna know is: why i couldnt spin psiwheel and i could move a piec of foil...

			If you believe the magnet theory of psionics, it might be easier to move metal due to magnetic effect or something. But I'm new here, so don't trust me on that.

			Not on tinfoil, that is not affected by magnets.
<br />
Good job Carrie, sometimes my tinfoil falls to one side and I can balance it again, so I know what you mean.
<br />
Maybe the psiwheel will move again someday, mine doesn't want to move either only tinfoil and I just got a toothpick to shake Yay <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			hi all.
<br />

<br />
congratulation carrie_white about moving the foil psi wheel <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
it is easy to spin foil psi wheel but paper psi wheel is little harder , i think because foil is lighter then paper .
<br />

<br />
i think if you make bigger psi wheel of foil you will hardly move it or you might dont move it because it is bigger and heavier then the small one.
<br />

<br />
for me i can shake and spin paper psi wheel slowly 6 cm X 6 cm but i can shake paper psi wheel 7 X 7 and harldy make it move little to left or right.
<br />

<br />
 <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> wait my 6 X 6 and 7 X 7 psi wheels are defrance in its paper kind dammit i need to change its kind then to see the true resalts. <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />  7 X 7 its kind of paper is little heavier &lt;.&lt; .
