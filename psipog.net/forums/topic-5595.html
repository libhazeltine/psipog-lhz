			I meet a girl about 2 years ago. She lied and told me she had a sister. Ive talked to &quot;both of them&quot; one claimed to be able to do telekensis on a LARGE scale and the other was a telepath. After awhile I caught on. We became friends and she told me about her friend that used to be her bf. They decided to take a year off from being a couple. She said she missed him and wanted to be bf and gf again. I told her to tell him how she felt. After that he kissed her and they became a couple again. She thanked me a hundered thousand times. After that I forgot about her. Yesterday i remembered and became overcome with depression. Like something happened. Do you think this was empathy
<br />

<br />
A little confusing isnt it, lol

			Did you feel any attraction to her at some point?  Maybe that feeling lasted in your mind, but on a sub-c level.  When you remembered her, you became depressed because &quot;she was the one that got away.&quot;  
<br />

<br />
I have a gf, but sometimes I remember some girls I used to know, and feel a little sad that I didn't &quot;catch&quot; them.  Then I remember how long I have been with my girlfriend, how we are engaged, and how much I love her.  The sad feeling goes away immediatly.

			Hmm....when you felt this depression, was it directly linked to her, or did it just come about after you remembered her?  Like, did you <span style="font-style: italic">feel</span> that the depression was linked with her?  If so, I guess that could be empathetic...But wouldn't you need to be linked with her to feel what she is feeling?

			Then it is very possible what you are feeling is her depression.  If you can, try to get a hold of her somehow...I have the feeling her bf broke up with her.
