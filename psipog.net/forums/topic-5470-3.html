Extra Strength Aspirin won't make your memory fuzzy, certainly not at the low doses he takes them at but nice idea.  It might wreck a little havoc on his digestive system, but he's not walking around in a drugged haze.  And yes, Aspirin is all he takes (my dad's a tough guy lol).

			I'm curious about the 'folding space' technique. Do you see where you're going to end up? Like, let's say I wanted to walk down an alley, but I ended up entering a different one because of the technique. Would I see the other alley before I entered it or after?
<br />

<br />
Also, I'd like to know if, for anyone who can control it, how exactly you bend space.

Regardless, serious knee surgery has major implications in this situation.  You cannot present this instance as proof and expect critical thinkers to buy into it.  There are many other explanations, all with a higher degree of believability, other than teleportation.

			iv had concious experiences with this. i dont like the word teleportation tho, it just sounds so....fake...
<br />

<br />
instantaneous movement, maybe.
<br />

<br />
i seperately teleported a pin, and 2 minutes afterwards, the wheel itself.
<br />

<br />
om doing shit loads of research into this, ill post up all the info when its completed. 
<br />

<br />
either way, from what iv found out, its only possible to do it when there is a mss of energy surrounding. i couldnt cnjure anywhere near the amount that was &quot;in the air&quot; at the time. when i get a particular feeling, when the conditions are right, nearly anything happens if i think about it hard enough :S (its so weird, iv tried figuring out logical explanations but have found nnone)

It's truly impossible. Don't even think about trying. It could do a great deal of damage to you.

You can probably teleport small objects, but for the amount of energy it would take to telepost yourself, you could kill yourself in trying.

			If my theory on the overlappingness of the mental, physical, and temporal is correct than teleporting would be quite easy. Well, sorta. You would have to bring your body completely into the mental and then reenter it at a different location. Think of the universe as just a big mess of mental things, physical, and temporal so you would have to sorta drag your body out of the physical. This is confusing me but by my theory teleportation is totally possible.

I don't think it would matter because it would happen in less than a second. If the person is rebuilt the exact same way as before, it shouldn't effect the person's condition. (though I do have a theory that being dismantled and rebuilt will hurt like *BEEP*)

I find it interesting that you dismiss something before anyone even proposes a mechanism for it.

I'm sure if you had told someone in the 1700s that it was possible to propel a 2 ton vehicle 30 miles in 5 minutes using only a pitcher of foul-smelling black liquid, he would laugh in your face.

Glad you said that. How did Egyptians and Mayans build pyramids with 2-3 ton blocks of stone with no cranes and manage to build the structures so precisely?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> I'm not saying they used teleportation. I'm saying that there things that are real and cannot be explained logically as of now. Like Teleportation.
