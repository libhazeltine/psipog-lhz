			I'm not sure how long I've had the ability to create psi-balls.
<br />

<br />
I am, however, sure that I've never, ever visualized anything while doing so. I simply.. focus, I guess. It's hard to explain, but looking at other people's experiences, what I sense is truly a psi-ball. 
<br />

<br />
I haven't taken my abilities too serious before, but seeing this website, I think I should.

			Possible first psi ball.  Not sure.  I could kind of feel a magnetic pushing of my hands away.  I'm not sure if it's a psi ball because if you put your hands strait out a few inches apart from each other for a minet or two, I get the same effect.

			I was making a ball and on the bit of getting energy from tan tien to chest to arms to handsi usally always feel a tingling going through my body to hands. anyway
<br />
IS this a ki/psi/chi/prana/energy ball
<br />
tingling (could be from blood in hands)
<br />
hands getting pushed away?
<br />
when i was gathering energy from tan tien each time i did this my hands where getting pushed away?
<br />

<br />
if so how can i improve and i don't imagine it i just feel it.... i am going to try imagining it.
<br />
My biggest question is isit blood flow that is causingthe tingling.
<br />

<br />
Now how do i chuck it (if i made it)?

			Over summer vacation in MI, I tried to make a psiball and I think it worked.
<br />

<br />
I went into this &quot;hallow&quot; kinda feeling, and my fingers started to pull inwards, and I kept hearing this monotone sound that the psiball eminated.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, it was very weird and I haven't been able to make one since, so yeah...

			Ok...so in that blender that is my mind, I wanted to play with trancing and Psi ball making simultaneously....so I did.
<br />

<br />
The result was interesting.
<br />
Previously, I've only been able to make little balls of heat. I'm never quite sure if that's my body or a psi ball....
<br />

<br />
I tried listening to trance music and following <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html159" target="_blank" class="postlink">this guide</a>. The result, I believe, was a very cold psiball. I played around with it for awhile, and at one point, noticed...not quite tingling...more like a coldsweat thing. Only without the accual sweat. 
<br />
The irony is...my fingers were cold-ish before I started. However, now they're even colder, so I would think I accualy made something.
<br />

<br />
Am I right; did I have a psi ball?

			I have made psiballs i think. One time I made one and threw it at my face and I felt a wave of hot air hit my face. Then i did it to my sister and she felt the same thing. Both psiballs made my hands feel very warm. Were these really psiballs?

			hello i started this whole thing about 3 or 4 days ago and i tried to get psi into my abdomen but i really cant imagine how to visualize it ... no way because i cant keep may head looking down to my abdomen and be relaxed the same time thats weird. so i started yesterday to make psiballs without collecting psi in my abdomen cause i cant imagine or visualize this...
<br />
btw i do with one hand only and i concentrate only on my hand and not on the abdomen xD, so i concentrate on my hand and fell after some time a warmth... and i think i can slightly visualize the heat but only when i stare at the hand. it looks like heatwaves on a road... but not soo strong ^^
<br />

<br />
my question is now: 1. is that what u call &quot;psiball&quot; ?
<br />
2. can i make a psiball without collecting psi in my abdomen first or wont it work?
<br />

<br />
p.s. i also try to make my psiwheel spin but i dont succeed atm  then i heard this meditation music and speech on mp3 and my barefeet on the floor on my room got hotter and hotter it was incredibly hot i thought they were in flames that was scary!  but i didnt spin the psiwhell <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			Well, I must say that I tried making a psiball using some of the techniques on this site.  When I gathered my energy or whatever I felt a heavy, icy mass in my solar plexus!  I am in a moderately warm environment, so this could not have been merely the chills.
<br />

<br />
As I tried to move the mass to my hands using my mind I felt the mass split in two and travel to opposite sides of my ribcage.  For a couple of moments, I thought it might of gotten stuck, but then my hands began to unconciously be pulled together.  I wasn't sure what to do with my new psi ball, so I envisioned throwing it against the wall and dissapating.  When I did that, the icy feeling and the pulling feeling seemed to for the most part disappear.
<br />

<br />
Now, please tell me, did I make a psiball, or did I BS myself?

			Well im new here, posted already a Hello thread. 
<br />
I discovered this site and about 4 hours later I went to bed. I read the article about the Psi and tried it myself. I consentrated for about 1 minute in my ab then another minute of the path it travels to my fingers. Always when I meditate in this state I feel the base muscle of my finger twitching.
<br />
It feels like when you twist a vein (like between thumb and fingers).
<br />

<br />
Then it feels like im holding two magnest facing + and + or - and - basicly.
<br />
I was like holy sh*t and broke the ball. I did this a few more times with eyes open and eyes closed and succeeded every time. It seems stronger with eyes closed.
<br />

<br />
From reading these posts I supose it really was a Psiball but doing it in so short time and for the first time I just cant be sure about it. Well tonight I will be trying the constructs and shelling.
<br />

<br />
I have strong believe in this, my past involved a bit of meditation and ti chi so I guess that helped. 
<br />

<br />
Also a tip to others maybe, I imagined the Psi in my faverite color, which is green. I dont know if that affects anything, but it might give you a warm feeling cause that is the color you feel confortable with.
