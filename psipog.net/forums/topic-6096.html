Two of my Teachers are acting weird. Like the girl one was like &quot;I am going to get nasty&quot; and she was like acting like she was going to take off in front of this guy teachre. And they have been doing a lot of flirting. So could you scan me and tell me if they are having an afair. (No they arent married)
