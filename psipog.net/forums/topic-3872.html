			This happened last Thursday.  I was getting the jug of water from the fridge, and I set it down on my island counter in the kitchen.  Then as I turn around to get a cup *BAMM* it hits the floor.  It must have thought it needed to follow me, lol.  Anyways, I like to keep people informed, hope you enjoyed my story!

(edit) Sorry if that's an annoying question, it was just the most obvious one.

			Actually I know for a fact I didn't...It was about, oh, 6in. to 1ft in from the edge.  I was kinda obsessed with getting a cup, so i didn't hear it slide, but I heard it hit the ground, and then i did a power rangers delayed reaction! lmao.  But seriously, there was no one else around, and no wind strong enough to push a gallon of water off the countertop.

			Something like that happened to me too.  I was at the computer taking turns  turning the psi wheel and trying to roll a pencil when I took a snack break.  I was two rooms away when both my keyboard and ashtray hit the floor.
<br />

<br />
There were no cats around, and the keyboard was safe on the desk and the ashtray was on the arm of my chair.  
<br />

<br />
I have little control of tk.  Yesterday after practicing on the psi wheel I was leaving the room when my door opened a couple of inches for me.  Something else I've been trying to do with tk but I wasn't thinking about tking the door open.  It just did.

			For a few months now (ever since I got my room painted, I think) very often when I get up from my desk to leave the room (when my door's closed) it snaps open slightly.  It doesn't happen when I try to open it, and I don't think it's vibrations in the floor because I can stand right infront of it and stamp on the ground, and it doesn't budge.  This has been happening from before I first did PK.  Not sure if it's Geisting.

Try doing it without going near it. I havn't heard of geisting that happens that frequently during the same action. Kind of like lightining; that it doesn't strike in the same place twice.
