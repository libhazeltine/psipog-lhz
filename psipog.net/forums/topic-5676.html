			I've heard of folks who purposely put on cold, black auras. Me, I want a nice warm, golden or orange (Since orange is a color I favor) aura. I'm told that though meditation I can achieve this, but Im not sure how.
<br />
I'd like to be able to determine my current aura color, and change it to one that is orange or golden, and gives a warm comforting feeling to those I care about when they are near me.
<br />
Also such an aura, I believe, would help ward off dark things that might harm me or catch me unaware.

			I think i can see aura's but i'm not positive. I dont know how they would &quot;put on&quot; an aura because i read that aura's are determined by how you feel so to have that color aura you would need to meditate to force your emotions to what ever matches that color.

			I'm sure there is, but since I am not that good at RVing, I can't quite do that.  Anyways, basically, isn't your aura a reflection on your mood? So during meditation, wouldn't you just change your emotional state, and your aura will change with it? 
<br />

<br />
BTW, I can see auras if I focus on any object, except for humans.  O well, I'll keep practicing, so then I can help you further on this subject!

			Theoretically speaking someone could remote veiw your aura but i dont know how it would be done. I think it would be easier to learn how to see auras and look at yours through a mirror.

			johnny, don't be a douche. Have you not heard of Aura Imaging Device? It's a certified, patented piece of equipment that can infact scan and display your aura in REALTIME.
<br />
That'd be like me saying there's no such thing as gasoline because I use a diesel vehicle. Or better yet... &quot;The reason you can't see oxygen is because there's no such thing!&quot;

			There are a lot of books that teach you how to see auras. One such book is &quot;You Are Psychic!&quot; by Pete A. Sanders Jr. (I think that is his name, it can be found in the book thread in General Discussion, it's a sticky)
<br />
There is also a website that has a very good aura training excercise but this community especially does not trust them and I also agree, but as I said they do have a good aura excercise. If you want to know of it, just PM me.

			um, well I couldn't contain all my theories about auras, ever, in here.  Way to much stuff.  Anyways, it all depends on what part of the arua your looking at.  Most people see a mesh of the first three layers.  If you want to change that just do as said above.  But look on your intention of doing so.
<br />

<br />
You want to give off a warm, happy feeling to others.  Instead of trying to change your aura, change your self!  Be compassionate, smile to everyone, say thank you for any kind of help at all, and mean it!  If you want to give off a good vibe, create the vibe.  Meditation is super helpful.  Helps you put things in perspective and keep yourself in check.
<br />

<br />
Check out &quot;hands of light&quot; sorry dont know the auther's name, but it's a good book, fairly religious, but you can just skip over it.  It's alot to take in, the beginning sounds horribly fluffy, but if you dont want to learn about that crap she's talking about just go the exersises, they work.  Worked for me sorta.  I can see my psiballs, and I can sorta see auras(badly).
<br />

<br />
good luck
