			k, today i was sitting browsing the net on my wireless internet when an idea occured to me that is either the dumbest thing to ever cross my mind, or the most brilliant, yet impossible for me to do thing.
<br />

<br />
ok, i was thinking, along the lines of 'you know, all this stuff on the screen is flying through the air, entering the computer and popping up on screen...'
<br />

<br />
so i got to thinking, and thought, if the information is floating around out there, and you can access it from a computer when near a WIFI source. would it be possible for a psion to make a construct to work similarly to the computer's internal router?
<br />

<br />
at any rate, if it is remotelly possible i know that i am not skilled enough to pull it off. but if it could be done, it could essentially mean after some study, being cappable of accessing the internet in your head (when near WIFI)
<br />

<br />
does anybody have any thoughts or ideas on if this could or could not work? or might want to experiment? 
<br />

<br />
i figured it'd best fit this subforum. i dont know if it'll work or not, but if it works, that'd be very useful.

			Well since the information is electrical and made of energy i suppose it would be &quot;theoretically&quot; possible. All the construct would need to know how to do would be to break down the information that it's receiving...

			LOL, yeah I can only imagine the emotional scars that letting the whole of the internet into your brain would cause.  I've gotten around on the internet, as I'm sure many others here have as well. (might as well admit it, youd be lying otherwise  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> ) Thers a lot of stuff you dont wanna see, but cant really avoid

technically, since virus's are all just data, your brain would be essentially uneffected by it i'd assume. a virus's method of destroying a computer would be useless againced the human mind anyway, wrong programming, a virus attacks files and directory paths, and the brain uses different methods than windows/mycomputer/settings/importantfiles...

			The internet does not flow everywhere at once.You type in a web adress which goes to your nic (network interface card) git encoded into a format the internet can understand tcp\ip. All this is put in a packet with the source address(your ip address) , and a destiantion adDress ( where its going) then it all goes throught routers switches hubs  and firewalls till it gits to it destination. All that info is packeted back to yo. ir would be a mind boggling process to undertake.NOT TO MENTION ITS ALL IN BINARY!!!!

			Yes, PsiGuy, it WOULD be a daunting task to undertake, but if one was REALLY good at both Psi and programming, it could probably be pulled off.

Now the question is, is it really worth all that effort?
