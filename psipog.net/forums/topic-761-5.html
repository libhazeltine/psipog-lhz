			The shape is what you want, right? I mean, you could have a fish.. but would you have to make psiwater? <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> I guess it would look like whatever you wanted, but presumably you'd have to be pretty clear if you just made a creature out of the blue, because your subconscious would have no related memories. So in theory, would it be better to create a replica of an animal that already exists, such as a cat or dog?

			Or you could make up a creature, and relate it to different aspects of different animals.
<br />

<br />
For example, let's say you wanted to make X made up animal. You could relate (in your mind) to a bird's ability to fly, to enable it to fly, for example.

			If anyones played the game Black and White, it's really starting to feel like that about now. I want to make a pet cow that runs around and collect psi wheat, psi people, and fights other small psi pets for competition!

I'm getting carried away with this =.=

			Heh, then you could make, like, little ghosts to chase it about <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> I'm so mean  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> but seriously, that sounds simple, but unless you could &quot;see&quot; it, because you can't properly feel the boundaries then you wouldn't know if you had shaped it successfully or kept it just as a technical psiball... ? I could tell it had wings and stuff because I could feel warmth at the extremities, but to be honest my flaw was rushing and not putting in even enough energy to get a proper &quot;push&quot; of the magnetic feel... I'll have to try again, I miss it XD

			Vladimir, that makes sense, I think that would work just as well probably, your only problem would be making something that didn't relate to an already existing animal.. but, can that even be done, or is it out of the limits of our own imaginations?

			When i made my shield, i started verbally talking to it.. something like this
<br />
&quot;shield, you will protect me, you are the only shield i will create. Shield, you can change into anything i desire. If you me my shield, i will be your sword.  Let's work together to make great things in life. Change into something hard please, i want to be protected from the others. If you die, I will resurrect you, and only you.&quot; Now, i said shields why? well, this could probably relate to having a pet. Talk to it, give it personality, give it dynamic qualities XD.

			Thats deep man <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> your sheild probably fell in love with you <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> thats basically what I did, only I imagined the outside of my psipet to be translucent, and there was a blue circle at its brain, and a red one at its heart. To feed it more psi, I visualised a link forming through me to its red circle and fed it more psi, but to give it new commands or programming I linked to the blue circle and &quot;fed&quot; it the conversation, like, telling it down a telephone line, visualising it &quot;storing&quot; the information in files or what have you in the blue circle so that it would have it... I don't think I severed the link properly the very last time, which could explain the PK, if it was in fact the psipet doing it...

			I was, but I became too attatched to my &quot;guineapig&quot; psipet...

I meant that in a good way. I have a couple of neat ideas myself, once the creature is complete, we shall write a small &quot;article&quot; about it.
