I wasn't doing good, so I quit.  Maybe I'll start up again, I don't know.
<br />

<br />
Instead of asking why &quot;someone else&quot; hasn't done something, why not ask yourself, &quot;why don't I do something?&quot;.  Give it a try.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Erm... I don't mean to be obstinate, but this <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> the skeptic forum. The lottery is set up on a system of statistical balance; basically, you get just enough money to keep you playing, but they still come out on top - fairly common knowledge. If one were to alter the odds, whether through precognition or PK, even by only a small amount, you could have a substantial form of income (even if you never won the jackpot). 
<br />

<br />
I have some small success with micro-PK, but not any at all when it comes to precognition, so I can't test this myself. However, it seems that <span style="font-style: italic">something</span> should come of a psion trying to play the lottery...?
<br />

<br />
So, the question remains: Why does no one here have at least <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> form of supplementary income from our skills?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
The lottery isn't a good try, is it? It's about one chance in fifty millions, approximately. It would require extreme precognition (which may not be reliable, since a slight change in the impulse in the hand that rolls the box with balls would change a number and destroy the results)... Or extreme micro-PK. Micro PK may help you with heads and tails, but, one in fifty millions? Impossible: it's like finding the needle in the haystack. You'll find it by chance, not by looking, even using touch, sight and the common, proven physical senses, without needing to use any supernatural stuff. Winning lottery with psi is just that: finding the needle in the haystack. 
<br />

<br />
However, casinos are another thing. If I could use that stuff, I'd go all for the roulette, the dice table, or use telepathy to play cards. That's why the Randi challenge looks so funny to me. If I could move a little ball like a roulette one, the million dollar Randi supposedly offers would be pocket money. Yes, in time I would get fired from all casinos, but I bet I could get between 3 and 5 million dollars in the meanwhile.
<br />

<br />
So, guys, if you have gotten to something with PK, I'd advise you to do a fast trip to Las Vegas and try dices and roulette. If you do telepathy, try cards: either blackjack or poker. Empathy could also be extremely useful at poker.
<br />

<br />
Cheating? No way! Psi powers aren't proven, right? Technically, thanks to Randi, they do NOT exist. If they don't exist, you can't be charged with anything you do with them (as long as you keep your mouth shut). Maybe I'm sounding pretty dishonest here... Not that I'd make an empire of that. But it'd be great to pay off the mortgage ten years sooner.
<br />

<br />
Honestly, I still don't know if all this works or not (see my signature), but if I could make it work, I swear the last thing I would do is let anyone else know about it. Man, I hate people smoking at hospitals and schools. If I could take their cigarretes from their mouths! (Promise I'd only do that if they smoke where it's forbidden, like in hospitals). Not to mention  all the possibilites that would allow you to get money from your powers. In my country, you can get high paid jobs with an state exam. If I could use telepathy, I'd just pass the exam for the highest-paying job with help from someone else. But, of course, no one could get to know about it (not that it mattered: in my country I could scream I passed with telepathy and they would just ignore me and give the job).
<br />

<br />
So, you see... I don't think that psi powers can't give money. I just think that, if I could get money from them, I'd make sure that no one else knows. And I don't expect less from the guys here. If Peebrain went to one casino in one part of the country each weekend, and won, say 10.000, (not to call the attention) do you think he'd remotely tell? I wouldn't. In fact, subtlety is the most appealing part of psionics. I don't know if it's true or not yet... But it is damn worth trying.
<br />

<br />
NOTE: Peebrain, sorry for putting you as an example of dishonest use of Psi. I know everyone here is against unethical use, such as using telepathy without permission. I only put you as an example. Sorry if this was offensive to anyone at psipog. In a certain theory, your Psi powers are the higher the higher your conscience is, and as a result, the most powerful psions wouldn't ever cheat, rob, gamble... or want vast quantities of money. So I suppose it rarely happens. But for the newbies, what a pretty dream it is <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Using psionic abilities in a casino is might hard.  The whole setup of a casino is geared toward making  a person lose their concentration and better judgment.  Why do you think alcoholic drinks are free?  Why is it so bright, with many flashing lights?  Why does everything electronic in a casino make a loud noise ?  Why do you they make you use chips that represent money when it would be just as easy to actually use money?
<br />

<br />
It's all engineered to making you lose focus, which in turn makes you lose money.  Now think about the first skill involved in using a psychic ability: the ability to maintain your focus, usually on a solitary task.  It's hard to focus on the movement of the roulette wheel when the man on your right is brushing against you, the man on your left is blowing smoke in your face, the couple across from you cheer excitedly, the slot machines behind you ring and buzz randomly or in unison with the bazillion watts of flashing lights strategically located throughout the joint.
<br />

<br />
I've been to more than a few casinos, and trust me, you need to be a fucking monk to maintain focus in one of those establishments.  The poker room is a different story, however.  Poker rooms are usually separated from the general casino area.  Here is where abilities like telepathy and precognition can come into play.  But why bother?  There are plenty of other methods for estimating what cards your opponent is holding outside of telepathy or empathy that don't require nearly as much mental focus and fortitude.  And if you have a solid playing and betting strategy, then you don't really need to use precognition or micro-pk to affect the cards.  This is one of those many situations where psionics simply isn't pragmatic.
<br />

<br />
If you want to use psychic ability for financial gain, do something like forecast stock market trends and start up an account with Etrade or a similar online service.  You can even try to propel yourself into a specialized trade where some of these abilities may come in handy, such as a salesperson who has a commission-based salary.  Again though, why bother when you can create a stock portfolio based on the sound advice of a market analyst, or leave salesperson jobs to individuals who have a greater perceptive abilities for body language?
<br />

<br />
Personally, I feel that the problem with the whole &quot;psychics should be rich&quot; concept is that anything that can be perceived as a psychic ability is pretty much in line with any other talent that is not viewed as being paranormal.  Someone who has an innate telepathic ability and uses it to develop a good rapport with patients as a psychotherapist is pretty much tantamount to a person who has the innate ability to quickly produce creative business solutions as a freelance consultant.
<br />

<br />
So in summary, there are two incorrect assumptions, I feel, with the &quot;all psychics should be rich&quot; idea:
<br />

<br />
1) The concepts that some people hold and share about psychic abilities are COMPLETELY overblown, and,
<br />
2) Psychics with innate or trained talents do not use their abilities to amass great fortunes, but use them like a normal person would use any other innate or acquired skill in the job market: to get a steady paycheck and a secure financial future.

You must be right. I've never been to a casino, so I didn't know. And... I had never stop to think about the chips... they are made to make you feel like you're not playing with real money... Because you wouldn't risk your monthly salary in a game if it felt real. Of course, you must be right. Sorry, I haven't been able to produce PK nor ever gone to a Casino, so I didn't know. Thanks for answering.

Maybe I've seen too many movies and thought things would be easier once you master the power. I suppose I don't really grasp how difficult things are... Peebrain's been to it during 7 years, so I suppose that you can't control casino machines in two months.

			I'd just like to add something interesting....Ever thought about cheating online poker...It makes sense...The dealing of the cards is based soley on a random number generator...Many of us have tried influencing these generators in other online tests and such...why should the poker be any different...micro PK...Now I understand you would have to be very skilled to do this but in theory it should be very possible...Obviously don't think of the random numbers and make it complicated..think of the cards and your mind should do the rest.....correct???
