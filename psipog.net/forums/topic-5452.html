			alot of people say she has a string attached to her leg *hence is why the objects only move toward the edge of the table* 
<br />

<br />

<br />
But the thing is, if you research her and that exact video, she was under strict supervision by Scientist and searched for any type of metal/magnets/or stringers up and down her body before performing the video that i had posted....

Great video if you ask me <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			A note to the weight loss thing.. Each and every time I do ANYthing with PK, TP, whathaveya I get quite hungry directly afterwards. I guess Psionics might burn carbs. Then again I have a naturally &quot;high as all sin&quot; metabolism anyway, soo I dont know.

			That's odd.  I've always had an insanely high metabolism too.  I used to eat a whole friggin box of crackers a day when I was younger.  But I have never been even close to being over average.

			lol its pretty cool, being in a state of anger, no matter what type, will burn more carbs and stuff than normal simply because, well youve got adreneline which will raise your metabolism and stuff, but 10 lbs! thats a huge amount of wieght lost in a simple session. but still if you need to lose wieght fast, do it the controlled anger way!
<br />

<br />
also i too have an insane metabolism(i can eat 10 hotdogs in 5 minutes and half an hour later eat a full dinner) and feel very hungry, and weak, after doing any psionics.

			I don't think I'm convinced that she lost 10 lbs JUST because she was speeding up your metabolism. I think there is probably another too since we don't really know <span style="font-style: italic">how</span> PK effects our bodies. Maybe there is a combination of raised metabolism and something else, but I don't think it's just the raised metabolism.

Me too.....
<br />

<br />
Whenever I practice my Energy Manip, I'm ALWAYS hungry afterwards.   Even if I've just eaten dinner.
<br />

<br />

<br />
A bit more on-topic, I'm reluctant to believe this, simply because on principal I don't trust anyone who's become famous(or pseudo-famous) because of what they do.    That, and the fact that I'm not entirely sure of the authenticity(sp?) of the video.
