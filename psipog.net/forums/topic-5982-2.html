For you goes the same. One year or three years doesnt make much difference. Even if you are turning 18 in two weeks, you should not worry about your future. My future changes everyday. 4 months ago I had the feeling that this month would be the beginning of multiple new things for me, and I got exactly what I expected. If people asked me one month ago: What will you do now? I said: &quot;I don't know yet, but I will see, something will come.&quot; And something did come. Just have a little faith in your own path I would say. Let the future unfold itself to you in the here and Now. Don't worry about the future when it has not yet arrived. You can make plans, but let them go afterwards and return to the Now.

I hope your right. I'll go with that at least until I get there. I mean I did get a job eventually. It just turned out that all the applications I sent out were pointless because a crappy, low paying job with few co-workers was awaiting me all this time <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. From here I intend to get a better job. So now that I think about it you've probably got the right philosophy there. Thanks MA.
<br />

P.S.  I still haven't sent you that HUGE PM I promised you months ago. From the looks of it it will be a while before I get that kind of time, lol.

			You're lucky.  You could probably go awhile without eating.  When you're a twig like me you're very dependant on food.  Heh.

I had a brother who joined the navy, he work as a nuclear enigneer. It was funny because my brother couldnt take small spaces. One day he said &quot;I'm going to kill someone&quot; out of anger. I guess you can't trust someone who is works with the engine to be crazy. They toke him off and gave him some out and drugs. Hes happy right now with his work on shore but hes trying to get out of the navy right now.

I have a brother in the army who is happy.....but hes all religionish now and always perech to me.
