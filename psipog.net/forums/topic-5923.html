			So humans have been around for a pretty damn long time now. Homosapians havn't been around THAT long per-say but don't you think that with the thousands of years that we have we wouldnt have delved deeper into this energy manipulation thing? Before that, Cro-Magnum Man was around and he wasnt that diffrent from us either so it is possible he could have had the same potential as we do today.
<br />

<br />
The only other explination is that recently out minds have been boosted up a bit? Sure it sounds all X-Men[y] but its true. Since only for the last couple thousand years have we been making new discoveries on a regular basis and acualy using modern day common sence its a given that eventualy out brains would advance but most of use would have imagined it would have happened in time. Doesnt evolution take millions of years? Could it be that are brains are working so hard recently it just sped up evolution just so it could catch up?
<br />

<br />
Some might say that it has been around for a long time now and thats how all these folk lore of witches and magical powers and out facination in magic and sci-fi arose but if it is part of our society why arn't people more open to it? I asked myself that question but then i got to thinking about it. Are people realy that close minded about this stuff? All the movies seem to hint twards it but those movies themselves make millions of dollars from people who are acualy interested in it. Not to mention the people who acualy made the movie and stared in it.
<br />

<br />
I'm sorry i feel like i'm babbling but looking back on all we've acomplished you have to wonder how far can you realy go? Eventualy we're going to destroy ourselves with our contant need to solve these problems that didnt realy need solving to begin with. In the near future can you realy see telekinesis as a everyday thing? In a couple hundred years can you see your great great grandchildren being teleported to school or running through all the houses and walls in there way just to get to school before the first bell rings?

			Nah, I think when we decided that God gave us the ability to think or as some other may just not believe in religion at all, we just spread around and started to learn.

Most psionic happenings been around for a long time, just some are harder to believe as religion is involved.

			I think he's trying to say that there's an increase in the amount of psions. I agree. I'm also trying to become psychic, and many psychics, including Cynthia Browne, concur that lately there have been a rash of outbreaks of the psion and psychic beings.
<br />

<br />
My reason: we learned today in English class that in the past census (so about 1990 to 2001), Americans have left the Protestant and Catholic church to become &quot;non-denominational&quot;. Why is that my reason? I think that people are realizing what potential they have, and that humans are naturally deceiving. They are going away from the &quot;written faiths&quot; to the &quot;mental faith&quot;. They stop believing in things that are made by humans, and therefore, achieve a higher state-of-mind. I myself am one of the above (bah, I think this is getting biased by this point, but it's an opinion).
<br />

<br />
Whatever anyone else wants to ask me or debate (not argue) with me, feel free to. I'm in a really philisophical state right now. I watched my good friend dislocate his knee right in front of me. It was....quite disturbing.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: I just re-read what you said, and you talked about the advance in speed of technology developments lately. The only other thing I can think to cause that is the population. So many minds, so many imaginations, so many possibilities.

Indeed humans have gain so much over its era, but even if you are opened minded to what we have gain. You should also be opened minded to what we have failed...and lied about. Or in some cases...just misunderstond which turns out like something else. So there are 3 opinions....how many do you usually see?

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Evolution and devolution</span></span>
<br />

<br />
One of the most common misunderstandings of evolution is that one species can be &quot;more highly evolved&quot; than another, that evolution is necessarily progressive and/or leads to greater &quot;complexity&quot;, or that its converse is &quot;devolution&quot;.[53] Evolution provides no assurance that later generations are more intelligent or complex than earlier generations. The claim that evolution results in progress is not part of modern evolutionary theory; it derives from earlier belief systems which were held around the time Darwin devised his theory of evolution.
<br />

<br />
In many cases evolution does involve &quot;progression&quot; towards more complexity, since the earliest lifeforms were extremely simple compared to many of the species existing today, and there was nowhere to go but up. However, there is no guarantee that any particular organism existing today will become more intelligent, more complex, bigger, or stronger in the future. In fact, natural selection will only favor this kind of &quot;progression&quot; if it increases chance of survival, i.e. the ability to live long enough to raise offspring to sexual maturity. The same mechanism can actually favor lower intelligence, lower complexity, and so on if those traits become a selective advantage in the organism's environment. One way of understanding the apparent &quot;progression&quot; of lifeforms over time is to remember that the earliest life began as maximally simple forms. Evolution caused life to become more complex, since becoming simpler wasn't advantageous. Once individual lineages have attained sufficient complexity, however, simplifications (specialization) are as likely as increased complexity. This can be seen in many parasite species, for example, which have evolved simpler forms from more complex ancestors.[54]

			There are several theories about human evolution... I personally hold that the earth is no more than 10,000 years old (give or take a millenia or two), and that, before a worldwide catastrophic flood, there was a canopy of ice above the earth that held in large amounts of oxygen (there is scientific evidence for this, I'm not just some wacky religious freak that has no evidence for what he says). This oxygen allowed for every creature to access its full potential... Oxygen levels have decreased since then. It's my opinion that we are actually <span style="font-weight: bold">de</span>-evolving, although we will never turn into another species; we are just losing more and more of our natural abilities.
<br />
I think that the recent revival of psionics is due more to a spike of interest in the phenomena rather than a spike in the actual abilities, and that spike of interest could be related to the discoveries that are being made about quantum physics and human psychology.
<br />

That's my two bits. Don't flame me.
