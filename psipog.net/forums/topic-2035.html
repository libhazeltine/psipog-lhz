			Recently, I've been trying telepathy and empathy and felt like I was getting nowhere. Last night, I was sitting down and these waves of energy kept sweeping over me, and my subconcious was bringing back LOADS of memories.  I could actually walk through houses or places from 10 or 15yrs ago and see every minute detail in the house.  I could practically feel objects as I mentally stepped through the building.  It was AWESOME.  That has never happened to me before and it was totally spontaneous.  After about 4hrs of that, I was so nauseated from these surges, and my head was spinning big time.  Can someone tell me what was the meaning of that? am I just progessing along? or is my subconcious starting to communicate with me?  what is the meaning of that? <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Also, while i was astounded by the level of detail at which i was able to recall from years gone by, i was also shocked when scenes from a painful marriage and divorced surfaced.  I felt the emotions, etc. all over again.  This is amazing to me.

I have 3 thoughts about what this could mean.
<br />

<br />
1.
<br />
Maybe you are suppose to figure out why the stuff you see happened in the first place and make it come to a resolution.
<br />

<br />
2.
<br />
Maybe something is just trying to torment you.
<br />

<br />
3.
<br />
Maybe you moved yourslef through different time periods through those placed OR your exploring yourself with a physical body.
<br />

<br />
Did you go anywhere that you haven't even seen before?  Did the scenes appear at random, like one from weeks or months came before the one you just saw?

			Honestly i'm unsure, it sounds like your mind was plugged into a &quot;Memory Matrix&quot; if thats real or possible, given your mind plugs senses and other things into a &quot;Dream Matrix&quot; when you sleep. All in all sounds interesting, I know there are some memories I wish I could relive... *long sigh*

			unless i read it wrong, it sounds a little like retrocognition.  i can't really explain this, so search google for it.  or maybe you are calming yourself down so much that your stored long term memories are coming to you on a conscious level?

			98% chance of bullshit. 4% chance of your pants getting caught fire.  32% chance of rain... You can all decide for yourself, but I kinda doubte he got into a &quot;memory matrix&quot; as shadowwolf called it.. Because it's fluffy as hell. Thats movie stuff, doesn't happen in real life. All you fluffers can say that I'm just not open minded, but you're wrong, I'm just not stupid like you all. Come on. Anybody with brains can tell this guys full of shit.

			Scorch,

You do know there are nicer ways of saying this not being a jerk in your sayings, this isnt the first and I bet far from the last. Also note my quote,
<br />

<br />
&quot;'Memory Matrix' if thats real or possible, given your mind plugs senses and other things into a 'Dream Matrix' when you sleep&quot;
<br />

<br />
The noted part is &quot;If thats real or possible&quot;. So please, read it fully, also be nice, its a rule, a rule you seem to be forgetting on nearly every post i've seen you make. There is being a good skeptic then there is being a insensitive person, which your being, note its fluff in a nicer way or please keep it to yourself, i'm sure the people here don't enjoy flames, I don't even enjoy it and it's not being pointed at me.

			Sircube and Shadow, I thank you for your response.  I am new to all of this.  Umm, I didn't go anywhere mentally that I have not gone before and yes, the scenes were random.  It's kinda freaky because that sort of thing happened to me all day yesterday and it kinda calmed down into the night.  Anytime I thought for a second about something I had done or somewhere I had been, I would get extremely dizzy, and then &quot;bam!&quot;, I was back in time reliving it all to the tee.  It kept freaking my wife out as I was moving my head around and reaching out as if I were touching things.  The way I got it to stop was to only think of things I had YET to do, not something that had already occurred.

			Nightshade!!!!  Yes, retrocognition!! That's what's happening to me.  Man, I've never heard of that before.  I just did a Google search on it and that describes what's happening to me. I am sitting here in my office and can see scenes like things that have happened before.

			All of this stuff is new to me. I've always had freaky things happen (visions, premonitions, precognitions, etc) but it's nice to start understanding and getting a handle on these things.  I wonder how you can develop it.
