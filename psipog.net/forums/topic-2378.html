			To the point. Removing contract cords through gentle destruction and healing is effective however my situation is rare from the stand point that empathic overloads (caused from cords + personal memories) have altered my focus so drastically that broadcasts thoughts are potholed with mental turrets. Driving my basic thinking of right and wrong out the mental car window while going 70 off a cliff.
<br />

<br />
Now my shield has keep me breathing this far (<span style="font-style: italic">earths </span>core provides an effective visual: molten lava, rock, crust)  Also I imagine memories on a laptop and destroy it by teleporting the energy into lava for recycling.
<br />

<br />
What im asking is if anyone has experience with filtering thoughts through inner programming?
<br />

<br />
Possibly I missed an important piece on shields/empathy which diffuses broadcasts and could be fixed with practice (at least I hope)

never really had much luck with filtering thoughts through a sheild. I have heard (read actually) that when programming a sheild, you have to know which one and what you want it to do before you start. Once you know, you start to make the energy around you, then program. You sheilds have been having NO progress with destroying empathetic overloads what so ever?

			Heres the deal. My shields always are up for wisdom however as i said at the beginning my basic thinking is impaired ergo random links/cords are sent and received creating havoc. This security breech needs a program of essence. A progressive clean slate if you will.

You should really consider joining the US government civil service, where your obfuscated bureaucratic language, semifunctional metaphors, and sprinkling of meaningless buzzwords would really be appreciated.

			Lets start this informationaly covered bisque. To arrange mindsets in a positive manner realize I personally have used these tactics and encourage your advice to run for president. With that lets begin.
<br />
Improving yourself is an inner battle since the notion that you create your own reality shines light on life. Some folks interchange the word problem with improving because of the mindset missing a trick. The trick (solution) to any problem can be found by: 
<br />

<br />
1. Create a goal.
<br />
2. Make a path to the goal.
<br />
3. Label what you can control.
<br />
4. Label what you can't control.
<br />

<br />
This is invincible so relax. Your memory is uniquely calm. Dont feel special, I have giving this information to others and they walked by unfazed. So my hopes of you actually appreciating this are neutral at best.
<br />

<br />
This systems greatest weakness is when you forget that you create your own reality. It is very easy to slip into objectification. With the blueprint solution to everything in the air lets start the improvement. Confidence always enjoys a boost so will begin with increasing yours. When you were a baby the world of confidence spun on your finger like a top. The only thing between you and cloud nine are memories. Faith jumps on that train and we comprehend that most people have energy/confidence trapped in memories. When I learned this I rolled the old eyes until I started receiving energy [talk about weight of the shoulders]. 
<br />

<br />
Hopefully youre thinking how do I get my energy back. This is the creative section where you get to flex your destroying muscles. Cages in the background rattle. The basics of this demolition fest are you must have the memory at your attention and then destroy it. My latest technique deals with a laptop that plays a movie of the memory. I then explode the computer into a million pieces that fall into the lava of my shield where they are recycled into clean energy.
<br />

<br />

<br />
After a primal thrash sesh remember to: thank your body for changing, run fresh energy, reground, and relax. Thanks go out to everyone who has helped me along my path and to this website for providing the gravy.

			i think you threw everyone off with the title. It said direct question. Although i can &quot;somewhat&quot; understand your metephors, you cant title a thread a direct question + sheild advice, and then ask for someone that can dicypher metaphors. You cant have your cake and eat it too.
<br />

<br />
on a side note. You should think of your sheild as a barrier between you and the psycic dangers of the word. To make this barrier adequet you need to consider your tools. The hard stone of rejection, and the mortar that holds everything in balance. Think of the stone as your intention, and the mortar as your programming into the sheild itself. Now as you may already know, and even if you dont, your sheild is only as good as both of the said tools. Your stone has to be strong enough to ward off said dangers, and your mortar must be detailed and must stick enough to hold the stones together.
<br />

<br />
The only thing i see wrong is your high attention to detail and you seem very compelled to command metaphors in it. The only thing i can tell you is to keep the goal simple, and it seems simple enough. You want to fight off empathetic overloads. (And by memories, i beleive you mean that you are flooded with memories that arnt yours.) Pretentious? I dont know really. You just seem to think that everything needs to be done or said in a big way, and it doesnt. 
<br />

<br />
Keeping it simple is a conundrum in its self. It isnt speaking in the generalities that most people interperet it to mean. Say, keeping it simple means simple to everyone else. It means keep it simple to yourself, meaning, that if you think that one way to do it is simpler than the other, then use it. Dont go for the flash. The glory. The glory will come in time, when the simplest of actions are not simple to others. What does all this mean? You dont need fancy programming language and metaphors that, on the surface, seem to be poetic, but in reality are nothing more than your desire to be looked up to and thats ok. But, like i said. Keep it simple. Use simple stones (intentions) and simple mortar. (commands) With this concept in mind, its almost impossible to to have a sheild (or anything else goal oriented) fail.
