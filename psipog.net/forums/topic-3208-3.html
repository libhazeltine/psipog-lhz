Hmmm, I am not sure if I can forgive you. I am not a man, just a fat guy. I just didn't like your boasting and self-centered ways. Are you on the road to enlightenment? I would ask that in a PM but you never read them!

			So be it. Like and dislike as you please. But know everytime you focus on such pointless negatives you create unncessary negative energy that hurts more than does good.

All my posts have substance. In every forum 80 people post garbage or don't post at all and 20 percent post substance. The 80/20 rule at work. I make sure all my posts have as much substance as possible as not to add to that garbage. And when asked about my self my posts seem boastful then so be it. When posting on an issue if my answers seem conceited then so be it also. It's better than garbage.

Your cruel. And speaking of garbage, you have written that statement about 80% of posts on forums to be garbage quite a few times...so you are making even more garbage.

			Ok can we get back on track? I agree with Nightshade's posts. And agreed, it is our job to teach. You can not learn this unless u want to, unless u beleive that yopu can do it. It took me like 3 weeks 2 get my first sccesful PSI ball. And do u know WHY I spent 3 weeks learning? Because I read about the signs while creating the PI ball. Tinglings, heart beast in the hands heat.........
<br />

<br />
We should just let the skeptiocs beleive what they want.  We already now thye truth. When they imagine l;ifes possibilities, they can give it a try. But until then, they will be unbeleivers, de3nying this ahh...ability.

AQnd yah, apparently the govern,ment likes using remote veiwers.

JustOwnin:You're right on the 80/20 rule but your speech is similar to when I'm either trying to confuse people or when I feel dark. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> but you speak quite eloquently if I do say so myself.....
