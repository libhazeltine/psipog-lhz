			so last night my mother threatened to put my dog up for adoption if i dont take it her more than once a day and one thing led to another and we got into a huge fight over stupid things. i retreated to our gym for some reason and just sat on the mats crying my eyes out. i got up with a straight face but couldnt hold in the pain of losing my puppy. i focused all that anger on one punch into the punching bag. at the very moment my fist touched the bag i heard a loud crash upstairs an 5 seconds later one outside.
<br />

<br />
It turned out to be the tv in the kitchen falling off the wall mount and the air conditioner falling off the window ledge wich was on the same wall  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
i've noticed my anger being a trigger before but i can't ever tap into it when i want to. i mean, i can barley move the psi wheel for a couple rotations straight. yet when i need a way to take out my anger it seems to easily provoke silly things like this? 
<br />

<br />
ive never let my anger get to me except for those few couple times. most of the time i put these sort of situations in the back of my mind untill kickboxing wich is my release for these kind of emotions for as long as i can remember. pfft. meet a future nut house guest  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />
