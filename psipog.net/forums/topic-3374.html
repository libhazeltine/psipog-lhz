			I just got back into psionics about a week and a half ago, telepathy especially. Since then i keep hearing someone calling my name, but i turn around and there and noone has sad anything. Has anyone had a similar situation happen. My only conclusions are that someone is playing a joke on me, saying my name and acting like they didnt, or some people are thinking of saying my name and im picking that up thru telepathy.

			As a natural telepath, I have consistently had this problem, though not commonly in hearing my name be said. Speaking about a person, for most people, non and natural alike, sends out a kind of pseudo-ping which will attract sensitive individuals. It's like having your name highlight on an IRC client, with a little &quot;beep.&quot;
<br />

<br />
It's fairly common in telepath types, but tends to be influenced by things like shielding and distance.

			If you ask me this is a prime reason to keep up a shield at all times.  And if you have these problems as many of us telepaths do you'll notice pretty easily when they are down or in shambles.

			I once had this happen to me a few years ago just before a Chemistry class (I had not been practising any psionics as I didn't know how).  Unfortunately I was so busy trying to tp a reply that I didn't ask the one other person in the room whether it was them.  I think it sometimes happens to nons too. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

I meant people who didn't practise telepathy and weren't naturals at it.

			yah Ive experienced that too... like the first time we practiced psionics about 2 years ago... when me and my friends were walking in downtown, with so many large crowds. There was one instance when I heard my name called and it was like echoing in my ear part. I just thought someone who knows me called me but when I looked around there was none, just group of people. And another instance when I was in my room alone. I was typing in my computer when I suddenly heard my named called, it was loud just as the first time and this time I could recognize the voice. It was a girl's voice and it sounded like my classmate BUT this classmate of mine is not into psionics and let along entartain such thought coz she never believes on such thing. How could that be? Am I just hearing things?

Based on the standard definition, nons are individuals who do not manifest abilities by course of nature. My nextdoor neighbor, for example, does not demonstrate any psychic abilities &quot;from scratch.&quot; Instead, were he to wish to learn them, he must apply himself and learn those abilities without the crutch of natural selection on his side.
<br />

<br />
Nons are those who are not natural. Those who are not natural exist. Ergo, nons exist.

No. While I'm sure these types exist, I wasn't referring to them.

			Hey, i often get what you have desribed but i never really related it to telepathy until reading this even though i know of telepathy; i always assumed that it was just my mind playing tricks on me as i seem to get it alot when i am listening to music or when my hearing is not at its optimum i guess we could say lol so i thought i was just thought that maybe im worried that i wont hear if someone calls me so my minds makes me think that someone is lol its hard ti explain i hope i haven't confused u all lol moonrave

			I get that alot, I've never been skilled in telepathy, well I haven't really tried it, maybe its a sign that I might be good at it. But up until now I've always just assumed I was paranoid, or you know just imagining things, not like crazy or anything.
