Sure there is proof. Obviously levitating a pencil would be harder than rolling it. If there was a way to weigh out how much force it would take, it would be much less then it would take to levitate. The proof is in force and weight. Moving a house would be much more difficult than spinning a psiwheel for the same reason.

			Ummm...basically, there is no rulebook saying you have to start on the psiwheel, NOR is there a rule stating that you &quot;may not slide an object before spinning psiwheel&quot;.  You never had to start on the psiwheel, it is just a very easy spot to begin because, for most, it spins within at least a month, compared to what might happen if you tried to roll a pencil (or slide it).  But who knows?  Maybe, just maybe, it would take the same amount of time because all you are doing is getting your mind used to moving things?  Idk.

I never recall saying there was a rulebook anywhere. Nor did I say such a rule ought to exist. The bigger possibility is the nerveza is kind of a natural but the MOTION for sliding is much more natural than spinning for him. It takes much less force to cause a psiwheel to spin than just about any object to slide. A light breath from your nose will cause a psiwheel to move but wouldn't budge a pencil. I don't think the mind getting used to moving things has much to do with this unless it's on your first object that you begin with. I'm used to moving psiwheels but I can't move cars.

That definitely doesn't make since. Moving a 2 ton car is much easier than moving a psiwheel that is fractions of an ounce for you? Now the motion might be more comfortable to you, but as for the amount of force, that doesn't make since. You have to come up with enought force pushing against the object. If you want me to I can make this into a physics equation, because the laws of physics still apply but the force is coming from a force that most people can't see. Heavier objects might be easier for you, but not for everyone else that I've talked to.
