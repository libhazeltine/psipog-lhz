			the only things i really practice are telepathy and psi balls, just to let you know first off.
<br />

<br />
so lately, i've said this in another post, i've been able to sense what drivers in front of me are going to do. let me go into a little more depth. i'll be driving right, and i get stuck in front of someone going under the speed limit (*cringe*), so naturally people come to this question; should I pass 'em up or not? well when I ask myself this question i suddenly get the impression that i shouldn't most of the time, but i'll sense that the person is going to make a left hand turn up ahead so i think why bother pass 'em up. too much effort. 
<br />

<br />
so is that clairvoyance? i dont practice it so i'm not sure at all. i figured it could be telepathy. i've also thought that it could be my sub-c. not too sure. either way.....if it is clairvoyance, it's like looking a few seconds into the future.

clairvoyance?  doubt it, i believe that's seeing objects from a distance (to which you can't see them physically).  i would say this is precognition.  search precognition and see if the definition is similar to what you are experiencing.

			gotcha. thanks.

i always thought clairvoyance was seeing ahead, aka seein the future too. 
<br />
guess i was wrong.

			more than likely... when someone is driving slow its because theyre going to turn. however i get sudden pattern shifts in traffic as well and i know exactly what you mean.

			i always thought claivoyance was seeing things in the future/distance.  i just said at a distance because they switched the old name of this forum (from remote viewing) to clairvoyance.  that sort of &quot;hinted&quot; me that psipog must define clairvoyance as a type of remote viewing...i could be wrong.

			i dont know. after reading that sticky on RV, the def kinda confused me. well i guess not necessarily the def, but how to RV. 
<br />

<br />
ya RV has protocols and yata yata.
<br />

<br />
clairvoyance i thought precognition, or in general seeing and knowing without being able to explain in normal terms; ESP kinda. 
<br />

<br />
that's just what i always understood it to be though...could be wrong
