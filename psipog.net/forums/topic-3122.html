			I had a dream a couple of nights ago and usually the dreams I have show me the future flat out or its put in a kind of metaphors of the future. Any way I had 3 seperate dreams that night and two of them were of my mom breaking up with her boyfriend. She really likes the guy and I dont want to tell her but I dont know if I should because she likes the guy alot and we have talked of moving there around the time I have to go to college but shes not sure yet. So should I tell her and hope I am wrong or just wait it out?

			Um definetly wait out, u should try to change the future because if even u find a way to make that not happen it still might happen later so i think its something u shouldnt mess with. Hey doesnt mean u listen to me its just what i think. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			You should definately wait, even if she ever breaks up, she might have had a good time with him. Life has too many consequences to stop doing something just because of the end. Just make sure you're there for her when it happens.

			What is your opinion of your mom's boyfriend, and of her relationship with him?
<br />

<br />
Be honest here. Be brutally honest.
<br />

<br />
Sleep is when your subconscious mulls over things that have been troubling your conscious, and dreams can be a result of this.

			If your dreams have a very common pattern of coming true somewhat, I guess there's nothing you can do to stop it. In most Greek myths, men and heroes tried to escape the fate given to them by the gods, and while doing so actually met their fate quicker than they wanted. This may be true in your case. I guess you just have to wait and see if it was a meaningless dream or a prophecy of the future. If it's the latter, you can do nothing to change it.
<br />

<br />
Good luck.

			Fist of all, listen to &quot;Felix_the_Cat&quot; as in also my humble opinion this is what?s usually going on.
<br />

<br />
Second, and this is important, ignore any suggestions to &quot;wait it out&quot; (no offence guys). To &quot;wait it out&quot; has the same effect as to &quot;doubt it&quot; ie. = it puts your focus on the negative. Point beeing, your focus has a lot to do with what?s happening in your life. If you focus on something negative &quot;not&quot; to happen then you just might go ahead and do what you don?t like yourself. If you deceide to go the other way, go ahead and find evidence why the opposite must be true. I?m sorry if I am not utterly clear here. In this case though, you may go ahead and doubt your dream if this makes any sense.
