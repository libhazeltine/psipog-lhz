			I have a theory...It's probably very common and if it is then I agree with it 100% and if not then hear me out. Dreaming, lucid dreaming in particular is in essence visualization at its highest form. One can instantly create any scenario, object, ability, etc. within his/her(if you are female then just bare with the usage of &quot;he&quot; from here on out)dream. So if one perfects his lucid dreaming skills to a level at which he could fully control his dream then can't he practice an every day skill? For example if that person wanted to improve his tennis game then can't he dramatically increase is motor skills, timing, judgment, etc. in the real world by simple &quot;practicing&quot; over and over in his vivid dream world? To be more clear think of it as &quot;The Matrix&quot;. You are basically creating an alternate detailed word for yourself and programming whatever skills into your brain. The possibilities are practically limitless! Think about it! In one night you can live out days, weeks, months even years of practice of any skill/ability! Now when I say &quot;any skill&quot; I limit this to practical skills an individual has ordinarily performed one time or another in his life. I'm not sure you could enhance skills such as levitation or pk, for most do not regularly see it in real life so they would therefore limit themselves. Nonetheless I feel that lucid dreaming can change ones life, enhancing their capabilities to an unimaginable level by simply doing the easiest thing in the world, SLEEPING!!! 
<br />

<br />
Tell me what you think of this and be critical if you have to. Again its only a theory.

			If you think about moving a psiwheel all day before you actually attempt it, I've heard you've got a higher success rate.

This is the same concept, so I'd say it would definately work.

			Can one improve motor skills in lucid dreams? 
<br />
Yes. I am 99% sure that this is true, as I've seen that it is possible from many sources. It is fairly common.

			Hypnotists help athletes by making them think they are doing what they are doing, and visualizing them doing it succesful. This works for gymastics and and other things as well. I am sure lucid dreams would definatly help

			Well, there are many parts of your brain that can't tell the difference between a vivid visualization and the real thing. If I remember right there are few parts of your mind that _can_ tell the difference so this would definatly make sense. This has its limits though. It can work to greatly enhance a skill but nothing will ever take the place of good old practice. But it could be a really cool training technique. Pitting the odds so heavily against yourself in a dream that anything in the waking world seems simple and easy by comparison.

			Yea ive thought of doing this before i agree with you on the fact you could become more coordinated or have better reflexs and whatnot. Just dont try to use it as a way to improve strength or speed, your muscles dont tend to move a lot whilst you are sleeping.

			Yeah, you can train any skill in a lucid dream as long as you have the knowledge prior to it. For instance I could improve on skills that I have already, skateboarding for instance, but I can't learn a new language.

			actually you might be able to make your body stronger because when your doing ur skill in the dream it could send more nerve signals to that part of the body.
<br />
Sending more signals can make it stronger. some english scientist did an experiment on it. One group worked out there pinky for a week and it got 33% stronger the other group thought about there pinky alot and made it 11% stronger

			I'm pretty sure that this can be done.
<br />

<br />
You can do it WHILE AWAKE even <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> Just using a visualization with all the stimuli you think you would be using in real life can greatly improve your coordination when attempting physical skills (Such as roller skating, Skateboard and many other things).
<br />

<br />
Though it is a lot easier to do these things while you are &quot;awake&quot;, or conscious in normal life.

As far as I know there hasn?t been discovered any part of the brain that could tell the difference. This is a Dr. Joe Dispenza &quot;what the bleep&quot; quote though.

			I agree with jesserevis. For example if you want to get better at driving you have to know all the physics in the real world... Cause if you dont know how the car will react to a certain new possibility in real life it may be completely different and you could get severely hurt ...

Very true. Visualizing increases your chances of getting it right or doing it better. And practicing in dreams would be tough anyways, nothing ever works right. Like gravity might take a vacation when you were going up on a half pipe, then return once you were over a nice big vat of lava. Or something like that. Maybe my dreams are just sadistic. Even being lucid sometimes you don't remember stuff, like being able to change the dream world, and sometimes you can't. So yeah, sometimes you gotta give what it takes you and go with it.
