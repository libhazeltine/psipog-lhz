			Hello, I have a few questions about PK.
<br />
Every time I try to move an object by using PK it kind of moves but it's really slow. I can move it a few milimeters but it usually takes me about 2 minutes... Is that because I'm not expierienced enough, or could it be a mental block of some sort? I haven't really tried to spin the psiwheel, I don't find it interesting  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  I started with a toothpick (yeah, i't was hard but I seem to have progressed).
<br />
When I recently tried to move a pen, it moved at the same speed as the toothpick (still slow, but atleast something). I was quite surprised. Of course, I'm not really used to the pen yet but it seems to be easier than moving the toothpick  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />
One more thing, when practicing PK, my hands become a little magnetic. Light objects seem to follow my fingertips when floating on water. Is that from doing PK, is that a sign of progress?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
P.S. Yay, my first post, there'll definetly be more.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Wait so you moved the toothpick and pen in water? Or did you actually roll them on solid ground. Either way it's progress. It just takes practice. The more you move different objects the more your sub-c will react and not take as long. It's just practice, that's all.

			Actually, I moved the pen on the surface of my desk. That's why I think I've made some nice progress, but I just can't make it move any faster. It seems to be easier to pull the pen by one end of it. And I can't make it roll, hehe, just because it's sliding so slowly.
<br />
I've also made a floating Lego brick follow my fingertip, of course that one's much faster.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

And thanks for the advice, Jynx.
