			I've been fiddling with Psi-balls constantly for the few days since I've started. It got to the point today where I realized a few things. 
<br />
1. Can't stick with them forever
<br />
2. there are side effects that atleast I myself have noticed. 
<br />
 The side effects I've noticed are rather awkward really, and consist several conditions. The first of which is emotion. I find that the more I get excited, the more I begin to &quot;radiate&quot; what feels like energy. In fact today a friend of mine started to piss me off and they developed what can only be described as sheer horror. When I asked them they didn't know why and quite frankly they are typically stoic. I'd figure if it was just a stare, but it never had that kind of reaction from them before.What concerns me with this is did I trigger some kind of release that caused a subliminal message to them? So I continued to fiddle around and decided to pull up as much as what irritated me into my mind. I was able to recreate the situation and once again, I began to radiate what felt like waves on my skin. Heres the problem with this entire thing though and that is if I keep developing my skills how much further will this go? I concluded that I should try meditating because I've noticed that along with practicing almost from sun up to sun down that I have become increasingly more doubting and miserable despite the fact that I'm not even remotely tired and I have been experiencing results.  
<br />
          Onto the second part of my thoughts. I've decided that at least for myself, my emotions are tied to my physical and I suppose mental strength. Unfortunately, with that means several things and non of which are good for myself or people around me. I am currently going to meditate for a bit before I hit the sack and then go to bed.  I'm usually easily amused and slow to anger, but over the past few days I've found that I've been extremely short tempered. 
<br />
         Onto part three and this includes anyone who can input.  Has anyone had these kind of reactions? Will meditating help this situation? Finally, are there other things I should be looking into alternatively.

			the only thing i can say about my energy when i feel that sudden, random rush is euphoria. I love that feeling. it feels like someone is brushing a feather from my feet spiraling up to my knees. 
<br />

<br />
My anger is... not the same as it once was. I am slow to anger as well, but it lingered. Has ever since i was little. But now, since i have been playing with psi, my anger has been quick to manifest, but dissipates just as quickly. And when i get angry, it feels like i automatically focus my psi.

			I don't see a relationship to Anger, or emotions, in myself or anyone around me because of Psi Practice. My suggestion: What ever you are going through it's just a &quot;phase&quot;. If you don't want to be quick to anger, then don't be. Practice keeping your cool, and you will stay that way. It is our natural human reaction to feel angered, even incredibly easily, and if you don't like it, you must fight it.
<br />

<br />
I'd guess your friends reaction was just a coincidence.

			I spent some time meditating before I went to bed last night and I that the most of the &quot;angered&quot; effect is a mix of physical exhaustion along with mental frustration. The frustration kind of lingered in the back as an underlining condition. Maybe my frustration was manifesting in my subconscous? Either way I think after a few hours of meditation and a good eight hours of sleep it should be pretty much quieted.

			Whe you meditated what did you picture in you mind, or say over and over again? Because there are different methds, ones especially for getting rid of unwanted anger. I once read on a site of a method that consisted you getting all the things that make you angry or sad or whatever and thinking of them all, and them gathering them and putting them into a visual dustbin and then locking the lid.TIGHT. Then you just kind of keep your mind clear and apparentely that should help if done everytime before. Also, certain images do different things, not only to your mood, but if on a long scale maybe personality. Of course this is completely theory. Probably not true about the personality bit anyways.

			I actually don't do any of that. All I do is plop down and for lack of better terms zone out.  I get to a state of mind where I'm entirely blank as in nothing is going on upstairs. The silence in my mind when I meditate calms me. I find that this way works best for me. It did definately help with the short temper issue, Actually it wasn't so much the frustration part that irritated me, but the fact that it actually in my opinion had manifested.
