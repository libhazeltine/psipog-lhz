			Before you get excited...no this isnt an article on how to controll peoples minds.
<br />

<br />
Silva mind controll is a method to switch your brain wave oscillation from the the beta range through the alpha range and ultimately to theta...although  alpha is usual experience.
<br />
For those of you who do not know beta is a conscious state of mind...if your up and fully awake chances are your operating out of the beta state.
<br />
Have you ever been extremely bored and experienced day dreams???
<br />
Its an imaginative state of mind...called alpha...
<br />
silva mind controll aims to consciously eneter you into the alpha brain wave state
<br />

<br />
Heres the tech ...its extremely difficult.......
<br />

<br />
Close your eyes breathe a few breaths in...look upward for 5 seconds ..
<br />
count down slowly from 5 to 0 ..there your done you are now in alpha.
<br />
Told you it was difficult...I have no links
<br />

<br />
yes it is proven ...through ECG scans while a man did silva mind control and answered math questions in t he Alpha state.
<br />

<br />

			This is a common beginner's technique for trance induction with a different name slapped on it. It's not terribly difficult.

			If I remember correctly, you had to go down and relax every part of your body and become aware of it to the point where you could feel your bloodflow, starting at your head. Then, starting at your feet, you had to convince yourself that your [insert body part here] isn't part of your body. There's also some numbers involved.

			I have taken the Silva Mind Control course several times. I have taken the child course when I was a kid 2 times, and I took the adult course when I was 14. Took that one twice as well.
<br />

<br />
The method is not just the counting down. they have created aLOT of techniques for aLOT of different purposes. All kinds of techniques you can aply to get more control over your mind, in the alpha or theta state of mind. They mostly work with Alpha though.
<br />

<br />
The official countdown method goes as follows:
<br />

<br />
+You count back from three to one, but you repeat each number three times. So you relax the body and sit down, preferably with a straight back, but any relaxed posture will do. 
<br />
+ Close your eyes and turn them 20 degrees upward, don't force it, just slightly look upward with eye-lids closed, unless you prefer to keep the eyes open. 
<br />
+ Then you take a deep, yet not forced but relaxed breath. When you breath out, you visualize and repeat the numbers in your head: 
<br />

<br />
3 Three....
<br />
3 Three....
<br />
3 Three....
<br />

<br />
-Take a deep relaxing breath in, slowly, and breath out slowly, while visualizing and repeating the following on the exhale:
<br />

<br />
2 Two....
<br />
2 Two....
<br />
2 Two....
<br />

<br />
-take a deep slow breath in once more and as you exhale slowly, repeat and visualize in your mind:
<br />

<br />
1 One....
<br />
1 One....
<br />
1 One....
<br />

<br />
You are now in the Alpha state of mind. Welcome <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
Silva Mind Control then has alot of techniques for you to control your subconscious and program it with whatever you wish. They have developed easy to use and practical, fast-working tools. I can advice every one, especially the beginning meditator, to take that course.

			Ah, now that it's been more explained, it sounds more like Monroe's focus ten. Actually, it sounds exactly like it. Except that Monroe uses binaural beats, of course.

			I heard of a technique, I'm not sure if it was Silva, maybe NLP?
<br />

<br />
Anyway the technique should have a very interesting result...
<br />

<br />
It goes like this:
<br />

<br />
Imagine you are walking in a corridor, arriving to a door, opening the door and entering a corridor, walking in the corridor, arriving to a door, opening the door and entering a corridor, walking in the corridor, arriving to a door...and so on...
<br />

<br />
I think you need to do it for 10-20 min., but I'm not sure.I tried it a couple of times and it didn't yield any results for me...
<br />

<br />
If anyway is willing to try it would be cool
