			When I was 11 years old I started PK. At that time I didn't like anything about my life. One day, I was standing at the bus stop thinking about everyone and everything I hated. The thoughts overwhelmed me so I sat down on the curb to wait for the bus. Slowly everything turned gray, until I was staring at a gray wall. I stared at this wall for about 5 minutes (or so I thought) and then came back to full consciousness. When I woke up, I felt very calm and energized. I noticed that I had missed the bus and everyone was gone, so I walked to school. When I got to school, I saw the time and I found out that I was &quot;asleep or something for 2 hours&quot;. My friends were telling me how they were yelling at me and hitting to wake me up, but I didn't move.

			Sounds like a game show, 'deeeoo do da doo dop pa da...&quot;

Anyway, definitely meditation.  That stuff happens everyonce and a while.  It's happened to me only once that i'm sure of except  I only did it for 45 mins.  And minus the grey, I only see random colors when stuff like that happens.

It was prolly your brain looking for an outlet to let all that junk go.  Hate isn't a pretty thing.  I hope your not like that anymore?

Start meditating often.  It helps more than more people realize.

good luck

			There's been this thing where significant spiritual progress is somehow signified by delays in time? I'm not sure. But in Taoism where that kind of concentrative meditation you mentioned is emphasized people go apparently for one day and when they return it has really been a month etc.
