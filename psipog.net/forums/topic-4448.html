			Maybe you have slow reactions? Almost everyone can move their finger through a flame without getting burnt, if your good at pyrokinesis (i am, yay, go me  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> lol) fire doesnt affect you, as ive found out. Anyway, back to the point, ive passed my hands through flames plenty of times, the longest time ive had my hand in a flame without a burn, blister or pain, is 6 seconds, so im sure that it is possible to convince your sub-c that flames are not harmful. But dont try to pass your hand through a flame without having experience with fire first. Infact, just dont play with fire.

			If you are not experienced with fire, you will get burnt, im a pyrotechnician, 4 years worth of experience with fire, you have to respect fire, and it will respect you, dont give it any leeway, because it will take advantage. So, dont play with fire, a twat at my school sprayed deoderant onto his hand and lit it because he thought it looked cool, 3 days later, he had to have his hand amputated, hes finding it hard to cope with just one hand. I cant say i didnt warn him, and i cant say im not warning you.

I wasnt pointing the finger, i apologise if it came out that way, and no, his hand could not have been saved because the fire scarred the tendons and rendered his hand useless, it caused him tremendous pain, so it was amputated.

Ohh nasty!

Shocking people always seems to be the best tactic to get the point across. I agree the fool shouldn't have done something as CRAZY as that, but can't help feeling bad for him in someway.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

I have stupid moments, do stupid things and usually regret them, but NOTHING as retarded as pouring lighter fluid on myself.
