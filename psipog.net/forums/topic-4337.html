			Ok I've been doing all this with my senses for about a month and it is making your 5 senses better to improve your 6th sense it may sound werid but it works and I got it out of a book called Psychic Development for Beginners and I will not copy it from the book word for word.
<br />

<br />
EXERCISE 1   SIGHT
<br />
When it is night look around the room and see the shape of everything and guess what the object is so lets say it was pitch black in your room and you see the dark shape of your TV what I want you to say is &quot;This is what a TV. looks like in the dark. I am sensitizing my sight to recognize objects accurately in the dark and under any lighting situation.&quot; There is more to it but thats all i do if you wana know more buy the book it might be more understandable.
<br />

<br />

<br />
EXERCISE 2   HEARING
<br />
In the book it says do this at night but I would do it at any time. sit down somewhere where you might hear alot and just close your eyes  and listen to what your hearing and try to figgure out what you are hearing and go into detale with it like if you hear a car outside it might not be a car it could be a truck or van try to hear what it is but dont look and also if you are having trouble blocking stuff out just listen to everything and it will all fade away. It will tell you more in the book and if you want to find out more read the book.
<br />

<br />

<br />
EXERCISE 3  SMELL
<br />
go in your kitchen or a restaurant and just breath in all the oders you can and know what the oders are or open up some spice bottles and smell them and know what you are smelling. Say &quot;I am sensitizing my sence of smell for use in my psychic development and i am currently smelling (name of item)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Now in the next exercise it will have 2 parts to it about touch.
<br />

<br />

<br />
EXERCISE 4  TOUCH 1 TEMPERATURE
<br />
Now some of you may not know but a psychis can usually detect an entity buy the temperature if you feel a cold spot in a hundred degree room you will prolly be in contact with one but do not freek out anyway in one hand hold something cold sutch as an ice cube and in the other hand hold something warm. What i do is take a glass bottle and put hot watter in it but dont make it hot enough to burn you if you hold the bottle and what this dose it it lets you know the difference between hot and cold a little better in case you com in contact with an entity.
<br />

<br />

<br />
EXERCISE 5 TOUCH 2 TEXTURE
<br />
Chose some stuff in your house that has different textures and feel them and see how the fellings of everything differ are they rough, smouth, silkey, gritty, etc and tell your self that you are sensitizing your sence of touch for psychic purposes.
<br />

<br />

<br />
EXERCISE 6 TASTE
<br />
Ok while you are eating or drinking pause for a moment while the food or drink is still in your mouth if you are eating a cookie say to your self or out loud &quot;I am now tasting a cookie and am sensitizing  my sence of taste for use in my psychic Development&quot; 
<br />

<br />

<br />
For all the parts that say I am now sensitizing my sence of whatever those are the only parts i did take out of the book because i didnt know how to put it in my own words. I hope that what i have put here has helped most of you in your development and i can tell you after doing just the hearing part for some reason my esp improved more than i can say and again i hope it dose the same for all of you.
<br />

<br />
              Thank you,
<br />

			Burn the book, it is trying to increase your 6th sense by increasing your awareness of your existing bodily senses?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> wtf? does that make any sort of sense to you?
<br />

<br />
 I personally find that in order to increase my ESP I have to actually stop relying on my existing body senses in order to make use of a new sense.
<br />

<br />
For example when walking the streets, I see a corner, rather than turn and look, I stretch out mentally and tactically feel the area, if I feel a presense, I scan for information, is it male or female? young or old? black or white? tall or short? and then I look to see if I sensed correctly.
<br />

<br />
You want to increase awareness of your psychic senses? Focus on that entirely, there is no relation between body senses and psychic senses. They work through different mediums.
