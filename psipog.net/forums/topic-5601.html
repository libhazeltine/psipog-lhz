			I read that page. Its quite interesting.
<br />
It sounds a lot like meditation. It sounds similar anyway.
<br />
What are you trying to achieve by doing it ?
<br />
It sounds very interesting to think what you can use it for!

			hypnotize yourself could well screw something up, hard to say what would happen if you break one of the roots in your abosults thoughts.

			when it comes to trying to meditate and focus on psi stuff, i find it rather hard.  so i was wanting to hypnotize myself to get me to practice it regularly.  i downloaded some hypnosis mp3, i've gotten it to work, but its directed toward whatever the guy says on the track.  i tried to remove my headphones as i became hypnotized, but as soon as i directed my attention toward my hand to remove them, i lost the state that i was in.  being hypnotized is a very interesting experience.  i thought it was going to be like dreaming with hearing what the guy said, but it turns out that you are fully concious, you hear everything, and it feels just like you have your eyes closed.  but the difference is that you just feel so good.  you just become so relaxed.  i wonder if this could have some affect on psi studies?  i'd recommend trying this.  i got a few of the audio tracks, and burned them to a cd, and im trying to find a way to shut off the guy's voice after i've reached hypnosis.

			last night, i hypnotized myself again, and i maintained the state after the audio file had finished.  it felt really cool.  then i started feeling really wierd.  like i was about to faint or something.  i felt a little dizzy and when i arose, my vision was a little blurry.  i expect this to be from laying down and not moving for about a half hour, then suddenly jumping to my feet.  i don't know.  but this still doesn't explain what i was feeling while i was in hypnosis.  any thoughts on what could have happened, please post.
