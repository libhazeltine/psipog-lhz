			i was trying to meditate, but thoughts kept flowing through my head, so i thought about how my breathing sounded (hard to explain). I felt like i fell alseep, but i was completely concious of reality and stuff. i felt like the world around me got huge and i got small and then vice versa (a very complicated feeling). this happened a few times.
<br />

<br />
then a few minutes later i heard a whisper in my head &quot;i wonder if he'll be upset...&quot; i thought someone had said something so i opened my eyes.
<br />
then my mom knocked on my door and she said that we werent going on vacation...
<br />

<br />
im thinking i read her mind but i didnt try.... im confused, could anyone shed some light on the situation?

			I get that feeling all the time.  Next time you do it, focus on a body part, it'll feel like it growing and getting REALLY big.  No real point but it's pretty fun.  About the reading mind thing, idk, i dont do tp really.  sorry

			You were into a deeper state than normal, and I bet that after you felt like you fell asleep but remained very consicous, that the amount of thoughts running through your head decreased and you were capable of observing them with greater clarity? 
<br />
Because you were in that state, not only your own thought waves can reach your area, but thoughts from other people who are near you, are also in your proximity of consicousness. This happened and you catched on on your mothers thought-wave. 
<br />

<br />
On a deeper level of your being, your energyfield is much bigger, subtler and interacts constantly with other peoples energyfields. Only this time, you were deep and consicous enough to witness somebody elses thought. Because thought waves are actually just complicated fluctuations in these energy-fields.

I'm not sure if you were addressing me, but I will respond as if you were.  I believe in telepathy.  But moreso, I believe in rationality.  I refuse to automatically jump to the most exorbitant conclusions before the mundane ones can be discounted.

You don't see it as irrational because you've integrated spiritual beliefs moreso than the average person has.  Normally this is fine and just a lifestyle choice.  However, it will almost always influence the interpretations you have and the conclusions you come to, as in this particular circumstance.
<br />

<br />
A guy reports that he heard the voice of his mother while in a trance right before his mother came into his room.  The most logical explanation for this would be the guy in question merely heard his mother talking while approaching or standing outside of his door, and because he was in a trance, it only seemed as though it originated internally rather than externally.  To someone who has internalized a serious belief in the paranormal and has eradicated a more logical thought process would automatically assume that it was a telepathic episode, just as you did.
<br />

<br />
It doesn't seem far-fetched to you because of these internalized beliefs.  Can I criticize you for these beliefs?  Sure I can.  Should I?  Certainly not, because I have beliefs that I'm sure other, more skeptical individuals would scoff at.
<br />

<br />
I appreciate the fact that there are a lot of younger kids who come to these online psionic communities and, with great enthusiasm and creativity, begin to learn.  Unfortunately, there are many people who allow their desire to experience something paranormal to preclude their rational thought process.  This can be a slippery slope since skepticism can easily recede into near non-existence.
<br />

<br />
Be skeptical.  Verify your experience.  Believe when you have good reason to.

			Yes, yes all very true, except I'm not really like that, much.  It just seemed to me that she would say somthing loud enough for the person she is talking about to hear it.  Also, when i'm in the trance/meditation he descrided, I stop hearing.  Like kinda deaf unless it's very loud, or someone says my name(nifty filtering system, heh heh).
<br />

<br />
And also, the only experience in TP I've ever had has been random.  Like people telling me stuff, but not saying it, and I hear it, then we both get really confused, always fun stuff.
