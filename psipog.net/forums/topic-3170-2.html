<br />
Pyro-PK is PK but focusing on the vibrations of molecules.  Therefore, if you make the molecules in an object vibrate fast, it creates heat and (if you make it go fast enough) create fire.  Pyro-PK is also the manipulation of fire.  I have heard many arguements that manipulating the flame is PK or energy manipulation.  You make up your own decision.

When you light a match, what is burning?  The wood of the match.  Air helps the fire burn (as we all know) but it does not burn by itself.

This is true.  But we are talking about down here in the earth air.  Air would not burn by itself and so there really is no point in argueing that.

Bladeslinger is semi right.  What you guys are talking about is dangerous.  Not nessisarily against someone but when you guys are talking about the potentual to hurt, it is considered combat.  Kind of like suiside is illegal.  Combat is even hurting yourself.

there is a key word in the above sentence ^^

Could.  when you come out right and say that it can hurt you, etc, that is to far.  Telepathy, PK, OBE's, etc, cannot be used to hurt.  If you use telepathic suggestion, yes.  If you use PK such as throwing something at someone, yes.  Otherwise no.  That is why we lock those threads.

&quot;Pyro PK&quot; or whatever, Isn't used for combat?

It's just the same as PK, Telepathy and alot of psionics.
<br />
Yes &quot;Pyro PK&quot; could be used to hurt. As could telepathy, Psi manipulation etc etc.

i'm not too sure that you can physically effect things with remote viewing.  i believe this is a more passive skill that allows you to &quot;view&quot; &quot;remote&quot; objects/scenes.  so, i'm pretty sure that the max effect would be augmenting the size of a very small ember to a forest fire.  creating a fire is PK, i don't care what anyone says.  creating a fire involves vigorously vibrating atoms until you reach combustion, so that isn't considered &quot;pyro PK,&quot; which is the <span style="font-style: italic">manipulation</span> of fire.

<br />

<br />
this is because making the fire go out is using actual &quot;pyro PK&quot; to decrease the flame until it goes out.  lighting the flame is using <span style="font-style: italic">PK</span> to vibrate the atoms intensly until the object combusts, which, needless to say is a lot harder and more advanced than just manipulating fire.

			I have gotten this to work <span style="text-decoration: underline">once</span> and so far thats it. As I recall there are 4 things you need for fire. You need oxygen, heat, combustible material (Fuel), and the proper conditions. So, you ignore the last one, because there is a pretty broad range of temperatures and humidities and air pressures that things will still burn at. 
<br />

<br />
What I did was this: I visualized fire igniting the candle I had out. I kept that going on the back burner the entire time. Then I imagined all the oxygen molecules around the candle gathering next to the wick. I imagined everything within an inch of the wick that was not made of wax to be covered in oxygen molecules. (BTW oxygen molecules are two oxygen atoms paired together by valence electrons In other words kinda like (OXO) if that makes sence) I visualized the area about 95 percent oxygen particles, and the rest were hydrogen (Highly flamable). Then I visualized them all swirling around the wick, touching it, causing friction. I kind of felt the candle heat up, and then I got this sort of <span style="font-style: italic">click</span> feeling and it lit. I timed it with a stopwatch and it only took about 30 sec. I suggest those interested try it.

			I was sitting outside with my friend james the other day smoking cigarettes, and their was an old matchbook in the ashtray...so obviously, i had to try and light it.  
<br />

<br />
I was holding the lighter on and the flame was going, and i decided, &quot;lets see if i can make it bigger&quot;....
<br />

<br />
I pull it away from the matchbook (which was empty, btw) and look at the flame for around 5 seconds when it starts to jump and spark up for maybe 2 seconds, and then dies back down...Pretty sweet.
<br />

<br />
I couldn't duplicate it though.  It was my first attempt at fire manipulation, thus beginners luck.

			a good way to practice <span style="font-style: italic">actual </span> pyro pk (as in the manipulation of fire, not the creation) is to make a small fire, like a camp fire.  let the wood die down into embers, and see if you can flare an ember into a flame.  any flame would be progress, and this is considered pyro pk.  you can also start the fire, and while it is still relatively small, try to augment the flames, or die them down.  i practice this a lot and get great results.

			that would still be regular PK, or psychokinesis.  you are exciting the atoms inside the object (in this case a flamable substance) in order for it to combust.  you are moving an object (although minutly, vibrating) which is still psychokinesis.  pyro PK is moving, increasing, manipulating <span style="font-style: italic">existing</span> fire, or an ember of some sort (like a cigarrette cherry, or a hot coal, ect...) and <span style="text-decoration: underline">that's it.</span>
