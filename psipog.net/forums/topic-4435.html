			Time doesn't exist, as far as I know.
<br />

<br />
The idea that we're stuck in the &quot;now&quot; is an illusion, as well as past and future. It's all simultanious.
<br />

<br />
You could say time is the sixth sense, actually, because it doesn't exist outside of perspective. Correct me if I'm wrong.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
So, if you were going to &quot;travel&quot; through time, you wouldn't really be travelling, only changing your perspective. And you don't need a psiball for that.
<br />

<br />
This is all in theory, of course.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			We already can travel through time.  Look up remote viewing.  Some people who have out of body experiences claim they can visit different times as well, though I haven't been able to personally confirm that.  A lot of people have precognitive dreams, which would be some other form of time travel.
<br />

<br />
My point being: maybe there are a lot easier ways to accomplish whatever it is you're trying to do.  Why do you want to travel through time?  What is your ultimate goal?  Or do you just want to do it for the &quot;cool&quot;-factor?

			to see into the future is to see whats going to happen next so every one can see into the future like if you see yourself doing something like me going to fix some thing to eat and then i do it that would be sorta looking into the future because i saw myself doing it and then not in that point in time it happend and uhhhhhhhh sorry if that sounds confusing its kinda hard to explain <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" />

			I got the gist of what you were saying... Grammar really helps.. but if you visualize yourself doing something then you do that exact thing 5 seconds later, is that considered precog? O_O

			Time really is nothing but an enigma, travel of it is just a cornicopia of many thoughts. Though somethings are best left untouched or rather unaltered, Peebrain is right, we do have the ability to peer into the future, observing, this already proves time isnt a straight line but a circle. Although to physically time travel your corporeal being, not incorporeal sight would take a wormhole or some regard like that to rip time-space, this would require atleast the energy of a giant sun (Remember, by comparison our sun is small) compressed into a very small area.
<br />

<br />
In short, dont expect to ever pull it off. Also to tamper with time is dangerous, to do so may well unravel time-space, it may just ruin the dimension, for as they say alternate dimensions exist, an infinite amount. Who knows? I dont, but I'd rather not go testing with such a dire thing, for some things are better left untouched by man.

			Gah!
<br />
This is the same as teleportation only out of this time! 
<br />
Time travel would be harder considering no one can even teleport in this time!
<br />
At our current skills, no
<br />
Maybe if we had a few lifetimes tho
