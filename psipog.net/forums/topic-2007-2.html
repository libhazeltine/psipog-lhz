			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
Alright, this week practice program is over. I will post more remote viewing practice targets next week. Here is your feedback.
<br />

<br />
1147-1539 - <a href="../images/img150.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/images/img150.jpg</a>
<br />

<br />
2315-6759 -  <a href="images/img334.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/images/img334.jpg</a> 
<br />

<br />
While reading through everyone?s results, I've noticed that you guys either have the wrong impression on what remote viewing really is or your simply guessing. Let me give you guys some tips that will lead to better accuracy next time you remote view.
<br />

<br />
Analytical Overlay is your brain guessing what the target is based on the raw data that is flowing in. For example: Let's say your remote viewing a target, you start to begin. The raw data starts to flow into yourself: Red, orange, black, oval shaped. Then your brain decides to fill in the missing part (What the target is) and based on the data coming in, the brain will guess. The brain goes &quot;It's the sun!&quot;, when the target is really a basketball laying on a hot city street.
<br />

<br />
If you decided to follow your AOL's then you are taking the chance of following a guess. Please note that I said &quot;chance&quot;. Not all AOls are wrong however, you should not follow them. 
<br />

<br />
Remote viewers are trained to use adjectives when describing a target. Descriptive words should be used when dealing with remote viewing, not nouns. Please try to remember that.
<br />

<br />
Please visit the following links:

<br />

<br />
Remote viewing is a skill. Anyone can learn remote viewing and you will get better at it the more you practice. There's a saying &quot;The best remote viewers are the ones who remote view the most&quot;. Keep up your practice and I'll see you all at the next weekly practice program. 
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />

			aww... the only thing i saw that was even close to right was the second one. I saw the smoke stacks and thought ladder. So i guess the whole point is to be vague until your absolutly sure of your answer? How does one filter out AOL with the others?

			ok- I've attempted remote viewing only once before but I'm going to give it a go too. 
<br />

<br />
(  
<br />
      )     &lt;~~ I saw a shape like that at first, and a stem and I'm guessing a balloon for 1147-1539
<br />

<br />
For the second, I saw a brighter object like light was coming through it.. square.. A window?  The second time I tried it I got a cross shape
