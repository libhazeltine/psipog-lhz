			First of all, I would like all of you to know, that I am a total noob to Telekinesis and I have practiced it only for about 5 days.
<br />
I have conducted some experiments with a psi wheel. The results I have summarised are:
<br />

<br />
1) Meditation helps to achieve higher success rate.
<br />
2) Using Bran Wave Generator (google it) before TK-ing, helps a little to adjust subconcious too.
<br />
3) Range doesnt matter much. I have moved my psi wheel from the other end of room.
<br />
4) Keeping your hand near the movable object like shown on the various videos people have posted here, is utterly pointless and maybe just adds a little of &quot;Amerikan&quot; movie effect. I have done it with my hands tied behind my back.
<br />
5) Size matters moderately. After 3 days of practice I can move 10x10 tinfoil wheels, when I began I could move only 3x3 wheels. Now I can move 3x3 paper wheels.
<br />
6) The weight is probably the most important. Weight matters a lot. Two same size psiwheels, one of tinfoil and other from paper, the second one is definetly more difficult to move.
<br />

<br />
Adding all that together:
<br />

<br />
Start small, end big.

			Also, sometimes, when I concentrate as hard as possible to my psi-wheel, it doesnt move at all. Maybe little twiggles. When I look some other object near it, like another psi-wheel, the other one previously looked starts moving more considerably.

			well said, i've been trying to use TK with my hands.. gah, screw that.
<br />
Very well said XD i'll just focus on what you said for now.  However I think there should be a way to trick your subconcious that &quot;this book is light as a feather&quot;, if ya think hard enough about the fact that it's light but never actually holding it and feeling the weight, maybe you'll trick the subconcious? 
<br />
Idea number 2 about weight: Have someone push down your arms as you pick up the book. Close your eyes, and try to convince yourself that your friend is pushing your arms down, and the book is totally weightless.  Do it enough, that might be another idea XD

			Yeah usuing hands is infact not needed.  Using my hand helps me cause my brains to used to using my hands to move things the mundane way, but i've broken that and found I have more control when not using  hands.  The only problem is that i have less power.  I think my hands were acting as a constant focus.  I can only focus for SO long before my eyes get all wierd and i have to shake my head or somthing. lol  idk  But not using hands is definetly helpful, but so is using hands.

			As of right now, i'm trying to get a psi wheel to work. I have the brainWave gen on deep meditation. At one point it fealt as if i had tunnel vision.. i concentrated so hard that everything around it started to naturally turn white, nonexistant, and the only thing left in the world was the psi wheel and me... but no luck yet.

			I'm sure you are already quite capable and I'm really a newbie lucidess... but, the way I did it was that for a while I tried with no luck to move the psiwheel using visualisation, going into the object etc. Then I thought, no one knows what actually makes PK work, only that your sub-c can do it, right? So i chilled a little bit and asked my sub-c to give whatever method it wanted to a little go, to see if it could figure it out, because only it knew what it was doing really, and after a couple minutes (and plenty of blinking) I saw the thing start to move, even though I was doing, literally here, nothing. It was so strange, because the only time it worked was when I wasn't even telling my sub-c what to do, or even being active or to me it felt i wasn't even being <span style="font-style: italic">passive</span>... Maybe you see what I'm saying? Godd luck, even if I have been of no use <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			That... actually makes things alot more clearer. Thanks rosella! So far i've been trying to visualize the pinwheel and me as a black color, everything else white, thinking that i am one with the paper, i am the paper.. and nothing would happen at all -.- then again, i've read it takes a long time to actually truly convince your sub-c to get it spinning...

			Great to hear my thought aint so crappy at all. The interesting thing is, that in my first post i forgot to mention that ive constantly tried to trick my mind into thinking the object is weightless, but I guess it soent matter anymore <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Anyways. I have tried may ways to &quot;trick&quot; or &quot;help&quot; my mind to move the psi-wheel.
<br />

<br />
Im too noob to move a pencil yet, but i bet i can do that in about a month.
<br />

<br />
Oh, and... mood doesnt matter much... I have done it in pure hatred. Usually people say U need to be happy. (no?)
<br />

<br />
Dont visualize. Ive tried visualizing a gust of wind circling the wheel. Instead concentrating on the psiwheel ITSELF, you concentrate creating a whind around it, which is a distraction.
<br />

<br />
BUT
<br />

<br />
If you can make good psi-balls, you can prgogram a psi ball which makes a psi-wheel going round in itself, when placed around a psi-wheel. logical, no? <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
ive treid it, but im not good at makin psi balls.
<br />

<br />
Anyways. Mind is our only obstacle <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			rosella, good point. Mostly i dont force my sub-c to move it. I rather say: so, old pal, shal we trie to move it. or: &quot;I bet you cant move it.&quot; It walways gets a psi wheel moving.
<br />

<br />
DONT think. AT ALL. Like, my psi-wheel doesnt go much in rounds, but it twiggles alot. Even when I cover my nose with a piece of carboard sheet.

			Weight, in my opinion and experience, doesn't matter.  I can slide a Trash Bin but not spin a pin wheel. In all actuallity, I have difficulty in sliding, rolling, spinning, anything really flat.

			actually a bigger psiwheel is easier to alot of people because it is easier to target and there is still a very little amount of friction (barely anymore friction then a smaller psiwheel)
<br />

<br />
just thought i would say that you should proboaly try to start bigger on a psiwheel then move smaller....plus if you start small and go bigger you are in a way setting a barrier of what you can move because you are telling your sub-c that the bigger it is the harder it is to move
<br />

<br />
just my opinoin

			i was kinda thinking that too. I made a slightly larger psi wheel yesterday, and i had better results. I think you're saying that it's easier to push a large object because you don't need to direct your focus into one small place.  TK doesn't work for me so well most of the time, so i visualize strings to pull it around.
