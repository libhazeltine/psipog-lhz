			Whenever I try to have an OBE, I'll be lying on my back with my arms and legs spread out. Lately it <span style="font-style: italic">seems</span> as thought I'm getting closer to an OBE, but once I'm at that point, it will feel like my arms are rising up off the bed. However, it's not what I'm going for; my physical arms are actually rising up off the bed. I'm not trying to use do this, but it keeps happening whenever I get to that point. Does anyone know what's going on, or a way to stop this?
<br />

<br />
I've never had an OBE before, so I have no references to figure much of this out by myself.

			don't try and stop it, just allow whatever happens to happen, and try, as much as possible, not to concentrate on anything (visual, physical) that happens. They are all barriers, set up by your conscious to prevent you from OBE'n/Astral.
<br />

<br />
 Go along with all the feeling/vision, since they cannot harm you, and once you accept, poof, your free.

			You aren't physically relaxed enough.
<br />

<br />
You need to be very physically relaxed to OBE. Essentially, your body needs to be asleep. Next time you attempt an OBE, work your way from your toes to your head and <span style="font-style: italic">feel</span> each individiual muscle and joint relax; <span style="font-style: italic">feel</span> the tension leave each one. Take as long as you need.
<br />

<br />
Ideally, you'll get the arms-rising sensation without the arms rising.
<br />

<br />
Don't worry; it's happened to me too.
