			Good day!
<br />

<br />
Today, while doing research on the internet, i read something about a german scientist called Wilhelm Reich. 
<br />
Well, this guy is a considered scientist, and he has actually worked with albert einstein. I'd like to tell you some parts of his history, so that you don't have to read all on your own (if you like to do so anways, check out wikipedia.com).
<br />

<br />
Ok, Reich was a psychiatrist/psychoanalist and in the 1930s, Reich said he had discovered a physical energy, which he called &quot;orgone,&quot; and which he said was contained in the atmosphere and in all living matter. (Sound's familiar, eh?). 
<br />
He then published some books, beeing more specific about the  subject, than i am at the moment. He then created devices to &quot;catch&quot; that energy. Later on, the FBI had become curious about his books, and they decided to burn! them. Unfortunately Reich got inprisonated and died (under questionable circumstances) one year after that.
<br />

<br />
Well, after this i got over a &quot;method&quot;, which pretty much reminds me of telekinesis. According to this method, you can -absorb- the orgone/psi/whatever-energy of clouds!. And the good thing is, it WORKS! 
<br />

<br />
I just tried it and i think it's amazing. You just have take a cloud (start with a small one) and try to feel the cloud. Then visualize (with open eyes) how  the cloud vanishes...and after some time you will become aware that it actually disappears, while the other clouds don't...Works best with blue sky in the background... 
<br />
Sooo, have fun, go out and experiment with it! it's definately fun!
<br />

			I've actualy known about the cloud diminishing since I've been like 10. I knew about it before I knew about psi. Only thing I have to say to your post is that I have no idea what it's connections to PK are... And you weren't really clear about it.

			Are you sure you absorbed energy from the cloud, and you weren't just &quot;cloud-busting&quot;? because that's a really common PK game. It's REALLY fun!!! Because it's relaxing, as well as PK practice, I strongly reccomend cloud-busting to anyone who wants to start on PK, because it's just doing PK on water vapour, which is even easier to control than a Psi-wheel.

Wait, so visualizing busting the clouds in the sky really works eh? I never thought of doing that O_O;; i'm so doing that tomorrow.. if skies are ok. I should like.. move the clouds out of the way if it's a cloudy day.

			I remember reading about Reich and his orgone catching machine in a book on dowsing.  I think it scared people because it really worked, if I remember correctly.  Then again, my memory can be a bit fuzzy at times.  But I used to stare at the clouds and think I was making them move and stuff, like growing or breaking up in certain places to look like something I wanted them to look like, is that the same thing as cloud-busting or was I just daydreaming? hehehe

cause this fucking shit humanity is FUCKING RETARDED AND STUPID!!!!!!!! JUST BECAUSE OF IT!!!!! &quot;WE AEW RACIONAL ANIMALS&quot; FUCK ALL THIS!!!!!!
<br />

<br />
i've read an article this days, about books being distryed by humanity. and TONS were distroyed along history. by church, governments, hitler, getulio vargas, anyway, dictatorsm, feminists, romans (alexandria library, anywone???), manuscripts and stone tablets with stuff writen on it, from egypt, greece and so one, all destroyed due to human stupidity. &quot;oh it's profane&quot; &quot;oh it's sacrilegious&quot; &quot;oh it's against good habits and descent people, or it's witchcraft&quot;
<br />
oh, recent facts: bagda's library was destroyed i think, parcially or totally, and sacked. nothing in there anymore. a guy from there said: we got no history anymore. THATS WHY I LOVE USA!!!!!!!!
<br />

<br />
several groups alredy have manifested interess in destroying the american's congress library (i traducted the name word by word but you guys might know what it is) 
<br />
nice isn't it? a bibliowar!!!!
<br />
for real, humans aren't the most intelligent beings... really...

I used to frequent this site alot.  You mentioned Orgone and it sparked my memory.  You can buy one of those Orgone-capturing devices there.

			Hey that one rant about stupid humans reminded me of something in social studies. It was just a little fictional blurb about a martian astronomer watching earth blow up, and he was like &quot;the fact that they were able to do it means that highly intelligent beings must have been there&quot;. so yeah..
<br />

<br />
Ok well I'm not sure how valid that orgone thing is, but i guess if a machine can capture it, there has to be something. that also reminds me about this one guy who was supposed to be able to get a machine to like to telekinesis or something... someone help me out here...

<br />
Indeed, it's not right to burn books. But it seems like that the FBI certainly had their reasons to do so. 
<br />
Knowledge can be dangrous and maybe this knowledge was inside those books(A simple formula like E=M*C? shows us that). 
<br />
The Question is: Are we to know these facts, which are slightly beyond our current scientific understandings and is scientifical proof evidence for those facts?. I think we -DO- have the right to know them, we almost have to experience them to understand them . 
<br />
The importance is -HOW- we use them.  For example manipulating clouds could be used as a strategical advantage in a war. Imagine enemy troops struggling through a sand/snow storm... This would be a bad example of using this knowledge, and could be a reason for the FBI &quot;burning&quot; them, as an &quot;ace in a sleeve&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Well, any thoughts?
<br />

			interesting note...
<br />

<br />
but as much as i understand, it says that reich has -already- been investigated. There is no mention of his second investigation, just that some FDA agency believes he was peddling a quack cancer cure... What are you trying to say then?
