			Short-Term Precognitive and Control
<br />

<br />
What is precognition?
<br />

<br />
This is the ability to see an event before it occurs. Nearly everybody has had precognitions, whether it be short term or long term. Let me explain this further
<br />

<br />
Long Term: This is the most common form of precognition. The majority of the time this will happen in a dream. You will have seen a small clip of what will happen, then months later seeing the event itself happen triggers this memory. Usually we don?t know that this is a precognition, and just ignore it, classing it as a strange dream at the time.
<br />

<br />
Short Term: This is a less common version that long term. This allows you to see an event prior to it, whether it is minutes before, or up to a day before.
<br />

<br />
Now this may sound strange, but this is my philosophy on precognitive acts:
<br />

<br />
I think that destiny is 100% real, things happen for a reason. To me, time is just an infinite line. Precognition allows us not to see ahead of ourselves at our current point on the line.
<br />

<br />
I think that it is a gift that should not be misused. If you mess with time, you could create a paradox ? BUT here?s a thought, why do we get precognitions? Is there a purpose? Are we supposed to alter that event in order to realign destiny? Anyways, you?re probably getting bored now so I?ll move on:
<br />

<br />
In this article we will cover:
<br />

<br />
-	Opening the third eye and reconstructing/ reprogramming it
<br />
-	Charging the third eye and utilising it
<br />
-	Basic precognitive practices/training
<br />

<br />
 Right, well just a few more notes before we start: the third eye, yes it is a chakra gathering, but I think of it as a psionic tool. I have discovered it has many uses which have helped me/ entertained me for a few minutes.
<br />

<br />
Also I only know one other person who has managed to successfully control short-term precognition (he has his own way). This article is aimed at people who have experienced precognition before.
<br />

<br />
Opening the third eye
<br />

<br />
So, third eye, ey? Sounds daft doesn?t it?
<br />
Anyways, I want you to place your index fingers on your forehead. Now I want you to visualize an eye opening up, and moving exactly as your normal eyes do. Now open your eyes, and blink with all 3 eyes. Keep doing this until you feel a slight pressure on that spot. Now I want you to move your eyes left, all 3 of them. Now right, now left etc
<br />

<br />
Right, if this all works well, you should have opened this eye. I want you to now try and shift focus, so as opposed to looking through 2 eyes, you are looking through 3. you can do this by closing your eyes, and keep telling yourself that when you open your eyes you will be looking through all three. Whilst reciting this try and feel your vision shift upwards, as if you are actually looking through 3 eyes.
<br />

<br />
Well so far so good. Lets move on
<br />

<br />
Eye Surgery, reconstruction and reprogramming
<br />

<br />
Now your third eye is set to default. The reason I say this is because I have found that, much like a construct, you can alter your eyes? settings. At the moment, you may be able to detect psi a lot easier, or even see auras (the eye has like a billion uses so im not going to go into all of them).
<br />

<br />
Once you have got the hang of opening the third eye you can move onto changing its function. When opening the third eye, have the intent for it not to see ahead of you, but ahead of time, you can do this by reciting it, or just visualizing everything moving as if in fast forward mode.
<br />

<br />
Doing this allows you to tap into your precognitive abilities. Not seeing ahead of time yet, but merely awakening the ability to do so in a conscious state. After doing this, you should start charging it.
<br />

<br />
Charging Your New Eye
<br />

<br />
Right, so we?ve managed to open and reconfigure the third eye. Now in order to prepare for the precognitive experience, we need to send some energy this way. I found that the more energy you put in the eye, the easier it is to see ?ahead?.
<br />

<br />
In order to do this, like collecting psi in your hands, you have to collect it on your forehead, specifically to power the precognitive eye. 
<br />

<br />
Lets Try PRECOG!
<br />

<br />
so far, we have done rather well. This is a lot to take in, but once you have done everything above, you are ready to undergo your first controlled experience:
<br />

<br />
The clock exercise:
<br />

<br />
This is a technique that allows you to start feeling a precognition. This is a very basic method, but in the future, depending on the helpfulness of this article, I will put up more advanced training methods, which allow you to actually literally be in the future.
<br />

<br />
Right, what you need is a manual clock, some paper and a pen. Now I want you to charge the precognitive third eye, and when you feel you are ready, you can proceed:
<br />

<br />
I want you to make physical contact with the clock, I want you to merge with it. Like when doing PK, you have to ?become one?. It is similar to this.
<br />

<br />
Keep your intent to see ahead of time, close your eyes and go into a meditative state . now wait, and you should see a flurry of times. You should see the clocks hand positions in various different places. 
<br />

<br />
Record these times down, as from what I have found, one of them will be significant to your day.
<br />

<br />
Usually it?s the first time that pops into your head. The rest can be your imagination. Like with telepathy, you have to learn how to distinguish between the two, which is what this exercise is for.
<br />

<br />
I recommend doing this in the morning, as you have the whole day ahead of you.
<br />

<br />
The initial idea is that by performing this technique on a daily basis, you learn to tell the difference between your imagination and reality.
<br />

<br />
Final Words
<br />

<br />
Well this article has hopefully benefited you!
<br />
Depending in the response I get from it, I will post up more advanced techniques and exercises, like retro-cognition, precognition on inanimate objects, and true precognition.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for sparing your time to read this; I really do hope that this works for everyone!
<br />

<br />
- Peace out, Joe (a.k.a. Genjo)

			Very nice tutorial. I'm interested to see what kind of results I can get.

EDIT: Blinking with the third eye feels quite odd. Odd in that it feels like blinking a real eye. Never thought it would be so tactile.
