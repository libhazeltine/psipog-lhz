			Technology today can exploit this quantum energy, Right now our machines can only take so much energy. 
<br />
1 cubic centimeter of space can power the entire planet for a day, that is how far this is, so everything is made of energy but everything is simply what it is, it is nothing more and no different from what you would choose.
<br />
This new technology is having a hard time getting around, basically alot of people dont want this Final science to begin.
<br />
Telekinesis, As much as you want you can take, the atomic chart of elements tells you exactly the amount of raw energy you need to make a element, in only your perception ofcourse. You can take endless amounts of energy from space and even matter. This is Happening all the time though, What makes everything so big and not all quantum?
<br />
Life to sense that it is there. The universe is exspanding?
<br />
Well energy has to go somewhere when it isn't being used.
<br />
This is one skill, it takes atleast a broken infinity to see me.

			It takes PK to take energy from quantum the quantum level, if you decide.
<br />
the quantum level is everywhere, its everything.
<br />
basically anything you want you can have, with this technique.
<br />
But only If PK is real because Quantum field of study is.

			Bleh, science. Stupid terms. But then this energy could also be anything like TP, remote viewing, etc.
<br />
this should be in the modern sciences forum -.-
<br />

<br />
furthermore I think the absolute zero temperature cannot be reached by any means possible, as well as the speed of light, the opposite of absolute zero..

Funny how zero doesn't actually equal zero. Seems like they could only show ZPE on a micro micro scale, but they say it's real just because of that tiny amount of energy. I'll keep an open mind for this, but I still think it's a dumb thought that we can get energy out of nothing.
<br />

<br />
Second off, no one know whats really real or fake, <span style="font-weight: bold">no one</span>.

Something like this comes up in the theory of relativity:
<br />
maybe some of you have heard about the formula E = (m*c?)/2
<br />
In my physics book there was the question &quot;What does 1kg electric energy cost?&quot;
<br />
Answer was: &quot;1kg Energy = 25*10^9 kWh, so it costs about 2000000000 Euro&quot; <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
Or the question &quot;how much mass does the magnetic field or earth add to earth's mass?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Quite interesting stuff

			call me crazy, but this guy is starting to sound a lot like the &quot;Avius_Krilaventus&quot; guy who recently was banned.  no offense to the thread starter or anything.  
<br />

<br />
EDIT:  it's also quite coincidental that the first part of his name, &quot;Aventus&quot; is also the last part of avius's name &quot;kril<span style="font-style: italic">aventus</span>&quot;, he also gives off the same vibe...

			The &quot;vibe&quot; I get is that he is spouting off crazy babble that tries to sound like a riddle.  Yet I'd guess he couldn't pull a riddle out of an ass-shaped pinata using a hammer, chisel and a map.
<br />

<br />
I understand the basic principle on what your sort of trying to almost say.  But please back it up with something and then relate it to your experience on how something small like this happened or your technique...or SOMETHING.  I don't expect much really...only that when you try to convince me of something present it in a logical manner.

			He writes the same way and has a similar name, and most of his posts have a scientific (and religious) undertone.

Its the same guy.  I just can't ban him.  He should be a poet though. Get himself some bongos and go to a coffee shop with the funny hat and sunglasses, perhaps grow a goatee.

Locked for psychotic rambling about quantum physics that the O.P. probably doesn't understand anyway.
