			kk my friend came up with this theory on psionics and we wanted some more scientific input on it. thanks in advance for your ideas or opinions.
<br />

<br />
i think energy and psi are 2 totally different things 
<br />
energy depends on psi but psi depends not on energy
<br />
energy does make it easier but you can generate the same amount of psi
<br />
in my case that is very little
<br />
also psi i believe replenishes itself 
<br />
energy requires sleep
<br />
energy is a dependent source
<br />
i can generate the same amount of psi wheter its when i wake up or 2:00 in the morning
<br />
 
<br />
i was thinking many people say that you only die when your psi is depleted (explaining why some people die for no reason) so if you could harbor some of someone elses psi could you save their life
<br />
well see you could hold their younger more reproductive psi and put it in them when they are on their death bed
<br />
 
<br />
also could you attach your psi to something and send it carrying your psi with it 
<br />
and could you perform psi transfusions
<br />
 
<br />
 
<br />
i was also thinking if your psi was somewhere else...could you focus your body to instantaneously go to it like teleportation almost
<br />
i mean your body teleporting to your misplaced psi
<br />

sword creating as well

			By &quot;psi&quot; -- you mean, animate energy.
<br />

<br />
Both animate matter and animate energy must first be inanimate, then processed by the animate.

But then this would make that person weaker, why not just draw psi from the surroundings, i.e trees, or the ground, or even the sky. You wouldnt want to steal someone elses psi and make them weak.

			The way I see psi, it's a word to sum up &quot;this energy we don't know about but we use it anyway&quot;. Our minds control psi, and the more trained the mind, the more psi it can use at once. Psi is all the same to all of us, except we manipulate the energy through our minds to create sensations like, heat, cold, etc. So it's like.. Mind --&gt; psi --&gt; matter.
<br />
As for the death part, I don't think we're supposed to talk about afterlife in anyway right? rules?
