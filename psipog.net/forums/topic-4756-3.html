			I actually think wet dreams are the effect of built-up semen. I called it astral-sex because it was the closest similar term. I don't intend on posting a video like that.

        I was making a reference to American Pie 2, if you watched it I was talking about the guy who banged stiffler's mom. I can't remember his name at the moment though.  Well he said that he could meditate and fuck chicks in his head and after a while you can actually orgasm. After that you could sestain that feeling all throughout meditating like it's one big orgasm.

			I'd feel kinda wierd doing that. If you made your girlfriend climax while she was in a room alone, that'd be pretty embarrassing because of all the noise wouldn't it? I mean coming from the female.

			Ok ok... TruePsion... I want to know... were you having an OBE and traveled to where she was? Or did you just Think of her or RV her then use psi to &quot;stimulate&quot;... If you used OBE did you do what you would have done if you were with her or still just used psi to stimulate the feelings? alsoo was she trying to OBE/dream or was she awake.. .were you also on the ohone.. .Ect...
<br />

<br />
I was woundering this actualy after seeing something but i was admitingly afraid to post my question because I didnt want to be called a perve ect. for wanting to further how close me and my GF are especialy since shes on the other side of the country at the moment also...
<br />

<br />
So if you answer all my questions I will give you a name of the person that gave me the idea to use psi for orgasim... but he was japenese and didnt call it psi, i dont think he even called it Ki.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: If ya wanna PM me to say what ya did more clearly withought &quot;dirtying the forum&quot; go ahead if ya need
