flash presentation of 10 dimensions
<br />
interesting to watch, since we don't know 
<br />
exactly what the physicist are thinking
<br />
when they say 10 dimensions.
<br />
Sure gets you thinking higher dimensions
<br />
should have possibilities for psionics.

			Before this gets out of hand:
<br />

<br />
They can only <span style="font-style: italic">prove</span> five dimensions. Everything else is speculation and unfounded pseudo-science. Furthermore, the fifth dimension mentioned in the flash is not the fifth that is accepted - rather, the generally accepted fifth dimension is that which would be influenced by relativistic physics.
<br />

<br />
Basically, a dimension is something that would be required to describe the location of something - simple as that. I can describe a 2-dimensional object with two variables, a 3-d object with 3, etc. The fourth dimension is, of course, time.
<br />

<br />
You could speculate on as many dimensions as you want, but you can't prove any of them. Thus, claiming them as fact is nothing more than pseudo-science. The most you could possibly do is claim a few more dimensions based upon quantum mechanics, but we don't know enough about quantum behavior to do that yet.
<br />

<br />

<br />

(Note: if I seem a bit indignant, its probably because I'm rather drunk. By &quot;rather&quot;, I mean a lot. My apologies, but this needed to be said.)

			Yeah, I just watched it again. The borderlines between dimensions are completely arbitrary, could be restated in any number of ways, and are utterly repetitive (in other words, you could repeat the process of 1-through-10 an infinite number of times). This is... eh. Not the best dimensional analysis I've seen.
<br />

<br />

<br />
No offense to the creator of this, but it's nothing more than pseudo-science. Only Mathematics can currently use things higher than the 5th dimension, and it doesn't name its dimensions anyway - it merely treats it as a different quantifiable variable required to describe a point. Completely abstract.
<br />

People want to know about string theory well, thats what it presents, it doesnt get into the mathematics. If you watch dimension 10, he says you can't get anymore, anyway I'm sure he knows its abstract (theoretical), can u prove theres other universes? no, you can't prove it but its a theory anyway (alot of scientists believe string theory, so be educated). <span style="color: orange">Anyway, my thought was basically a dimension above moving something in 3 dimensions, appears so &quot;psionic-like&quot;, doesnt anyone think so?</span> 
<br />
My point of discussion wasn't how many dimensions, just higher dimensions (period). It shares a good imagination. I still wonder if time is a dimension, even though I know it exists, not necessarily a dimension, but it is a worthy condidate. He states timelines can break off into other timelines, but backward time travel isn't possible(at least for humans) it breaks the laws of physics as we know it to go back in time, which is a requirement of a dimension (2 degrees of freedom, btw under that logic dimension 10 makes no sense anyway). So anyway let me state I <span style="color: red"><span style="text-decoration: underline">don't believe </span></span>in string theory. I thought it is a good imagination the way its presented, since so many scientists talk about &quot;string theory&quot; its good to be educated about it, hope some people appreciate it.  String theory is still debated alot, keep that in mind everybody. Its always good to think outside the box (box has 3 dimensions, <span style="font-style: italic">haha</span> <span style="font-style: italic">get it? get it?</span> <span style="font-style: italic">eh? eh?</span> &lt;=corny joke)
<br />

<br />
I've actually never heard of <span style="color: red"><span style="text-decoration: underline">proof</span></span> for any higher dimensions period.<span style="font-style: italic"></span> I wasn't expecting anybody to believe it as absolute fact, just expand your imagination.
<br />
Just like if you moved a penny in the flatlanders world, from a 3rd dimension it would look like PK to the flatlander. 
<br />
(thats basically my viewpoint of it all, something could be higher dimensional like our minds, man its all theoretical anyway)

			That was a cool video.  Neat way of looking at things.

It seems a little obvious to state that it isn't proven.  Of course it isn't proven... it's just something cool to think about.

don't be a nitwit. you can't &quot;head into&quot; a dimension, it's a spatial measurement.

From what I read, tesseracts and hypercubes are two different things. A tesseract would be the 'shadow' of a four dimensional object. But it might be an unraveled hypercube. I'm getting lazy with my facts. My information comes from [i]Hyperspace[/i] by someone.
