<br />

<br />
In the past, we have tried to organize a way for translators to work together and translate articles or sections of PsiPog.net into different languages.  Usually this was attempted through e-mail, but it was really hard to keep it all organized and together.  Oneta offered to take over the project, and I'm glad to have him work on it <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
To avoid the problems in the past, we decided to create a seperate forum that anyone could view - but only active translators could post in.  They could post their work, and have other translators analyze how well they did, and hopefully come to an agreement on how one particular article should be translated.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Purpose of this Project</span>
<br />

<br />
The purpose of the Translation Project is to translate the relevant sections of PsiPog.net into foreign languages accurately.  Basically, that means the articles, but also other areas on PsiPog.net that make sense.
<br />

<br />
To achieve an accurate translation, it is better to have multiple people work on one article for a given language.  They can compare different word choices, and hopefully come to an agreement on the best way to represent the article in the foreign language.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Role of the Project Leader</span>
<br />

<br />
Oneta has decided to be the leader of this massive project.  His responsibilities are:
<br />

<br />
1. To be a contact point for people who want to join the project, and decide whether they will serve the purpose of the project or not.
<br />

<br />
2. Contacting the original authors if a dispute arrises about the original intent of the article.
<br />

<br />
3. Keep the final products organized and prepare them for submission on PsiPog.net.
<br />

<br />
4. Keep the translators happy and make sure everyone stays focused on accomplishing the purpose of this project.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">How can I join?</span>
<br />

<br />
The first step is to contact Oneta through a PM on the forums.  When contacting him, please include the languages you intend on offering, and what your experiences are with those languages.  I.e., how fluent are you?  What is your first language?  How did you learn your additional languages (college, lifestyle, etc)?  To message Oneta, <a href="forums/privmsg.php?mode=post&amp;u=13" target="_blank" class="postlink">click here</a>.  Please be aware: by joining, you are giving PsiPog.net the copyright to the results of your work as they relate to this project.  I.e., you can't translate and participate in this project for a few months, quit, and demand that we delete all your submissions.  Once you submit information in this specific forum (&quot;Translation Project&quot;), or to Oneta, it becomes property of PsiPog.net.
<br />

<br />
If you have any questions, please direct them to Oneta.  If he can't answer them, then you can ask me.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">What languages are needed?</span>
<br />

<br />
The top seven languages needed, in order of popularity, are:
<br />

<br />
Dutch (nl), Polish (pl), German (de), Swedish (sv), Spanish (es), French (fr), and Portuguese (Brazil, pt-br).
<br />

<br />
Others are welcome, but I would prefer to focus on these seven first.
<br />

<br />
Thanks!
<br />

<br />
