I believe he is referring to another thread where EversoSLEEPY chastised him for his horrible grammar, which is predominantly displayed here.  As far as the rest is concerned, it's just drivel.

Some interesting accusations, there...
<br />

<br />
Sorry, bud, but you need to use proper grammar. One of my biggest pet peeves is AIM-speak, which doesn't resemble any actual language at all. Take five minutes, think about what you want to write, and then read it over once you've written it.
<br />

<br />
And please, don't say that it's a &quot;practice,&quot; or that it's your right to use &quot;u&quot; instead of &quot;you.&quot; It is not a practice. It's lazy. I understand that English may not be your first language. However, you lack capitalization in any form, and there is one period to this massacred blurb of angst.
<br />

<br />
I don't even understand your final accusation about jail and learning telepathy. It's completely beyond me what you're actually attempting to say here.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure I read that thread. Where everyone was telling him to shield?
