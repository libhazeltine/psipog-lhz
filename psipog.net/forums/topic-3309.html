			The psi pets. I am new to construct programming, I used to think it was stupid and served no real purpose, until psi pets came along, so in an analytical formula explain to someone who hate visualization and prefers the tactile method of things, on how to make a psi pet that does as follows:
<br />

<br />
1) Detects when my body heat rises and swirls around me cooling me.
<br />

<br />
2) Draws energy from ANY possible source available, even if it does affect other people in order to keep itself alive.
<br />

<br />
3) When I am low on psi it should feed me, the energy for the 'feeding' will come from #2.
<br />

<br />
4) When it is inactive it should rest where my heart is.
<br />

<br />
5) When a strong physical force comes near me like a punch, it should put all of it's energy and mine into hardening itself and shielding me from the attack, so basically the punch will hit it and not me (yeah I know I'm mean).
<br />

<br />
6) It should come into my palms when I call it's name (It's name is &quot;Elkin&quot;), the reason for this feature it so that I can feed it if it can't find a good energy source nearby.
<br />

<br />
7) It should give a strong &quot;pushing&quot; force directly to any energy force (yes even humans) that come near me so that they may feel my power, not to hurt though, just to alert that I am there, so a person who doesn't know me can walk by and feel it, then get scared and walk away, no this isn't for comat, it's for intimidation purposes (Yeah I know I'm cheap).

All you have to do is speak to it. Mentally or verbally, whichever suits you. And it would be better to shell it after you program it, so the the programming can be easily sent to the construct.

			I would try more simple constructs to start with.  I have found that if I put too much programming into a construct it tends to turn to crap.
<br />

<br />
Simple constructs can be very rewarding in their nature, you just need to be a bit creative.
<br />

<br />
Try making a pinging construct that you can set places so if people walk through it, it sends you a ping.  These are great for testing or for security IMO.  Try adding elements of PK or light to a construct.
<br />

<br />
Constructs can do literally anything you could do without them, but they keep it in a nice programmed package so that you don't have to use your brain at everytime of the day to maintain it.  The only downside is that it requires skill in programming.  Which IMO is not too hard to gain as long as you work at it and make it a goal.

			Make a pet for each of those things then after you perfect them all start adding them together in to a new construct. Just work your way up
