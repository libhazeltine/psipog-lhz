			I haven't answered to the Poll yet because it's somewhat inbetween with me. I told my mom, because my parents are divorced. She doesn't like it, but she knows that she can't make me stop. She says it's evil and I don't know I'm getting myself into. But then again, baseball's the same way. And Math. And Mountain Dew.

			If I announced it, my dad and sister would love me for it (having had experiences with psi themselves).  My mum would be skeptical, and would probably say I was imagining stuff, but she'd let me get on with it.

I think I'll tell my dad when I get some good results with PK, that'll surprise him!

			When I first started seeing auras about a year ago, I told my friends and they thought I was crazy.  I started to think I <span style="font-style: italic">was</span> crazy!  I stopped seeing them without a lot of concentration <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />, but recently I've been practicing, and now I can see them really clearly most of the time.  So, practice, and believe, and your ability will soon return.

			My younger brother actually told my parents, he was trying to &quot;tell&quot; on me for going against my church. Then I explained to me parents what it was really about. As long I don't actually do anything that defies their Christian beliefs (and mine) they don't really care.
<br />

<br />
Interestingly enough, if I had started practicing sooner, and my parents had found out, they probably would have put consecrated oil on my head and put a blessing on me. Fortunately, my parents started to become way more open minded shortly before they found out. 
<br />

<br />
My (other) younger brother is pretty interested, and asked me to show him the basics. My first younger brother still thinks I'm crazy (and maybe a little evil, which is fun  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> ) and my oldest brother has the same veiw as my parents (as far as I know).
<br />

<br />
Another interesting note is that my first younger brother, used to believe in all this stuff, but at some point just changed his mind. It's like he and my parents switched places, when they opened their minds, he closed his.

			I've told my mom about PK, but not about any else like EM. I showed her the covered psiwheel and she was pretty cool with it and even seemed interested. She was all like, &quot;How are you doing that?!&quot; After a while she just forgot about it. I haven't told he about anything else because I'm just too lazy.

			Well when i first started i told them and they were like cool... What ever.. Then i stoped for a bit then started again and they still rolled there eyes so i dont like to talk about it alot. And Apollos story is pretty sad. Thats why i think religon is stupid. And Apollo i would try talking to your parents. Like making them listen..Do not take no for an answer. Tell them exactly how and why you can do this.  When i can really show proof of Psionics i will show them.
