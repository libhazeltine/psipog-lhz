Haha. yeah. i'll drop a geltab and spend the rest of my time in a loony bin. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />
<br />
I know drug related talk is frowned upon here. so here:
<br />
<span style="color: white"> but from what i've read people can have very spiritual trips on Salvia divinorum (within the right settings), Psylocib (sp?) mushrooms and cannabis. Don't think i'm gonna be running around doing coke and crystal meth here, i'm a responsible person. i know how to handle myself.
<br />
venturing into the world of psychoactives is my way of finding myself. i'm sick of people telling me what does something. i'm ready to experience for myself.</span>
<br />
Whether i'm chosing the right path or not is irrelevant. the fact is that I'M the one making the decision.

i plan to be as responsible as i possibly can. and i shan't go actively looking for stuff for the most part. but if the oppertunity comes along i won't refuse. (given the right settings) there'll always be a place in me for psionics. but right now i need a break from it. something different. I'm not gonna be a raving crazy methhead. but i'll be open to experiences. well, more open than i was. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
but, anyway! drugs are bad, don't do drugs, kids. psipog is not the place to discuss it.

			You're not going to have any kind of spiritual trip on cannabis. Research what things have already been done and tested in lab environments. LSD's the most powerful drug in terms of giving you a &quot;spiritual trip&quot;. It's been tested by respectable people ( Lawyers, accountants, businessmen etc.) in controlled doses, and <span style="font-style: italic">with guidance</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> reported to have spiritual journeys. They all were able to remember what it was like to be a bird, animal, tree...even an atom! Tests on their brains during this time showed that they weren't just hallucinating, they were actually <span style="font-style: italic">remembering</span> being these things. They also reported some remembered and experienced some of their past lives. Although, it's been proven possible to achieve these states through meditation <span style="font-weight: bold">alone</span>. If you want specific info about all this just pm me. Also, yes mushrooms and acid will give you hallucinations as well, but all of these are very dangerous to use. I speak from experience  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> . LSD and acid are not to be toyed with. I'd inform you that if you <span style="font-style: italic">have</span> to try them, do it in a controlled situation where you won't get hurt, or make a fool of yourself, and do very small amounts to understand how it will 1st affect you. (You're not garaunteed to have a spiritual journey, you might have the worst nightmare of your life. Seriously) ...Kids don't do drugs..blah..blah..blah

i was talking to my mate who graduated nyu last year and he was telling me how EVERYONE takes psychology and no one ever finds jobs in that feild because its so competative. &quot;They usualy end up doing something else&quot; she said. Thats why i'm going with my backup of quantum physics. My goal is to have my cake and eat it too (a little personal thing no ones would realy get lol)
