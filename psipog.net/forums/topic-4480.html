			Hey,
<br />
I know the answer to this question is probably no, but on the overview of  psi on this site, it says that you can learn pk/tk without learning the basics.  Sine I still want to learn psiballs and psisheilds, I will practice that while practicing the wheel.  Do you think that I will still beable to learn how to spin the wheel or should I make sure to learn the basics first.  Also, along that same note, I am not very good at visualizing or feeling as I am more of an audio kind of person.  What would you suggest to make psi balls, shields since it is very hard for me because reg. visualation and tactile visualation are hard for me.  I try to practice visualation everychance which is why I want to continue to practice it as I learn the psi wheel.
<br />

THanks for the help
<br />

			As far as visualization goes, I would suspect that you could use resonance as a form of... erm... &quot;audioization&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
For example, instead of picturing a waterfall or whatever you choose giving you energy, imagine a large amount of sound coming from somewhere nearby (as if you were in front of a bass speaker at a concert), and just follow through by &quot;hearing&quot; your body resonating with it. Then, direct that resonating sound (something similar to a tuning fork sound) into your palm for a psi-ball.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, no clue if that actually works, just a quick thought on an audio visualization.

			whatever works for you is fine, i started doing psiwheel right off the start, without even trying anything else, surprisingly i could do it in about 1.5 mins <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> but it's different for everyone, so try what you feel you should start out with.

			Alright thanks for all teh help.  Btw, the sound technique of visualizzation sounds awesome and I will try that in the morning when I am not so tired.  I think I will just start with the psi wheel while practicing the psi balls  And yes I have read every article on the site about it and the first 2 pages of the forum on psi balls and constucts.

Thanks again!
