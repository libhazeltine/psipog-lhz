			Hey I've been having these dreams were I'm doing psionics. I wake up and I feel like I've been kicked in the head. I can feel it as though I'm truly doing psionics, I do things like TK and alot of stuff where I refill things that were just dumped away like water. Is it possible I'm actually doing psionics in some sort I mean I do feel the after effect.

			That would be cool... its all contained in your brain... If your subconcious thinks its real (etc, dream is real enough) then concievably maybe, it would induce the after-effects? what you could try is if the dream is lucid, saying out loud 'This dream is not real. I will not have a headache in the morning.' or something... just my 2 cents.

			I tried blasting someone with a blue visible psiball in my dream but a blue hazy smoke came out instead with matching SFX (PUFF)!

			Alphaling, it's all in your head. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

In a lucid dream you can make someone's head explode by the snap of your fingers. You can do ANYTHING in a lucid dream, while LD'ing, the world is at your command. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I've been having a LOT of OBE dreams latley. I feel they are real and in my dream I even get the urge to run over to the forums and post my experience. xD But I wake up and realize its not true.

When psionics are in your dreams, its just an indication of how devoted you are to it. The more you think of it, the more it gets into your dreams, especially if you practice right before you sleep. Some are good ways to get your dreams to be lucid, which then can help you achieve an OBE.

			I had a dream a little while ago in which I was a master of TK. It was a normal dream, and I was doing conceivable levels of TK, just the kind I'll never get to in real life. Levitating small objects and sliding rather large ones. I actually remember my technique from the dream, it was like a modified version of Apollo's. Surround the object with psi, connect with it, then move it was pretty much the way I did it. Probably works in real life too, who knows.
