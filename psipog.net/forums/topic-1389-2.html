			meh well... i as well am very interested... especially when the one guy suggested to use it as a means of lucidity. I just recently got into lucid dreams, and started a dream journal on dream veiws. It has one dream that is meaningless. Im looking for my dream signs, which i beleive is random people i know being misplaced. My dream recall is bad. I remember some parts really well, and others im not so sure about. I am not able to attain lucidity just yet. Someone pm me if they are willing to let me know im dreaming.

			Ooh! that sounds like so much fun! I have a friend who I practice telepathy with, but lives too far away to see, and we've been doing something like that, except neither of us can dreamwalk very well, so all we've really achieved is sort of being able to sense eachotherspresence while meditating.

			umm i think this is an interesting idea. However, I put no in the poll because i think it might be a bit dangerous. i mean in someone elses dream. what if it was a violent dream? could u get hurt if u were in someone elses brain. I mean the Dreamer would wake up if he was getting hurt, but would a visitor stay hurt and the dreamer stay sleeping until they themself is hurt. I admit that it sounds tempting and fun, but it sounds a little scary.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			A dreamwalked dream is similar to a normal dream. If things go bad, you will wake up. Joining others in their dream would be the same thing In My Opinion.

			stupid question
<br />
it is NOT doable thing!
<br />

<br />
all you will be unconscious...
<br />
there is more simple to go astral plane and meet them than the same night do things togever! How can it be if its a dream? How can you do things?
<br />
If you can do things, then probably you will wake up in dream and go into astral or go back to body.
<br />
to do things you need consciousness because the mind is sleeping.
<br />
when body is awaken, you mind will do anything you want ( it wants )
<br />
while body and mind is sleeping you cant do anything.

Hmm, have you heard of Lucid Dreams? They are dreams that you are aware that your dreaming in. If two people that are Lucid Dreaming decide to Dreamwalk, they WILL be able to control the dream. Your mind won't actually be sleeping, but your body will. That means you <span style="text-decoration: underline">can</span> do something.

			Hmmm, Sounds very good, I'd love to see someone pop into my dreams, hell, my dream is a host, but the main problem I think I will find is that I live in London... So, I won't be sleeping when you try to dreamwalk, and viceversa. Tell me if there are any londoners who would dreamwalk with me. Again, I'm game! That'd kick so much ass, practice psionics with someone, actually get better at psi while doing so, possibly teaching a technique that was to hard to understand before.
