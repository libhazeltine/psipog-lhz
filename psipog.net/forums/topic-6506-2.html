Aii ya, I don't read comic books animes because the pictures look all weird.

Never mind, it would be hard to convince you because all I read has been history. But since you have a shallow world concerning things like as mysticism and such... 
<br />

<br />
Well AT LEAST you have heard of the Siddhis right? Martial Artist introduced them to you his topic. You see those yogis who manifested those Siddhis probably didn't have an understanding of science like we do today. Yet they could &quot;call lightning and wind&quot; &quot;roam about unseen&quot; etc. 
<br />

<br />
You see I don't believe in psychokinesis the way you do, because I'm not limited to this website as the only ways of performing psychokinesis. Those of you who have no experience in this stuff and have never been off this website I'm trying to tell you that you CAN do more amazing things then spin psiwheels and roll pencils.

			Okay, everyone, let's not make this a flame war. That would get this thread locked REALLY fast. 
<br />

<br />
PsiReady, don't be so quick to denounce the ways of people here. We may not be able to do spectacular stuff like throw cars and stop bullets with PK, but our pencil-rolling is a start. Give people more credit.
<br />

<br />
Randy, do your homework before you try to refute please. There have been SO many people in mankind's history, and just because we don't have proof doesn't mean they didin't exist.
<br />

<br />
For everyone: Lack of evidence is NOT evidence of lack. Also, not everyone who has a fluffy idea, or conveys a good idea in fluffy labguage is a Narutard. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Now, onto my views on the original topic: I agree with Eldibs. It's my opinion that, although it may be possible, it would be astronomically difficult to create lightning from scratch. Targetting a strike in a thunderstorm sounds much easier. You just have to &quot;nudge&quot; the imminent strike in a certain direction, rather than create it all on your own. 
<br />

<br />
Summary: 
<br />
- Targetting? Yes.
<br />
- Creating? Possibly, but too difficult for almost everyone.

<br />

<br />
Physical Reality and your Imagination (dot) (dot) (dot) have no (dot) (dot) (dot) &quot;direct link&quot;. Therefore it is unnecessary to perform psychokinesis (dot) (dot) (dot) scientifically. It is unnecessary to say or think when calling lightning that you will call down a million electrons and direct their movement at a super speed etc. etc. Or say for &quot;Invisibility&quot; that you will bend light around you and continue to imagine that actually light particles are going around you. This will complicate and inhibit your ability to perform your powers or whatever. It will also cause doubt which also inhibits your ability while performing. So it is best to keep your methods simple. Do you really think that reality cares whether you moves the electrons one by one or in a stream? If you think so then there infinite details of physics to go through and infinite worries to take care of.
<br />

<br />
Mystics in ancient times did not have knowledge of particle physics or of the nature of lightning or gravity or the laws of energy etc. Yet they still were able to call lightning and wind, roam about unseen, levitate etc. Therefore it is not necessary to imagine excessively. Just let your subconscious handle it, with its massive stores of sensory information and its accumulation over time it will understand what to do far more then you can consciously grasp.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

ooh ooh one the smartest thing in this thread.  I really agree with psiready and everytime I've mixed science into something with psi that I'm doing, I've screwed it up.

I don't remember seeing very many obsessed naruto fanboys on here at all... maybe one... or two...
<br />

<br />
 
<br />

<br />
and to derricktheone:  Maybe he warned about flaming because he's psychic and knew you were going to be all like mad and stuff in your post. And annoyed.    After all this is a psychic forum who's to say that he didn't know your post about his post was going to be all annoyed sounding and so he made a the post that was going to annoy you just so that you wouldn't reply to it all mad.
<br />

<br />
oh, and to stay on topic: i think that calling lightning down is very possible indeed and I'm not sure how hard it would be to create lightning.  Obviously it wouldn't be hard during a heavy thunderstorm, you could just make a construct to call lightning to its location.

Yes, you can move past rolling pencils. If I recall correctly, NI reported being able to move chairs and such. However, NI was extremely gifted and had plenty of practice. You go ahead and believe whatever you want. If you want to believe that psionics is some form of magic granted to humans by a flying spaghetti monster, that's fine. But no matter how hard you believe otherwise, physical laws are just that: laws. PK (as well as psionics in general) is not breaking any fundamental laws of physics (the object is moving by an application of force, even though the force is unknown, and it uses up energy). So, you're welcome to go ahead believing whatever you want about psionics, but as long as you're here at Psipog, go by what's in the articles, as those have been written through actual personal experience (i.e. the writer has actually performed the feats contained repeatedly, and others have performed them as well, they didn't just read something someone else wrote and decided to teach people about it), and have shown to be true for the majority.

			I think calling Lightning isn't something with what you should mess around. 
<br />

<br />
Imagine for one second the power you want to deal with. You manipulate energy which can kill. It can be so powerful to kill you or destroy many things. It can kill others too. Before you acquire such skills you should maybe consider what you are doing. Fortunately it isn't so easy to control Lightning. 
<br />

<br />
It would be like you have got a nuclear bomb for christmas but you don't know anything about it. So you can't handle it and it explodes and kills 100000 people, yourself and even more with the pollution of it. That's probably a bad comparison but it's the first that came into my mind. I picked it because it's maybe comparable to the power of a lightning. 
<br />

<br />
With great force there comes great responsability not only for yourself but for others as well. Sounds like a quote from Peter Parker and that's what it is.

			I have done my homework, and I conclude that everyone who has claimed to call down lightning has been fake. So far in modern times, whats the best that someone has done with PK? Ive heard of moving couches and such but nothing of this proportion. Sgt, if we have no proof, then what do we have? Elaborate stories to help them gain popularity? If you think anything is possible, then your results will never be enough.

But I'm still not willing to say that it's not possible. Granted, it's probably not easy in the slightest, most likely requiring years of concentrated effort, but that would still be possible, right?

<br />
But I've got to thinking, why would you <span style="font-weight: bold">want </span>to &quot;call&quot; lightning in the first place? So you can hit people with it? Seriously, it has very little relevant use other than destruction, in my opinion

			I just try to be realistic in my posts. I see a lot of over confidence in this forum nowadays. If people believe anything is possible, then why havent they achieved it yet? Having confidence is great, it motivates you to work hard. Over confidence is more dangerous, and could ultimately lead to dissapointment.

How do you know they haven't been achieved yet? And don't say: because it has never been on the BBC News. People perform miracles everyday, you just need to open your eyes. Or was it your third eye?

There is no detail to describe here. I Have said this many times before: You don't need any method or complicated knowledge to perform any skill whatsoever. Please people, remember this line at least. Take it with you whenever you practice and with whatever you practice cause then you will see it is the truth. You don't have to know how the muscles work, you just use them by using your WILL/INTENTIONS.

What is it that makes people think that this fundamental principle is different with psionics or even with the Siddhi's? Never change a winning concept. So why change the basic principle of creation?

All you need to fly, cast lightning, walk through walls, teleport to different planets without the need of oxygen (do i need to make this more clear, or should i say fluffy <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />?) is <span style="font-weight: bold">Intention</span>/will and <span style="font-weight: bold">Attention</span>. <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">IA</span></span> is all you need! Intention &amp; Attention. The level of skill depends on the clarity of the mind and therefore the clarity of your A (Attention). the intention is already there, all we need to do to manifets our intentions is getting rid of the cloath of dirt and illusions and self-doubt that we have covered it with. With a clear mind, comes clarity of our intentions and they will shine with beutiful glory and manifest themselves in an instant. All you need to do is let them.

How do I direct lightning? I should first have an intention. I already have the intention of moving the lightning or else I would not be trying/doing anything would I. So the I is there, now we need the A. Ok. I focuss and I <span style="font-style: italic">Will</span> the lightning to strike somewhere in specific. <span style="font-weight: bold">WILL</span> could be considered a balanced or perfected mix of <span style="font-weight: bold">I &amp; A.</span> Next thing I know the lightning strikes exactly there. Most of the times I tried to make certain patterns in the clouds instead of letting lightning hit the earth to reduce any potential danger. I do actually not advise anyone to do this unless their minds are controlled and self-confidence and fearlessness is developed at least up to a certain degree. If you experience any form of doubt whatsoever when trying to direct lightning, stop trying, meditate for another year, master your mind and thus master the world, then try again after a year and lightning will be yours. Simple yet potentially dangerous if your mind is uncontroleld and full of ego/fears.

I just gave you the list of ingrediants you need to master any skill. If you want to rise in skill, all you need to do is rise in level of consciousness and control over the mind. All that changes in the development is your mind. The requirements (I&amp;A) for any skill remain the same on any level. They just come with higher clarity. That's why I don't bother so much with performing or practicing skills cause I know that I could better be spending my time on mastering and transcending the mind. By doing so I will become master of all my intention and achieve liberation along with all the power to co-create along with all other parts of god (you). Do this and you will lack interest in the psi-wheel soon. With good reason too. Skills are just magic tricks which you should not be attached to cause it will bind you. You don't want to be bound, you want to be free. Become free and all is yours. Focus the mind, become clear, become transparent to the light of creation within and let it all come out with IA. Manifesting your intentions will become an automatic process. At times it even seems as if the A from IA can be forgotten. But that will be a result which will start to come after some development.
