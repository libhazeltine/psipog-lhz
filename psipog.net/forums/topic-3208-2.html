prove it to yourself.  we have all taken the step to prove the existance of psionics, and we have had our results.  if you want proof, do what all of us have already done and take the weeks of practicing to prove it to yourself.  you can't expect everything handed to you on a silver platter, why is this different?

			I am starting to beleive it exists (I am kind of skeptic) but something unbeleivable happened to my friend today. When he woke up, sometime during the day, he could see a face, and then closed his eyes and opened them again. Again, the face was there, and then it started to scream. He felt some pain in his head, and then he could see the face bleeding out of its ears and eyes. This kind of freaked me out a bit, but then I found out he was attacked. Does this normally happen?

my contention is that, were it to exist, then it would be a much more popular and common facet of modern society. if it really existed, then why hasnt...say an indepentant media source done an investigative report on it? they could subject the psion to a series of tests in a controlled setting in which outside forces could be negated in order to prove or disprove the existence of psionics. if the reports on this site of kids who &quot;show it to their friends at school&quot; were credible, wouldnt the trend catch on? wouldn't a teacher or administrator say &quot;DUDE...THATS...A BIG DEAL.&quot;? im completley open-minded to the possibility that it does exist, but ive tried for years and yeilded no tangible results, and it seems to me that, were it to exist, that it would be documented conclusivley to be real.

ADD-ON: What I'm trying to say is.. It's there, I've experienced it. The sensations are real. Therefore it exists, right?

			continuing bladeslinger's answer (psion):
<br />

<br />
everyone can use psionics.  if you can think, you can do it.  it's just we tend to tune it out.  as a child (2 or 3) we have already drowned out our abilities since we haven't had need to use them, and haven't been encouraged to.  it's just the matter of tuning them back in.  it's like the sound of a rainstorm.  at first, it's loud and prominent.  after a while, we tune it out and it can be hard to tune the sound back in.  psionics are also labeled as &quot;abnormal.&quot;  well, where is the glamour in abnormal?  humans are social, and we don't want to be abnormal, or do abnormal things.  it's against our nature, so we just ignore psionics.  religion (without getting into it) also plays a part, where most of them say witchcraft is bad, and people associate witchcraft with psionics and other supernatural phenomena.  so it's not that psionics is some underground culture that the media doesn't reveal, it's just that we people have learned to ignore, and cover it up.  and the tests you ask about have happened, google them.  you can also find a lot on the internet about the government and remote viewing, and look up that nina kulgina (i think that's her name) lady, she was a famous psychokinetic.  as for a trend that doesn't catch on, some kids are afraid their parents will be mad at them for practicing &quot;witchcraft,&quot; or they are afraid that psionics is &quot;witchcraft&quot; and will have dire consequences.  plus the ever annoying sentence:  &quot;move this!&quot;  all of these are HUGE factors in the hinderance of the psionic movement, and why we choose to ignore one of our most useful natural abilities.

Forgive me. I am just a man just like you. My post came from the anger that comes from seeing the truth about the &quot;powers that be&quot; conspiracy to hide such information from the mass media. And now, realizing that it can push our selves into a new era, embrace it. Next time I shall not speak in any negatives terms towards any individual.
