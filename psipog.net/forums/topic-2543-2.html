			You make some good points, Bob_stew...
<br />

<br />
You're right in a sense - it shouldn't bother me if someone casually claims it, and doesn't intend on turning it into a huge proven/disproven debate.  Finding out more about anothers beliefs is interesting.
<br />

<br />
On the same sense, otherkin should understand that their claims are pretty out there, and that most people probably won't believe them.  I've had otherkin accuse me of being close minded, stupid, hypocritical, etc... just because they refused to present evidence to me.  C'mon.
<br />

<br />
Most of the time, I don't think they are lieing.  I think they genuinely believe in what they're talking about.  Detecting delusion using psionics opens up a huge can of worms - and if someone detected they were delusional, do you think they would care?  No.

			I think the idea of otherkin is quite interesting. My friend spoke to me about it, there are traits that identify you with your otherkin, but there are so many that it's hard to find one you can't identify with, so it's almost a trap. For example, those who heal faster than others and are naturally prone to phonomena(idk if I spelled that right) are known as angelic, which I would put Peebrain into that category <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. 
<br />

<br />
I don't honostly believe it, but it is interesting to think that I have the spirit of a Vampire/Dragon. Vampyric because....Well...I crave blood and spend most of the time awake at night, I woke up at 8PM today &gt;_&lt; It doesn't mean I'll die if I hit sunlight or without blood, it just means that I prefer the night. Dragonic because I'm a big guy and especially like Dragons, very prideful, noble? At least I like to think so, lol.
<br />

<br />
It can be explained though, perhaps in an alternate universe all these beings of lore exist, and there is a very small barrier between our world and there's, enough that they influence our thoughts and they're spirits pass over to this world when they die, into one of us. Of course, as I say with most things, it's implausible, not impossible.

			I had a good discussion with a friend today, it went something like this:
<br />

<br />
&quot;I was checking online to see how many &quot;groups&quot; of psi there where...&quot;
<br />
&quot;Yeah, what did you find?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Well, I found that the most groups online who associated themselves with psi also associated themselves with vampirism/magick/whatnot... What a bunch of morons.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Yeah, screw those people.&quot;
<br />
&quot;I mean, jeez, what the hell drives you to think you are half dragon vampire werewolf fairy donkey man?&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
Basically, it went about with me badmouthing &quot;Otherkin&quot;. My opinion:
<br />

<br />
Other kin is a bunch of teenage people wishing their lives where more interesting, or attempting to explain their disfunctionality with ridiculous references to some obscure reference form a magic book. Reality is, life sucks, and if you're screwed up, it's not because your dragon self has a particular weakness. It's because you're DNA sucks, and you're too weak to overcome your mental weakness'.

			Lol, damn. As I said above I don't truly believe in it, but it's a nice thought. It's fun dude. Everyone has their little quirks and oddities, for example I say &quot;Sorry, it's the Dragonic side of me&quot; on occaison. Have you ever looked into it before you first heard of it and dissed it? I would suggest looking into it now, but you've already formed a bad opinion on it. So chances are you won't change your mind by looking into it now.
<br />

<br />
I stick by it being fun though, and can you explain to me why I crave blood and like the darkness? I'm in no way a Vampire fanboy btw, and there are few good vampire movies(Interview with a Vampire is great though). It's just an oddity of mine, do I really believe I have the soul of a vampire in me? No. Would it explain why I like such things? Yep, perfectly.
<br />

<br />
I have a friend who truly absolutely believes in it, but I don't disagree with her, she's too nice, lol.

			For my part, I believe, and have believed for several years, that I am otherkin. Quite frankly, I don't care if the majority of the world considers me crazy or 'deluded'. 
<br />

<br />
How do I know? I don't have a clue - its like knowing that you are female, or have short hair.
<br />

<br />
As for saying it doesn't exist without even considering it, I personally call that closed-mindedness and think you should take a look into it before actually badmouthing it.
<br />

<br />
As for those who have researched it, and still don't believe... Obviously I don't agree, but every person is entitled to their own opinion. *shrug*
<br />

<br />
As for being a 'dysfunctional teenage person' with a 'crap life' - absolutely not. Im teenage, yes, but I don't blame human weakness on anything other than that.
<br />

<br />
And thats my two cents.
<br />

			What do you consider &quot;researching&quot;?  I've read about otherkin, and the entire thing is silly.  It's good that you don't care if other's think you're deluded.
<br />

<br />
I don't like being &quot;guilted&quot; into believing in it.
<br />

<br />
&quot;You don't agree? Then you're close minded.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Gee, I thought someone who believed in psychic abilities would be open minded enough to believe in this.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;How can you be so rude?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Blah blah blah.  You are human.  Here's how you can tell: are your parents human?  Are your siblings human?  Are your grandparents human?
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Then you are human.</span>
<br />

<br />
It's that simple.

Aqua Teen Hunger Force summarizes my position perfectly, in the following clip:  <a href="otherkin.wmv" target="_blank">http://psipog.net/otherkin.wmv</a>

			I honestly see no evidence of otherking being legit, therefore I am inclined to say that it is untrue. But some people may truly believe they are something else on the inside, and if that is the case, im not going to bother them about it.

			i think that otherkin is just another way of identifying onesself. setting you apart from the crowd. i don't realy condone drinking someone elses blood. people get AIDS that way.
<br />
but saying you're an 'angelic' kin because you're good at healing is just another way to identify who you are and what you do. i'm not realy into the otherkin thing though, the whole thing seems too weird for me (lol), surely instead of saying you do TP, PK, RV and OBE, it's easier to say &quot;oh, yes. i'm a &lt;animal&gt;&quot; grouped up to releive confusion about what you do.
<br />
in my opinion though, PSIPOG has struck me, and always will, as a very professional place, that looks at things from a vareity of angles with a scientific approach. with some other websites i've visited being a bit too spiritually orientated for me.
<br />
maybe otherkin is just another way of looking at psionics. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			Alot of the things we have are just terms chained to the abilities we have, we can call psi or special gifts whatever we want, as long as it makes you stronger, than I see little reason to stop doing what you're doing. Call yourself angelic, call yourself anything, if it makes you use your abilities better than go right ahead.

Normally I'd be inclined to agree with you that if something makes you &quot;Stronger&quot; you should be able to call yourself whatever you want. However, that thinking like gets you into trouble. Let us, for example, take another case. Someone is really sucky at Psi, ok? Now, he creates a system to mimic his favorite video game. After a while he gets good at what he's doing. But, he never drops the system. At this point, he starts believing he is a level ** Dogmouser, Master Psychic. Why create a delusion to sustain an ability that can be increased with out it? Not only is it a strain with communication with others, it's like... FAKE. Unfortunetly, these &quot;otherkin&quot; have found other people to share the delusion with, but one day, when they find out they don't have an immunity to fire. They're going to get hurt, not just physically, but Psychologically too.
