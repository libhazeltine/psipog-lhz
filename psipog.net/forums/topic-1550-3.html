If they did blow up the world, you wouldn't have time to believe that they existed or not, since you'd be dead. Lol.
<br />

<br />
Btw, about that one post someone said the flying saucers were government crafts, I read somewhere once that they could be using anti-gravity technology, which I don't doubt at all. What I mean is, science is advancing by the second, and if they had anti-grav techs already, I wouldn't be surprised.

			Why are people so fearful of the world being blown to smitherines by aliens? Look at this logically its a planet, a planet thats hospitable, teeming with life, resources, and a generally rare resources to find on planets, that being bodies of water.
<br />

<br />
If we found an alien species or planet no way in hell we'd blow the thing up, we'd most likely observe and interact with the natives. Or if more ambitious try to take the planet over, not so much just blowing it up, rather a waste of what astronomers have deduced to be a rare find in planets. Rest assured earth will probably only be blown up by one of few things, a extremely large comet/asteriod or our own stupidity, IE blowing one another up with the thousands of ICBMs all over the place.

LMAO! That made me laugh for a good minute or so. I always used to blame losing things on black holes. Forgive me, i was only 10.
<br />

<br />
Erm yea, i believe theres something out there other than us, it would be foolish to assume so, I mean with so many galaxies(sp?) and planets out there i couldnt imagine there being no other intelligent life forms. 
<br />

<br />
I dont think they'll look anything like the aliens out of &quot;alien&quot; because they just look ridiculous and primative, although i dont know how intelligent these aliens will be either.
<br />

<br />
So many things we dont know, leaves you thinkin...

			Ridiculous to answer no, unless by aliens you mean the Xenomorphs potrayed in the Alien movies, or little green men, though either may exist. Visiting earth without the purpose of any manner of communication or clearly visible plan, is questionable.

			if humans do come into contact with alien life forms i want them to be like the asgard from stargate which are basicly the roswell greys and i dont think they fly in saucers because in space there is no air therefore they dont need to be aerodynamic they could be any shape under the sun.

since when do you need aliens to blow up the World??

			Alright, here's my story.
<br />

<br />
I was sleeping one night, I think 4 years ago, and suddenly light was coming in through my eyes. I opened them and was staring right into the face of a reptile-looking humanoid. The skin was brown and scaley, it had slits for a nose, and the eyes were yellow, black and red with elongitated pupils. They almost seemed to glow.
<br />

<br />
I realized I was laying on a table or something, and this thing appeared to be around 6 to 7 feet tall. It had been using some tool (can't remember what) to mess with something underneath my heart. I was in intense fear, and apparently the alien got a bit freaked out aswell. It's eyes widened and I got the feeling that it wasn't expecting me to wake up. Suddenly there was a bright flash and I was back in my bed.
<br />

<br />
I explained this to myself as being a dream for around 3 years afterward. Then, about a year or two ago, I met someone who claimed to have seen the same thing, and described EXACTLY what I had seen. I know there are coincidences, so I looked into this further.
<br />

<br />
About 8 months ago I found a researcher by the name of David Icke who heavily investigates these creatures. He has talked to thousands of people who have seen the exact same thing I have, which I believe discredits it from being a hallucination/dream paralysis story. What I learned from his books is staggering...
<br />

<br />
These creatures are called &quot;chitahuri&quot; by african shamans, and are commonly referred to as &quot;reptilians&quot; by researchers of them. They came to the earth thousands (possibly even millions) of years ago. Today, they take up the main positions of power in the world and you can see this through their bloodlines.
<br />

<br />

<br />
David Icke (although commonly the target of ridicule) is, imo, a genius and his books and ideas explain EXACTLY HOW things like psychokinesis work among other things.
<br />

<br />
He touches on pretty much every topic you can think of, from conspiracies to the nature of the universe, and they all intertwine to create the world we live in today.
<br />

<br />
I would definately suggest picking up one of his more recent books (children of the matrix, infinite love is the only truth; everything else is illusion) at a local borders, although that choice is yours.
<br />

<br />

<br />
It's none of my business whether you believe me or not, but I had to give input on this thread since it is one that applies greatly in my life.
