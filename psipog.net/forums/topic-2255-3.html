			I still don't hear any facts or detailed explainations, I just hear opinions and random thoughts, like reading a book that doesn't have any structure.

are you advoiding the explaination? or are you just Bullsh***ing us?

I don't mind how long it is, I want to hear the explaination, I don't give a f***, explain it in every single detail and don't give me any type of s**t on how it can't be written down or whatever f*** the excuse is, I want to know what the hell you are trying to make us understand, you are just babbeling usless information.

			Im not going to create another world that stands in line, i found my way on how to control reality with my imagination by using my senses to prove to my mind that it has to be there and real. I really hate writing now, I practice everyday all day, shit like this makes my thought so small.
<br />
This is what is funny, going this deep inside of yourself is where only yourself can understand, there is a plan and fate that lies deep, what to choose is simple, stay in or stay out. There is no words that will teach anything, it is you that chooses to read and think, words mean of a ifinity thing, you can explain everything with two words - your choice. Opposite or equal, different or the same. It is not my words you seek it is the sequence that tells you that you have to give up, except the consiquence or you lose. the middle of being awake and being in a dream is where humans are ment to be. that cannot desribe what it is on a thought on a thought. you can be taught how to slightly alter your reality but going to far is where words get destroyed. We are all the smartest speices on this planet, all you need to know is that there is no difference between your thoughts and imagination and what is out there. you see this does have balance this does have limits, the physics are the exact opposite but why trust me my words are lies, this is no better than a video or a book, you see it is yourself that you trust but if you care for something else you lose. Look where you are scared to look. no need to think when yourself allready does that for you. you are for choice. your oppose is infinity memory, 1+0 is what you did not make. it wont be clear because your are not part of the plan, sorry and simple.

Well that's a bit flawed since your sample size would consist of one psion (who would prove your null hypothesis lol).  Such a poor experiment would be completely unrelated to the argument because you missed/misunderstoof a good half of what I wrote. You would see your counterargument is a totally invalid one if you had read my post fully.  I've identified the variable that dictates whether one will move a hole-puncher or not besides human potential (since we've been asserting that is limitless)....

There's a difference between &quot;very few people have such knowledge&quot; and &quot;only I have such knowledge&quot;.  I only said that I had the knowledge and that beyond Avius (and one other member), I have not seen anyone else on the site demonstrate such understanding.  I didn't say that there are 2 people in the universe with this knowledge: me and Avius.  It's not a surprising fact that the majority of psipog is inexperienced in such an area though, how many teenagers do you know that have life figured out?  I got to where I am from reading about quantum physics and string theory when I was 10, and self-understanding has been the focus of my life for 5 years.  Most people do not pursue self-knowledge with such dedication though so I don't expect many other people to possess such knowledge nor do I mean to be condescending.  I just happen to be an exception resulting from exceptional parents who educated me about metaphysics and its connections to the physical.

ShadowWolfX:  I've read over your post for anything I missed and can't find anything I haven't addressed albeit some might make more sense in my mind than when written down.  Such could be the case so feel free to ask a specific question and I'll answer it best I can.
<br />

<br />
neveza: You may not have noticed but I specifically wrote at the end of my last post that attacking me is just a show of narrowmindedness.  Swearing excessively is of course an attack and so, I'm not going to waste my time trying to educate someone who is so infuriated at the knowledge I'm giving you.  Personally it's encouraging to see an elegant truth push someone's buttons.  There are always those who are so resistant to change (especially within themselves) and so get angry at those who have succeeded at what they refuse to try.  It's a sign I'm doing something right <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  Perhaps you should take Avius' advice though and &quot;look where you're scared to look&quot;, you may just find out something interesting about yourself <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

I never attacked you, I was only expressing what I was thinking, and I swear excessivly when irritated, yes, but it also shows a bit more emotions in my case, nothing more.
<br />

<br />
I've know enough about myself, I've lost sight and form of all reality, hell, I used to think like you two, but I've decided it was a pointless thoughts, so I abandon it. Yet, I've also, had other thoughts with that thoughts that sort of corrupted me and cursed me with memories I try to run from which ,too, has changed my reality of things, so I sometimes question what I do see. 
<br />

<br />
either way, I still rather see some evidentual proof of some sort and personally, I still think you are evading any type of explaination.
<br />

<br />
from avius last post, you make it sound like fate has a good 90% of the world's population as it's unselected of evolution and will die out besides you and some other folks.

			if psychokinesis is a hallucination, then why does it take a couple of weeks for it to start to work?  and why can other people see the movement as well?  i mean, if me &quot;hallucinating&quot; pk makes other people &quot;hallucinate&quot; pk, wouldn't that be considered paranormal?  and who's to say psionics is fake?  that would be like me saying that your &quot;reality control&quot; is fake.  i &quot;know&quot; psionics is real, and you &quot;know&quot; that your reality thing is real, saying that it isn't is unfair and rude.

your &quot;monkey see monkey do&quot; theory doesn't work that well.  according to this, if jesus was real, then everyone could perform miracles.  this also means that everyone can perform magic tricks, and we wouldn't be entertained by them anymore.  we would all be able to do anything possible, and there would be no need for social sects and different jobs.  i should be able to speak latin if i hear someone speak it.  seeing as how none of this is true, i'm not sure this theory is correct.  and seeing as how this theory is incorrect, you can't say pk is a hallucination.

			My question was to 'explain' the other psionic powers since this only touchs on the more corporeal powers, for lack of better terms, such things that cant be tangible in any way (Psychokinesis and PsiBalls being so since you can feel and interact with the objects). Such as Remote Veiwing, I really dont want to repeat my question right now, given I just got down with a bunch of technition work today, but search my previous posts with that basis in mind, i'm sure you'll find it.

Well, my personal experience is that energies like psi ARE part of the corporeal world.  Is your brain not a corporeal object?  Does it not have it's own trends and function according to them?  Thus telepathy and empathy are covered.  Also, are trends of the world dependent on where you are and what time it is?  Quantitative universal constants like Planck's Constant or the Universal Gas Constant don't change according to whether you are in New York or Tokyo, at noon or midnight.  Neither do qualitative universal truths, which is why everything involving psi is independent of distance and time.
<br />

<br />
Personally I've also found that construct making, psionic sparring and those psi manipulation practices (as well as OBE's for that matter) are all imaginary.  That's not to say they aren't real, since the main point of this thread is that everything exists in a grey area between thought and physical.  The two are interconnected and so &quot;imaginary&quot; exercises are quite real, as real you make them.  It's just that sometimes you're more willing to accept how real something is which is why an &quot;unenlightened&quot; (sorry, can't think of a better word that gets the point across...) person's abilties are so much more dramatic during astral projection than while conscious.
<br />

<br />
Apollo: The whole point of this thread is to show that the line we draw between thought and our physical reality is blurrier than we imagine it to be.  Hallucinations are no less real than lucid perceptions, the only difference is whether you believe in that hallucination so much so that it manifests itself physically as the physical world does.  Thus you can say reality is a dream, or dreams are reality.  So while you hallucinate that the pencil moves, you believe in that hallucination enough that it manifests in the pencil actually moving.
<br />

<br />
Neveza: I'm not going to change my decision to not address you because all you're doing is making excuses for something completely true that I called you on.  I don't accept bad behaviour from those I interact with and this rule has no wiggle room.  Maybe now you'll be more respectful in the next thread we both post in.
