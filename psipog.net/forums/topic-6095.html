			Oh yes, sleep. 
<br />
I am in high school and almost every day I hear someone say: &quot;Oh, I'm so tired *yawn, fart*&quot; (Ha ha, they don't actually fart but imagine it for me, you'll laugh) 
<br />
So I asked some people around as to how much sleep they actually get. And this one girl I spoke with said she hasn't sleeped fully since last Thursday, and it is Thursday today! 
<br />
I am quite reluctant into believing this though. I just want some answers to this riddle. I think that it seems to be a fad of somesort where kids just say that they are tired and never get sleep. 
<br />
What's your thoughts on sleep?

			I try to get a good amount of sleep or I crash in English and then in Physics. Sometimes I'll get like insomnia in the summer and then I won't sleep at all some nights. It'll just be like half sleep and I'll dream while consious. It's pretty weird. I dunno about other kids though.

			I get anywhere from 4-8 hours a night. Usually around 6. That girl who said she hasn't slept in a week was either lying or on hardcore drugs. I can't stand when kids think it's &quot;cool&quot; to say they've been awake for so long. She was trying to sound &quot;cool&quot;. There's no way she stayed awake that long because she chose to. She's in highschool with you I bet. She'd be sleeping through every class by day 3. Tell her to stop lying  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> . Anyways I think noone gets that much sleep because of the type of people you are asking. Everyone's 12-22 give or take. Ask people who are 35-50 and you'll get different results. However it is proven that people overall, are getting less sleep nowadays. A lot of survey's say it's because of the current lifestyle and &quot;they're aren't enough hours in the day&quot;. I say it's organization. You'll get enough sleep if you're organized. (I'm not lol)

			i dont think very little. i sleep like 4 hours a night but when i get home from school i sleep and hour or two. sometimes i take another nap durring lunch in the student lounge.
<br />

<br />
The reason why i have trouble sleeping at night is me thinking about all the shit that happens, the things that make me happy and the ones that piss me off. What takes up most of my time is my homework. I have to read 1 packet of 14-19 pages each day and answer questions on a worksheet about it for global. Every monday i have to hand in a current events article and most of the time my math teacher assigns homwork for that day. Since i was out for about a week i missed 4 labs wich i still have to make up and i got a 95 on the last test but a 53 on the one yesterday.
<br />

<br />
Basicly its SO much bull going on i can't concentrate on sleeping. the sucky part is that most of the time i'm just thinking about it and not realy doing anything to solve my problems

			Assignments make more sense to keep someone up. 
<br />
I agree with having to do work. But &quot;Oh, I just can't sleep.&quot; 
<br />
Just sit there quietly and close your eyes and you will fall asleep. You just need patience.

			Agreed, try a sort of meditation while trying to fall asleep.  Those constant thoughts will keep you up. So, learn to shut them out.
<br />

I personally, like my sleep.  I get about 8 hours asleep a day.  My friend, however, stay up and walks around town until about 5 in the morning and gets about 2 hrs of sleep.  Well, that's mostly because she is emotionally unstable and what, wont get into that.

Blah! I like my SLEEP!
