			Me. 
<br />
I meditate about once a week, at the most, and I'm fairly good at the psiwheel.
<br />
I'm working on spinning two at once now, and I've had decent success.

			Well, you don’t need to meditate to become good at pk for starters. I only meditated about 7 times in total, one of which was just before I got good results, however, I didn’t really meditate after that and got good results. I went through a phase of meditation but before that I was fine with pk, so that rules it out. Despite that though, meditation could help, but really depends on the person and their attitude towards it.

edit: btw, you might want to delete the other topic you made on this too.

			Hey, i was thinking about meditation being cumulative, and all, so i came up to a &quot;conclusion&quot;:
<br />
coudn't meditation be something like a &quot;training&quot;, of the kind you do before you get good enough to start a sport or something? you know, before starting to run, or jump, you first make some exercices to make your legs and arms strong so you can have a better (and faster) achievment?
<br />
so, if you meditate, you make your mind ready for new things, and makes it stronger, or more open, or anything like that. like if you were fat, and needed to slim before you can run/play football and stuff.
<br />
you CAN start with footbal, but if you get fitter it will be better and easier to play and get results, won't it?
<br />
so, your opinion about it

			try observing yourself breathe
<br />
while breathing, just simply notice the air filling your lungs, and notice when the air leaves your lungs
<br />
that way, you don't have to 'focus on nothing', but you're still focusing on one thing. there are many different ways to meditate. if one method doesn't work, try another. just remember to try not to have any expectations about it. whatever happens happens. it's most likely different for most people
