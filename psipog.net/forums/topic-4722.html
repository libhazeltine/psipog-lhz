			Well it's true. I'm not a real trained lucid dreamer but I'm trying to get started up. I'm asking what is the first thing you want to do in your dream once you realize you can do anything. My personal desire? Well I just had a dream and I seized the opportunity for it, and it was? Sex. Yes I had sex with a hot girl that I liked in the dream. Actually it's true thing for a lot of lucid dreamers that their first fantasies are of sex. They will find the girl they like or just &quot;seize anybody&quot; because it is a dream. So I know you people out their and I know who you are. But if sex is one of them then just note it and go on with your other fantasies. Flying is popular but for me personally it is spider man. I had a dream as spider man and it was awsome. Maybe just X men I dunno, wolverine seem pretty sick. Maybe I'll go fight some bad guys or something, lol. Oh yes and there is one last warning about the sex issue. A lot of people say that orgasms are better in a dream because your body in reality is so relaxed, but you know whatever.

			My first desire is Flying... ^^ then I would try to Astral project. I've never had lucid dreams for very long... it's usually the last few minutes of my dream sequence.
<br />

<br />
Once when I was lucid dreaming, I stopped in the middle of my running and checked myself out. Found out that my arms were a LOT shorter than they are now... ^^' haha. 
<br />

<br />
I've only had a few lucid dreams. And I want more. On to practice!

			i only had 1 &quot;real&quot; lucid dream so far (beside many few secs at the virge of waking).. Similarly to psiready i went jumping of our building and back up, doing flips up and down and bouncing all over the place.. no web-strings tho <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
What is strange to me, is that i didnt want to do more stuff.. i just jumped up and down for couple of minutes (i was having great fun) and than i just did a 100 flip sommersault and *intentionally* crashed into the ground, knowing that i will wake up. i felt disoriented and very very dizzy. Now when i think of it, im angry i didnt do more stuff.
<br />

<br />
Anybody had similar experience?

			I usually just go with the dream. Its funt to play along. But what I need to remember (and also what I keep forgetting!) Is to go to the lucid crossroads and the lucid dojo to practice martial arts.

			Blow up everything and fly away in a huge explosion. I'm not generally an angry person at all, sometimes I just like to cause mass universal destruction.

			I am still in school, and I have a pretty poor social life, my brain is not adjusted to social behaviour. Im kinda wierd, but half is being afraid. So, what I'd do is have a lucid dream and play out a whole day of school and be social, seeing what I get out of the DCs and if they like me or not, and such. Just see what it would be like if I tried to fit in. Good practice for the real deal.
