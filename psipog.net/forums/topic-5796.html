			I never made a good psiball until I learned to take in energy and cycle it, and learned to view it.  I notice a lot of people getting confused because they're feeling weird sensations and don't understand where energy is going or how to move it through their body.  To me, it seems like you're focusing too much on your mind and not enough on the physical perception of energy.  Yes - you can get results both ways but one is grounded and one is not.  It's weird to me reading through the forum that people don't realize these things.  I get better results moving energy, rather than with imagination.  Maybe I just function that way.

no... there is no forcing involved... it's more like letting go and not forcing.  It's easy.  People just make it too hard.

pretend that you can... but not with imagination.  the reality is that you can have complete control of everything.  you're using the wrong part of your brain.  Taking in is almost letting go of thoughts in favor of letting things happen while you make them happen.  It doesn't matter if you understand it intellectually.  Or understand that theories.  Just do it.  Focus on it physically - the energy is a physical reality.  You control it all the time, but you don't know how to control it.

			Sounds like he's just saying, Use tactile visualization and think about what you have in your hands more then what you expect.

			Actually, this is how I was able to make a psi-ball the first day I came to this site. I've been practicing psi-balls and a little PK, with no burning-out yet. I guess I just have to train harder. Not to the extent to where I feel pain though, just to the extent to where I know when I need to stop, to get the best results.
