			Ive been practicing 'OBEing' for about 5 days now, it didnt really appeal to me, but it does now, anyway, i sitting in maths today, doing some probability trees, and i suddenly felt my body lift out, but i looked down, and i was still all in one piece, my pencil lead had snapped, so i walked over to where the sharpeners were (by the bin, about 10 or so feet away), and my teacher started talking again, so i looked back, AND I WAS STILL SITTING IN THE CHAIR, when i almost fainted, it went black, and i was back in my body, but before it went black, when i looked back, my hand was still writing and drawing lines with a ruler, i really cant explain what happened, so maybe someone else could help me understand this, because ive been practicing OBE's for five or so days now, and my understanding was you had to be bordering on concious/unconcious to have an OBE...... <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

Actually, I've heard of it happening before. One person was talking to a friend, then &quot;popped&quot; out, and watched themselves still talking and engaging in normal conversation.

			Ive been trying to have an OBE for about 5 days now, with no avail, ive got good vibrations, just every single time i try to leave my body, my mum or my sister calls me or comes into my bedroom and completely breaks my concentration. Today i was in maths, doing incredibly boring probability trees (does screaching sound), and i was just letting my hand write, as i do sometimes if my focus is up to it, i just let my hand write, its as simple as that, its like it knows what to write, i can talk to other people or just sit back and relax with my eyes closed, even look the other way and my hand still writes, as it would if i was making it write, the advantage to this is that i dont have to think about doing the work, and thus save my energy. I just program my hand to follow a 'preset path' and away it goes. Anyway, as my hand was doing this, i was sitting back with my eyes closed, wishing that i coud have an OBE when i got home (too lazy to try and have one right now, so i'll do it tomorrow), and i just felt my body rise by about 2 inches and i thought 'hmmmmm, thats odd, dont i have to be in some kind of conscious/unconcious state for that to happen' and then i felt my pencil lead snap, 'bollocks' i thought to myself, so i got up and walked over to the bin where the sharpeners are, roughly ten or so feet from where i was sitting, and i got there, just about to pick up a sharpener, heard the teacher start to speak again, so i turned around, and to my horror, i was still sitting in my seat, but i wasnt leaned back with eyes closed like i was before my pencil broke, i was hunched over my work drawing lines with a ruler, i felt incredibly faint, it went black, and i was back in my body, hunched over my work holding a ruler and a pencil with broken lead.

This is as much detail as i can possibly put it in.

			So this is something like the subconsciousness taking oer the body, when your conscious self is out and exploring.. something has to stay behind to keep teling the lungs &quot;inhale..exhale..inhale..&quot; and the heart: &quot;beat..beat..beat..&quot; <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
