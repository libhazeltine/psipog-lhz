			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
After reading some private messages and a couple of threads I realized that you all would like to see more videos. I know that a lot of members find videos inspirational and that members love watching psionic abilities in action. 
<br />

<br />
Now, I cannot say &quot;Give me some video ideas and they?ll be posted!&quot;. I cannot say that at all. PsiPog is currently going through a lot of ideas and thoughts on how to make our members more happier and to give you more options in your learning experience. That being said, we cannot upload new videos today. These are just some ideas on future video clips for PsiPog.
<br />

<br />
For the years that I have been here, I've constantly book marked every idea, theory, ability, debate and videos that I made or participated in. That being said, I have a load of videos that I have made myself. The following list are videos that I have made in the past. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Psychokinesis</span></span>
<br />

<br />
1) Soda cap sliding.
<br />
2) Shot glass sliding.
<br />
3) Three shot glasses sliding.
<br />
4) Basketball rolling.
<br />
5) Book sliding.
<br />
6) Cell phone spin.
<br />
7) Ceiling fan spin.
<br />
<img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> Pencil spin.
<br />
9) Pen roll.
<br />
10) Quarter sliding.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Telepathy</span></span>
<br />

<br />
1) This video that I made was titled &quot;Ping fun!&quot;. Basically it's a short video (62 seconds) of a friend of mine and myself pinging people in a local mall. My friend held the video camera while I pinged people. It's called &quot;Ping fun!&quot; due to the look of people reactions when I pinged them. 
<br />

<br />
2) Telepathic suggestion video. - I performed this video on my dog. I made her think that someone was at the door. Perhaps the funniest video I have. To say the least, the dog went nuts. (41 second video)
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Energy manipulation</span></span>
<br />

<br />
1) Force bubble construct.
<br />
2) Shield video.
<br />
3) Flare video (Three year old video)
<br />
4) Construct flare.
<br />

<br />
Those are all the videos that I have created in the past. A lot of those videos were made years ago. However, videos like the &quot;Ping Fun!&quot; video as well as other short PK video's were made recently. The following list are videos that I was considering making.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Psychokinesis</span></span>
<br />

<br />
1) Coin levitation.
<br />
2) Paper clip levitation.
<br />
3) Keyboard typing.
<br />
4) Door close/open.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Energy manipulation</span></span>
<br />

<br />
1) Visible shield
<br />
2) Construct flares.
<br />
3) Force bubble fun (Knock over small objects)
<br />
4) Shield connection - Inspired by a good friend of mine Suni, I wanted to make a shield around a small object (Cell phone, lab top, wireless connection box, etc) and disturb the connection. Suni made a video of him shielding a cell phone. The cell phone connection went high to low in a matter of seconds. It was a great video that inspired me to decide to make a similar video clip.
<br />

<br />
Those are just some of the many video ideas I have floating around in my head. Please feel free to comment and share your opinion on video ideas. If you have some video ideas yourself, please share. Thank you for reading.
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />

			That's great! Why don't you just upload the videos, or at least some of them, to rapidshare.de? I'm sure you would be doing a _lot_ of users a great favour. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> You can surely link from psipog, or at least from a sticky in the forums!
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Ping fun sounds like a great clip. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> We have only macro-PK vids on 'pog.

			I think that these videos would be very encouraging and hope that you will decide to show all of them to us! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Well anyway, I have a shared hosting account and I have much bandwidth + space that is going to waste.
<br />

<br />
I have opened up a ftp account for you with 200 mb of space and if you're interested you can upload them?
<br />

<br />
The servers in the US and pretty fast so I don't think it will take up too much of your time--
<br />

<br />
I'll send you details of it, just in case if you decide that you will upload <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
If you upload people will be able to access...

			I can re-record the anti-skeptics movie, then rehost it.

Unless that's not supposed to be up in the media section, only real psi videos

			Joe, I have a pretty spiffy idea...it's a combination of energy manipulation and PK.
<br />

<br />
You could make a force bubble construct in the shape of a cup or bowl of sorts, and then pour water into it.  That would be an amazing demonstration...or maybe I'm just easily amused.  And if you do it, I name the process the Force Bubble Cup. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

			Personally, I would enjoy viewing the shot glass videos (mainly due to my intrigue for the validity of this video  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4957790045041805261" target="_blank">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4957790045041805261</a>) and the video entitled &quot;Ping Fun.&quot;  
<br />

<br />
As far as potential videos, I'd like to see the coin levitation and paper clip levitation.

			I have a cool idea for a video. Throw a frisbee and have it stop in mid air, and change directions, then have it fly back into your hane. That would be awesome.

Post those videos... PLEASE!! Ill keep giving you ideas for them if you keep making them and posting them.

			If anyone could sound a note on an instrument with Psi, that would be amazing. I wouldn't expect a sonata, but perhaps someone plucking a string of a guitar with Psychokinesis, or sounding the bars of a xylophone. Just a thought. =)
