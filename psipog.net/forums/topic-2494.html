			Hello all
<br />
I took a short break from PK, but now I am back. Really recently, in fact yesterday, I was running and i tripped. My head smashed a tree and my knee smashed into my nose. Ive had a headache ever since, and i was told no sports for a week, as I cracked my nose and I have a concussion (I think thats the spelling). I almost definitely know the answer, of No, but sometimes I'll stare at an object and just try to move it, half assed. Could pk hurt me severely while I am in this state? I know many other things that alter the perception of your brain, could possibly help or hinder your pk ability. These are untested and should remain that, but im just wondering about everyone's 2 cents. Do you think doing pk with my concussion will severely hurt me? Thanks for your input

			I'd suggest, you take a break and let yourself recover. PK has been reported to cause severe injury and stress to the body, in otherwise apparently healthy individuals. *Nina Kulagina, for a case example.*
<br />

<br />
~&quot;Probably because they had preconcieved ideas of PK being stressful.&quot;~
<br />
I don't know, I don't plan to find out. Everyone is different - just be careful and use common sense.
<br />

<br />
Also, bear in mind that the common oppinion around a lot of psi-communities seems to be that PK is a physical skill; and you were advised against doing sports activities for a while. Something to possibly consider.
<br />

<br />
But its upto you in the end.

			i have heard the quite opposite. I heard that running a long distance and draining your body of physical energy, you are supposed to be able to slip into the meditative state easier. Physical skill? i doubt it. I have yet to see beads of sweat run down my forehead after i move my psiwheel around.
<br />

<br />
Psi is what ever you make it... You hear of all these people in this community getting drained and tired from using psi for long periods of time? Lemme let you in on something. That is an illusion. I have broken this illusion, and can do pk pretty much when i want, where i want for how ever long i want.  The only limit in this skill are those that you make.

			By 'physical skill' - it is usually referring to the effects it causes <span style="font-weight: bold">and</span> the very real physical effects on the body. Blood sugar levels, Nerve damage, increased respiratory and heart beat rates, heart attack, permanent 'burn out' of psionic skills... 
<br />
~ Boring to hear the safety stuff, I know; but I'd rather work within reality given what experiences I've had - than be the owner of a hip 'new' reality perspective.
<br />

<br />
You may start feeling the drain many people talk about if you start 'geisting' or moving objects bigger than a psi-wheel. Psi wheel is to door, as pebble is to large rock.
<br />

<br />
Sure, there may be mental concepts which hinder performance in psi. The mind is indeed powerful and important. But your physical body has as much to do with your existence and performance as your mental capacities. 
<br />

<br />
However - each to their own,
