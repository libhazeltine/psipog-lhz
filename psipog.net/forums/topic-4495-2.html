Are you saying my grammar skills are bad? I agree, My grammar isn't the greatest in the world, but at least, I could give a first impression that I could type out a reasonable topic with out commas and periods.

While neveza may have been a little harsh, his criticism is well placed.  Use proper grammar, please.  If you want someone to take the time and energy to read your post, then you should expend the time and energy to make your post refined.

If it's a bundle, I have a hard time reading. I'll start getting frustrated, when I get frustrated, I get pissed, which leads to high blood pressure to a major headache, eventually putting in a pissed mood.

A side from me. Some people might not beable to read it. it doesn't need to be perfect, but must at least be easy to the eyes.

My thoughts exactly. 
<br />

<br />
nodawg777 do you feel comfortable reading someone else's comments without punctuation so you don't really know when the sentence begins or ends to some people its quite annoying respect the English language if we pay you the same respects by typing sentences with grammar maybe you should do so too and if you have trouble with losing your train of thought whilst typing using grammar something fundamental that you should've learnt in primary school i suggest you get some serious help i sure as hell don't hope you write like this in your school essays your teachers must hate you what the bloody hell are you going to do with those extra few minutes that you obtain from saving a few keystrokes anyway oh i know you can spend it on improving your grammar and learn how to speed up your thought processing
