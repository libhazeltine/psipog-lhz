			Well this is my first post here, and I knew that I'd be joining this site at one time or another. 
<br />
Anyway, is it possible to move objects in an OBE? 
<br />

<br />
If I were to have one, then how could I prove it to others? 
<br />

<br />
Also, what are some uses for an OBE, besides blowing away your sense of reality?
<br />
Hopefully I'll be able to do an obe soon.
<br />

<br />
edit: Whats up with these fourms? I keep getting this debug mode error, and I have to click refresh every time. Didn't do this the other day.

			It is not possible to move physical objects.  Astral objects though is another subject...
<br />

<br />
You couldn't prove, beyond doubt, that you had one.  OBE's are more for personal exploration anyways...but you could always tell someone what you saw them doing at a certain time or something like that...
<br />

<br />
Uses for OBE??  Fun!  You can do nearly anything you want, and I hear energy manipulation and combat in OBE is fun as well...but I wont speak too much of that here...

The forums are fucked for the moment, just refresh <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Oh yeah one more question, how far can you go from your body?
<br />
I have heard of some sort of silver rope in an article, so how long will that rope most likely be if there is one?
<br />

<br />
thanks for the quick reply^

			Actually Kaiandy, it is posible to move objects in an OBE i did an experiment where i put a balloon on the one side of my living room and while i was out of body i was able to project my energy into the balloon and move 2 or 3 feet across the room, it takes loads of energy though.
<br />

<br />
To prove someone ask them to put a big piece of paper on the wall of a certain room and tell them to write three numbers on it, you OBE go to thier house and remeber the numbers. 
<br />

<br />
For the uses of OBE's go here
<br />
<a href="topic-3649.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3649</a>
<br />

<br />
You can go as far as you want to the other side of the world, the moon, to the sun to pluto if you wanted you just have to know where you are going. Some people see the silver cord some people dont but it is infinate it never runs out.
