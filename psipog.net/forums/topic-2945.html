			ok recently ive been delving into the creation of psipets. that and leaching but i will leave that at that. but anyhow i want to share to the ppl about psipets.
<br />

<br />
so far i can create 2 animals, a dragon and a swarm of mosquitos.
<br />

<br />
now onto creating them
<br />

<br />
ok first create a psiball and put ALOT of energy into it. you will want huge amounts if you want it to last. my dragon has lasted for about 4-6 hours.
<br />

<br />
ok once you have a psiball compress it and shell it while programming into it to be very hard and to flare into a color when it gains enough energy if you want. also include the feel of it such as scaly for a lizard fluffy for a cat or chinchilla.
<br />

<br />
 now program how it will move. birds fly, rats scurry, snakes slither, dogs walk on all fours...etc, etc.
<br />

<br />
 got that down? good now onto the actual shaping of it. first start by putting more energy and then making a tubular structure. then pull from it the legs and tail and (maybe <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />) its head
<br />

<br />
once you get the shape and details down is when you program it what to do. for instance my dragon is able to gather energy from others and create firey psiballs and fire them at what i want. as well as it flares and grows as its energy does. it also floats around randomly. for dogs have it lie down and alert you of others.
<br />

<br />
gl!
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">My pet statistics </span></span>
<br />
ok my dragon does these things
<br />
Float around and gather energy from others.
<br />
flare into a orangish reddish color when its gained a  suffecient amount of energy
<br />
give my 10% of the energy it gains
<br />
create firey forcebubble psiballs and launch them at what i tell it to
<br />
follow me
<br />
create heat around it
<br />
snort
<br />
give me &quot;Dragon Eyes&quot; which allows me to see what it sees when it travels away. a very good way of remote viewing.
<br />

<br />
and my mosquitos
<br />
float around in a swarm onto ppl
<br />
create a prickly itching feeling
<br />
leech energy from its victims causing the feeling
<br />
return the energy to me
<br />

<br />
it doesnt last long but hey its a good way to get energy.
<br />
idea came from the game warcraft 3 from the spider hero who had the skill locusts which flew around taking health and returning it to the unit. very useful indeed

<br />
ok well i just personally love dragons and lizards in general. dunno about others. but anyhow yes i do communicate with it. i simply talk to it like an actual animal just only in my mind. i dont however talk with the squitos mainly because theyre not a true pet
<br />

<br />
i also forgot to mention that i also tell it to do what i say like a pet somewhat like &quot;move where i tell you otherwise float at own will&quot;

			I am trying to make a psipet but I have never made a visible ball of psi. Any tips?
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Is it possible to create the energy around an object to make a psipet?

			<span style="color: darkred">OOooo, Sakura... <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" /> It's alright if you haven't created a visible psiball before,you don't really have to see your psipet to know that it's there. If you're good at sensing. But (as Psikey did) you can train it to flare when it obtains a certain amout of energy, and probably over time, it will flare.  </span>

			Hehe thanks... I actually drew her off the internet. But back to the topic, I've tried making a goblin and a flea. If I've made either one or both I can't find them. Is feeling weak a sign that I've done something? I feel I've been creating them because everytime I try I feel very weak.

			<span style="color: darkred">Feeling weak may mean that you have used alot of energy to make your psipet.  If you want to know where they are, you have to be good at sensing, you can look on the psi pog website for scanning or sensing. But don't worry I can't feel mine either, that's why when I trained mine, I told it to let me know when it was nearby by brushing against my right cheek, or it may just randomly bite me.</span>

			Haha! I don't think I had enough energy for the goblin I spent it on my 2 flies, my mosquito, and my flea. I wonder what the psipet will be... So far my pets haven't done anything I think. I think I made a CATS... <a href="http://www.parn.pro.br/blog/images/zerowingcats.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.parn.pro.br/blog/images/zerowingcats.jpg</a>

			well ive never made a visible psiball before either but the dragon can do it on its own. also it does somewhat comunicate back to me but in a beastial way.
<br />
it also can bite(which hurts!) and it is pretty fun
<br />

<br />
i have had no previous knowledge of making a psipet. i just decided to make one after reading the topic that someone made that was very unorganized and didnt make sense. so i made one, it worked, and then i wrote all of this.
<br />
i have no other knowledge about psipets than that so apparently im pretty good at this.
<br />

<br />
also i just feel it with my hands and can sense it around me. its cool
