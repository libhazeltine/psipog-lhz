			I had the wierdest experience last night. I was walking around my apartment when I felt something evil covering everything. I have trouble with shielding, so I didn't have one. Whatever it was felt very far away, and that's what disturbed me because the feeling it was giving off was extremely intense. It litterally made me start crying. After a few hours it went away, and by that I mean the feeling just vanished. Did anyone else feel anything like that? I mean, if you didn't and you have a shield up then it was probably so intense that your shield considered it an attack and blocked it out. But it still disturbs me.

			I was sleeping at the time, given im sick right now i'd have slept through all of it and the time I did wake up I was pist rather then feeling evil, the only damn time my alarm wakes me up and im sick!
<br />

<br />
Anyways around that time my poster of a SR-71 did fall over, but granted the damned thing along with the poster of my P-40 Tigers keeps falling over each night....It's a good material of paper so its going to take a bit for it to not be in a rolled up shape.

			if you are in southern california, that might have been me. because i sent a psi-ball to my friend to deliver a message(just to see if i could yet) and i concentrated on it for 30 minutes with different visualizations. i used: fire,water,wind,gravitational,magnetic,electric,dark,light, and something that looked like a laser beam. it was 10-ish and i tried programming it to deliver a message to my friend in 6 hours. if it was me, sorry.

			I was out of town that day, and around that time I woke up with a ringing in my ears. That's about it. However, several weeks before that day, I created my psi alarm clock. So, I think it was probably that.

As a coincidence, that just happened to be my birthday.
