			An_st, it may be better to just type in plain english, from the it looks, your requests are being misunderstood due to your typing style. Maybe we're all just stupid, as I remember you posting somewhere - who knows. Is there any reason *why* you enjoy your cryptic communication?

now now temper temper. first off your right about me typing however i want. my senses tells me the rules have no speech rubric. now about what i asked... a very humble person could of answered with &quot;practice meditation&quot; or &quot;learning happens from association&quot;.  Most replies keep on racking up the intelligent points. Now you asked a good question...what does silence mean...well  the_musician I guess its when your thinking about integrity.

			ok so how do you figure silence meaning telepathy.. i figured playing along in the last post would chill you out but.... damn man come on.

how hard would it be to not type like that? And yes... the answer is what you just said. Learning by doing... meditating... what gets me the most is you knew this and you still asked it in this way.

If I put your two sentences together, your problem basically is that someone suffers from silent thoughts, and would like to find them. To oppose silence, one would have to hear. Finding usually goes hand in hand with 'lost'. Those two sentences are not at all relevant!
<br />

<br />
Asking how your awareness finds thoughts can be rather vague. Finding thoughts could mean that you have a crappy short term memory, for instance, or a mind that wanders a lot - you think of something and may lose that thought/forget the thought 5 seconds later. 
<br />

<br />
'My new friend is silence'. Silence...now, my grammar may not be the best, but I'm thinking that silence is an adjective. You're using it in place of what should be a verb? (Unsure on this)
<br />

<br />
Silence can also mean a lot of things. Silence as in, unable to talk, lives in a world of silence (deaf) so on so forth. However, the next sentence is regarding thoughts and awareness. How is one 'silence' in thoughts? Are they not thinking? I'd think that they'd be a vegtable in a coma then =/ 
<br />

<br />

<br />
The above is what I mean by cryptic. Psionics, in my experience, is something that can already be vague and difficult to understand - what may make sense to one person can make another go 'wtf?!'. Please don't make it any harder for the inhabitants of this forum.
