			I have, without a doubt, officially moved the psi wheel under glass. There was no possible wind getting in this time and while I did it once with my hands on the glass (turning 1/2 turn each way slowly and with a pause between directions) I also managed to do it with my hands simply around the glass.
<br />

<br />
My main concern about having my hands ON the glass was that because I'm using a foil wheel, the heat conducted from my hands, through the glass and into the air within, can cause it to turn. Thankfully I was also able to do this with out my hands on the glass though so I *KNOW* it's me.
<br />

<br />
I also had an interesting experience when, after moving the wheel a few times successfully, I focused, but got nothing. Deciding to shake my hands out and clear my head I removed my hands carefully (wheel didn't move) and sat back. I looked over at my monitor (with the PK forums up of course <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> ) and caught movement out of the corner of my eye - the wheel was turning slowly - over a full turn. I've read about the distraction method before (I also think of it as the Discharge method because when your attention shifts you discharge the directional energy you help the item with previously) but have never had it work, and never expected it to.
<br />
Well, it worked, and quite well I might add.
<br />

<br />
I'm very happy with the progress I'm making. For any of you that read my blog, this probably won't get reported until tomorrow since it's late - and it'll be a cut and paste job at that. Though I will also be blogging out a few thoughts on moving bigger objects and a few other topics soonish as well.

			Good for you, I've been thinking about moving on to the glass over my wheel, think I might try it now...

			Nice. What you should focus on next is not using your hands. I've actually gotten better without my hands than with my hands.

Coincidentally, I couldn't do <span style="font-style: italic">crap</span> when I put my hands around the wheel.

			Well, finally got s'more time to practice again. Results weren't as good as the other night, but I still had several solid rotations in directions of my choosing, at the time of my choosing. I can't root out my webcam now, but I will soonish and hopefully will be able to catch it on video for the folks here.
