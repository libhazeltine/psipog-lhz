			Well, right after reading some articles on this forum, i decided to try to make a psiball, and flare it. But something else happened. So i'm staring at the floor, theres a few dim lights on (speaker, power strip, keyboard num lock) and im focusing on making a psiball. I close my eyes for about a minute, and open them, i see nothing, but suddenly the lights get a bit brighter. I decide to keep my eyes open, and go back to focusing on the ball. So i'm making the ball &quot;stronger, and i notice all the lights around me suddenly get darker. I take my focus off the ball, and they get brighter again. I figure &quot;my eyes are just messing with me&quot;. I keep focusing on the PsiBall, and the lights go dim again. I take my eyes off, and Boom, brighter. 
<br />

<br />
Now, what im thinking is that by focusing on Touch, i've managed to somehow lessen my other senses. When the lights go dim, i dont hear other things as loud as they are either. Though, i doubt this.
<br />

<br />
Any help ASAP would be greatly appreciated, thanks for reading.
<br />

<br />
Edit: I've (quickly) drawn a picture up of my desk. The small bit of green on the left side is from the light from my power strip. It now occurs to me how wierd it is, that its a small dim light, and yet theres part of it on the side of a desk, at least a foot away.

Before Concentrating on the Psiball

The second i stop concentrating, the light comes right back.
<br />

<br />
Edit 2: I forgot to mention, as the lights go dim, the ball becomes stronger. Vice versa with brightness.
<br />

<br />
Edit 3: Somethings wrong with my eyes. If i look away, theres a small white/green glow on the side of my desk. If i look at it, it goes away. I'm going to bed, to stop myself from constant editing, and to make sure not to piss anyone off.
