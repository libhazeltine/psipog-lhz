			hav u ever tried making psiballs under ur feet, strong enough to make u float in mid air? i havent tried it before, neither hav i actually created a psiball. i just felt it's stinging effect on my palms. just imagine people thinking u r levitating, but in actual fact it is psiballs under ur feet. for those who don't know about levitating, it means going against the LAW OF GRAVITY. you can just fly just like criss angel. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
one word of advice, don't float too high, just in case the psiballs disappear.

			well I read somewhere around here that peebrain tried standing on a force bubble and nearly sprained his ankle. so it is probably possible but it would take alot of skill. you would probably have to make it a cube so it doesn't roll (try standin on a basketball). and it would have to be pretty strong since cubes aren't as strong as spheres.

			this is nothing more than another way of levitating using telekinesis...using a psiball under your feet to levitate you wou;d be a force bubble and telekinesis is programmed into force bubbles wich means this is just telekinesis...i doubt anyone here is advanced enouph to do this though....it must be really hard to make a force bubble that strong....

			Well, I feel that i've been advancing pretty well with psi balls so I'll give it a shot and try to remember to post results here. What I'll do is make the psiballs under my feet and stand on a weighing machine thingamabob, &quot;scales&quot; that's the term I was looking for lol and see what happens. I do happen to know my current weight which is 159lbs and if it goes less then it's pushing me up a bit :O

			Doesn't sound possible to me. Well, not in this lifetime. You couldn't make that in one go, no way. It would take more energy than the human body posses. If you were to, it would use up all your energy, leaving you with just enough energy to actually test it out. If you could do that, it would have to be as solid as a brick wall. You would actually have to make it so strong that you can't even punch through it! Not an easy task people... <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />
