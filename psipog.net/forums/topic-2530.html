			I was praticing yesterday and my friends saw me, nothing happened, but, thery were still curious. I told them what i knew. 2 out of 3 were interested. 1 said it was just gravity pulling the sides of the psiwheel and that it was all explainable. She showed me a site where some guy performed the same thing i was doing and it was'nt that complicated. I can't remeber the site or the experiment's name, sry. Do any of you think gravity is the reason or is it really psi!? <img src="images/smiles/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" border="0" />

			Gravity doesn't move the psiwheel unless it is unbalanced/ too heavy on a side.
<br />
Heat _Can_ move the psiwheel, but if you have enough distance and no air currents in your room, then it it TK

			So... he did the same thin gyou were doing and claimed it was gravity?  Like Gonzo said it would need to be unbalanced, unless TK users are actually manipulating the gravitational pull (somehow...), or you create a gravitational pull with your body.

Overall, I'm confused  by what your friend means <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

Then your &quot;1&quot; friend is stupid thinking that it's gravity.
