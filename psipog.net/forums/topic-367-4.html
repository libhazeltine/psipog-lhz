That is basically what our debate comes down to; He wants to learn as fast and efficiently as possible and I refer taking my time. Not that either mindset is superior, each just has different advantages and disadvantages.

Martial arts to me is not a sport

not a way of life

not self defense

Just the most effective way to kill a man.

So, you believe that people should only be able to defend themselves after twenty years of practice? Or do you think they should be able to defend themselves after a few weeks, months, or a year or two at most... and then be able to defend themselves for another twenty years. Which do you think makes the most sense?
<br />

<br />
The inside thing was: Are you one of the people that understands?

You don't find it a bit odd that you'd need to practice twenty years to be able to protect yourself and or fight other people?
<br />

<br />
So should people think: &quot;Fuck defending myself now and the rest of my life... I'll just start practicing something that will only work well once I master it in some twenty or more years&quot;?

			I understand DanielH. He's saying that something shouldn't take you over years of practice to be worthy enough to be used for defense. Unlike Boxing or Jeet Kune Do, You could take a few lessons or read a book and under a month, you could have the basic skill to successfully take someone down. A great martial Arts should increase effectiveness over years of practice, not start becoming effective.
<br />

<br />
That's probably what Dan finds to be a flaw in Kung Fu.

			In my case of aikido, everything is defensive. Almost every technique involves entering, blending, and redirecting. You can't just &quot;do&quot; those after a few practices or by reading a book. You need practice, lots of it. You need the coordination to enter in the right place, the right time, and without getting hit. Once you have those, you can finish almost any fight in one move. 
<br />

<br />
However, this may not be what Danial was reffering to, becuase these things probably take about two years of semi-serious to serious practice to get well enough to use, as opposed to 20.
