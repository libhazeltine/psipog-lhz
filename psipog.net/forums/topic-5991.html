			oh, i had a thought about the geiger counter experiment stuff
<br />
okay. i'm kinda ignorant in some ways. i thought to myself: okay, a geiger counter measures radiation. but, there are many different kinds, so which one is it? so i checked. it measures alpha and beta (and sometimes gamma).
<br />
an alpha particle can be stopped by a piece of paper. a beta particle can be stopped by something as simple as tin foil. an alpha particle is a helium nucleus. a beta particle is: beta- --- electron and antineutrino, beta+ --- antielectron (positron) and neutrino
<br />
gamma....that's part of the electromagnetic spectrum....photons, xrays, etc
<br />
to me, it seems as though 'psi' could be any one of these, depending on how you're using it (flaring psiballs = gamma radiation in the form of photons)
<br />
Electron-positron annihilation occurs when an electron and a positron (the electron's anti-particle) collide. The result of the collision is the conversion of the electron and positron and the creation of gamma ray photons or, less often, other particles.
<br />
in my observational opinion, psi could be said to be the manipulation of the electromagnetic spectrum in order to create/destroy certain particles to be able to serve a goal (pk, etc)
<br />
also, these specific particles, not including alpha, are determined by the weak nuclear force, and the electromagnetic force, which scientists have determined to be 2 parts of the same force: electro-weak
<br />
i need to do more research on particle physics....
<br />
well....it seems to me that if a geiger counter clicks while a person is performing pk in its proximity, then psi is either the creation of these particles, or mere manipulation of the already existing ones....
<br />
any thoughts/comments?
<br />
wiki says one click on a geiger counter is one particle.

			For of my knowledge, the geiger picks up the particles shed and not psi itself. But it does show something, no matter what anybody says. I do admit, it doesn't prove much. It just shows something happens partically, giving some shed of light. If such thing is true and they move in waves, they would be near UV rays since it can hit a frequency and length to produce color and light on the electromagnatic spectrum. That's just what I came up. Other people might know more, some might be biased. In the end, I'm waiting for that article from EJDWII.

			Yeah well, Erik should be praised for his little bit of experimentation that he's made public.

			After a long round of experimenting, it was very obvious that the data was insufficient to be conclusive, but SOMETHING was still happening.  We do however have a working hypothesis about what possibly was going on.
<br />

<br />
My Geiger counter probe is not only sensitive to radiated particles, but also gamma-rays.  After some more tests at the University of Washington, we have come up with a hypothesis where what was occurring was not the detection of radiated particles, but a wave-collapse of very high vibration energy.
<br />

<br />
Here’s the gist:
<br />

<br />
We suspect that an action was occurring in the higher vibration spectrum well beyond the gamma.  This subtle-energy reaction became so dense, it self-interfered with itself and the wave collapsed into a lower harmonic.  This may have occurred a couple times before finally dropping into the upper gamma range and was detected by the equipment.
<br />

<br />
The ramification of this hypothesis is that, if true, we would have a framework for explaining the visible “flaring” of constructs.  If the energy was dense enough to collapse down to the visible light spectrum, we would indeed observe photons being shed.
<br />

<br />
But for the most part, this experiment was a “springboard” to greater things later.
<br />

<br />
Verdict:  “Inconclusive, yet ambitious”

			Very good to know that. If you get a measure, you can work on it. You may be able to get multiple measures, and extrapolate on that to know which frequency the original wave was. You may need more than one sensor at the same time. It's kinda how to detect what kind of start certain space body is based on the visible light. After doing that, you may know which frequency the original wave was to know what kind of sensor you need to measure it directly (if we have such a thing). Maybe it is generated by a gravity wave, who knows  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
