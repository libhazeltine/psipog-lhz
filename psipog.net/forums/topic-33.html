			Psipog.net would be better if it had a Wiki. 
<br />

<br />
Everyone could edit the wiki, all articles could be setup that way, it would easily be moderated, and information would travel quicker than other sites with forums
<br />

<br />
anyway, i think peebs should set one up just to play around with, just try it!

			I don't think that would be a good idea. everyone has their own experience with many things and i don't see one possible way that 1 person has concluded the exact same thing with another person about (for example) how telepathy works. Just read the Techniques forum, it's good enough <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Yeah, there's already the forums and the chat. What would people want to put in a wiki that they couldn't post here?
<br />

<br />
If there was no specific topic for the wiki (posting techniques, or experiences, for example), it'd become a bit messy and people would be confused. If there was, well, why couldn't it be discussed on these forums? Wiki pages would also need quite a bit of upkeep, I think.
<br />

<br />
Nice idea, but I don't think it's necessary now that there are forums. =/

			I don't like the idea of a wiki site either A)&gt; because it's making us look like we are trying to rip of Veritas. B)&gt; because it looks messy and in my personnal opnion not a very good way to host information for customers (you) to look at. Plus you always get that one idoit who edits and article and puts &quot;transform&quot; or &quot;blows up&quot; or even worse in the middle of a very well structured article.

			We won't be having a wiki.

<br />
A wiki should only be used when there is substantial collective knowledge.  I.e., wikipedia.  This is not the case with psionics.

This is something you'll probably never convince me to do.

Agreed, SA is the toilet of the internet.

But a psionics wiki would be the worst idea ever. The fluff would wipe things out in 5 minutes or like that amount.

			A wiki probably isn't what Psipog needs, admittedly, but as a website and community specializing in psionics, I would love nothing more than to have a structured place for Psipog to perform extensive online experiments and a means for members to enter their data in an effort to come to some unified conjuction in results and methods.  In essence, what I'm looking at is a psionics reasearch project, working from the ground up, to analyze both the qualitiative and quantitative relationships between variables relating to psi.  If this sounds interesting - you might consider implementing a wiki for that purpose.  If it doesn't... thank you for allowing me to waste your time with the idea.
