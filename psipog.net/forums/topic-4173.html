The last thing Government officials need is the New York Times discovering that they are funding psi-op projects.

The government can monitor cell phone calls because it's on a public airwave.

			The whole STARGATE thing was used by the US government for almost 25 years, and when its existance got leaked, they shut it down on orders from Congress.
<br />

<br />
I doubt it'll ever be publically used by the US gevernment. If it's a choice between squelching these programs and getting deposed, the politicians will invariably choose to keep their power and can the projects.

As we can see, only in 1994 and 1995 did the project (which became public after Ed Dames set up PSI-Tech in '89) overlap with the sci-fi series/film by the same name. Also, in the last few years of the project's existance (after it got media coverage), the CIA did an internal investigation into the project. The investigation results were deliberately fudged, and it was concluded that Project STARGATE was unsuitable for intelligence-gathering purposes. 
<br />

<br />
I say the results were fudged because they refused to take into account the billions of dollars and hundreds of lives that were saved by using RV as an intelligence-gathering tool. Thus, the project was called Stargate before the film (and indeed, the TV show) ever existed. The film makers were allowed to keep the title because it had nothing to do with the then-largely-classified project. The only thing that wasn't classified at that point was the project's existance, but now a LOT of it is readily availible. Thank you, Ed Dames!
<br />

<br />
Regarding the Illuminati, I must say, they're really dumb if they're putting their super-secret secret symbols of secret secrecy on the very thing that millions of people across the United States handle every single day. But hey, the New World Order ain't happening any time soon anyways. Not if YouTube has anything to say about it...
