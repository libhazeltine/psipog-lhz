			I'm wonderin what this was, so here is my story:
<br />

<br />
A while back, someone had told me and my buddy that there was a haunted house near by and what not...so a few days later me and my buddy go to find this place, and we do..its like an old farm/barn place and the house was old and abandon and everything..But the weird thing was, we weren't sure if the place was huanted...but THE MOMENT, and i mean THE EXACT MOMENT i set foot on the property, i had this feeling go through my entire body that we shouldn't be there...my friend later said he saw something up in the second story window, but the thing was, that there was no way u could get up there cuz the steps were too weak.
<br />

<br />
We didnt experience anything out of the ordinary, cept for me and that feeling that went through my body..im wondering what it was..i didnt feel it anyother time except when i step exactly on the property.
<br />

<br />
anyone know what this was?

			Probably just normal fear/anxiousness, especially if you didn't feel anything else afterwards. I get that feeling all the time, and mine's certainly not psi related.

			Are you good at sensing energy? Cause if you are, you could go back there and sense for things. I picked up a body-shaped blob of energy in my friend's house one day.

			Theres also this ability called 'postcognition'.  This is the opposite of precognition, where you see or feel things from the future.  Anyways... in some cases, people have seen shadowy figures in the corner of their eye, usually in places where strong energy has been released there in the past; someone being killed, etc.  The feeling you got was probably maybe you just being overcautious... Or maybe, the house on the house actually is haunted... o.O
