Yes of course, because morons usually resort to that sort of non-verbal communication.  I'm so glad you took the time to reflect upon what I said and formulate an intelligent response.
<br />

<br />
If you want a Dr. Phil, then I'll give you a Dr. Phil: why were you in juvy?  Was it a violent crime, perhaps ?  I'm just a bit curious because it wouldn't surprise me that a former juvenile inmate would lack the empathy and understanding required to compromise and get along with other people.  Is that enough Dr. Phil for you?

All I've been stressing is that it is pretty much improbable to suggest that you can stop war.  If you wan't to try, go right ahead, but 99.9999 percent chance says you will get no where, or if you do, the situation will just repeat itself.

I know because you mentioned it as a caption to one of your photographs in the &quot;Display Your Photos&quot; thread in General Discussion.  I usually pick up little details like that.
<br />

<br />
It's not improbable to suggest that you can stop war.  It's actually quite easy to suggest that you can stop war, and if I'm not mistaken, that's what I've been doing for the entirety of this thread.  I'd love to know your criteria and statistical analysis methods that led you to 99.9999 percent.  Given your calculations are accurate I still feel that the .0001 percent chance for non-violence justifies any endeavors toward that goal.

			Sure war is a good way of culling a population, helping to create a bigger death rate than birth rate.  Though, as proven in WWII there were a lot of deaths, but births won out in the end (e.g. baby boomers).  
<br />

<br />
Whether or not war is good, that's a hard question to answer.  Economically and ingenuitually, yes.  Truly, war is both good and bad.  Frankly, no war can truly be gauged until about 20 years later.  We might figure out that the war in Iraq, or the War on Terror, were the best wars ever.
<br />

<br />
As to my stance on all of this, I'm currently undecided.  Somehow I still have hope in the human race, even though I know they're all total pricks(me included).  Though, hard to accept, it's probably true, as long as there are are other people we will be disagreeing with them to the point of escalating to war.
<br />

<br />
But, back to the issue that this began on.  Sure it may be near impossible for anyone to stop a bullet or an explosion with PK.  However, I'm sure that some of the stronger PKers (e.g. those that can move couches) can disable their effectiveness.  Both bombs and guns have small fragile parts that can completely disable such weapons.  By breaking the fragile parts, changing the way the barrel is facing, changing the trajectory of the bullet, or slowing the hammer of the gun, can disable the effectiveness of the weapon.
<br />

<br />

Well at least there's one thing we can agree on.  People like psi4life with his horrendous ability to communicate without profanity, Theorist with his belief that only strings of periods are necessary for punctuation, and everyone else who cannot create and express a well-thought out opinion should think first, and then post.  Somehow they often get the order mixed up.
<br />

<br />
I also agree that those who volunteer for the military know full and well what they may encounter.  To minimalize their dedication and sacrifice by using their sacrifice to fuel a cause they had never consented to (such as that dog-faced Cindy Sheehan is doing, having the time of her life campaigning, traveling, meeting world leaders, making speeches and seeing herself in the news, all of which she accomplished by standing on the body of her dead son).
<br />

<br />
To say that war was a necessity in the past is misleading.  To be more accurate, you would have to say, &quot;war in the past was a necessity to become the nation that we are today&quot;.  Certainly this is a great nation despite it's flaws and faults, but that doesn't logically conclude that we would have been better off with the wars we fought than without them.

What? Pfft, I don't enjoy the goverment tell us to kill. Personally, I think we should have a agreement over the country whether or not to go to war. If can't agree then no war unless forced.

I'm just saying that war isn't exactly as bad as people may think. It's a bit rough and sometimes seen uneccessary, but it's a must since capitalisim is built with murder and blood shed, now thats all we know hjow to correct a problem (politcal wise). If you want no more war, become a fucking communist then develop your own political power! (No I don't hate commies, I used to practice such, some years back)

I think we all understand this.....(This is one of those DUH moments)....  But even though they WILLING go to war, I would not disrespect ANYONE in an uniform. I don't know how this country would be like (if it would even be a country), but it doesn't change the fact that through the deaths of soldiers, this has given us the freedom we know today. I don't know if I'm really explaining this in the best way I can, but I think that we do owe dead soldiers a lot.
