			yeah, i think that we only use approximatly 10% of our brains at a time, but overall we use close to 100%.  you have to keep in mind that a simple task such as breathing uses at least the medulla, the frontal lobe, and i think part of the amygdala (correct me if i'm wrong), that right there is at least 7% of the brain.  and while you breathe you blink, which also uses the frontal lobe, and i think the cerebellum (again, not too sure).
<br />

<br />
but i agree.  i wouldn't mess with your DNA.  it is such a complex system, and no matter how much you know your body, do you know exactly which chromosome or link is in charge of whether you have connected/detatched ear lobes?  something as insignifficant as that is extremely hard to figure out.  and if you wanted to mess with your DNA to give you superpowers, unless you have a degree in DNA researching, and are very familiar with your genetic makeup (inlcuding encoding and DNA pattern) you may just end up taking your left arm and having it protrude from your forehead.
<br />

<br />
also, if we feel the &quot;3rd eye pressure&quot; when perform telepathy, why do some of us feel it when performing psychokinesis?  since they are two different skills, why would that feeling persist in both practices?  i guess maybe since in both we are projecting psi...sorry, just rambling to myself lol.

I really don't understand what the fuck you are really trying to say.
<br />

<br />
I was being a smart ass if anything.
<br />

<br />
DNA hardly makes anybody &quot;godly&quot;, unless it's mixed with Technology or psi, it doesn't do much, but balance out the body just enough to survive alone. I never seen such orginism with DNA that makes them &quot;godly&quot;.

			You're missing the factor of developmental potential.  DNA gives structure to a being that is originally just a piece of meat, but that flesh can become quite a lot more.  Jesus, Buddha, as well as numerous gurus and sensei have become quite literally &quot;godly&quot;.  Do you think they were genetically inhuman?  Obviously not (since they had the same organs, the same bone structure, the same body systems), so their potential was not the result of any inherited predisposition.  One's state of mind is the only thing that dictates whether one is a piece of meat or a god.  Such potential is not possible for dogs, cats, ants, trees or rocks and the difference is only a few strands of DNA.
<br />

<br />
Tinkering with something so fragile that already creates beings with so much potential is pointless and detrimental.

			Excactly. Your DNA is already perfect. That is why it has a repair function to protect itself from mutations. Without getting to deep into molecular-biology, i can say that it is unnesesary to try and alter your DNA.
<br />

<br />
In fact, everybody is altering their body on a cellular level. Every cel has a receptor, and we have a receptor for all feelings we can have. When a neurotransmitter-o-feelgood binds with a receptor, we feel good.
<br />
Now when we feel good over a longer period of time and the cel divides. It will create a new cell with more 'feelgood' receptors and less 'feelbad' receptors. So we can feel ourself even better. 
<br />

<br />
What creates this feeling? Our thoughts! Yes. When we are thinking about nice things, loads of neurotransmitters get in our bloodstream and finds it way to your cells. 
<br />

<br />
Our process of thought has a direct influence to our body. Did you know every cell in your body is no older then seven years?
<br />

<br />
So, can you alter your body using your thoughts (as in PK)? Yes. Is it therefore neccesesary to alter your dna? No. Your body won't even let you. It will find other ways to alter itself to suit your needs.

Um, so you CAN alter it.  According to your logic, all I have to do is alter my needs, and my DNA will follow.  But it's even more simple than that.  Your explaination is dead on according to biology - and we can send out neurotransmitters by visualizing or by recalling past memories.  Another way to alter DNA.
<br />

<br />
That doesn't mean you can alter your DNA to become &quot;a god&quot;.  That's just fluffy bullshit, in my opinion.  Bruce Lipton is a cool biologist who explains this stuff really good in his video, A New Biology.

			Neveza:  I don't disagree on any particular point.  DNA isn't always perfectly transcribed, preserved, etc.  However there is one thing DNA is perfect at and that is creating our potential.  Ultimately, as long as your DNA is good enough to keep you alive long enough to realize that potential, it is doing its job perfectly.
<br />

<br />
Peebrain: I, nor anyone else, has said that your DNA can be altered to make you a god.  I said that DNA already allows for that potential, but the final steps to attain that potential are not evolutionary, and thus &quot;becoming godly&quot; is not the purpose of DNA.  That's a task for the human mind (but such a mind would never exist without DNA) and so my argument in no way insinuates that DNA can be altered to create a god.

Bacteria and virusses have their own DNA (RNA). They do not alter our DNA, they infect our cells.  The DNA of bacteria and virusses is perfect for their function. Furthermore altering DNA and the immunesystem are two different things.
<br />
btw, The immune system is really a beautifull thing. It can stop every disease given the time and fitness of your body.

No, because DNA is perfect it lets us be different. We can create our own body so we can so we can identify ourself in relation to the world around us. That we also create according to Quantum mechanics (consiousness causes collapse). Dna makes that possible, it can create any body you want. Because it can make any cell you want. 
<br />
Perfection and differentiation do not contradict eachother. They compliment eachother. It's only because you think that 'he' is better then 'me' that makes you believe that it isn't.

There is a repair mechanism that delete cells that differ to much from its mothercell. So your DNA has a function to protect itself from mutations. 
<br />
Your dna has certain functions wich can be turned on or off. You get this information from your mother and your father. These function can be switched on or off during your lifetime. So it is not possible to change your DNA but it is possible to turn functions on or off. Wich in turn change your cells. Wich in turn change your body. Wich in turn change the way people look at you. Wich in turn change the way you look at yourself. Witch in turn changes your cells..etc.
<br />
And this is happening right now inside your body only you are not aware of it. You just live your life asking yourself: Why do i keep getting in this kind of relationships? Why do i keep getting myself in this kind of situations?

Excactly. 
<br />

<br />
But not really alter it. You can redefine its function.
<br />
But it does not happen only if you want it to, it happens all the time. Right now. So if you spend your day in agony, and then you deside you want to alter your dna-functions by spending 10 minutes in joyful memory, it will not have that much effect. It's a start though.

			Well some virii do actually change your DNA.  Retrovirii do this, the most common of which is AIDS.  It changes your DNA to become a virus-producing machine.  That's why you have AIDS for life once you contract it.
<br />

<br />
One thing struck me though, why must we change our genes to perform biokinesis?  We could also change gene expression which would be far easier to do.  The reason chimps and humans are relatively quite different compared to the relatively tiny differences between our genetic code is gene expression for things like body hair, growth of bones, etc.  It's just one more way to change your phenotype thus falling under the category of biokinesis without actually changing genes.

			Nice thought Lightbringer. 
<br />
The actual fdifferance in DNA from chimps and us is about 1,23%. But when taken in account substitutions, insertions and deletions we get to 5%.
<br />

<br />
5% = 150.000.000 differances.
<br />

<br />
Just some facts. Don't really know what my point is excactly.
