			i dreamed that i was in army fighting other army then get capture by the other army , there they send me to their leader she was woman and she was good with psi powers and i asked her to teach me to do tk so she told me it is so simple all you need to do is to ask the object to move and it will get moved so i done as she said then i moved heavy things and levitated pencil and other things.
<br />
so is that message from my brain to me in picture of dream or it is just normal dream .
<br />
other thing after all that happened i asked her that if she can levitate herself and she said yes i can , but i need to cover my half hands and my half foots  <img src="images/smiles/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" border="0" />  . is that mean anything or it make no sense

			It could be both a dream and a message, I've had dreams in which I could levitate balls, and other stuff. 
<br />
These dreams are normal when you practice TK and I think its a message of how good you can get after a while.
<br />
But as real as the dream may seem, its just a dream and the same rule applies: keep practicing.

			I think this should be moved to the dream section? or.. bah. anyway, if it's true that your unconcious is more vulnerable when you're sleeping, maybe we can teach the sub-c to learn TK in our dreams.

			The other day I had a dream where I could I would throw a psiball and when it hit the object it would create an explosion.  There was this cool &quot;boss&quot; I had to fight, I probably took it from a Metroid game or something, and my first attack on it were really strong, and the rest were weaker.  The one controlling it was a really good friend of mine, I saw here and after after going to this place with her through a hall, I joined somed clan type thing that was based around psionics.  It was odd, but cool <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
