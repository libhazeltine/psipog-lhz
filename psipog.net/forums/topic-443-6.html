			i have some questions, that should have been seen before the first page posts i read, sorry if they've been asked or mentioned.
<br />

<br />
anyways, by the looks of it, that lamp in the image is OFF, maybe i'm not entirely familiar but the shadow indicating the bulb would be bright not dark.
<br />

<br />
second, why the HELL would he want to mess with the wall? WHAT on earth could he POSSIBLY want to edit on the wall?
<br />

<br />
third, the angle of light is indecice, as a shine can be on the wall, but doesnt that just mean A light is there, not THE light?
<br />

<br />
and finnally i looked at your 'green and gold' mixing. well, any file saved as a jpeg has a chance of doing that, i've personally had images that i changed format on, and they blurred in spots. you never know what it could be.
<br />

<br />
sorry again if i mentioned things that were mentioned before. ^_^;

Someone will probably point out the &quot;However, this rule in no way affects the awarding of the prize.&quot; part, so I'm going to nip this one in the bud, the awarding of the prize would be if the proof is agreed to be proof, if Randi says it isn't proof, you lose, and he owes you nothing.

btw, here is a challenge similar to randi's, but with evolution instead of magic <a href="http://www.drdino.com/articles.php?spec=67" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.drdino.com/articles.php?spec=67</a>

			so basically he says that

<br />
once you enter the contest, and that it's legally false
<br />
you can't prosecute him
<br />
and he won't give the money.
<br />

<br />
but... a loophole says that you CAN sue him, 
<br />
because you're not part of the contest, if you get a friend, to enter for you.

Hah...there's an idiot at every corner, you just have to know how to stab them the best way.

First question, Zack. WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU ON PSIPOG? GET BACK TO HIGH IMPACT HALO.

problem:
<br />

<br />
the contest is if you prove something, you get a prize, it is basically a bet. if you with the 'bet' there is nothing the person can do, his hands are tied by his word, and denying infallable proof would be impossible.

			I know this is an old topic, and I bieleve in psi, but I am skeptical about the picture. First of all, why just take a picture? Why didn't you film it? And all these high tech picture editing, yet nobody suspected him of just throwing it into the air and taking a picture of it just before it lands into his hand?

			You know after reading all of what said here what really interests me is: 
<br />
WHY ARE THERE PEOPLE WHO TRY SOOOO AGGRESSIVELY DENY TK or PROVE THERE IS NO SUCH THING?
<br />

<br />
Are you scared of something or tha fact that something like this COULD exist insults you in some way?
<br />

<br />
I'm not talking about the ones who say its hard to believe in, its the &quot;attackers&quot; who interest me.
