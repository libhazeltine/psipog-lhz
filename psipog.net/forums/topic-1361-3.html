			Hey, Xiouslaidyn, how old are you now. Those voices might be talking about your age and something important happening to you or the world. And if you were trying to OBE, i would stop because the FOCUS FOCUS YES YES YES might be like (dont pick on me for saying this) an evil spirt trying to take over your body when you OBE. That would suck if it was.

From my personal reading experience, the Mayans did not see an &quot;end to the world&quot; in 2012, but an &quot;end to the world as we know it&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
IE: physical world destruction, but higher spiritual consciousness. 
<br />

And I do infact think something big will happen, but I don't think &quot;it&quot; will happen to everyone.

I strongly agree with this statement. An end to the world &quot;as we know it&quot;.
<br />
Not something rational like a third world war derived from current political events... but rather, something unbelievable... something indescribable and unimaginable. Maybe Catastrophic, maybe Revolutionary. Maybe both.

			To those who stated it was probably my imagination or subconscious.. very possible. I considered this. Though I persoanlly consider it less probable than it being an unknown entity.
<br />

<br />
There are other factors and events which have occured in my lifetime which lead me to believe it was not my own mind's doing. So, to those who recommended I see a psychiatrist or psychologist, I politely refuse your suggestions. As things are, when im awake and fully conscious, I think with a clear and logical mind toward everyday matters and social interactions. Until that ceases to be the case, I shall never consider seeing a psychologist (UNLESS it is for anger management lol). 
<br />

<br />
These occurances happened to me while my mind was on a wavelength seperate from the beta waves (or is it alpha? i forget) that I and everyone else experiences while fully awake and aware. Also, the voices did not come from inside my head, according to my ears. Though im aware my mind is capable of producing &quot;false physical sounds&quot;, I am simply convinced this was not the case.
<br />

<br />
PS: To psi_ninja
<br />

<br />
im 22 years old now (just turned 22 today in fact). And I considered the 12 year thing might be in regards to just myself. In fact, when i was 10 years old (maybe 11, not positive) I encountered some kind of entity while i was swimming at my cottage. Everyone else had already gotten out of the water and started heading up to the cottage, and I was playing in thwe seaweed crib (catching minnows with a net. I used to do it all the time at that age). 
<br />

<br />
While I was underwater, I heard this EXTREMELY high pitch screeching sound. At first, I figured it was a boat (boat engines sound very high pitched underwater) but then I noticed it was really loud and that the pitch was consistantly altering somewhat. I lifted my head out of the water and looked around for a boat and saw nothing, and I noticed I could hear a huge rushing sound (of water) above the surface, and looked toward the sound.
<br />

<br />
Hurtling towards me at a fairly high speed was this big thing. Ever see a submarine when it first surfaces? all you can see is a rounded off blast of water, before it clears the sub. Well, that's what this was..... except that there was nothing underneath the rounded-offness of whatever was surfacing from the water, and the water didn't clear it, it just stayed the way it was, churning this way and that. It was moving toward me, quite quick, and I was paralyzed. I had no clue what to do.
<br />

<br />
Then it smashed into me. I felt a weird hard/slickness rub up against my body at that moment, and I was sent sprawling around in the water, my head nearly hitting the rocks of the seaweed crib. I literally turned upsidedown underneath the water, doing like a 720 spin before i could regain control of myself. It was still screeching, really really loud, underneath the water. I looked over in the direction it had gone. I could still see it, a little ways off. Suddenly, it turned out toward the center of the lake and submerged.
<br />

<br />
To this day, I still think about this event. It's not even the only time i've encountered an entity during daily activities... it's just the only one where that entity actually came into physical contact with me.
<br />

<br />
So, chew on that one, peeps. I gotta tell yas though, i don't care if any of you believe me. Those who do believe me can rest easy knowing they are NOT believing a lie, though. I would swear upon anything the truth of what i just said there. Im not a liar at all. I can count the actual full blown lies i've told in my whole life, on the fingers of one hand. That past account is not one of them.

			I still think that this has something to do with your age because what is 10+12? 22. If you hear that loud noise when you were 10 and you just turned 22, that means that 12 years have passed. When did you hear these &quot;evil voices&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Let me know if you hear any of these voices again

			Something similiar is also happened to me..
<br />
I was ten, I woke up and suddenly I heard a voice it said:
<br />
&quot;What do you want from me?&quot;
<br />
I thought I was dreaming, but the voice continued to shout at me....also with anger! and later the voice continued to say those words loudly....
<br />

<br />
I was really scared!

			loud noises? psi ninja, it was a helluva lot more than high pitched noise. It was a real, physical, existing entity of unknown composition and origin, that struck me violently. Sometimes, I think im priviliged to have such an experience under my belt, because it really helped in the development of my open mindedness... A lot of times i wonder if i'll ever encounter it again.... I have a feeling I will. 
<br />

<br />
I've encountered a few physical entities in my time, all out my cottage in the countryside, and also I've seen UFOs on a couple of occassions out there as well. Real UFOs, as in fucking spaceships or some other otherworldly shit that was definitly not constructed by the minds and hands of human beings. To see such things... and have others there to see them with you, is a blessing, to me.
<br />

<br />
I, personally, know for a fucking fact that we are not alone. That we are far from the only intelligent life in this universe, even on this planet.
<br />

<br />
I just hope i live to see the day when everyone else can have the same proven to them.

That is weird that you brought that up because i saw 3 UFOs in the past 3 days. 2 yesterday and another when i was going to bed on thursday night.
<br />

<br />
And another really weird thing is that i woke up today with a couple of inch long cuts on my left arm and i didnt have then when i went to bed yesterday.
<br />

<br />
I'm going to start a UFO thread in the general discussion forum and we can share our stories.

Hmm... If anyones ever read the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy by Philip Pullman (Golden Compass, Subtle Knife, Amber Spyglass), someone blew open a hole between the different worlds, and started a rebellian against God. Could this be something catastrophic and/or revolutionary?

<br />
Yeah that would certainly be catastrophic... not revolutionary..
<br />

<br />
Whether or not it has to do with merging two seperate realities, or blowing open a hole between worlds, I doubt very much there will be any &quot;war with god&quot;... Whatever happens has already been written imo, and if it's a war with god, it's certainly just going to be war with A god... probably not a nice one, and certainly not the force that created the universe..... im getting ahead of myself though... I can't, without being completely illogical, assume such a fanciful and fantastical outcome for the years 2011-2012.

			when I was about 4-7 I had loads of strange stuff happen to me, one of them included hearing a man and a woman talking to each other (although I could ever make out what they where saying), and ocasionaly I would here one of them loudly call my name like they where trying to get my attention.
<br />

<br />
as for 2011-2012 I think if its real it will be symbolic, more tha literal. maybe psionics will be officaly accepted by a couple of big goverments, which will start the trend for it beacoming main stream or somthing like that, maybe whatever it is wont even be obvious

Personally, I agree that if the worlld ends in 2012, it'll be the end of the world as we know it.

Anyways, someone said early in the thread something about a psychic War-type thing having been predicted. I've heard about that, too... And I get the feeling that, if anything, the War will trigger this end, whether it is the 'beginning of the end' or whether the resolution of the War is what triggers the 'end of the world'. Either way, I figure that the Psychic War, 11.11.11, and  12.12.12 may well be connected.
