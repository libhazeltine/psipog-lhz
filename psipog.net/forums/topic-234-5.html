			I use a technique that I made up called aura shaping you have to gather a massive amount of psi energy for this to work then you think of a shape around your head, hands, legs, feet, etc. and you make the shape making you look destructive, funny, or all around plain normal what we learn from this one is that you can shape more advanced things.

			a gun shaped construct that creates and stores constructs, and also shoots them. For something fun to do if your sort of bored. You could also make it store programed constructs, like a force sheild (on a smaller scale) or a construct that is programed to temporarily make someone lightheaded in order to avoid them or something of the sort.

Mmmmm, I like it!

How about a construct that absorbs thoughts? This absorb both your thoughts and others thoughts and can replace shielding for some time. Also, you could ground once in a while to prevent overload.

Tried that with my PsiPet, Jet. OMG, it worked great! It works better than any other method I've tried to gain lucidity. For all you working on Lucid Dreams, this is a must (along with good Dream Recall).

			Here's some:
<br />
1)A construct that will warm you up when you're cold and cool you down when you're hot.
<br />
2)A construct that gathers energy from several sources and stores it. Then when you need a psi ball...POP! It gives you one. It could also automatically shell them too.
<br />
2)A pain relief construct that takes away specific pain from you whenever you want it.
<br />
3) lol. An airfreshner construct! No more fabreeze! haha.
<br />
4)This could be funny... a construct to make your frinds non-alcoholic drinks taste alcoholic! They would order coke and complain to the barman.
<br />
5)A useful one to stick on the outside of your bedroom door that makes anyone you don't want in your room suddenly think of something else everytime they are about to go inside your room.hehe. Make them think they need to go downstairs, then when they get there they can't remember why they went down there in the first place.
<br />
6) A construct to report back images of what it has seen to you. You could probably cheat in a poker game by sending it round the other side of the table and then seeing what it saw. This would be invaluble if you were blind! Same goes for deafness, though not sure about that. Maybe constructs can't send you senses like sight and sound, unless you were a very good telepath...
<br />
7) A construct to cool down the inside of your computer. It would run really quickly. But i would be careful with this one as it may damage it!
<br />
<img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> This one is crazy but could work, and if it does it truly would be a breakthrough. btw, if anyone who can do what it needs then i suggest you try and share because I have been thinking about this for ages....:
<br />
If you were to make a psipet and then imprint your knowledge of English, or any other language you speak onto the psipet and try and program it to interact with you by using the language in the same manner that you would(effectively giving it your personality) but telepathically, then it would comunicate with people! If anyone is telepathic and would like to try this, please do since i suck at telepathy. Also PM me with the details.
<br />

<br />
hope this hasn't been an overlode of info since all the other posts on this page were really short and snappy. I just wanted to avoid having to post a billion times. Hope they all help! Happy constructing peeps!

			Thats a good idea. Would be handy at school when people are always trying to take your stuff. I would probably make it have a thought imprinted on it so it makes the person stealing it not want to. Or even tell you that they wanted to but not anymore. hehe, then you can know who is likely to steal your stuff and who not to trust. Caught in the act!

			I know your not supposed to talk about combat but your allowed to talk about shields and most of those are used for psychic combat, right? Well anyway I thought of a new twist for the mirror shield, store extra energy with it, so when something hits it, it will make the energy stronger before it sends it back, or, like a copy shield. Make a mirror shield with a lot of extra energy so when something hits it, it makes a copy or two copies or however many you want to send back to the original sender, imagine trying to throw a pain psiball at somebody and getting like 10 in return thrown back at you  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> ! hypothetical. I know your not supposed to talk about combat but this is hypothetical, I thought of an idea and I needed to get it out.[/code]
