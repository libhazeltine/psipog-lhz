			Ok, there is still alot of drama going on about the MPW13 forums. I know this is getting quite old. It may not be an out right war, but there has been much fighting going on, on several diffrent chats and sites. It's getting very annoying. I myself am apart of the community and even though I may not agree with everything that is said there, I do believe that not everyone there is a immature fluffer. Yes, some....alot maybe are. 
<br />

<br />
Im not dissing anyone when I say that, just saying not everyone is experienced. I am not &quot;Experienced&quot; in the sense that I can do everything that is expected of me to prove myself to the government and other reigning bodies that I am a TRUE Psion. I think everyone will agree with me that none of us are. It's one of those things, some of us have moral reasons, and others of us are just not experienced enough. 
<br />

<br />
Now the fluffers that you are talking about on MPW13 I agree there are some. But not everyone is so don't think everyone is just because we joined. I myself joined because a friend of mine wanted to me check it out. I like the main idea of the site. Just... we need more experienced teachers, thats more than likely why FrostBitten put the advertisement up on PsiPog. I don't know though so don't quote me on that. 
<br />

<br />
Please, if you do not like the site don't flame it, and don't argue with the Captians/Co Captians about it, internet drama is the worst. And as for the  comments made by the captians in the last topic, I sincerly apologize on their be-half, even if they do not. It was not right of anyone to put anyone else down. Espically since the Psionic Community needs as many members as possible so as to learn from everyone. We need to work together and have strong leaders who won't argue over petie things like the opening of a new community that may or may not be fluffy.
<br />

<br />
All im trying to say is if you have an opinion on MPW13 or any other Psi Site that may open up. Please suggest your advice in a less harmful fashion. I know people at PsiPog just wanted to help the new community by trying to stopp them from harming them selves, but in doing so yo may have harmed it even more. 
<br />

<br />
You may not know who I am, but we need to stop bickering amongst ourselves. It's not the best for a Psion to grow up argguing about who's community is better than who's bull she-ot. If they do they miss the point of being a Psion, to learn. -Salem
<br />

<br />
P.S. I apologize for my grammer it's definatly not my best subject nor is english, or spelling. And I FInally apologize for bring this subject to light again, I know it is old and needs to be shut down, but that is why im doing this. I have heard too much about this, and am tired of the drama that is going on because of this. Thank you for your time.

			I agree Salem, there are not much people on there although it has potential.
<br />
We need some more experienced members in multiple psionic skills.
<br />
It is a really cool community and I hope we will see some more members arrive soon...

Some of them are, yes, but that's not their real problem. They're a nice enough guys, their only problem is their ego, they let their ego overgrow their abilities and thats never a good thing. If they solve their ego problems everything else will solve itself.

			I think my Inkling of 'quitting' when i did was right. 
<br />
they've started up a combat section on their website, not that it's not allowed over there. it just seems so horrible reading through some of the combat techniques people have come up with. the reason anyone would want to even use Combat Psi is beyond me.
<br />
I'd rather be on a site that has been established for Years and has many an Experienced member to answer any questions that i may have.

			I think in your last post about your group, you were told not to bring the group up on PsiPog again, but I degress...
<br />

<br />
People can say whatever they want about any group they choose as long as the owner of the venue allows it.  If you dont like it, tough beans, ignore them. 
<br />

<br />
Psionics is a touchy issue in many places. That's why a &quot;combined&quot; organization of sites doesn't exist. It has been tried before, and it ended up being more trouble than it was worth.  I started a group called UOPC, and some of the mods from here remember THAT one (notably Peebs, ESS, and Mannen, I think maybe Roy too).
<br />

<br />
There will always always always, be psychic sites that disagree with eachother. Trust me, you guys aren't &quot;hated&quot; and there is no &quot;war&quot; or anything like that.  There have been far, far worse situtations that have come up between two or more sites. This isn't something to worry about.
<br />

<br />
Also, if you have announcements for your members, post it on YOUR forums, not ours. Thanks
<br />

The best Offence is a good defence, come on mike, you're old enough to know that!

Frankly, i wouldn't want to be affiliated with a site that condones Combat, but that's just me.
