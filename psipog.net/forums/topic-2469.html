			Ok, This is newbish, but What are the Diffrences between the Astral and Ethric planes? I know in one you can die in, I think. And one more question, when you project or have an OBE is it possible to change you appearance? So that you could like what you want to?

Personally i think that this is a load of BS, i think that there is no difference between the planes.
<br />

<br />
YOU CANT DIE!!! there is absolutly no way possible you can die while in OBE state because you have no physical matter. How would you die? anything is possible while in an OBE so you cant hurt yourself nor is there anything out there that wants to hurt you. there are some people that have been doing OBE's for 40 years and not once have they reported being hurt.
<br />

<br />
-Your second question&gt;&gt;&gt; I saw a simular question on another thread about changing apperence if i find it i will edit this post. Basically all you have to do if you want to change appearence is concentrate on how you would look and how it would feel, for example if you wanted to grow a pair of wings on your back all you have to do is really concerntrate on the thought of having wings try to feel them growing from your back and visualise it too and before you know it BAM, a pair of wings at your disposal.
<br />

<br />
I have tried to change in animal several times i get half way there and then my astral body  returns to the physical one.

Well, that's not entirely true.  Monroe reports feeling his life in danger a few times... the one time that sticks out in my mind is when he was fighting a dog/wolf-like creature, which he believed was trying to do harm to his body while he was away.  The truth is that no one really knows what is possible in an OBE because it isn't understood at all, really.  Some people have experiences that sound very dangerous.  At this point, it's impossible to tell if they were in REAL danger (or maybe just hallucinated some danger).

			My opinions regarding the differences between the Etheric/Ethereal Plane and Astral Plane, which I myself am not entirely sure of, are as follows:
<br />

<br />
The Ethereal Plane (as you call it) is somewhere between our plane of waking existence and the Astral Plane. It is exactly like the physical plane in terms of being a solid environment that we cannot change through mental exertion. I don't know the mental laws that govern it, though, so there could be many other things possible there.
<br />

<br />
The Astral Plane is easier to connect to. I don't know why, could have something to do with the various states of brainwave patterns that people emit. (alpha, beta, gamme, delta). And of course, the Astral Plane is less bound by the laws that govern our physical reality. We can change our environment there, at will (with varying degrees of difficulty depending on the skill/connection of the person) and we can change our physical form (or &quot;projected self&quot;) while there. Within the Astral Plane, you can do pretty much whatever your mind conjures. But, when all is said and done, you return to your body and that's that. 
<br />

<br />
Someone once told me that you can take your actual physical body into the Ethereal Plane and use it as a means of travel. Can't remember who.
<br />

<br />
I've been to the astral plane many times, and I truly believe that while there and connected well, I cannot be harmed by another entity.
<br />

<br />
However, I believe I've had my astral, or &quot;energy&quot; body pulled into the Ethereal Plane several times, and attacked. Each time I struggled free, but it <span style="font-style: italic">was</span> as struggle. I believe a person can be harmed on that particular vibrational plane of existence.
<br />

<br />
Edit, to MikeV:
<br />

<br />
There is a difference in the vibrational frequency, and therefore in all the laws that govern, the Ethereal and Astral Planes. There are more planes of existence than you can count, or ever hope to think of while you're still a fleshpod human.
<br />

<br />
On the astral plane, with a strong enough connection, and powerful mind's eye, you can transform into whatever the hell you want. You can create other creatures or people if you want (though they are just projections of your mind) You can do pretty much anything you've ever daydreamed of doing, and so much more. Sprout wings on your back? Why don't you just transform into a gigantic bird creature or a dragon? turn into a dog or wolf? Make it cooler, make it a werewolf. Lol. 
<br />
There are endless possibilities.
