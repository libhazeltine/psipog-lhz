			In the psionic community, for some reason people like to invent new terms.  The largest offense is adding terms in front of the word &quot;kinesis&quot; to create a new psychokinetic related skill.
<br />

<br />
Basically: it's retarded.  So don't do it.
<br />

<br />
Below are the ONLY terms that should have &quot;kinesis&quot; in it:
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Scientific Terms</span>
<br />
Psychokinesis (PK)
<br />
Micro-Psychokinesis (Micro-PK)
<br />
Macro-Psychokinesis (Macro-PK)
<br />
Direct Mental Interaction with Living Systems (DMILS)
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Slang Terms</span>
<br />
Telekinesis (TK, try to use PK instead)
<br />
Pyrokinesis (Pyro-PK)
<br />
Cryokinesis (Cryo-PK)
<br />
Biokinesis (Bio-PK, try to use DMILS instead)
<br />

<br />
Anything that isn't on this list is subject to being politely corrected, edited, deleted, laughed at, etc.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">If you would like information</span> on how to do something-kinesis, then just don't use the word!  Don't use the word.  Type out what the word means.  For example, &quot;Do you have any information on geokinesis?&quot; = retarded.  However: &quot;Do you have any information on moving dirt using psychokinesis&quot; = better.  But the BEST version would be to simply understand that moving dirt with PK... STILL FALLS UNDER PK.  So just use PK.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Please be aware</span> that these vocabulary restrictions don't mean we think it's impossible to move dirt, or effect electricity.  It's certainly possible!  We just don't like the terms people use for it, and we don't like people making up random terms and adding &quot;kinesis&quot; to the end, in an attempt to sound &quot;cool&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Thank you.

			Wikipedia has  a lot of the 'whack' forms of kinesis branding on it. Umbrakinesis, atmokinesis, just to name a few. I just tend to stick to Telekinesis, but I do have a tendancy to slip sometimes and use &quot;electrokinesis&quot;. Is Macrokinesis acceptable? I was meaning Macro Psychokinesis but it just came out as Macrokinesis in my post.

Macrokinesis isn't a word, but it's certainly more understandable than the other terms that float around.  Just edit your post.

			Actually, &quot;electrtokinesis&quot; is called &quot;Remote Electron Tampering.&quot;
<br />

<br />
And I think it is
<br />
PK- Pyrokinesis
<br />
TK- Telekinesis
<br />
CK- Cryokinesis
<br />
BioTK- Biological Telekinesis
<br />

<br />
Although, this is just the names of the applications.  PK and CK are really the same thing, and they are all Psychokinesis.  Psychokinesis is the broad term for mentally influecing a physical object.
<br />

<br />
But yes, the best way to say this would be, &quot;using psychokinesis to...&quot;  but who wants to write that?  The four main ones are above.

Where are you even getting that information from?  I googled &quot;Remote Electron Tampering&quot; and it pulled up information on VIDEO GAMES.
<br />

<br />
Hint: video games are not a good resource for legitimate information.

My original post still holds.

Indeed they are, the terms ~ Kinesis are slang - with many being taken  from various video games. 
<br />

<br />
They are generally looked down upon because they show ignorance.

			Basically, all other suffixes of kinesis aren't types of kinesis, they are just are a mis-naming for what you may do with psychokinesis. For example, to talk about making an object cold you need not refer to a term like cryokinesis. Just simply state that you use <span style="text-decoration: underline">psychokinesis</span> to make an object cold. Simply put, it clears the air of unnecesary jargon.

			The word 'pyrokinesis' helps making conversation easier. I understand that it's made up by private persons, but then again, that goes for a lot of other words too, right?

I'll avoid using the word, but I think many people are going to tire quickly of the phrase &quot;heating things with PK&quot;.

  I do understand the reason for this list, peebrain, I think it would be good if psipog had an official list of term and their definition, one of the real drags is having to explain abreviations or some things mean..... I used to think electrokinesis was a valid term
