I'm pretty sure that would be telepathic projection which is possible. It will make your target(s) think there is something there when it isn't or vice versa.
<br />

<br />
*on topic* I hope to accually do these so in my mind they're possible.
<br />
-Play monopoly with tk sliding the pieces around the board. (may get since monopoly is the never ending game).
<br />
-Play marbles with tk.
<br />
-Unlock\lock doors.
<br />
-Flick light switches or push buttons.
<br />
-Trip a friend (by use of force bubble). *slowly drifting from what I will try.
<br />
-Push myself on the swings lol.
<br />
-Skateboard without any accually skating, just tk rolling me.
<br />
ehh it's endless

Toy car racing! I would probably be racing, and most likely losing, to a snail, but it would be fun.
<br />

<br />
Levitating my dog would be cool. Freak him out a little.

What is it with you guys and unlocking doors? I get the feeling i'll wake up one day to a TK crime spree.

victim: &quot;The door unlocked itself and the TV just flew right out.&quot;

			Nudging your friends pen at school so they make a scribble on the page. hehe. 
<br />
Rolling your friends pencil when only they are looking, freak them out. And when they call a teacher or a friend to see it, stop doing it so they think they are crazy.
<br />
Making a liquid go up a straw and into your mouth.
<br />
(not possible) Causing your friends mobile to go off. Again...and again......and again.
<br />
Stiring food in the pan.
<br />
Peeling an orange. (HAAAAAARD)
<br />

<br />
Anything to do with computer can be done rather easily compared to more physical stuff. I would love to control my mouse without touching it and make words appear on the screen.

			Doesn't that involve manipulating probability, which needs a random number generator? - So you could get one, and get a program which averages out the numbers (1 &amp; 0) generated over a short amount of time, then move the cursor based on the average?
<br />

Just a theory.

Oh yeah.. damn. Well, maybe if you're really good you can force the computer to change 0's and 1's. Might break it though.

			Hmm... *blow up a light bulb and freak people out.
<br />
*use PK to win at sports <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> 
<br />
*bother cat, (or maybe people) by tickeling their hair.
<br />
*make a cold drink warm, (works well when people are expecting it cold, obviously.)
<br />
*try and poke people five feet away, (may be difficult if you want s strong poke.)
<br />
*try and light a light bulb in your hand
<br />
*knock down card-houses, (fun if thier really big ones)
<br />
*knock small items off of peoples' desks, (really fun if done repeatedly.)
<br />
*put out candles on a birthday cake before they have a chance to blow.  
<br />

<br />
All I got for now...
