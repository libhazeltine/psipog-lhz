			For experienced telepaths - is the psi-sig basically the imprint, or sensation of presence that u get from people, thats individual to different people? I know it sounds like a dumbass question - but the sensation Im thinking of comes off literature and poetry as well, its hard to explain - but I was wondering - under the risk of serious abuse by the likes of Scorch - if the 2 were the sam thing?
<br />

<br />
I can elaborate about the sensation! Its kind of like n individual, and really subtle feel more than anything else that you get off things and people, in particular when reading literature/ poetry or looking at art?
<br />

<br />
any help would be appreciated!

			I personally get sigs by location. Not physical location, just wherever their sig is. I don't quite understand your homo literature part though, so could you rephrase it into a tangible question? Thanks.

			he is trying to compare the feeling you get from reading, hearing (this wors with music too) someone's personal work, and catching someone's sig. I dunno if there is a correlation.

			I'm not really sure about this whole signature business... I can sense if someone I know is approaching when I don't actually see them approaching, but a lot of times I don't know much beyond the fact that I know that. There have been a few times when I knew exactly who the person was who was about to show up at my door or call on my phone etc, but I don't know if that's related to the person's sig.... and personally, I can't understand how some people can get signatures off of people on chat. I get a particular &quot;feel&quot; for each individual, but I attribute that to the spelling of their chat handle, rather than their &quot; psychic signature&quot;.

			thanks - do you think we're actually percieving something when we experience that sensation or is it something we cobble together from what we see/know.understand?

			What I meant was the psi-sig might not be a seperate entity but a product of the mind - the feeling could be the product of the mind putting together what you associate with another person into one sensation, the psi-sig.
<br />

<br />
I was just curious, I havent had enough experience to argue either way - what do you think?

			oh.. well, call it what you will. bottom line is, thats how you feel around someone (especially people you know) and you can catch this essence at will.

			I have a question.  How do you know if you are linking or whatever to the intended target, if they do not know you are doing it?  Suppose you are trying to communicate with a friend that is many states away from your home but you do not call them on the phone, yet you feel that you have their signature.  How do you know whether or not your are being effective, whether or not  you are conjuring up thoughts of yourself in their head and that they are thinking of you more than usual?
