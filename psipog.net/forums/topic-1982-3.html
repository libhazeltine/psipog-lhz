			Yeah i agree a spoon bending video would be pretty cool to watch as long as they proved the spoon was real somehow first then did it. And apollo to move your hole puncher you would have had to of used like some big industrial magnet so i don dbout your is real but like sliding pens and the psi wheels are hard to beleive. Even under a glass if the pole that the psi wheel is on is stuck to the paper and a motor makes the pole rotate wollah there you have it a real looking psi wheel.

			hey, have you guys ever thought about what a great expenditure of energy it is to put up a website like this and have all these senior members lie about their developed skills just to fake it for people. thats a whole lot of free time on these guys hands just to be faking it. the time it would take to magnetize a hole puncher, get a really strong magnet to go thru the table, thats alot.
<br />
have you guys seen the videos from this site, <a href="http://www.ppsociety.com/w_media.php" target="_blank">http://www.ppsociety.com/w_media.php</a>
<br />
check out the ice cube, or the fork one,

			fors starters apollo a pencil can have a peice of metal pushed in to it so magents affect it or some other way because it can easily be faked. but thats not the point of this forum. I just wanted to see some good videos that yeah could still be fake but look more real then the ones already out. Also i know it would be pointless for a heap of people to run this website if it wasnt real but again notthing to do with what im talking about. I belive strongly in psychich abilities i just would like to see some good videos that can help me assure myself that its real so i dont have doubt in my mind holding me back.

			There are many more ways than just magnets. Magician's string could do it. Even angling and rolling the object, but making the surface appear level, could be done. 
<br />

<br />
There are many tricks I could think of to create an effect, what would make me think are the tricks I am not thinking of.

			Videos are nice, but I really don't see why peoplewant them so badly.  Granted, they do help by giving an actual image to go by rather than some sketchy visualization, but the effect is purely temporary. 
<br />

<br />
If you really want to believe its you then just keep doing it and you'll know.  When I started out I had no idea, and I kept seeing threads and comments just like the ones spoken here about how this or that can be faked.  I was a bit of a skeptic too, but I realized that no amount of videos or debating the point would get me anywhere and tried it for myself.  I see that both Jeshe and Kief are relatively recent members, so I want to ask a question first: have you tried PK for yourself yet?  And if so, have you had any results?  If you have, but aren't sure about them, then no video will convince you of what is being done, only you can.  If you haven't (tried or succeeded) then keep at it.  Look at it this way, compare what you have to lose by trying it for yourself, to what you could gain from &quot;wasting&quot; a few small moments of your entire life.  I know that kinda sucks, but thats basically what you're stuck with.  We all were as well.  And though Apollo is very good, I'm sure he was in the same situation at some point. (Unless your a natural, Apollo, if so then sorry for the assumption lol)
<br />

<br />
Lol, it wouldn't matter if there were any new videos for me anyway, because I'm still stuck in the world of dial-up and even 20 second videos take forever to load, or download.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			Yeah i have actually been a member of psipog for about 3 years. I also had another account on the forums which i cant remember the username or password so i made a new one because i saw my old pis wheel and thought that i might try it again.
<br />

<br />
Honestly this forum has nothiong to do with scepticism(if thats a word) it has to do with me trying tk after about a years break and not being able to do anything and wanting to see a decent video which can help boost my beleif in psychic abilities. I did not start this thread for a argument/discussion on wether the videos are real becasue as i have said in other posts and have read on psipog since the media section was first open i understand they arent meant to be there saying see it must be true they are there for ppl to show their skill and to show others what tk looks like. I just watched a few videos and thought they were a bit sketchy so i thought i would ask for a video which is not filmed exactly like all the other ones are. I did not want to argue about scepticism as i 100% believe.
<br />

<br />
p.s teekay, i was able to move the psi wheel really well for a while but then got distracted with school and stopped. now i cant do jack and want to start trying again.
<br />

<br />
p.p.s bummer on the crappy connection. mine is only 256k adsl so it aint that much better but does alright.

Oh, hell i was a new to tk once.  So was everyone else.  I looked up to Float, NI and all the people you guys do.  I wanted to see the movies because it gave me a goal to get to.  All i did was practice everyday for a long time.

			Hey apollo!  I rewatched both your pencil moving and hole pucher movies and i was wondering.  In the pencil one you are pushing the pencil.  in the hole puncher one you pulling.  Is one way better do  you think??? Or is it just pulling a bigger object is easier cause with physical force it is easier??
<br />

<br />
Just thinking.  Trying to move a pen and when i watch your movies, it wiggles in the corner of my eye.  But i cant get it to do it when i accualy watching it.  well i have but not all the time.
<br />

<br />
get a good camra!!!  or borrow one...
