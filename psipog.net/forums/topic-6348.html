			i was reading on chakras and the flow of energy in the body and i heard the term marma's. it said that these marma's are points, 107 points or so along the body that control the flow of &quot;Prana&quot; through the body and these points could be used for healing. i was wondering if anyone has a pic of all these marma points and if they knew which points do what. i heard some of these points could be used to triple or even quadruple a persons strength and speed.

thanks,

			This sounds awfully like something off of Naruto...

Anyways, I personally don't believe in chakras. Never heard of the other term. I think that Martial Artist might have some good information on this.

			until yesterday i hadn't heard of the term marma's either, it is supposed to be a term from india, i believe there is a martial arts known as marma adi where these points are used to both heal and to cause damge to your opponent.

			You sent me a Pm, and I didn't understand because I never heard the words marma before. There are so many different names these days. But now that dawu posts that picture, I recognise these points. I even work with them quite alot to help people. They are points along the meridians (sp?). They regulate the emotional energy-body. I use especially the first 13 'marmas' to bring balance to people. You can use them to release someone or yourself of unwanted emotions and you can use these points to program someone's nervous system and subconscious. That way you can get rid of some nasty habits or some nasty feelings of disturbances within, and program the nervous system with a positive counter-feeling instead. It works really well.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, there are many interesting points in the body. There are thousands of chakras so to say both in the grosser bodies as well as in the subtler bodies. This system of the marmas is just another system to classify those points. You could use them to harm others I suppose, and you can deffinately use them to aid others. However, these marma points deal with the physical body (which includes the pranic body) and I find that chakras are more interesting and more life-changing than these points. They are handy to bring some emotional balance to a person, but besides that, I don't use it that much.
