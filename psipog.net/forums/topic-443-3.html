I'm gonna put that in, then Dante's Inferno, cause it's 16 mins long, lawl.

I suck at videos, but I'll do this AGAIN, if I have to. And a third time. But no more than three. Then I'll just castrate them and make 'ends meet'.

			No, I suck. I can't even move the wheel.
<br />

<br />
The whole time I've spent on psipog (a few weeks before they put away the psipog client), I've hardly done any psi, myself. But, I did attend the cutlery-bending thing in psipog earlier today, but got no results - I didn't expect any anyway. 
<br />

<br />
XD I help more people on THEIR path to success (I've referred alot of people, and made them interested), in numbers, than even helping myself for minutes.
<br />

<br />
Gah. I really need somebody to get ME to learn, someone who's doing the same work as me <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
But, I'll be uploading the video within an hour to Putfile (www.putfile.com).
<br />

<br />
I'll post the links in a new thread, and some instructions, that the music, they may not like.
<br />

<br />

Edit: Video's been uploaded, in it's own topic ^_^

Pyrodragon, i am also a little capable of preforming PK on a paper on a pin. many, REAL many people can do it. since this &quot;skill&quot; isnt &quot;normal&quot; people that doesnt know about it gets afraid. and when they are afraid, they do like everbody else, they protect yourself. and then start searching for small things that &quot;may proove&quot; that the media stuff are faked.
<br />

<br />
these skeptics doesn't want to understand how PK works. and theirfor we cant tell them or &quot;proove&quot; that PK really exists. if they just had a little more self-confidense to try new stuff. they would have started to read thew material on psipog.net and many other sites and they would tried the basic experiments them self. and by that, they would, as everybody else, learned something that would amaze them so much that they woudn't know what do belive (like everbody else). 
<br />

<br />
there really isnt anything PKable people can do to proove it. we can show them PK live - in real life. but even then they wouldn't belive it. they first will when they WANT to LEARN it. 
<br />

<br />
the only thing i cant understand is how the heck these people who are so good at this stuff with photoshop and advanced techniques about cameras , how they managed to lead their curiosity around topics about psychic stuff and straight to digital photo manipulation?

			hehe, it's always fun to see how a 1337-Photoshop-expert takes a photo, rips it apart and explains how it was totally made with photoshop. It's double as fun if you really know how that photo was made, because you were there. 
<br />

<br />
Keep looking for graphical elements that look so &quot;unreal&quot;. Maybe you'll find a ghost and an ufo in that photo, too, so you can finally prove Randi wrong.
<br />

Sorry, I'm too busy right now to get into details. It was still fun to find this thread. It really made my day <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I still have the original JPEG, that is un-modified from the day NI sent it to me.  If any SERIOUS graphic artists want to analyze it, I can send it to you.  The only reason I keep that banner on the public image (&quot;NI doing TK for REAL!&quot;) is because I knew it would be copied without permission, and I didn't want someone else to take credit for the picture.  (and it HAS been copied many times without permission since then).
<br />

<br />
If you are serious and actually know what you're doing (not just looking at the picture and saying, &quot;hmm that shadow is off&quot;), then I can send you the file.  Be prepared to tell me exactly what you intend on doing that you can't do with the public image posted on PsiPog.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: the funny part is that, in the original attack on the picture, if all those &quot;mistakes&quot; were fixed, then you would still find something wrong, or if you couldn't find anything wrong, then you would say it's &quot;<span style="font-weight: bold">too</span> good!&quot; and must be fake.

			Yeah, I'm with Sean on this one. If there is anyone who knows what photo manipulation is all about, then you are welcome to take it and analyze it.
<br />

<br />
Maybe this thread is a good way to train your healthy skepticism. I want you to know guys, that I'm open to constructive skepticism. If you have your doubts, you have the right to explore them.
<br />

<br />
Nevertheless, first you've got to decide what the subject of your skepticism is NI or TK.
<br />

<br />
If it's NI, then I have got to say something.
<br />
You may want to ask yourself a few questions:
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">1. Why is NI here for so many years?</span>
<br />
I'm here because I've got friends in this community that I love to talk to and discuss different topics with. Besides I'm here because some people are interested in hearing about my experiences in tk. At last, I'm here because I think that we all together can create something unique in this community.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">2. Is NI looking for attention?</span>
<br />
60 employees of mine rely on my judgement. I've got to deal with dozens of pretty &quot;consuming&quot; topics daily. And sometimes I go through difficult times, I know that many people depend on me. In fact, the last thing I need is a stalker kid from US. I don't need your attention nor respect to feed my self esteem. I don't need more responsibilities. Those of you who know about my inner values also know who I am.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">3. Is NI a faker?</span>
<br />
Yes, No, Maybe? That's a possibility you'll have to live with. You are not really going to trust a guy from Europe, just because he writes cool stuff about telekinesis, are you? <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />
Personally, I think I've got no reasons at all to lie to people. Nevertheless that could be another lie. So what's the solution to this dilemma? More proof? No. You are not going to get anything. We've been through this before. I don't feel any need to prove anything. I can live my life the same old way, whether you think I'm a lier or not. Your &quot;respect&quot; won't pay my bills either.
<br />
You may have good reasons to think that I'm a faker. That's a possibility you have to keep in your mind. That's what healthy skepticism is all about. You don't want to end up following a complete wacko, do you? <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
You're here to explore things on your own. I'm not going to be always there, I'm also not able to show you guys exactly what to do. Even though we are a community, in psi progress we completely depend only on our own selves. We are here to share our experiences. Take what you need, test it. If it works, keep it; if it doesn't, throw it away. Don't make your progress dependant on any person but yourself. Rely on your own possibilities. Know that you can progress and explore on your own. This is your life, and you should find on your own how to live it.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Again: </span>
<br />

<br />
Skepticism is an important tool as long as you keep it flexible and open-minded. Keep up the good work.
<br />

<br />
NI is just an insignificant, not important guy from Europe, who doesn't play a big role in your psi progress. So why bother?
<br />

<br />

<br />
