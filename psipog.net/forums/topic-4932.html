			Hey guys, I haven't been on in a long time, but in regards to the &quot;telepathy&quot; between your dog for instance, I have a theory that may work? I'm not sure if someone had already addressed this so I apologize if it's something already out there. Just that I thought about it right now and thought I should log on to share. 
<br />

<br />
So last I had logged on, people were saying dogs, for instance, speak an entirely different language to humans. Which is true! No lie. However! What about those commands we've taught our pets? They register the sounds we create in order for them to do a task. &quot;Sit&quot; for example, if your dog recognizes that, then that's one &quot;human word&quot; that your dog understands. So would it not then be possible to telepathically talk to your dog?
<br />

<br />
It would be entirely limited, but I say it's still possible to talk to your dog. Sure, it's not carrying a conversation, and it's not like your dog talks back. But try it and tell me how that turned out!
<br />

What do you mean by &quot;pure humans&quot; as far as I'm concerned all humans are pure humans as we have not and cannot produce offspring with any animals except for other humans therefore all humans are pure humans, no ifs or buts about it I am pure humans you are pure humans we all are pure human.

			If telepathy is the transfer of thoughts and ideas, then sure, it's possible to communicate with your dog if you really want to. It's not going to be in the same way as with a human, and it probably won't be very clear (cross-species thought mingling, aaah), but dogs have thoughts, and therefore it should be possible to use telepathy with them. If thought and emotion can transcend language, why not species as well? If said animal has a thinking mind, then the fact they are thinking should be enough to enable an application of telepathy, and no-one can dispute the fact that dogs can be pretty intelligent (when it suits them  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> ).

What i think is that humans are just another animal we evolved from other animals, it is just that i dont believe there can be a pure or impure human for example dogs can breed with different types of dogs but they are still pure dogs, we cant breed with any other creature on earth except other humans because we have 46 chromosomes no other animal has this and that is why we cant produce offspring except with other humans and in any case i believe animals are smarter than humans just not in the technological sence.

			Complex thoughts wouldn't work but something like... warm would work I think. Like if your dog was outside in the cold you could try projecting the feeling of warmth and the concept of inside.

Edit: to try to get it to come inside that is. Of course, just calling it might work better.

			I already mentioned it once, but i shall say again, to make what i said more clear.
<br />
 I never ment impure in physical manner, when you are 'impure', your astral self is that not of a human's by default.
<br />

<br />
Define &quot;complex thougths&quot;, please. 
<br />
If i understood it correctly, the complex thougths would always confuse a human.
<br />
The &quot;large questions&quot; for humans are tiny, it's just not seeing the wood from the trees, so to say.

			Eh I actually tried to connect to my dog the other day and it actually worked. He was on my bed sleeping when I was at my desk reading a bunch of articles on telepathy. Sooo, since I was alone in my house I thought I would try it on my dog. I sent him the word &quot;outside&quot; which he does know, usally when I say &quot;You want to go outside&quot; he runs to my backyard door. So when I sent him the word &quot;outside&quot; he woke up and looked at me. I'm pretty sure he was thinking if I just said that or did he think it, after he cocked his head and looked at me, he ran to my backyard door...like he always would.
<br />

<br />
So I guess telepathy with animals is possible. Although I dont beleive the shit on animal planet with the animal psychic <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			I've tries this before and it is the most difficult thing I've ever tried... It's the fact that you consciously think that you can't really understand what your animal (in my case, a bird) is thinking. I found it a really dangerous thing to do... I nearly hurt my bird... <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I tried this ages ago and I'm a rubbish telepathic but I had a really good connection with my pet because I see him everyday for at least 4 hours. Anyway, I read about it and thought &quot;hey, lots of wierd things have happened lately. Why not try?&quot; I had a VERY open mind back then and so thought yea, I'll see how it goes. I sat for an hour before I passed out screaming with a headache. I heard what my bird was thinking though and most of it I didn't understand but I did catch up my name... It was really wierd... And it feels wierd. All the silence and then a sudden bombardment of thoughts.. Hundreds of them. My bird started flying around and going crazy at that point but this all happened like last year.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for bringing my memories  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
