			Alright, I'm looking for my &quot;Transformers Armada&quot; minicons, for use as characters in a crossover between my webcomic and another.
<br />

<br />
They are circled/pointed out in this image from my webcomic (I removed the dialogue and special effects to make it easier) 
<br />
<a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v87/Cthon98/Misc/minicons.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink">Click for an image of them (They're circled or have arrows pointing to them)</a>
<br />

<br />
And I would really like to find them. I run the comic &quot;Nukeland Cinema&quot; and I have a crossover planned for today's update with the webcomic &quot;In space, no-one can hear starscream&quot;
<br />

<br />
Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.
<br />

<br />
Oh yeah, if location is needed, my exact location can be found here

(its the only one in Nova Scotia)

<br />
Edit: I see you guys use some sort of coordinates system. Any idea how to get these coordinates for my situation?

<br />
First on a dark platform thing, Raised off the ground. If it's not there I reckon it's between that and what I think is a bed.
<br />
Second one is in the same room but I reckon it's closer to the door.
<br />

<br />
Only done the first two coz Im not sure what ones in the pic are lost. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			ALl of the ones I've circled or drawn arrows pointing to are the ones that are lost. I used that pic as its the only one I have of them (Its a panel from my comic with the dialogue removed.) I have three &quot;Dark platforms&quot; in my room (pastic things I use to keep stuff off the floor that could get damaged if wet.)
<br />
I've searched two of them prior. One has my computer on it and nothing else, one has some other stuff (But I really scoured through that) and the third one has alot of boxes, mostly containing books.
<br />

<br />
And I have a VERY strong suspicion they are all together. I was talking to another psychic/psionic type earlier who was helping me until he had to go, and he directed me to these forums.

- When you do this don't describe the item. <span style="font-weight: bold">If you describe the item you may be doing nothing but hurting your chances of having the item found</span>. Telling someone what the item looks like (in more details) will only help people use their imagination and suffer from AOE or any other number of problems.

3) If you have any other details mention them.

- Maybe the urgency or whatever. Like I said up there... please don't describe the item.

			Alright, I had to use my backup script for that comic, but I would still like to find these figures. I've attempted RVing myself, but all I can get is the inside of what seems to be some sort of box, and they're clearly all together. However, I haven't the slightest how to figure out where that box IS.

			attempt to do that again. only when seeing the box with the figures inside try imaging your sight as a camera and zoom out to try and get surroundings. Jus' giving ideas.
