			I'd just like to start off by thanking Peebrain and everyone else who has been running this site for years. It really is, in my opinion, the most, if not only reliable site on the web for anything psi-related. 
<br />

<br />
I stumbled upon this site about two years ago when I was about 16. I started playing with PK and the psiwheel and after about 6 months I was able to move it with varying degrees of consistancy. Like many others, I generally lost interest for a while, and I never progressed beyond the psiwheel. 
<br />

<br />
Fast-forward a few years to today. I have this baseball on my desk that I like to fiddle with whenever I'm waiting for stuff to download, programs to load, etc. It was kinda out of the blue, and I didn't really plan it, but the ball was sitting on my desk and I felt the urge to try and roll it towards me using pk. I had tried this earlier in the week, but with no real success. To my suprise, I had it rolling towards me in less than a minute. It didn't move far, but it was enough to push any doubt out of my mind that it was anything but pk.
<br />

<br />
Note that I still haven't tried moving the psiwheel again, nor have I really been practicing pk, except for a few attempts here and there like today. Maybe those who are stuck on the psiwheel should take a few years off and come back to try something new  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Seems to be the general concensus about psi. You stop for a while, and it'll start working.

Good job though, I suggest you get back into it if you have enough time. It's worth it, no?
