Yeah, that sounds about right to me.... only when it's the use of Psi, it's just ritualized Psi. Also, I've found it to be rather hard to tell whether it's demons or Psi. But we'll not get into that on the public thread.

			Sgtpsion and supersaiyainsith have brought up the one quarrel I have with not recognizing psionics as a part of magick.  By not using archangels, dieties, demons and all that stuff when performing the psion's form of &quot;magick&quot; (called direct magick loooooong before psi was ever around) is that you put in place a barrier of ignorance.  This ignorance is the cause of people trying too hard to be scientific.  They can't just accept that there are some basic holes in every theory about psionics but regardless attempt to embrace psi as a psionic theory.  After all, it can't be denied that psionics exists, but we also have been conditioned to be extremely skeptical of all things unscientific.  This is a serious problem because though one does know the cause of psionics (our will or desires, sub/consciously) and the results (moving shit, reading minds, etc.), they don't know the MECHANISM.
<br />

<br />
By simply assuming that it's their brains or souls or what-have-you that are exclusively connecting the cause and effect, they deliberately become ignorant to the fact that ANYTHING could tie the cause and effect together.  Whether it actually is all due to the psion, an astral entity, a diety, demon, etc. is completely unknown because the psion assumes prematurely that they are in complete control.  So as long as the psion wills something to happen then it happens, they remain ignorant and so should those supernatural beings exist, the psion is allowing themselves to be used and toyed with.  So rather than being ignorant, dig deeper.  That's the only way to be sure you're actually controlling your abilities rather than being used as a pawn for fun or energy.

yeah, direct magick has been around for centuries, but you're mistaken, it is simply the use of magick without rituals. Direct magic itself is agnostic to those causes.

okay, let's see... yeah, people do try too hard to be scientific, and when they do, they usually fail miserably, look at creationists. but skepticism in general is good...

Never said skepticism was bad, in fact I never even mentioned it because it's irrelevant to my point.  I was explaining WHY people were being overly scientific, and how it was a folly to do so.  &quot;Skeptical&quot; and &quot;scientific&quot; are very different terms and are mutually exclusive.

Under Crowley's definition, &quot;the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will&quot;, then a whole lot of things are magick.

Yes, that would be the case IF you went by that definition... My definition, as I said was &quot;manipulating energy to cause a change.&quot;

 But you're still using psi to do it. You're still manipulating the energy. You using tools to do it, but still doing it nonetheless. As I said, Magick is psi without the religious aspect. What you were bringing into view was a major religious aspect of magick.

Elements can be manipulated just the same as energy can. When you invoke a god, you bring their higher energies into yourself.. Hey, don't you bring other energies into yourself when you make a psi-ball?

It's funny how people explain things.  For example, in this thread, Dbizket explains, &quot;whenever you manipulate energy for TK or whatever you're doing, you're really casting spells.&quot;  But for me, I see the opposite.  Whenever you do magick, you're really doing psionics plus a bunch of other useless garbage.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
We'll agree to disagree there. Psi is the very core of magick. You can't do magick if you can't manipulate energy. When both are viewed by an energy manipulation, the 2 are one in the same. 
<br />

Again, all the same. Also, no one knows what's going on depending on how you look at it. But remember that people feel the connections to the astral dieties the same as people feel connections between each other when using telepathy and empathy. They feel it, and know what's going on and know they're right. Not being sure what's going on only raises a religious debate. As you said (for once), do what works.

Of course non-religious people would favor psionics over magick considering that psi is magick without the religious aspect of it. Thank you for proving my point. And you're right on the fact that magick is another belief system as it's WAY more in depth than psionics. But just dealing with psionics is only a tiny fraction of the picture. That's why I don't understand why some people only believe in psi and not magick and its principles. Wouldn't one favor the whole picture over a fraction of it?

I'm not even sure what you're arguing.  You are saying that magick and psionics use the same mechanism?  Yes, probably so.

You're arguing that psionics is magick minus the religion?  Hmmm... ok.  I don't really study or practice magick, so I don't know, but I think it's a little more complicated than that.

Where did I say that magick is BS?  I am openly stating that I don't study it.  I am openly stating that I think it produces results.  I am openly stating that if it makes sense to you, and you want to practice it... go for it!
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">I see.... Uh, aren't you choosing between one and the other?</span>
<br />

<br />
Yes, I personally have chosen to practice psionics.  My original statement means that I don't think others must choose to practice only psionics.  I don't care what other people practice, and they are free to study and try out whatever they want.  I don't care if some of PsiPog's members practice magick... that's great.  But at the same time - PsiPog is about psionics.  So if you're looking for some magick buddies, or magick discussion, PsiPog probably isn't the best place to go looking.  This follows the same logic that you probably wouldn't go to a fishing website to ask about cooking cupcakes.  Sure, you might find a few people there that know a thing or two about cupcakes, but the topic at the website is fishing.  Go to a cupcake site if you want to talk about cupcakes.

The bolded text is where your reasoning has a hole.  That &quot;therefore&quot; has no place there because what belongs in this forum can't involve drugs or religion, both of which forms of magick use in their rituals and spells.  Yes, Psi is used in many forms of magick, but it's just one of a magician's tools.  It's like saying in a forum dedicated to talking about wrenches that because a wrench is a tool, every tool should be a subject of discussion.
<br />

<br />
So while &quot;direct magick&quot; would easily be discussed here because it is EXACTLY the same thing as psi, only with a different name and older roots, not all magicks can be topics of discussion.
<br />

<br />
Peebrain: Aleister Crowley is a terrible person to quote about the realities of magick.  In some people's minds, his fame seems to override the fact that he was a frickin loonie but in actuality he had very little real knowledge about magick and it's fundamentals.  He was just another pawn of astral entities that became obssessed with his powers.  And no one that's receiving their abilities from another being has a serious knowledge of metaphysics.

			Alright. So, I skipped the second page, so I dunno if this has been said or not, but here goes:
<br />

<br />
Psionics, and the material presented on psipog, all have to do with manipulating energy. Magic does too. The difference?
<br />

<br />
With Psionics, you manipulate the energy with your brain. No candles, symbols, whateverthehell, it's just you and the energy. With Magic, you (from what I've read elsewhere) have to use candles and symbols and all of that other stuff. Psionics isn't Magic. Magic is Psionics.
<br />

<br />
And, oddly enough, browsing through Magic websites has lead me to Psionics, with which I've had more pleasing results.

			Lightbringer i would kiss u if i could - but then you'd probably kill me but anyhoo -

Lightbringer makes the most, well one of the most, relevant points about the link between these various practices - and that is in understanding the mechanics of psionics etc. - by linking and approaching various practices and ideologies we can find a way to better understand what it is we (well you) do.  At the same time we can't make the mistake of linking them too closely together - i can't remember who it is that mentioned the part that rituals, entities, summonings etc. play in other practices - but these are characteristics that set them quite apart from each other and psionics. So the relevance of the ps/magic(what is with the damned k) link? that depends on how you approach it, but don't over or underestimate it. The two are both the same and yet completely different
<br />

<br />
+ Lightbringer's point on Crowley really pleased me - for gods sake the man lost the thread VERY early on - i reckon his work is important in some senses, but as usual and as sadly is the case in so many practitioners of whatever craft, they get a tad involved in themselves and not the goal - His work on the significance of the Will is pretty damned interesting though...

			I think I actually agree with Lightbringer for once! WOW! Putting this date on the calendar as a special one! 
<br />
Crowley WAS a nut. He lost the plot pretty good. I think we can leave that at that.
<br />

<br />
And, as many have hinted and vaguely (or maybe not so vaguely) speculated at, Magick is Psi, with a bunch of stuff added. As far as I can tell, the first parapsychologists decided to study paranormal effects (caused my magick, among other things), and try to find the bare-bones mechanism of it. What better way to do that than to do similar stuff to magick, and just take all the religious/spiritual stuff out of it? It would (in theory, at least) leave you with only the raw technique, mechanism, and effect. Which would make it reproducible under a greater range of conditions.

			Crowley was indeed a nut, I strongly disagree with him on most points, and I can't see much intelligence in his magic nor his beliefs, but I also know that he was a key in the revival of magic, though I think he would have done better if he LAID OFF THE HEROIN, and maybe he would have had a social life if he didn't FILE ALL HIS TEETH TO A SHARP POINT. And let's not forget his STD's, I believe his strongest association to such diseases was gonorrhea. So yeah, he ranks about the same as freud on the raving lunatic moron scale.

<br />

<br />
*sigh* I'll sum it up: direct magic-magic without use of rituals, meaning, as you put it: &quot;No candles, symbols, whateverthehell, it's just you and the energy. With Magic, you (from what I've read elsewhere) have to use candles and symbols and all of that other stuff.&quot;
<br />

<br />
you don't have to, it's just good for breaking mental barriers, I never bothered with rituals, and I am quite pleased with the results.
<br />

<br />
&quot;what is with the damned k&quot;
<br />

<br />
some use it out of habit, but it's meant to seperate stage magic, from real magick. I think for most in here it's just habit.

			Crowley's hyprocicy (spelling) is an important one though - the book of law describes the importance of the True Will which is diluted through, well life, society etc. His obsession with ritual and sex/drug magic(grudgingly drops in the k)s were dilutions of his will - sadly enough the idiot never realised that. From what ive read of Osman Spare and chaos magics they followed the tradition of the true will more closely. - But again they went a bit on the nutty side.
<br />

<br />
The great thing abut psionics is that the dilution of will is circumveted by a logical approach and the lack of any ritual - which is probably where the 2 are completely different and yet exactly the same. Originally Hermetic and Thelemic traditions were (this is my opinion) based on the True Will in its rawest form, as is or was early psionics, in time, as with all of these practices, the rise of ritual will lead to the same stagnation of thought etc. I hope you see my point - early magic(k)al traditions (well the ones that involved the True Will) are actually almost exactly like psionics, but in time became tainted by blahdeblahdeblah....
<br />

<br />
+ its arghuable that visualisation is a similar dilution of the will - but hey... im probably bullshitting
<br />

<br />
+ hermeticism - in alchemy has, if u read about it, some interesting relevance
