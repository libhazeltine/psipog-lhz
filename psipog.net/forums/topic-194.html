			I think people don't understand it. &quot;General&quot; forum means that you can talk about things not related to psi here. But it doesn't mean that you can dump your bird-brained crap here. Useless and dim 2-words-threads is the last thing we want here. Be aware that somebody pays for that bandwidth/space we use, so let's show a certain level of respect and gratitude each time we post by posting at least half-intelligent things. 
<br />

<br />
It's alright to chill, but it doesn't have to be grotesque.
<br />

<br />
Thank you.
<br />

<br />
P.S. You may have noticed that &quot;Be Intelligent&quot;-sign above the textbox where you write your messages.

			I know what you mean... this one person just posted a &quot;hello&quot; somewhere (forgot place), but yeah, the general discution topic usualy becomes a shithole filled with way too many topics, most of them unecesary.
<br />

<br />
  PS: is casual swearing allowed?
<br />

<br />
edit: oh just so I wont eternaly be seen as someone stupid, the post I was in a very misplaced topic

			I expect people to show some class when they post on these forums. Sometimes we talk about difficult topics here. And the last thing we need are kids flaming and posting idiotic comments in CAPS.
<br />

<br />
Keep it clean and professional, so everyone benefits and learns from your posts.
<br />

<br />
And I wasn't talking about the &quot;hello&quot;-threads, since they are actually allowed on that specific forum. I was talking about for example the thread where the author suggested a &quot;competition&quot; about &quot;who can post the largest quote of the previous posts in that thread&quot;. Needless to say that it's a nuclear weapon for this site's bandwidth. Completely stupid and useless.
<br />

<br />
I swear sometimes, too. Swearing is a weakness. I suggest for your personal good that you keep it under control.

I agree with you 100% Not_Important it also helps people to respect what we say more if we dont swear very often:)
<br />

i have a dum question does it take up bandwidth to add smiles to all your messages?

The &lt;img&gt; html tags of the page sent to you, but that's not significant... just a few more bytes

the actual image data is sent anyway when you make a post, and then they're cached

			I agree totally, but why do you let these kids/people play stupid games like: &quot;Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer&quot; or &quot;Put the one above you in jail&quot; etc.. These kind of posts defy intelligence in every aspect. Sure there are many things to talk about other than psionics, but somebody posting &quot;why do my hemeroids ich so much&quot; is just crap; and its really destroying the integrity of the forum..
<br />

<br />
When i first read about this forum, when it was still in the making, some extreeme rules were to be aplied, something like that you'll be only able to read posts at first, than gain some credibility and advance to talk about stuff too.. so everybody would make an effort to write reasonable things and contribute to the society.. i thought that was a bit too extreeme back than, but now i see it might not be so unreasonable.
