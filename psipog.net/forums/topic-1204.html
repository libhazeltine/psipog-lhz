			Do you practice ninjutsu too?
<br />
I just realized that kuji-in appears in the ninjutsu techniques. I checked it out. Seems like kuji-in is not just a handsign it's more of a buddhist/hindu? meditation thing. From what I read is to have a desired effect you have to do a proper handsign (mudra), visualize a proper symbol (mandala) and also chant (mantra). Buddhist three secrets or something, I don't know exactly.
<br />
Anyway, I don't practice kuji-in, but it looks like pure gold from eastern wisdom. Good, good, keep it up.

			bladeslinger, if your gonna start ninjitsu soon, i recommend finding someone that at least says that they are affiliated with Dr. Masaki Hatsumi, because he is the 34th grandmaster of the Togakure ryu family, the oldest family still left out of the Iga region. that way, if they are affiliated with him, you know that your training will be for real. my master was and is good friends with Hatsumi, so that way i knew i was getting the best in training. I don't know that much about the masters of the Koga region, but forget Koga, go Iga all the way! I know Stephen Hayes, even though he's gotten pretty old, teaches Iga's system of ninjitsu, he was trained directly by Hatsumi, and probably Richard Van Donk is a good choice too. Those are the only authentic ninja's i can think of that are here in America rite now. Try to look them up, i know you can order instructional videos from both.

			ok i was looking at the baisic kuji-in hand signs and seeing what each did, and all of them have an equal psi technique!
<br />

<br />

<br />
1- Rin - Strength of mind &amp; body, energy
<br />
2- Kyo -Master and direct energy, grounding
<br />
3- Toh - Harmony with the universe, balance and protection
<br />
4- Sha - Healing of self &amp; others, regeneration
<br />

<br />

<br />
rin is pooling, kyo is energy manipulation, toh is shielding and sha is healing!..i think all the spiritual techniques, no matter what its called can raise the effectiveness of another since all use energy in a different way thus letting you use energy to its full potential!....opinions are very welcome and i want other opinion <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
