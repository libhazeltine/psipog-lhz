			Never had an experience with an alien, but I've read Sylvia Browne's books and what someone said about anti-gravity technology coincides with what she said. She claimed that the aliens she saw were stumbling as if gravity was unfamiliar. Make sense, don't it?
<br />

<br />
Also, everyone is claiming &quot;what if the aliens are like this? like that?&quot; All I can say to that is than know one even knows that they think like us and if they have morals or the type of curiousness and intelligence we have.
<br />

<br />
As for how they look, I'm sure they can change their appearance. They probably want to help us along with our evolution and uses of our natural resources. Who knows.

			I've seen some shows on discovery about the whole reptiles in leadership positions around the world and also alien/human anit-grav technology....about the 1st part i think thats pretty phony seeing as it says George W Bush is one of em ( mabye he's so smart he's really good at acting dumb lol) but the anti-grav tech was cool. It actually gave you some understanding as to how it could work (was somthing along the lines of magnets and stuff distorting the actual space/time infront of them so the ships don't fly, they just SLIDE through space because theres nothing infront of them) somthing like that........what do you guys think about UFO's being found in ancient hyroglyphics and early cave paintings???  because they have been found. ...reports of some type of &quot;saucers&quot; or &quot;metal blobs&quot; in the sky have existed since man has....I think they've been watching us the whole time  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> ..but thats just me lol

Well, here's how it works, at least from what I've gathered.
<br />

<br />
There are the full reptilian aliens, which exist in the astral AND physical dimensions. (the opposite of us, because their perspective defaults in the astral and they have to look &quot;into&quot; the physical, whereas our perspective is in the physical and we have to look &quot;into&quot; the astral (astral projection).
<br />

<br />
Then there are the crossbred reptilian/human hibrids. These are the ones that can &quot;shapeshift&quot;, this has something to do with their genetic makeup. That's where &quot;divine right&quot; and incessant bloodlines come from, and most positions of power.
<br />

<br />
Then there are the humans which are possessed by the full reptilians from the astral dimension.
<br />

<br />
George, imo, is one of the latter 2 options.
<br />

<br />
You have to understand, though, that they ARE capable of &quot;playing dumb&quot;. The point is to lead people to believe that bush is calling all the shots, when he's actually just a puppet. Even he's probably not even aware of everything going on.
<br />

<br />
His approval rating is 20% for a reason. Think long-term.

Interesting concept. This is probably possible with psionics aswell, because magnets are just energy. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Well, from what I have gathered the reptilians came here a LOOONG time ago. An ancient african creation story, for example, has the chitahuri (african word for reptilian) coming to earth in a giant metal ship, who then proceeded altered humanity's dna to end up how they are today. And these same kinds of stories can be found in many many cultures.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, for more information I'd suggest looking into the research of David Icke. Google video has a great 6 hour interview with a Zulu Shaman (the reptilian agenda), and a 6 hour lecture at the Brixton Academy (secrets of the matrix) that both go into detail. I'd recommend Secrets of the Matrix first if you're just getting into this, as The Reptilian Agenda can be long and boring if you aren't aware of some of that info.
<br />

Knowing about their history and race helps understand why they do some truely bizarre things at, among other places, Bohemian Grove and the secret society Skull and Bones at Yale.

Is the skull and bones society the same as the Illuminati society?...Thought i read somwhere they were the same thing and just updated the name...Oh i just remembered seeing a thing on tv about the skull and bones thing..well just remember the picture in black and white of like the &quot;original&quot; skull and bones men
<br />

<br />
Also seems to me there's little doubt in your mind about their existence PK_11  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> ....And actually i have read pretty in depth in a broad range of such subjects and find a lot of the theories very fascinating. Personally i feel they are the ones who actually put us here but that starts getting into the higher intelligence theory which is religion.....if u want to discuss anything about it PK_11 i'd be glad to. Just messege me  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

The illuminati is just the umbrella name for the rulers of the world through their bloodlines, which are decended from royalty.
<br />

<br />
I can post some of those bloodlines, but if you do a bit of research you find out fairly quickly that most presidents are related not only to other presidents, but to royalty from england and the rest of the world.
<br />

<br />
For example, Bush and Diana, princess of whales are both related: <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/learn/library/article.aspx?article=6393" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.ancestry.com/learn/library/article.aspx?article=6393</a>.
<br />

<br />
Furthermore, Bush along with many other presidents can be traced back to Alexander the Great, or other influential figures.

<br />
Not the same thing, although Skull and Bones is one path to initiation into the illuminati. However, you still have to be part of one of the illuminati bloodlines to be initiated.

Well, I believe I was abducted by them (and therefor have seen them with my own eyes) so yes, I'm pretty sure that they exist. Not that my experience can prove anything to anyone else.

From what David Icke describes, their bodies couldn't really adapt to earth, so they lost the ability to reproduce and eventually their bodies broke down... Since then they reside in the lower Astral instead of the physical, and manipulate the physical world by possessing certain bloodlines. (because certain bloodlines are easier to possess than others)

			abducted? care to share some information to me? I'm curious about it.

I think I should add that seeing we are far into the future, its really easy to be related to people in the past. I believe like 1/3 or even 1/2 of all Amiericans are infact related to royals. I don't have any evidence, I'll try to look it up later. For example my brother told me were realted Jone handcock (the guy who sign the U.S paper of interpendsie. I'm also related to lady Godiva....some woman who ran through town naked. And the greatest island king Brian Boro (First thing that ran through my mind is that...ireland has a king?)
<br />

<br />
.............................maybe its lady Godiva that explains my family crazy behavior  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Also pochahouts, also Shakespear (I was told hes our 42th cousin 5 times removed) maybe hes my creative side.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

That is very true, many people can be traced back far enough to be related to somebody.
<br />

<br />
However, the idea that the winner of every election has been the one with the most royal ancestry is impossible based on chance and coincidence.
<br />

<br />

<br />
And may I use this space to point out the following:
<br />

<br />
Bush + Kerry relations: <a href="http://genealogy.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;sdn=genealogy&amp;zu=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.familyforest.com%2FKerry_Bush_Ancestors.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">link</a>
<br />

<br />
(surprise, surprise... only Bush is related to Baron Geoffrey out of the two... if this is a complete list, Bush has more royal connections, an example of the &quot;most royal genes wins&quot; rule.) *forgive me if I interpret that wrong, I know the royalty rule, but I'm not sure how good of an example the bush kerry chart is.
