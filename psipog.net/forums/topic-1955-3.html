			It seems that the razor would have to lose shrapnel in order to sharpen.  Since matter can't be created out of thin air to refine the blade.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps you could try this.  Get a peice of blank white paper and a magnet.  Put the white paper under the pyrimaid and the razor above the paper just incase any metal shards may fall.  Tape the magnet on the the other side of the paper where you'd expect the shards to land.
<br />

<br />
If the blade is not being sharpened similar to how you would sharpen a blade with a wet rock, then i don't know what to say.  It would have to be some mystical force.  I think this would be the easiest way to notice anything.  Then comes the question how would the blade sharpen itself in such a manner?

			I'm with somefatguy as far as what causes &quot;pyramid power&quot;.  I think we call all agree that IF this power exists, then structures like the Pyramids of Giza would be the genuine article as to how to store/generate/conduct it or what have you.  But then why aren't the Mayan pyramids shaped the same way?  They had great sacrifices and coronations on their pyramids which would have also been greatly important to them (important enough to use a pyramid design).  Well, both civilizations had amazing astrological knowledge and oriented their pyramids based on the positions of the sun, moon, and stars.  Both used a technique that involved using the star Sirius (other civilizations like the Sumerians also used this technique) as a landmark in the sky, even though Sirius is only barely visible in Egypt for part of the year.  Perhaps this is a clue to some shared knowledge between the 2 civilizations, especially pertaining to the uses of pyramids and astrology/astronomy?
<br />

<br />
So what are the similarities between the 2 types of pyramid?  They're both made of stone, sit on bedrock (Egyptians went through great lengths for this to be accomplished), they're set up perfectly parallel to latitude and longitude lines, they are oriented based on the moon, stars and sun, they're frickin huge, and are places which were the locations of the most important events to their empires.  Seems to me that the similarities are overwhelming, and any power must have come from these similarities.  (Notice that their shape is NOT one of these similarities.)
<br />

<br />
Perhaps this pyramid power is very weak and thus requires a very large pyramid to gather it?  Maybe the energy comes from the stars and only hit the Earth in such a way that pyramids have to be oriented precisely to create the desired effects.  Maybe stone stores the energy better than air which is why there is so little open space in pyramids (or at the very least, perhaps a solid medium of any type is required and rock was guaranteed to last for millenia and was readily available).  Maybe pyramids are on bedrock because that puts them in better contact with leylines of some sort, keeping them grounded.
<br />

<br />
The possibilities are endless but I think I've made it clear that testing if some tiny, hollow, cardboard pyramid that sits on a table or desk inside is not doing to do crap all.  It bears no significant  commonalities with either type of pyramid except for the few &quot;true pyramids&quot; that the Egyptians built.  Remember that they made tons of stepped, bent and other pyramid shapes before the true pyramids so perhaps that particular shape is purely aesthetic.  I doubt they would be able to test the efficiency of the structure's ability to gather such energy in such a short amount of time, so I doubt the remodels of the pyramids were due to constant improvement of it's energy manipulating capabilities.
<br />

<br />
So if you wanted to make a pyramid with even the potential to have some crazy effects on energy, at least make it out of rock, put it outside in an planetary and astrologically significant place, and make it fairly big.  There's got to be a reason the Mayans and Egyptians didn't put 10 foot pyramids right next to quarries facing any old direction to place their pharaohs in or use as a sacraficial altar, and I would bet it has more to do with the current archeological view that it was the whim of some priests, emperors or architects or we wouldn't see such similarities between civilizations that should have never met.

			On the topic of testing sharpness:
<br />

<br />
I am thinking the best thing to use would be one of the old single blade razors. Using just the blade seems to me the easiest solution (if they sell those anymore). 
<br />

<br />
The way to test sharpness would be to get a pile of papers and a standard weight. Rig some kind of setup to keep the weight on the blade. Then simply place the weight on top of the blade on top of the paper and count how many sheets the blade cut. The weight is simply there to standardize the amount of force.

			Ahhh, the &quot;pyramid power&quot; myth. I was watching Myth Busters, and it showed something like this. They did the experiment and proved it wrong. The blade was still dull. They also did something with an apple, but I can't remember.

			Did they create a pyramid the size of any of Egypt's?
<br />
Did they line it up astronomically?
<br />
Was it built from the same material as the pyramids?
<br />
Was time of day, etc factored in?
<br />

<br />
I really think Myth Busters does a crappy job of recreating things in the right conditions... There are so many other things that could account for success/failure, and maybe those secrets are lost with the ancients... Ah well. We're back to square one.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't there a &quot;Triangular pyramid&quot; and a &quot;Square pyramid&quot; (That is, if you look at the base)

Therefore - the possibility exists of a Pentagonal pyramid, but why would anybody want to create one of those? It looks weird and is hard to make XD

			maybe take one bigger blade, and rub only its half somewhere and check the 2 halfs then?
<br />
might be easier to compare

btw. the height of the pyramid can't be 8.75... i calculated it and got 8.739994 as result <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			BTW, the actual egypt pyramids are built on a certain point of earth's power grid/ley lines, if I'm not mistaken (and if it's a real concept). These lines connect and you can &quot;channel&quot; energy through them.
<br />

<br />
The government uses this &quot;power channeling&quot; concept in their monuments and designs, like the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/theawakeningnews/washdc.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink">GIANT PENTAGRAM</a> in front of the white house (check it out on Google Earth if you aren't convinced... it's there) and with the pentagon itself.
<br />

<br />
Also, obelisks and domes (male/female) channel those respective energies, which is why you usually see a dome near an obelisk.
<br />

<br />
The capitol today and ancient egypt's monuments aren't that different after all... So it starts to make sense that there's a pyramid on our currency.

Different numbers have extremely different effects on energy. After all, at its simplest point everything is just vibrations... each pattern, sound, etc has it's own vibrational signature, which can effect energy.
<br />

<br />
We should look more into the ley line thing... see if psionic power is stronger near any of those points. Who wants to take a trip to the white house? lol.

			Somehow I don't think this particular experiment is viable. For one, think of the size of the pyramids, all the tunnels in them, then the size of the mummy and the other junk inside it. And like others have said, the shape and size of the pyramid makes a huge difference.
