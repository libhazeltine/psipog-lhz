			Hello, I'm BalckShadow. I've been involved with the occult since 1st grade. I didn't understand anything untill 3rd grade though were I had my experience at what I was capable of. I regret it but long story short I had &quot;vamped&quot; energy and strength from a friend that was chasing me. Since then I had started looking into the only type of majik I knew of, ritual majik. I found loads of info and spells, such as to look better, summon this, gain money. I never used any for the fact that they had no point in my life. Finaly I just started practicing what just &quot;came&quot; to me. I later found this site in 9th grade, and found that what I was doing was energy minipulation, Psiballs and Shields. I happened by the media section and found the videos on TK. I thought it was awsome, got pumped up and tried my self. First try it spun like crazey and wouldn't stop. Though after that I had sudden trouble, due to high expectations and then discouragement. Now days I have let my self develop as needed to suit my life. So needless to say I study practical things, I've ditched TK and now I embrace my natural empathic and Telepathic abitlies to help add my friends when they are having trouble and help explain things related to the situation. I am also a necromancer, though I practice different things. NO sacrificing, I'm so against it. I study a part that deals with controling deamons, which isn't only demons, rather beings from the plane of death, good and bad (for those that beleive in such a thing). I beleive in balance and that everything has a purpose (minus mosqetoes). Well thats the most I've written about myself. Hope I didn't bore you to death.

			No offence, but you do seem to be overestimating yourself a bit.

Natural this, natural that. Just stop it.

That and occult comes under heavy spiritual crap, which in turn leans towards religion. Which is a big no-no here.

			That was merely an introduction of myself and how things have occured. 
<br />
I'm NOT overestimating myself at all. Everything I said is true I have NO reason to lie.
<br />

<br />
I believe that what you are refering to is NOT the Occults but a Cult, two different things. The Occult refers only to metaphyisical things. A Cult is a false religion. Unless ofcourse they changed the dictonary. If I understood you wrong please let me know otherwize let it be.

I look forward to seeing the better side of you.

			Welcome BlackShadow, 
<br />
I am sorry you didn't get such a nice welcome. I find it right to show new members the rules in a polite and nice manner. But some people have seen so many new people breaking the rules that they just shout at everyone. So in the right terms they are the ones who broke  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Would you be interested in going to Peebrain's new site once this one is down? It focuses on spirituality and OBEs.
