			My friend was mentally depressed and unstable.  She was smoking weed and stuff and I told her to stop and what not, anyway.  She was so unstable that she thought should would write a book and it was making her think a ton and become to interested in her mind.  I told her somethings about psi that she let influence her a great deal.  She seemed kind of at a higher state of mind.  
<br />

<br />
Recently she was checked into the hospital.  Her mom is a puritan basically. She knows psionics is real but thinks it is to powerful and is not to be messed with, that's what god does and he should only use it.  Anyway!!!!  She believes she was close to Nirvana and that it's a bad thing so they put her on meds since she was depressed and now we can't see her since she is in a hospital.  She isn't playing the game they want her to.  She should pretend to be better and take the meds like she is supposed to so she can come back!
<br />

<br />
I want to use tp or energy manip to send her things to just remind her of me, but that might set her off and make her &quot;unstable&quot;, I want to let her know we miss her and I want to try to tell her to play their game.

How about you patiently await her discharge from the hospital.  Maybe even organize a surprise party or something of that nature for her when she returns.  I'd imagine that she will need the moral support after this ordeal.

I recommend empathy. Send loving and healing feelings maybe? I don't think that would &quot;screw her up&quot;. And I also just recommend having faith and patience in general. Maybe even some positive micro PK for her safe return! I'm no expert but I think that's the only safe thing to do in your current situation.

			The mother loves her daughter. Sometimes love just doesn't agree with others though, or can be shown in an odd way. She just wants what is best for her daughter. And we should respect that. 
<br />
Although when I look at it another way, the mother is only controlling her daughter like a puppet. She wants to set her off right (right being the mother's own views which causes the daughter to have the same) in this world we live in. Personally, have being controlled myself, I don't like it when people don't have the right to act on their own accordance. But that is how society shapes us...
<br />
These prescription drugs that have come into this world seem to just be other ways of controlling people.

			I totally respect her mothers opinions.  I don't like the fact that her mother has to controll her opinions and beliefs.  I mean, she was close to moving out , but I told her that was a bad idea plus she would've gotten deeper into drugs.  
<br />

<br />
I tried dream walking last night, the only thing that was weird was it looked like I was having two dreams and one was like moving on top of the other, it went away after a few minute.
<br />

<br />
I just feel really bad and medication can't slove anything... especially if it is trying to make someone who is sane into like a robot.
<br />

<br />
I know her mother loves her, but according to my friend since she's the daughter she gets weird treatment, and she's adopted so it's just odd and she wants to be so independent.
<br />

<br />
I want to try linking to her just to see if I can see/hear or help her.  Besides she probably wouldn't detect that.

			try helping her by taking a step back. let the doctors do their thing for now. when you become mentally unstable you try to obsess about things. things that you believe are constant, and as a result, attempt to keep you sane. but eventually it just leads to a downward spiral. i nearly got into one of these myself. it's important now not to interfere untill you can be sure she'll be stable. otherwise you'll only make the matter worse with all this talk about psionics at a time like this.
<br />
but then again, i'm no psychologist. do with my advice what you will.

			Well what I think is that you should lest talk to her mother and why you should lest see if shes ok. Tell her all the reasons why you help, listen to her and respond to her in your most honest way. You and her mother needs to settle this right now if you want a good relationship with your friend. Be open with her, and let her talk as well. Tell her why everything you honestly did to help her and that you didn't do anything with the drugs.
<br />

<br />
If the mother donest want to talk to you period,....well I just don't know what to do then. Just let her know you want to fix the problems.
<br />

<br />
If the talk donest go well and one of you throw a agurment (which I'm sure there will) and end up hateing the other more. Well....I don't think that be exactly true what it may seem...
<br />

<br />
This is the only advice I can think of right now. 
<br />

<br />
I'll try to help some more later. <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" />

			Oh no, it's cool. I talked to her mom.  I called her up to clear some things up.  She said she wanted to talk to me anyway, because my friend had been mentioning some things I said.  I basically just listened and replied yes and what not.  I mean I don't want to argue against her set in stone beliefs so f it.  If she does come back then I can talk to her, but I wont mention that.  
<br />

<br />
Oh and Sparkz your deffinatly correct with that.  
<br />

<br />
I knew she was getting out of hand.  She wasn't sleeping for days, she would walk around town for hours into the night, and she started writing a book.  She was writing on her legs and arms taking down notes from questions she was asking.  It was an experiment according to her... well her book was.  She just needed to write the info down.  I was distancing myself from her because of this, and she changed dramtically... I mentioned it to a few other of my friends who are friends with her, but they thought she's fine.. which is totally ridiculous if you saw her.
<br />

<br />
I just don't like the fact that she has to be put on meds for the wrong reason. Her mom thnks she was close to Nirvana or a high state of mind... and apparently that's bad so she's in the hospital stuffed with meds.  Yea, I will wait things out, I feel terrible .. but hope she doesn't become even more depressed after this ordeal...
