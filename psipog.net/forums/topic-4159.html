			Ok, I was coming back from a vacation in MI and it was T-storming.
<br />

<br />
I love t-storms and love hearing the thunderclap.
<br />

<br />
Well, this one was freaky. 
<br />

<br />
I was riding in the car not doing anything, and I hear this small thunderclap. Annoyed, I mentally said, &quot;Oh, come on, sky, you can make a bigger thunderclap than that!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Just then a HUGE thunderclap went off, and I was startled. Then I mentally said, &quot;Ok, not that much...&quot;
<br />

<br />
But at that moment I thought my thoughts actually influenced the weather.
<br />

<br />
I dunno if that was just a natural thing or it was actually me asking it to give a louder thunderclap.
<br />

<br />
What do you think?

I can kinda sorta do that already. I just think of a strong wind, and viola! It's there. ^^
<br />

<br />
I've been cool when I'm outside and playing something with my Summer PE friends. ^^ There was constant wind b/c I was concentrating on the wind the entire time. But we lost the baseball game, and had to jog 2 laps. But it's all good.
<br />

<br />
So, yeah.

			BelovedWater :O i like thunderstorms too but i did not see thunderstorm in real life before i saw lighning only^^ .
<br />

<br />
i think that you helped the thunderclap to be come huge in that time because the first thunderclap make you produce strong desire to see or hear huge thunderclap and it was huge too much as you did not expect because your emotion of desire was too strong and you did not realize that so it was huge one.
<br />

<br />
edit : as nina she use angry emotion to boost her power but you here use desire emotion .
