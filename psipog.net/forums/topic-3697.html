			So far ive been doing PK off and on, for the last 2 years, more off.  My biggest success was moving the psiwheel 3/4 around, happened once.  I can make psiballs easy, very easy, havent fully flared yet any but made some to the point my hands where shaking a bit.  I have problems understanding and using the Just Do It tech, Its that i don't really understand if im doing it right or not, or is there a right way to do it even.  I basicly mediate or trance for a good 10-20 mins before starting.  Then i look at the object and throw in a little visualization of it spinning or me connected to it through psi.  The end result is that nothing really ever happens.  I started to think that i may just lack alot of control.  Im just wondering if anyone has any advice or help. Anything will help 
<br />
Thanks

			Hello and welcome, bloodyshame!
<br />

<br />
&quot;Just do it&quot; yeah nice one <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />
In my opinion it is a combination of feeling and observing.
<br />
First you should connect with the object, try to feel in in your hands or body or mind, after you are fully connected just feel it move in your being and observe it move.
<br />
Just like moving an arm, you dont do that by thinking about it, you just do.

			i dont know about you guys but when i started telekinesis like a week ago (still have no practice done because of finals) i didnt do meditation and ik just looked at it and just thought right...and it moved right more or less than a full turn.  so i am happy my mind is pretty well trained so i dont have to meditate and i am deffinatly happy when i got results because i thought i was waisting my time...and yeah i know i am gonna hit just as many problems as you guys now...like sometimes when i try now it moves the opposite direction i want it to move <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> ....well i dont know if this is the just do it method but it worked for me <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			That is, indeed the Just do it method.
<br />
A lot of people don't meditate, it is not a must.

			I find that trying it first thing in the morning when you wake up works best, as your mind is natually clearer at this point and you are naturally relaxed.

			I still dont understand what this just do it method is.  Is it more of a felling you get when you connect with the object, or something else. Ive most of the articles and i am still lost.  I find myself just stareing at the psi wheel for a while and trying to stare/focus harder on it and throw some visuals in... conclusion is nothing happens. Not sure of any other methods so far that is the only one I know how to do, or understand how to.  Any help or pushs in the right way, in any form is very appreciated. Thanks

			What I do, is I stare at the wheel, and then i concentrate on what I want it to do. I think to myself &quot;I want the wheel to turn to the left/right&quot; and then i sort of relax and then let my subconscious do the rest. It's like NI's technique in the &quot;Power vs. Control&quot; thread. Reading that helped me out a lot.

If your object moves the opposite direction you want it to move, then why not tell it to move the opposite direction of the direction you want it to move. Might not work maybe your subconcious might get confused of what youre trying to do but still worth a try aussi

			My problem is just moving it, i really think im forcing it to much.  I can feel the energy on my hands when im doing it, even sometimes my muscles start spasing.  If anyone has had any problems in the past, and know of a technique that helped id appreciate it. Thanks

yeah but it only goes in the opposite direction SOMETIMES...and i want to get full control over that becuase it gets annoying and what happens when i learn how to levitate stuff (if i ever do) will it go down when i want it to go up?...i dont kno so i just want to find out controlling stuff.
