			oookey. this may sound hokey, but it's been really REALLY useful to me and my friends who do it.
<br />

<br />
this is fairly lacking in psi-work, but can contribute to psi perception.
<br />

<br />
sesnory training involves increasing your senses temporarily, or sometimes permanently. as a martial artist, my senses are my most valued asset for not being kicked in the teeth. 
<br />

<br />
the title is self explanatory, so i will get right into what happens.
<br />

<br />
these are arranged in pro-con sections.
<br />

<br />
Eyesight: you begin to see little details, have a huge (nearly 180 degree on some occasions) perferal vision, and better night vision.
<br />

<br />
cons: bright lights hurt more than normal. (at least to me)
<br />

<br />
hearing: increased range, and selective hearing. plus, the ability to pinpoint sounds
<br />

<br />
cons: high pitched kills, and pinpointing sounds can be a pain due to reflection, and the speed of sound sucks so if it is moving fast, you won't be accurate.
<br />

<br />
no increment for touch, taste, or smell. no idea how to increase those.
<br />

<br />

<br />
the easiest way to train your senses is to use them. and, not normally. 
<br />

<br />
eyesight: instead of looking at what you see in front of you, see what it really is. look for small insignificant things. stare straight ahead and use your perferal vision to see instead. focus your vision.
<br />

<br />
hearing: close your eyes and listen to a specific sound in the jumble. focus on it. don't lose it. try to pinpoint it. see if you can descern what it is. if it is speech, try to figure it out.
<br />

<br />

<br />
that's basically it. this took over a year to get to where i am now. but, like i said, it's worth it.
<br />

<br />
i'm suprised no-one else knows about it.

			First off, I see no way in which this relates to psi.
<br />

<br />
Second, dodgeball really helps here. It helps both. You can play with your eyes open, or you can try to hear when someone throws a ball at you. Forget subtle movements with the latter, just get away as fast as you can.
