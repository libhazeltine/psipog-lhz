			I tried to astrally project last night and I ended up getting up and having to try again, all in all I tried a total of 3-4 times last night I got those unpleasent vibrations and my body went numb; but anyway the probelm was I couldn't get over my breathing everything was vibatory and numb save for my breathing. Anyone have a tip to get over my breathing while trying to project?

			Yes...just ignore it.  I know it sounds like something you probably already tried, but let me put it a different way...
<br />

<br />
Don't bother with your breathing.  Let it happen.  Be passive about it.  Just let it come and go.  That is my best advice...

			Dude, to you Fov, no one is ready.  He obviously thinks he is so let him do it. You seem to think you know everything, which is a surefire way to knowing nothing...and stop speaking cryptically, it sounds dumb.

			Yeah, one would think studying, occult things and psionics would make one open-minded, but there are those, and first off he doesn't even know how long I have been practicing. or anything else...

you are not right, i know something, to know nothing is to be the best. 
<br />
well socrates understood that he know nothing.Im not so good as he is <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />
so i know something.
<br />
Ye many are not ready, me too <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> but im very happy <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> because after so many  months trying into obe i realized that that is not the way to get into astral plane.Now im happy because im not trying, also im dumb but i very like to speak in such way, because its not serious.This obe is sooo not serious that i can really talk in that way <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
just dont get offensive. Just have fun 
<br />
 <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
but if the nice question will come, ill ask it from my experience, not from old mamas books. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Yes but your replies aren't helping people.  There is such a thing as &quot;training for an OBE&quot; and you aren't helping people do this.  Sure, your way of attaining an OBE right now is not giving a damn, but he wants to OBE and wants to train to do it.  Thus, you have no right to tell anyone that &quot;they are not ready&quot; because you actually have no idea whether someone is or not.
<br />

<br />
And to know you know nothing is true knowledge, yes I know.  But you like to think you know that everyone isn't ready, which is, in essence, false.  If they are practicing OBE'ing, then they are ready.

The training for obe is worth almost half than you can imagine.
<br />
I tried so long time that i have the right to say that this is so not enough.
<br />
Also i have the right to say that they are not ready, because its true, why you should feel offended if i say this? Does this hurts you? Why? Because you dont want to be with no skills?
<br />

<br />

<br />
i dont want you to think i know everything ! Dont be so sharp to me.Just i know everything i need about obe ( and its so small experience, but im happy <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> )  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  
<br />

<br />
and stop reading this as a clerk. ! 
<br />
Read this like a friend, so you will get the not-ordinary answer and a smile.
