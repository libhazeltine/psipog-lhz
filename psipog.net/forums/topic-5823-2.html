			waddya mean fluffy..... get on the web and search for bazi.... u should yield some results..... if not, go to Hong Kong and there are many Bazi-Fengshui masters around..... go check with them if u dont trust me
<br />

<br />
bazi is a method of divination that &quot;fortune tells&quot; ur luck cycles by using ur Year of Birth, Month of Birth, Day of birth, and Hour of birth
<br />

<br />
the above is for lazy people or people who found bullshit on the net

Magic and metaphysics serve their place, but they DO NOT belong in a discussion on a forum in which most of the stuff is based on logic and science, as opposed to the supernatural. Much of psi is distinguishing what is happening, from what isn't.
<br />

<br />
On subject, however, I have a journal detailing my initial energy work. I just rummaged through it, on average I was able to track the ball around the room as having a .5-1.2 degree difference (average being ~.95 degree difference) from the standard room temperature (according to the data it was at about 67 degrees, fairenheit.) I'd say one could logically assume that psiballs (or whatever you want to call your energy) are warmer than the surrounding air.
<br />

<br />
On the experiment: I &quot;moved&quot; the ball using my mind to a place where my hands weren't, and had to check with my hands as to where it was, I'm not particularly energy sensitive. This was done after I found positive results of 3.5(!) degrees in between my hands, then realized body heat also factored in. I'd suggest anyone actually attempting this experiment do the same.

			I don't know about 'Bazi', or anything, but my mom has been studying under a master of something or other, and people ARE born under 'elements' (wood, earth, metal, water, and fire, each detract from one another and feed another.. sort of like horoscopes and compatability), however, their inclusion into psi is completely unknown to me. I don't believe that people are born with the POWER of elements, but rather, people alone are gifted with a certain AFFINITY to a temperature or kind, but I don't think it's restricted to those 5 (have you ever heard of a wood psiball? O.o). I myself happen to be near incapable of producing a COLD psiball, only warm ones. The opposite is the same for my friend. Coincidentally, I'm a 'fire' person, or whatever that means.. more closely tied into personality than anything. Sort of like numerology, but not associated with names.. it's deep. I have no clue for my friend.
<br />

<br />
Conclusion? Bazi sounds real enough, since I have a close contact with my mom's studies (since she's always doing this stuff for people), and it's very real and accurate, but it does not seem to tie into psi PROWESS at all, to me.

<br />
 
<br />
When I make a cold psi ball it still feels hot to me, but I can feel gusts of wind a slight chill although my hands are still hot.  I tried making a cold one to a friend and it was hot for me, cold for her.
<br />

<br />
Then again, it could've just been that I didn't make it that strong, meh just a thought.
