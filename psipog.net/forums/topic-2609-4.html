A rather rude response I think. I'll admit other people (like you for example) do have less freedom than others but I'm just saying we have less freedom than the majority of kids our age (at least in our area). Not to mention we do not have game council privliges on school days period. One time I was banned from playing M for mature games for several years because they thought it had a bad influence on me. And they did it to my brother too just for the hell of it!

I do agree. Also, he is being hypocritical (sp?).  He is bitching about what you were bitching about.

			Might I point out that the vast majority of people on Psipog are under 18 and thus have little to no chance of going to wherever the convention is unless it is in their home city?
<br />

<br />
Regardless. When are we talking about holding this? I might be able to make it, depending on if I have other activities scheduled at the same time, and if it looks like it will be something worth 650 miles of gas and 6 hotel nights worth of money.
