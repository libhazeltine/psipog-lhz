If you look up to someone, you don't really look down on yourself, you just acknowledge that you're not perfect, and that you'd like to improve certain aspects of yourself. Those aspects are usually held in your desired quantity by whoever you look up to.

			shenlon, I'd agree that Hitler could compete for most charismatic leader, but if you study his militry tactics, he was a shitty general. Which is how he ended up getting beaten like a drum from both sides. Plus of course, he was just kinda a bad man whereas Julius Caesar was an early proponent of a lot of liberal ideas that are common practice today (like basic civil rights).

			People have this big idea that Hitler was 100% evil. Not so. 
<br />

<br />
You know Volkswagen? It was started in the 1930s, under Hitler's regime. He said he'd introduce affordable cars. The result? The Volkswagen, the &quot;people's car&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
He also said he would introduce a trans-German roadway (ie. a highway going through all of Germany). Ever heard of the Autoban? That's it.
<br />

<br />
Hitler's actually the only leader I can think of who fulfilled every single one of his election promises. Unfortunately, once he did that, he went to war on two fronts, massacred millions of people, and got himself owned. Sad end for someone who actually went through on his election promises...

Apparently, contrary to public opinion, not every person has the same mentality. 
<br />

<br />
I learned how to love through the love my parents gave to me as a child. I have also learned how to love through my friends.
<br />

<br />
None of them ever hurt me to make me learn about love, so how does your statement make sense? You're pessimistic.

			I meant that, when others get hurt by a lack of love (not neccecarily from you), you learn a greater capacity for love, because you want to reduce their suffering. 
<br />

<br />
I see people get hurt on almost a daily basis, and it's usually because someone I don't know showed a lack of love. As a result, I learn a greater capacity of love through desire to lessen their suffering.

Or something like that.....never really remember it exactly. Basicy what it says is that when someone feels bad we feel it to. We feel the pain of others. I read in a book of babies being able to detect other emotions. Its not till there like 2 years old they see that what they feel are other people emotions.

Ever seen a baby cry? Its not always there own pain.
