			Yeah, knowledge transfers are possible, my friend and I have been experimenting with it for a while now, only we haven't been able to get a successful conscious knowledge transfer, only unconscious, as in the knowledge goes into the persons unconscious mind rather than conscious so it's a bit harder to access.
<br />

<br />
As for transfering skills/abilities, that is a whole other story. Lets take a martial arts transfer as an example, the knowledge transfer is like having that person read a book about the martial art and learn everything in there, but this is theory only, when he goes out into the street he might know everything he needs to know, but his body doesn't have the neurological adaptations needed to successfully perform in combat.
<br />

<br />
In the case of psionic skills, that again is different, but I'm not sure of the rules here as yet so... yeah.

			how about telepathicaly sending a mental video/snapshot. as in the person doesnt directly has the knowledge implanted in their brain, but know the 1sts persons experiences and learns from them.

			I was born an audible telepath and I can say from experience that when telepathy happens, a host of 'feelings' from the 'sender' come right along with the information. I have never received just 'raw data' from anyone.
<br />

I sum it up in The Quantum Brain: <a href="http://Quantum.CozzCo.com" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://Quantum.CozzCo.com</a>

I've made every effort to keep it scientific, but from my perspective, science is a perspective <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			- I belive it could work, and work well. When I thought of this idea it is the secondary reason I started attempting occult in the first place. I believe it would be hard, but not sufficiently dangerous to worry about. Though it could easly be thought of as an attack.
<br />
-  Best not to try it on a Psi, or other occultist incase they were able to use some sort of Psi-Virus. But why could it not be done? How is it any different then reading someones deepest subcounies subconscious thoughts.
<br />
-  All minds copy information in various, but similer ways. You would almost need to get there own mind to decode it to steal it sucsessfully, thus you would need to get them to start thinking about it. Such as a math teacher at the board writing out the problem. Threw his head, not even deep in his mind, is math. Its just a matter of reading it on his mind, and copying it from his own.
<br />
-  But how is data stored? Is it purely phsicial, thus, no spirit? Or is your spirit a copy of all the information stored in your brain, and your brain is just there to keep a connection to your spirit?
<br />
-  It is likely irrelevent if your spirit is a copy of your mind  and your brain is just the ancore, or if your brain is all there is to it and there is no spirit. Either way, its just a matter of looking at it logically in there mind, and bring it to your own. Though I believe the hardest part would be your mind acknowledging the fact it is there.
<br />

(Side Note: Bah, I put it into paragraphics, and the thing deleted the spaces I used to note the start of 'em. &gt;.&lt; Why are forums evil like that?)

			I must apologize for my lack of understanding your questions. I can only answer specific questions or else I will begin to introduce philosophy, which is not my intention.
<br />

<br />
This ?potential knowledge? does not exist locally. It only manifests locally so that we can interact with it from a time based reference.
<br />

<br />
No one knows where memory is ?stored? in the brain. We can?t drill a hole and remove specific memories. There is every indication that memory is holographic through not only the brain but the entire physical body. There is even some very good science indicating that memory and experience is located in the energy or ?morphic resonance field? as it is sometimes called.

I would like to know where you found this information.
<br />
I have no such information, that is simply the believe I came up with the first time I started thinking about knowledge transfers.
<br />

<br />
Please PM me, or reply to this with the sorce of your information. It would be very helpfull. Any knowledge that helps to prove, or disprove a theroy of mine is always nice. ^_^

			I am assuming that you are asking about morphic resonance. Of course, Google is a great tool, but I always like to start with the Wikipedia:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphic_resonance" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphic_resonance</a>
<br />

<br />
Google Morphic Resonance or Morphogenetic field:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.co-intelligence.org/P-moreonmorphgnicflds.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.co-intelligence.org/P-moreonmorphgnicflds.html</a>
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sheldrake has ventured some guesses as to the relationship between morphogenetic fields and our individual memory and intelligence. He suggests that our brains may not contain memories and knowledge, per se, but may be devices for tuning in to relevant sections of the morphogenetic field for human memory, much as a radio tunes into radio waves. Our own personal memories would naturally be more accessible than those of other people or cultures (since, in morphogenetic resonance, like resonates with like), but theoretically the memories of every human (and other entities?) would be available to anyone capable of tuning in.&quot;
<br />

<br />
We can look at this as the vibrations of the energy strings in string theory and our relationship to those vibrations. When we listen to music that we enjoy, we have a tendency to 'get in step' with the beat of that music.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps the vibrating strings of energy memory in the quantum world have the same effect?
<br />

<br />
It is important to keep in mind that our current science has no way to explain how memory is stored in the brain. There are no 'memory centers' and it is obvious that some memory, such as reflexive actions that take place between the spinal cord and the body <span style="font-weight: bold">before </span>the sensory information even reaches the brain is actually in the body.
<br />

<br />
DNA is the 'blueprint' for life - but a blueprint is just that and nothing more. A building will not grow automatically just by placing a blueprint on a vacant lot - but that's exactly what takes place in every form of life.
