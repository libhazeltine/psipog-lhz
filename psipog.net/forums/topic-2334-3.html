I was trying to move my cellphone over my bedroom table on thursday night, but wasn't really focusing right, and moved the table instead. Just a little, like 4cm to the right.

			hm maybye that jack guy is fake then again i would might do it out in the open to. i mean there not much point in telekinesis if you cant do it around pepole (well other than to see if it exsit). i mean its like tellin pepole i can beome invisble if you dont look at me. not to metion it would open pepole eyes to the reality of telekinesis even if it was a couple pepole at  time. but meh the guy might be a fake but i read on some website that he dosnt get any typeof money from this. and how popular could a old fart get. so populartiy and money could be twron out the window for motives

			I guess I have to agree there.  Anyways, why in the world would he spend time making videos of PK and only showing minimal stunts.  It's pretty pointless.  Unless he is shy, and afraid people would hate him.  But if that's the case, he should have never started.

			Jack is for real.
<br />

<br />
There is no correlation between his hand movements and the ball's positioning.  If he were controlling the ball with anything other than psi, whenever he flicked his wrist, the ball would jump.  His movements look exactly like every other PK video I've seen.  The movement in the hand means nothing, it is merely symbology to us, something to tell our subconscious that we are trying to push / pull the ball.  How many of you have actually managed to have so much control over the PK target that you it will flinch when you flinch?  I'd venture to say none.
<br />

<br />
Also, he is able to move the ball laterally, in any of the three dimensions.  To be able to control an object like that with conventional physics would require a complex system.  For instance, just to move a ball from laterally (without gaining or losing height, and without it swinging) when the control pivot for the string is more than 1 foot above would be impossible.  This system would surely be easily visible to any onlooker.  He has no issues with obstacles being above or below the target, including his hands, a jar lid etc.
<br />

<br />
Also, all of his movements in the video are clearly seen.  If he were controlling the ball in some other manner, he would have to make other motions that would be VERY obviously controlling the ball from elsewhere.  The only other possibility is that he has an accomplice... and this is highly unlikely also, for reasons previously mentioned (i.e. practically impossible to control a light ball like that with string without it being VERY obvious) and also the preparation for the &quot;stunt&quot; would be again, next to impossible, as there are always onlookers.
<br />

<br />
If someone can give me a logical workaround for ALL these problems (as these would be ALL the problems he would have to overcome), please share.
<br />

<br />
It amazes me that a community <span style="font-style: italic">dedicated</span> to the powers of the mind would so easily dismiss the hard work and dedication of this old man without first considering all the possibilities.
<br />

<br />
I have an honest offer.  If one person could replicate this show using conventional methods and demonstrate it to me, I would happily pay for plane tickets to St. Louis, where I live, and $500 as a humble gift for proving me wrong.  If anyone is confident they can do this, with the fluidity and transparency that this man can, then by all means, let me know.
