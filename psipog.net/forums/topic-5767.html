			Hay <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ,I think all have heard about the series of Harry Potter.It have been clarified by certain scientists and was shown in Discovery channel that the several parts of this story was real and had happened in the past.
<br />
This means that wizards and witches were there for real.So,could they have used tk by the name of magic ?Even if the story was real or not, would using an object such as wand for tk proove useful ?What are your views and ideas on this subject?
<br />
Please reply.

			The only way i can see a 'wand' helping Tk is just to help you focus on a certain object, i really doubt that it could possess Tk abilties.

			The want could of consisted of certain materials that amplified the energy used for telekinesis. Of course, nobody will ever know. It may be that only minor aspects of the story were true. It might be wishful thinking.

Much as I love JK Rowling's work, it's simply fiction.  Sure, there must have been some people who knew about PK and magic and all of that, but you can scrap that romantic image of Merlin or Gandalf or other wizards like that in our past.

athames arnt used the same way wands are. athame is a sprate tool used for stuff like carving your wand or staff wich are made with your own two hands and then i read somewere you have to pass your energy into your wand or staff to make it your own. i always wanted to make a wand but im a horrible sculpter so im guessing my wand will come out looking like a sad little poking stick

Sorry, I realise I wasn't exactly clear.  No, clearly they aren't <span style="font-style: italic">used</span> in the same way (one wouldn't try to cut herbs with their wand), but as far as representations go they can be interchangeable.  For instance when evoking power of fire or air, each tool could be used for one, the other, or both as they both have ties to each element. (cited from Edain McCoy)
<br />

<br />
And why would you need to sculpt?  I simply went out to the park one day and found a nice fallen branch for my wand. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Anyway, back on topic.  Smith, don't believe everything you see or read, even if it's on the Discovery Channel.  And yes, Rowling did cite several ancient legends for naming and such, but the bulk of her story has no ancient basis (other than the eternal struggle of good vs evil and the nature of those two things).  I doubt she consulted any actual historical texts on the subject - rather, she probably just read someone else's take on it, or maybe even did what we do when we need to know something - <span style="font-style: italic">Googled</span> it.
<br />

<br />
If you care about it, perhaps you could provide a link to more information backing up your arguement?

			Well, when I first tried TK (as in first day of psiwheel practice), I was only Ok, but when I held a pencil and &quot;pretended&quot; it would amplify my energy because of it's structure, the wheel spun at least thrice as fast as without the pencil. It may have been static, but I am almost certain that tricking my mind using the archetypes of a wand and my idea of how TK works made the whole process work so smoothly.

You mean Greek MYTHOLOGY?  I don't get people figuring that ancient civilizations were smarter than us.  And yes, she did refer to Norse mythology and the like to look up interesting magical creatures, but besides that, Harry Potter is a work of <span style="font-style: italic">FICTION!</span>  It's threads like THESE that made somethingawful.com pick on you.
