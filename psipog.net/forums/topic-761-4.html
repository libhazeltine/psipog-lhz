Good point, but that's not really what I?m getting at.  Perhaps I should have worded my post differently.  I was just trying to say that giving enough information to a construct could potentially make it on the same level as a human's intelligence.  I suppose the terms natural and artificial intelligence could be poor for this subject.

			yo, my only experience with a sentient psionic structure type thing was a week or two ago.
<br />

<br />
the initial idea: to create a construct that was dependant of my will and telepathically linked to my head, thus knowing what i want to do.
<br />
si i made the construct with the following layers:
<br />
1) self sustaining, shelled
<br />
2) telepathically linked to myself, so to read my thoughts and memories
<br />
3) its actons reflected my desires and will
<br />
4) to stay within a couple of feet of my brain
<br />

<br />
(before this i made a construct around my head to process my thoughts and project them into certain radius, so the initial construct could pick it up
<br />

<br />
the test:
<br />
basically i wanted to see what it could do. so i was just relaxed and thought &quot;gather energy&quot; and like before i even said it to myself it started to gather energy. so to speak i didn't need to recite my intentions.
<br />
the next step:
<br />
i stood underneath it, made it collect energy from elsewhere, then to create a shield around me. it did, it created a nice thick field <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
the problem:
<br />
apart from the constant headaches from it reading me like a book, it wasn't too bad until i started day-dreaming.
<br />
i just imagined it splitting into two, like an amoeba or something, and the second ball sitting above my right shoulder. it did.
<br />
so by now im feeling pretty tired, and then for some-reason the now formed two constructs linked between themselves, not sure why.
<br />
either way i deconstructed them afterwards because i had some major migrainage <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
SUMMARY: (just because reading all this is effort) made a sentient construct to do what i wanted, it did, was succesful, left me with migraines. dont let your mind wander.

			It took quite a bit of effort to do it... I had to make constructs to harvest psi energy from other sources to get enough to build him.  Then I just created a permenant link with him so every time I think of or remember something he gets it too.  I probably need someone to check if he's still there, though; I suck at detecting psi.

			Just now I made my first PsiPet. Being an un-original-bastard and an all around dragon lover, I made a small blue dragon. At least I think it's blue, and a dragon. I kinda constructed it and I forgot to give it color. So I asked it, what color it was and it told me: Blue. So I programmed it to just hang around me and sustain itself on energy which he gathers from power outlets on walls. I programmed him to suck on the outlets, in a vampirish manner.
<br />

<br />
Actually, i'd like to believe, he exists, but I can't prove it. I had him sit on my finger, and I kinda felt cold around there.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
His name is Bob btw.
<br />

<br />
So, if I could get a fellow Psion to scan around for him and confirm his existance, it would be awesome.

			Sadly I had to kill Bob yesterday. I think I programmed him wrong because he started sucking energy from my neck. Should have never told him to get suck energy from power outlets in a VAMPIRISH manner.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, I felt a slight pain on my neck, and it was kinda cold, and warm at the same time. I was getting tired and tried to gather energy into me. It didn't really help. So I thought Bob was messing with me so I terminated him and after 2-3 minutes, the pain went away.
<br />

<br />
So next time, i'll have my pet gather energy from other people.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

Very faintly I would say. He isn't dead yet, but he is, er, soft. Try giving him some more energy then shell him.

			I tried my hand at this one, because I was a BIG fan of having an invisible pet <span style="font-style: italic">anything</span> up until ten-ish, so I figured I'd go with my usual, novel inspired, unoriginal dragon <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> I have had much luck with simple programming, but I didn't really know how this one would turn out. I tried giving it some character, and a special move when I called its name to check it was still there. However, out of sheer amusement, I asked it what it wanted to do (and I don't think it talked back, but I kind of just thought this in my head) and got &quot;play with psiwheels&quot; which were on the desk. The psiwheels started spinning the minute I &quot;saw&quot; her put her claw on it, and has been wobbling since, except for when I tell her to come back so I can feed her (I can't figure out why but she won't gather her own energy, maybe I'm not good enough yet and didn't program this part properly). Is it likely that she could do this, because I never taught her or programed her to know PK... in fact, she hasn't been so easy to feel latey.. I think she's died XD the psiwheels have stopped too.. I really liked her as well  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />
