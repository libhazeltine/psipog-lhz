			Okay so i had a question/thought.
<br />

<br />
Dreams are supposedly entirely within your mind. it becomes an OBE when you are on the astral plane, an energy recreation of the physical world. 
<br />

<br />
So how can two people share a dream? instead, could it potentially be a shared OBE? two people having an out of body experience with each other experiencing the same things on the astral realm? keep in mind it is possible to go from a lucid dream to an OBE, and Vice versa. Maybe when you are in a lucid dream, by saying that walking through this portal will bring you into somebody elses dream, perhaps you are leaving the lucid dream within your own mind, and entering the astral realm at that persons astral body location, to in a sense, meet up with them.
<br />

<br />
Also consider the idea that instead of sharing an OBE on the astral with another person, perhaps there is a connection of energy (Psi, much like the silver cord reported by monroe) between the two energy body duplicates on the astral, which is transfering lucid dream information, much like a host/client (halo, counterstrike lol). 
<br />

<br />
i am in a jumbled state of thought right now and will probably come back to update, but tell me your thoughts guys, im interested.

			or then the shared dream might be like telekinesis that the peoples mind are connected some how and that way they share theyr dream but that is just my theory <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			yea that sounds similar to what i proposed at the end. both minds are dreaming, but they are connected by energy(much like the silver cord which connects the astral body to the physical), this energy transfers information about the dream kind of like two computers connected to each other both playing the same computer game. its an interesting idea.

			The silver cord is a controversial thing, for one main reason. Not everyone sees it. Almost all of the older books pertaining to AP say everybody has a silver cord, but not many people report seeing it. 
<br />

<br />
As to shared dreams: That is an idea, I think it might be plausible, considering you can use mirrors and such for AP as well as shared dreaming. However, most people report OBE's to be much more vivid and lifelike then dreams. Also, in OBE's people can't control the environment, unlike in dreams.
<br />

<br />
Another thing that makes this cloudy is what you believe about dreams. You said earlier that dreams are all in your head. A reasonable assumption, where else would they be? A lot of people think that you leave your body every night, and go to the astral plane (sorry Roy) to dream. They say that you wall off your own little area where you do your dreaming, until you wake up, and return to your body. And then there is Robert Bruce's mind-split theory, which is ridiculously complex, but if you want to read it, it's here:
<br />
<a href="http://www.astraldynamics.com/search.asp?Search=mind%20split&amp;Type=1&amp;ReferenceID=207" target="_blank">http://www.astraldynamics.com/search.asp?Search=mind%20split&amp;Type=1&amp;ReferenceID=207</a>
<br />

<br />
So is shared dreaming meeting on the astral plane? Maybe. Is it some other telepathic connection between subconsciouses? maybe. Is it something else I haven't considered entirely? Maybe even more possible.

			thanks for the reply hatter.
<br />

<br />
that is one concept i hadnt thought of... a physical space walled off to create a 'playground'(per se) for your own dreams. I do get a lot of my basis from robert bruce, astral dynamics being one of the books i can never seem to put down.
<br />

<br />
i have had one Wake Induced Out of body experience. Going through the trance state, the vibrations, strait to the 'pop' out of my physical, and yes it is a surreal experience uncomparable to anything else.
<br />

<br />
so i see where your coming from, in that even a shared OBE would have its relative differences from a shared dream. i guess the ideal test would be to determine whether or not both of the shared dreamers are going through R.E.M. (this is assuming you do not R.E.M. while having an OBE.)
<br />

<br />
Either way if a shared dreaming experience occurs, there is no doubt there is a connection between the people, the two energies, the two conciousness'... somewhere.
<br />

<br />
If you believe in a collective unconcious (as i do) it may be a relative awareness through a sub-physical connection, of what the other person is dreaming, to create likewise dreamstate.
<br />

<br />
this has been one of the most thought provoking topics on the site. i hope you guys can come up with some intrigueing rebuttles.

			I subscribe to the theory of the collective unconscious as well, and It might be a good example of how everybody can meet in dreams. 
<br />

<br />
As to REM sleep during shared dreaming: That is a good idea for testing whether or not it is a shared OOBE or not, but it does have one flaw. You can dream while not in REM sleep. It isn't remembered as well, and not generaly as vivid, but it does happen.
<br />

<br />
I still need to read Astral Dynamics. I have it, just haven't started it yet. I kind of went overboard and read about 130-150 pages of Robert Bruce on his website. That feels like a lot more when it's on a computer then printed on a book for some reason. I did read his treatsie on astral projection though. 
<br />

<br />
Another idea might be this: What if it is possible to link up while OOBEing and while dreaming? What if there are two kinds of connections? Or maybe that connection is the same, and the type of consciousness is just the vehicle that utilizes said connection. Maybe dreams and OBEs take you to the same place, but are just different means of perceiving that place?

That is an awesome theory.
<br />

<br />
while i have not experience, either A. Shared Dreaming, or B. Shared OOBE.
<br />

<br />
i do know that many OBE'ers and 'astral forums' and what not, try to arrange specific locations and dates in which to OBE to the same place and meet up in the astral realm. 
<br />

<br />
that is to say that many OBE'ers believe it is an energetic recreation of the physical world in which you actually would need to be in the right place at the right time to share the experience. but it is hard for me to say  how shared dreaming could potentially be different because i have never had such an experience. 
<br />

<br />
going back to your first post, OBE's do feel 10x more real than dreams. to me, dreams create the FULL illusion of an experience, but whose to say this is an illusion if not an actual realm where dreams take place.
<br />

<br />
Thinking about it, Astral dynamics (the booK) proposes another question. Robert Bruce says while he is having an OBE he can enter a painting or a mirror or television what have you, and enter a perception(i wanted to say reality) of being that time/space/dimension. could this be related to entering a dream, in your mind or a dream realm, from an actual out of body experience???
<br />

<br />
i think im starting to confuse myself, so i'll gather my thoughts for a second...
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Okay, so you proposed two possible connections, is that to say is possible to share a dream with somebody, as well as share an OBE?
<br />

<br />
if so im going to practice lucid dreaming and convince my girlfriend to do the same.

<br />
That's what I was proposing. Also, do you think you could connect somebody having a lucid dream with an OBE? This assumes that dreams take place on the astral plane.
<br />

<br />
Also, I've been trying to get my girlfriend to LD for a while. I think she might do it once school starts...

			i have been in a dream where i was in a house with leech things all over me...   and i looked out the window (it was nighttime)  and saw a shaded figure running from a big creature...
<br />

<br />

<br />
my firend had a dream (the same night)  that he was being chased by a big creature, and ran by a house, looked in the window and say a figure doing what i was doing (trying to get the leeches off of me)
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
earlier that night we were trying to communicate telepathically, but we failed.
<br />

<br />
if any of this makes sense.... i think all you have to to is make a telepathic connection before sleeping (dreaming)
