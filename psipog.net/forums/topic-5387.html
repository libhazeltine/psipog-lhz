			One parent, (dad) could ccare less what i do with PSI. However, my mom on the other hand, seems to think it is satanic, and nothing i do or say can convince her otherwise. Any advice? Should i go underground with it? What am i supposed to say the next tome she sees the wheel spinning?

			O ouch there is like no possible way to help you without getting a little religionish....

Lets see....well I can see why she would think that. You could always say your useing invisible strings or something...or mangtics! But if you just want to tell her the turth (which you should). Not to sure how I can do this without breaking a rule here.........
<br />

Well it's not like your summoning demons or something right? Like them crazy evil people I see on the discovery channel....................are you?

Some parents are unreceptive of a comment like number 2. I'm getting the feeling that his mother would be very unreceptive if he said that. Honestly, though, the letter to parents is a good thing. I would print it out, if I were FinallyEffingJoined, give it to my mother and say, &quot;Here. This is something that one of the people on one of the websites I go to wrote. I hope it helps take away some of the worry you have involved with this.&quot;

			When I first started psionics I was foolish enough to let them catch me trying to use PK on a candle.  Since my parents are very religous they instantly thought it was satanic.  Now I've sucessfully been gaining skill over the past year without them having a clue.  If you can handle practicing in private and becoming kind of secluded then just go on with it.  You've got to make the decision of whether you want to study psionics or be on good terms with your mother...

&quot;Its not satanic, if you think it is, fine, see if i care, go away.&quot; If that doesnt work, well, crap. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> Ill be grounded for a long time but theres always ways to practice PSI, even if you are immobile and with no objects around.

			Certain people just can't handle being told that paranormal activity isn't related to religion at all....

In anycase, I'd say the best case is to tell her you stopped and keep it away from them.

			yeah my parents are stupid like that. i told my mom and she thinks its just an illusion or im just being crazy. and my dad screamed &quot;cultist&quot; at me when i messed around with an ouiji board. so i figure its best not to tell him. my advice: just ignore them until you can get out of the house and let their skepticism be your fuel to get so good at psionics you CAN summon an army of demons to destroy them and their petty blind skepticism!! HAHAHAHA  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> did i say that outloud?

			wow, I guess I am one of the semi- lucky ones.  My mom is open minded and believes mostly in psionics although she had never heard about it till I told her.  I just keep it away from my dad though, lol.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Yeah im a lucky one, my stepmoms sister (aka my aunt) has done this from teen years so shed be denying everything ive shown, done for her as her sister has, she was forced to believe it kinda. As for my dad he dont care, he actually said thanks when I fixed a cramp he had. My real mom also believes me because ive done TP on her over in Northcarolina where she is. Surprisingly she was cool with it like she expected it or something.
