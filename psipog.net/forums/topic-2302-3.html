i dont know any good blog hosts, if you could give me a link i could start one.
<br />

<br />
and, before entering the tower, i was always on that cliff that curved down to the ground, it seemed like a volcanic area, and the monsters seemed like a flood of red and black, as that was thier color, and there were a lot of them, though they were weak, which kinda added to the volcanic feel cause it almost seemed like molten rock when viewed from the top of the cliff, though now i just go straight to the next floor. though i probrably could go back down and outside, it wouldnt do me much good.

Preliminary disclaimer: I have already said that it is my opinion that you should see a professional psychologist; nothing I say from here on out should be construed to modify or nullify that opinion.
<br />

<br />
Have you tried to AP elsewhere? How about traditional OBE? If you haven't, perhaps try one of these two just for comparison's sake.

not really steriotype, he is tall, has long black hair, black eyes, a round face, and a black trenchcoat are the main features i can remmember right now, and he always fights with a new weapon every time he shows up, ranging from claws, to swords, and polearms.
<br />

<br />
i have APed elsewhere. to like a tavern like place, i dont do too much wandering the astral plain cause the towers more interesting to me.
<br />

<br />
i havent had much success with the OBE method of astral projection, i get about to where i feel the heavy tingling, but i get stuck there.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
due to several nightmares i've had recently i havent had a clear enough mind to concentrate enough to go to the tower, in case anyone is wondering why i havent posted about anything new happening.

		<td>
			For starters: Wow, I like the little message at the top. Very handy rule to live by.
<br />

<br />
Now, yes, I am the Anatares he speaks of. We HAVE been talking for three years about these very things, over MSN, and he has a package of birthday cake coming to him in the mail very soon <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> (From one hour into the future, too. I love timezones).
<br />

<br />
To clarify on a couple of things; We are both psions of course (Yes, he really is nineteen, and I really am eighteen), and I was the one who coined the phrase 'astral projection', actually the night that he met my Sady in the tower. Astral projection is a, granted, very debateable issue on whether or not it is 'real', but there are a lot of sources for it and if Galdon here can see, hear, touch, and talk to Sadira, then I believe him. I've known and trusted him as a friend since his earliest days in the tower where I, too, was very skeptical about his daydreams. Yes, he gets hurt in there, and yes, it sometimes carries over to real life.
<br />

<br />
As for G and Viet, I believe they're real too. One reason is because I'm a tin-pot telepath, and managed to shout out to G when he went nuts in the tower. It was truly an amazing experience, my first successful connection with anyone and it's G, angrily and fiercely blocking me, but I pushed harder and managed to give him a headache <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> Viet, on the other hand, lived in my own head for a bit, I knew he was there by the tingles at the back of my head/neck that were there 24/7, which would intensify when I thought of or spoke about the tower or other things. Also, when meditating, I could hear his voice, but it sounded like total gibberish. I wish I could've understood him better.
<br />

<br />
About my 'pet' demon, apparently he's been terrorizing me since early childhood through my dreams. He recently (And piously) revealed that he can slightly alter his physical appearance, which explains.... Well, a lot. The form we've seen him the most as has a very specific shape to the face, (Rounded cheekbones, kind of effemiate) with a very pale complexion and his black eyes set slightly deeper into his face. He's making like I don't own my own soul and generally trying to intimidate me or cowardly use my arachnophobia against me. He's apparently from the future to try and alter the past to suit him, which somehow involves me.
<br />

<br />
About Sadira, she is my guardian spirit's (Anatares, we'll call her Ana from hereonout to try and not confuse people) daughter, and also comes from the future, to try and stop Delmr, the demon. She recently had a fit with poor galdon when he called out to her because he wanted a little more help in the fight against him. But she's bound by the same rules that every science fiction/fantasy show has to offer: Don't f*** with the past. She's doing what she can to fix things, and that's that.
<br />

<br />
Ohyeah, it might help to mention that recently galdon and I discovered that we're psionically linked, probably due to intensive practice throwing psi at each other across the continent. This means a lot of different things, but so far I haven't noticed much from him, though at least he knows when my period is due <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> Violent mood swings much? To visualize the distance between us: He's in Somewhere, Texas and I'm in southern Ontario, Canada.
<br />

<br />
Any questions?

			Anatares, I live in quebec.. juste so you know... I did experience a few obes.. and from all I've read.. I'll refer astral with levels.. level 0 is the physical world as we know it.. going down to -1 would start a lucid dreams.. slight difference and abit of control.. the lower you go, the more ''inside your head'' you are.. if you go up.. 1-2-3-4 its different planes.. all the more different from the physical plane. This is just a way to see how the astral works.. (For more explanations/theories/proof, read Journeys out of body by Robert Monroe) So the 'Tower' would exist on a specific level that someone created, that would explain why anyone could go in it. However, it doesn't mean that everything is real, in fact, it could be just thoughtforms by whoever created it.. Similar to psi constructs. Anyone ever took a look at the ''Crossroad''? It's  a shared astral projection.. Never could try it. So the astral plane can be real, in your mind, or in another plane/level/channel (whatever you call it) However, I recommend everyone to read about obe and try it themselves..

			First of all, Anatares, my greatest thanks to you for being coherent and comprehensible in your post.
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, your story seems... fluffy.
<br />

<br />
I will say that, should I actually manage to consciously control and/or remember my OBEs and/or go that extra inch and get OBE (what I need to do depends on who you believe, hence the uncertainty) - and should I actually find an &quot;astral plane&quot; to go to - I'll certainly check out your story.

Truthfully, for some odd reason, the demon you describe sounds extremely familiar... I have no clue why though since I can't recall any occurence of seeing anyone or anything like that...  Maybe its just paranoia or something <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> I'm don't know.
<br />

<br />
Once I achieve an OBE or Astral Projection I will definitely try and check out the tower you speak of.  That is, if I'm able to get somewhere <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> as in, make it at least past my bed <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.  Also, if I realize that I want to do it too <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
