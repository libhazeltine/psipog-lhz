I don't think you realize that I agree with you in that the Pineal Gland probably doesn't have any paranormal function. However, I choose to admit the miniscule possibility. This provides the opportunity for all the evidence to be brought forward.

You come off as very denialist. I'm not saying you are, it's just how you appear. You're entitled to believe what you like, but when you post, I think it would be a good idea for you to refrain from flat denial in your posts. Make it sound like you think it could be possible, maybe play some Devil's Advocate? of course, you don't have to take my suggestion, but you can if you want to.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">I'm just havin' fun.

			If you read the sources I DID NOT say the pineal gland sees light but it does know when light if off and on. If you read my third cited source it tells you the exact path this light info comes from. In the second source read paragrapgh 7 or 8 and it tells you from the real eyes eventually to the pineal gland. I'm arguing that the pineal gland does something not that it is a third eye. What it does is adjust melatonin levels if you read the scond source due to the pineal gland knowing but not seeing light differerences
<br />
Niushirra if your points were directed at me they were misinterpereted I said the pineal is sensititve to light not that that it sees light

			Well, at least you can make sensical conclusions. How do you think the biological clock knows when day and night are? It adjusts itself by calculating the amount of light coming in through the eyes by means of melatonin. 
<br />

<br />
The longer the day, the more light coming in through the eyes. The more light coming in through the eyes, the more melatonin is produced. The more melatonin is produced, the longer the day according to the biological clock.

<br />
this biological clock that determines the amount of sunlight coming in through the eyes has an importance to rabbits and other animals. THe changing sunlight tells the animals what season it is and when to breed. 
<br />

<br />
Also high doses of melatonin can induce fatigue and sleepiness. I think this natural chemical of the body could be used as a sleep drug as long as the body keeps producing its normal melatonin amounts and doesnt notice the excess melatonin.
