			Just a question.
<br />

<br />
I just started trying out Psychokinesis (Was bored, so thought what the hell, nothing better to do). Made a paper psi-wheel. Put my hands round it, and for the first half hour, nothing happened. However, I read a thread about how you should try making a &quot;psi-ball&quot; where the wheel is, and &quot;ask&quot; it to move. Although asking it didn't do anything, a feeling more like &quot;allowing&quot; it to move brought me results.
<br />

<br />
The wheel started spinning. &quot;Hurray&quot;, I thought. It would slowly stop when I wanted it to stop. Then I made a psi-wheel made out of aluminium foil. Spun round like the paper one pretty easily. I heard someone say that the true test is when you put a glass over it, and try to make it move.
<br />

<br />
So that's what I did. Now, this was frustrating. For around 45 minutes, it didn't even move at all. Nothing. So I tried concentrating that extra bit harder. What about? Nothing, I just concentrated hard on the wheel. And guess what? IT MOVED! Hurray.
<br />

<br />
But it's not all good. See, it moved, but it moved so so slowly. Like I concentrated on one corner of the wheel, and it took around 10-15 seconds to move 90 degrees anti-clockwise. I stopped (My head was hurting), played a little counter strike, then started again. It moved again, but took around 10 seconds to move another 90 degrees anti-clockwise. My head was hurting again (Usually goes away after a minute or so), so stopped. Gonna try again tomorrow.
<br />

<br />
I even blew hard at the glass to make sure that no air can get in that's making it look like I'm doing something. Psi-wheel never moved when I blew hard, so it was me!
<br />

<br />
Please advise me, my fellow, more powerful psions:
<br />

<br />
1. How do I make this power stronger? I want to make the foil turn around faster. Will practice do it, or is there a quicker way?
<br />

<br />
2. My head usually hurts around the front bit (Frontal lobe), and the back of the head, around the bit where it connects to the spine. Is that normal? I wouldn't say it hurts, just feels funny. You can just feel you're doing something like exercise on those bits.
<br />

<br />
3. How soon after this &quot;psi-wheel under the glass&quot; would you recommend going to small objects? And what small object should I try to move first on the next step of developing this wonderful skill?
<br />

<br />
Thanks.

			1. Just keep practicing. Pretty soon, you will be able to spin the wheel much better.
<br />
2. Not really sure why...
<br />
3. When you get better at the wheel so that you can move it fluently(change directions), then you should move on to larger(or maybe smaller like a straw) objects.

			I can only really answer the second question out of experience, but I get that as well. It's a strange, funny, tingling, pressure-ish, essentially undescribable feeling, right? For me, it's around where a third eye supposedly is. 
<br />

<br />
I'd say it's fine and nothing to worry about, though if I concentrate too hard it hurts and THAT'S not a very good sign. So stop for a few minutes in that case.
<br />

<br />
For the last question, this is a good article to help you decide: <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=113" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=113</a>
<br />

<br />
I would think it would be best to practice on several different objects, to reduce a tendency to become attached to the psi wheel. Warm up with it, and once it is moving fairly easily, change to an empty Coke can and practice for a while on that. And it wouldn't hurt to have a third object as well; a marble maybe? I've only recently started practising PK again and this is the way I've decided to do it. Hope it helps.

			Well, I tried a small ball of aluminium foil , put both of my hands round it, but it refused to move. Tried for at least two hours on and off, but didn't work.
<br />

<br />
Tried using my hands to move the piece of foil under the glass, and seems to move slightly quicker now. Then, decided not to use my hands, and tried to move the foil using my mind - Foil moved around 180 degrees slowly before stopping. Concentrated again, and foil moved another 180 degrees slowly before stopping.
<br />

<br />
Interesting..
