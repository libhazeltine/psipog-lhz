			there is such thing as beginners luck, however i do not belive in luck itself.
<br />

<br />
the downside to gambling is.. when you win money, you get overexcited and the more you win the more likely you are to lose that money by being arrogant.

			yup, it's a trick. if you start losing from the beginning, you'll think it's not my lucky day, maybe i should stop. but if you win at first... you get excited and first don't mind losing. you'll end up betting your last coin, tried and true.  (not my experience, just noticing about the common casino players)
<br />

<br />
search for some casino player's profiles and psychology. you'll find a lot of interesting stuff there

			Thats really great!
<br />
I dont believe in luck itself it is mostly the thoughts you send out that make the luck happen, so if you are happy and relaxed you will win quicker than when you are stressed.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, to practice micro-PK is a good thing and when you get better at it you can try the same again, and win even more <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I'll talk to you on msn about it soon!
<br />
Anyway Congratulations!
