			I'm going to write an article on the different uses of psi, but I would like you hear your ideas. What skills do you use and how in your daily lives? Where do you use these skills? ex: school? home? work? shopping? Any warnings or tips? The more creative, the better.

			I entertain myself by making little psi-shapes (race cars, toy guns, random squishy blobs of psi I chuck around, etc.) and mess with them. Sometimes I put them in people's heads or hands--and they stare at me. I laugh at them.

			i use PK to close doors and things. PK entertains me when im bored, really.

<br />

<br />
i play around with psi, just becuase i can lol
<br />

<br />
erm i use RV to find things that my friends and i have lost.

			I use PK alot to move things, to bring things from distances, though I try to avoid picking things up.
<br />

<br />
I also use psi just to snse the emotions of those around me so that I can prevent myself from making any mistakes.
<br />

<br />
Also, I live on a fault line (the San Andreas fault), so the other psions and I try and do a measly little bit to keep our area from going kaboom when the fault shifts.  But thats major application, and takes all sixty-five of us to even keep a bit the same.
<br />

<br />
So yeah.

			I would miss my phone all the time if it weren't for the fact that I knew when it was going to go off. Empathy's always useful and it's kind of extended so that I can gain the answers to questions and stuff without asking them physically - saves a lot of time and effort. 
<br />

<br />
And auras can be entertaining if nothing else.

			I use a construct at school that tells me where my friends are sometimes. I put a shield in my door to keep people out, and a construct in the hall to tell me whhn someones coming, and once or twice I've put a construct in the drive way to tell me when someone was pulling in. I also use telepathy to get a feel for people.
