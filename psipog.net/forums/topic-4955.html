			i went on holiday last week with my family and me and my sister were on the beach, it was really hot so I decided to create a psi-ball to cool myself down. after about 2 hours I had a good strong ball going and my sister said she could feel it cooling her down
<br />
so then my sister had an idea &quot;why not use the psi ball ... as a volley ball?&quot; so i picked it up and threw it at my sister and she hit it back, and we had a great time playing psi-volley ball for over 3.4 hours
<br />
has anyone else played psi-sports
<br />
i think they are a unique experience

If I was to be in the same country as you, I'd be at your door right now.

Then I'd slap you around like that bitch you are.

Sorry to others that read this, but &quot;bekkichan&quot; FUCK OFF. You're probably that other stupid cunt using a proxy.
