			Alright, this was probably over a month ago so some of it has escaped me. Anyone else catch this program? There was this show on the National Geographic Channel. On it they had a karate master that has tought moves to some of the best known martial artists around the world, one including Bruce Lee. So when I heard that this guy is actually at a school where they learn to train there 'Chi', I was instantly glued. I never knew that this thing was serious around the world. They showed videos of this guy and his students, he would throw and invisable Chi ball into a group and they would struggle to stay upright. This was amazing.
<br />

<br />
So then the scientists come in.. and crush whatever plans this dude had going on. They said it was fake, bla bla bla. I was like ok, I knew this was going to happen. But then they do the smartest idea possible. Instead of talking about it, these guys went to prove it wrong first hand. A scientist stood still as the guy had one of his top martial arts students give him the Chi treatment. He put his hands by his face, and I think it was supposed to make him collapse or wobble. It did nothing.. So that was kinda a shocker after all this stuff they showed. Scientests went on to say that it was all in there minds, and the master had affected everyone of the students(kind of like when a preacher shakes a persons demons out on stage, its all adrenaline). So that changed my mind and dissapointed me. Then the Master gave a really lame excuse, something to do with the Scientist might have been wiggling his toes? Psst.

			I saw that, it can be viewed two ways.
<br />

<br />
1. It is not always succesful, and those already with knowledge of the practice are more succeptible. 
<br />

<br />
2.That the scientist were subconciously controlling chi to stop the technique.
<br />

<br />
3. Chi/Psi it's all fake, not real, don't waste your life.
<br />

<br />
I believe psi is real, so I think the second view is possible, since the subconcious can have a big affect on your psi even when you are not trying.

			I believe it was call Is it real? The karate master is named Dillman I believe. I think I went to a few of his seminars when I was still studying martial arts.
