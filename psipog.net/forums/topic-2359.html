			It is just a different method of remote viewing.  It is the matrix method, or something like that, I believe.  Think of it as a grid and everything in the universe has to be connected from something else.  You can acess other information by going through something else that is attachted to it, like iff something is written on a piece of paper, you can connect your self through that paper and to the object.  If you have the coordinates set to a certain object, the coordinates and the object are connected so you can go throught the coordinates to get to the object, it is like a gateway.  Not a very good explanation, probably not completely accurate.  I read it in an article in this site, let me go find that :/.

EDIT: Wow... It is the only article under remote viewing <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

			There are no protocols which I know of which use anything other than target coordinates. It's paining me, deep, deep in my heart, how many people here seem to think that remote viewing is synonymous with clairvoyance. The entire reason the term &quot;remote viewing&quot; was adopted was to get away from that.
<br />

<br />
Remote viewing is based on structured protocol yielding results by an almost bureaucratic adherence to detail within the session itself. Coordinates are used because all RV protocols require the use of a blind - the viewer <span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span> under <span style="font-style: italic">any circumstances</span> know what they are attempting to view - if they do, the session is completely voided.
<br />

<br />
Coordinates mean nothing. They are completely arbitrary. Their format doesn't matter. The only reason they exist is for the viewer to have something to target - the viewer needs something to use as a marker for acquiring the signal line. Without it, the viewer doesn't know what they should be viewing at all.
<br />

<br />
If the viewer is told what they are looking for, then it's entirely possible they are just making stuff up. It's also possible that they're extrapolating using a rational deductive process. It's even possible that they're clairvoyantly viewing the foreign location. But it's not possible that they are remote viewing, because RV protocol dictates that the viewer must not know until after the session is complete what it is they were looking at.
