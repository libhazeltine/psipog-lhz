Honestly, I don't believe you do. I pray for the future of this community, and that this movement may been channeled for the Greater Good.

Blessings, dear Sean. You have come upon the same realization that I have made a few months ago as well. I pray also that your Spirit may guide you on that path which has been set out before you.

			Peebrain i couldn't agree with you more about OBE's being the bridge. I've felt this way since i could remember seeing mighty max travel to the astral plane lol ( I must've been like 6-7)...ever since then I could feel inside me it was real ( or somthing like it) and knew it's the key...the big door....can't wait to hear about your progress...never give up  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Sean, your latest blog post reminds me so much of me it's frightening.  Partially because you're a few months (or perhaps a few days, who knows?) ahead of me and I'm looking at my immediate future self and freaking out at the changes that are inevitable. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
At the same time it's relieving.  So I sympathize (as well as empathize?) with what you've gone through (and are still going through).  I'm glad psipog served it's purpose to you, however I would agree with others that while it's purpose for YOU has ended, that does not mean it's useless.  There are plenty of people who still have yet to be fascinated by little paper wheels and balls of energy, get all wrapped up in the parlor tricks and neat things they can do, then realize they got all wrapped up because they were afraid of a fundamental truth about themselves and the world around them.  So I'd say pass it off, but if you choose to do otherwise, I'm sure these people will find a new psionic site to hang out and grow at <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Btw, if you decide to make a new OBE/LD/Spirituality site, count me in as a member.  Enjoy your journey <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Well, i am a bit dissapointed. I mean, if psipog generates enough income to support itself, then why put it down? No worries, just pay the bills. This site had an enormous influence on me and i believe it can do so for future psions. Spirituality is coming, but are the newbies going to read articles and believe cause they are on the &quot;truthful internet&quot; or because there are people chatting and interacting with them who support psionics? I think the answer is simple and clear. I say keep up psipog. I already find it a psionic safe haven, so maybey we all can too.

			Thank you for all your replies.
<br />

<br />
I'm glad some people see the same perspective that I see.  I know that others don't understand what I'm talking about.  Let me try another way.
<br />

<br />
First, I will be archiving PsiPog.net.  I've decided that this makes the most sense.  I will be shutting down all interactive parts of the site though.  No membership, no forums, no chat, no Q&amp;A.  The Q&amp;A will remain up - just in archive form.
<br />

<br />
Do not take this to mean that you must follow me, or you must quit psionics.  Not at all.  I encourage everyone to continue practicing and learning.  There is more than enough information in the articles to last you for years, and nearly every strange question has been addressed with the Q&amp;A system.  You have everything you need, and then some.
<br />

<br />
The only thing that is going away is the community.  This really isn't that huge either... PsiPog has been without forums for a very long time.  The chat will go away, but that's doesn't affect the 14,000 members of PsiPog that much.  It affects the 100 or so chatters who visit, and this is the only thing I honestly feel bad about - it feels I know a lot of the chatters personally.  The forums aren't that big of a deal... like others have said - move on to another forum, if you need a forum.  There are hundreds of new forums posted in the links section... or pick another psionic site that you feel serves your interests.
<br />

<br />
Honestly, I don't like forums in general.  I have nothing against the PsiPog forums... I just don't like ANY forums in general <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.  I think the forums we have here are awesome compared to a lot of other forums... but at the same time, I view it as a distraction.  People worry about sigs and tedious thread games more than intelligent discussion.
<br />

<br />
Don't feel that my own slow pace with psychokinesis means that PK is impossible.  It isn't.  Anyone can learn it, I'm absolutely convinced.  I can learn it, and I know where my mistakes in the past have been made.  But I still run into the same problem: why learn PK?  So I can slide books around?  What is the bigger purpose?  Learning PK does not serve my goals.
<br />

<br />
PsiPog does generate enough income to support the server costs.  But I don't think a lot of people realize how much time I spend on PsiPog every day.  On a weekday, I spend probably 5 of my 8 free hours on PsiPog.  On the weekend, I spend maybe 8-12 hours a day on PsiPog.  You people don't see the e-mails I get every day, asking about psi balls.  Or resetting people's passwords.  Or figuring out why someone couldn't join the site.  Or calling my webhost to figure out why the site went down for 5 minutes.  Or fixing the chat bot.  Or programming the new psipog.  Or browsing and cleaning the Q&amp;A.  Or talking to people privately in the chat.  Or reading possible future articles and giving my opinion on them.  Or proof reading articles.  Or surfing other sites to see if they've discovered anything new.  Or reading research documents.  Or looking up information in books that I've read.  Or checking on my moderators to make sure they're fair.  Or resolving conflicts between moderators.  Or explaining to people why a rule exists.  Or fielding people's complaints, and getting to the bottom of a conflict.
<br />

<br />
There is a lot of little things that I do every day to <span style="font-weight: bold">maintain</span> PsiPog.  Not that I'm complaining - I used to feel these things were necessary, and while it annoyed me sometimes, overall I did enjoy doing these things.  But now I don't believe in PsiPog.  By that I mean I don't believe in the ideals of skepticism and absence of spirituallity.  How can I sit here and enforce rules that I disagree with?  How can I tell people how important skepticism is, but not personally believe in skepticism?  I can't.
<br />

<br />
One of the reasons PsiPog was great was because I worked from my heart.  I honestly believed in what I was talking about.  But now my heart has moved on to something bigger.  I don't have the energy to continue to maintain PsiPog while also working on projects that motivate me.
<br />

<br />
I'm not going to &quot;pass&quot; along the forums to someone else.  Because people are free to create their own forums.  Perhaps I will just create a list of &quot;recommended forums&quot;, and that be it.
<br />

<br />
What makes PsiPog unique was my involvement.  All of you have the freedom to create your own organizations.  Nothing is stopping you except your own limiting beliefs.  I started PsiPog on a free web host, with knowledge of basic HTML and nothing more.  You can create your own site in a week.  You can create your own forum in a day!  Creating a chat room takes all of 5 minutes!  For free!
<br />

<br />
If you believe that PsiPog's ideals are awesome, and that I'm a fool for leaving... then start your own site based on the same ideals.  Go for it!  I created the forum rules, and I officially release them to the public domain.  Feel free to copy/edit them all you want.  I've loved my experience with PsiPog, and I encourage anyone who feels strongly about something to create a website and community of their own.
<br />

<br />
--
<br />

<br />
I agree that throwing PsiPog out the window would be a shame.  The information is useful, and should continue to stay available.  That's why the best decision is to archive it.
<br />

<br />
But any sort of maintenance or active participation from me is hypocritical.  Which is why all interactive parts will be shut down.  This doesn't mean that psionics is dead or anything!  Please, by all means, continue to practice, and continue to share!  But you'll have to do it without me, unless you participate in my new project, concerning OBEs and spirituallity.
<br />

<br />
Like I said.  You have all the information you need.  If you think you need my active participation for you to succeed in psionics, then you underestimate yourself too much.  And if you need help, check out all the communities in the link section, like PsiOnline, UPCOnline, PPSociety, PSC-Online, PsiPalatium, PsionGuild, PsiScape, etc...  There is more than enough live support.
