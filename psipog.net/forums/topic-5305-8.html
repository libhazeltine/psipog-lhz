Personal experience teaches me otherwise. Waiting has only brought about misery in my life. The only times I've ever achieved anything close to happiness were when I took action and pursued that happiness. I'm sure you'd like to believe you can do nothing and get everything, but that's just not how things work. To achieve inner peace, you meditate. To get a good job, you go out and look for one. To get a good education, you study and do your homework, and try to find a good college. To get a girlfriend/boyfriend you dress decent and take care of yourself and go out looking for one. To stay entertained you look for fun things to do. Everything you have, either you worked for or someone you know worked for. You didn't just find your computer laying in the middle of the street with a sign that says &quot;take me home,&quot; and the food in your refrigerator didn't just magically grow there. Happiness is not about being lazy and doing nothing. The only way you're going to get something for little to nothing is if you play the lottery, and the odds in winning are stacked very highly against you.
<br />

And maybe it's just me, but &quot;doing what I feel like&quot; is doing nothing. If I could be happy just sitting around all day, believe me, I would just sit around all day. Once again, I know from personal experience that if I want to be happy, I have to pursue happiness. And that's all life is, really, the pursuit of happiness.

			True what you say, but why do you assume that it's for everybody the same or similar like for you? You can't tell how it's like for other people for example because you have never been another person,... well maybe you have but don't know it, but anyway. Somethings or some peope aren't what they seem to be. But i think it's really good to rely rather on personal experience, than on what others say, like you do, because in the end your experiences are the only thing you can really trust. You can trick yourself, but still it's better than being tricked by others.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />
