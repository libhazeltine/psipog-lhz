			There is a thread like that in the PK forum. It was started by the mighty Peebs himself. It covers all the acceptable terms, and explains what is and isn't allowed, and why.

			sgtpsion is right.  The main problem, though, is that no newbies look at that topic (or the rules for that matter)

			Maybe it is possible to have the rules with acceptable definations be the first page before registering on the forums.  Also it may be helpful to lock that page there for 10-15 mins before you can move on to registration.  Sort of like the defensive driving online courses where they regulate your time in each section, and if you time out or something it makes you start over (to ensure your actually reading stuff).
<br />

<br />
I think it is pretty important that people read and follow the rules, but I think Peebrain just needs to decide if he wants to force people to read them or not.

			It would be great if he forced people to actually READ. The main problem is what if people won't read no matter what?
<br />

<br />
There's actually a kind of glossary somewhere. I think there's one in the psion handbook.
<br />

<br />
I don't know, maybe he could try some kind of test system. Like the one you have to pass at <a href="http://www.elfwood.com" target="_blank">www.elfwood.com</a> (art gallery). You read the rules and then you answer a constantly changing test. Depending on how well you did, you are able to register as a member with a key password made specially for you (sent in by e-mail).
<br />

<br />
Then again, it's just an idea.
