			from my frist day that i decided to practice i was practicing everyday and 2 days off in week but nowdays i cant spin the psi wheel paper and i can move the psi wheel foil but before the foil psi wheel was very easy to spin so i was spinning the paper psi wheel but now i cant spin the paper psi wheel and have little deffecults in spinning foil psi wheel but the strange thing is that i can move the foil psi wheel from very far distance like more then 10 feet . 
<br />

<br />
so i think there are other things that we still did not discover and we need to watch ourselves and see when and which state we are in when we are very good at tk . but for me i watched myself but there are little things that i notes but not very helpfull . and i still think that there is somethings is missed in tk that we dont know it.
<br />

<br />
i dont mean if we discover that things we will move cars and so on <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> i mean if we discover it , it will make tk easier and get fast improvements and with that things we can solve that strange things that happen to us like some people say they moved psi wheel but when they moved to move pencils and moved pencils they now cant move the psi wheel.

			The state of the planetary energysphere and the phases of the moon effect human energy levels, brain rythms &amp; emotional states, etc.

They probably effect PK, also.

			I think beliefs affect your practice too. This relates to how NI posted about our concept of stable and instable objects. But if I'm working on rolling the can, and I clearly can't get a full roll, but I'll imagine that I've already rolled the can and just moved my hand up closer to it to get it to roll again. That way, in your mind, it doesn't say &quot;I can't roll&quot;, it's &quot;I already have and I'm trying to do it again&quot;. It seems to bring me more successes with movements. I figured that one out from the psiwheel because I realized that it was easier for me to continue the spinning motion once it already was going, even if it was going slow at first.
