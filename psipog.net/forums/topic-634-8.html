			A) 6 minutes to read 800+ words and type a responds is kinda iffy, did you actually read all of that?
<br />

<br />
B) *Refers to first comment, when did I say it was superhuman? And basically yes to the energy comment though, theres only two ways to satisfy this equation, one is to provide more energy and the other is the x factor that maybe you could seriously improve your focus to get more effect for the reaction (I got a feeling theres quite a lot of energy loss that results from tk- think of the energy seeping away from the point you're focusing it at if you didn't get what I meant - which would explain why some people say its an less efficient way of moving stuff). Either way though takes a ton of time. General rule for anything, if it was so easy to do you'd see more people doing it. So unless you see a lot of people doing the thing in question, its probably not that easy.

			concentration isnt a problem with me, about the super human when you say that you need that enorumous amount of energy to move the pencil,you were basicelly saying that an averge tk practioner wouldnt be able to do it,and this would only be achieved by a pro

			No, you misread, the pencil isn't too bad, levitating a person though is. Since a pencil is like a couple ounces at best, I think my calculations are somewhere, roughly the average person is 1500 times the weight of a pencil.

			I'm an intermediate psion that's been practicing in some form for the past: *counts* 5-6 years with a sufficient amount of experience in energy manipulation, energy management, some tk, and starting experience in a handful of other abilitities. Its both science and my personal experiences with how far you can yourself with psionics that I know how hard it would be to pull this off.

			I've aluded to this before, the energy management stuff I'm doing needs refining, right now I don't want to put too many other people through this. The rewards are promising but some of the strains it can cause through long term use are concerning. There's some more simple and tried and true stuff around if you look enough. Head over to PSC and look around for charging techniques and stuff like that.

			I was trying to say that what I was refering to would be unsafe for you, although there are places you can find stuff for what you are looking for that you could do without any problems, I bet one of the mods in chat knows either that or you could poke around between here, PSC and Psionline, I'm pretty sure out of those three if you ask around someone will have some stuff.

			hmmm ok, i asked you cause there is stuff i can find on the net you could number a few:
<br />

<br />
1- i feel a vibe or pressure i dont know what to call it,that moves really fast and it moves with my will,what is this,
<br />

<br />
2-i feel more confertable seeing the energy rather then feeling it i dont know how to improve this,does aura vision help? what else should i try
<br />

<br />
3 how do i know im actually manipulating or controlling energy? i dont know if im actually doin it
<br />

<br />
i cant seem to find the answears for this on the internet so i cant find a way to practice this.

			I can't levitate. But If I was going to try. would it make sense to shoot psi or chi from underneathe you. for example. You make a chi ball in your hands.. you could project your own chi out of your feet in a jet like manner to shoot up... but that would take a lot of practice I'm assuming... maybe something with aerokinesis... wind manipulation around your body... Leviation is highly possible... And I'm sure there is more than one way to successfully achieve it.. But for each person I'm sure it's different as well... hope this has helped... ~peace to all~

			A technique I tried a couple of times in my free time is filling my entire body with psi and visualizing it pushing up on me from the inside like it's lighter than air (think Helium).  So far it's made me feel a little lighter but I have yet to leave the ground.

			I thought about levitation last night, instead of using your whole body I decided to try a flat piece of paper. Instead of making it float up, I moved my hand down, and let it float.. no I didn't actually get it to work, but I felt it getting a little lighter. So it's a start. But another idea would be to do that. Are you floating up? or are you pushing the earth down? XD
