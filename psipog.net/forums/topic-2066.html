			i have tried a few times to have an OBE but the one thing keeping me away from it is that i stop breathing once i am close to leaving my body. i stop breathing for a little while, but then once i do breath (sp?) the whole process is messed up and i cant have an OBE.

			That could be the fact that you are losing sensation of your physical body, in which case you really don't feel anything, I don't know, I OBE from lucid dreams.
<br />

<br />
My breathing doesn't stop when I try it the regular way, though. Keep trying and see. Maybe have someone watch you and wake you up if you stop breathing.

			When you say you stop breathing, do you have any of the usual effects of not breathing, e.g. lack of air, discomfort, trying to get a breath, etc.?
<br />

<br />
While I haven't stopped breathing before, I have had my heartbeat &quot;stop&quot; - I simply ceased being aware of my heartbeat, which I am ordinarily very aware of when lying still in bed, even in a trance.
<br />

<br />
The big thing to remember here is that your body will not - I repeat, <span style="font-weight: bold">will not</span> - allow you to run out of air. Try it. Breathe out, and don't breathe in. The longest I can simply sit and not breathe without my body forcing a breath is seven seconds (note that I can of course hold my breath for much longer - I'm talking about the amount of times it takes for my body to feel the need to breathe in). If you begin to run out of oxygen, your body <span style="font-weight: bold">will</span> take in a breath.
<br />

<br />
The worst that will happen is that somehow you will not breathe for a minute, two minutes, whatever, and you will black out and then start breathing again. It is physiologically impossible to hold your breath long enough to kill yourself without external help.
<br />

<br />
Hope that helps.

			I have had this problem before.  I get the feeling that I need to breath, but if I ignore it I don?t pass out or anything, so I think it?s not that I am not breathing, but that I have lost all sense of my body.
<br />

<br />
I also find that when I get my body relaxed to the point where I can no longer sense my breathing, I can easily leave my body, once I block the sensation to breathe out of my mind.
