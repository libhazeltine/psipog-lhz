			Dont do psi vamping.  DEFINETLY combat, DEFINETLY not good.  Why do you think it's ok to &quot;feed&quot; off someone elses energy?  They rightfully were born with it, rightfully gained it.  Why is it ok for <span style="text-decoration: underline">YOU</span> to steal <span style="text-decoration: underline">THEIR</span> energy?  That is plain ass holeness to me.  Also, it majorly screws up the astral world i hear, so yet another reason not to do it.  How about you just meditate.  Do yoga.  Open yourself so you naturally gain energy, instead of ripping it out of someone.  And there are horrible side effects.  You start NEEDING to steal energy or you cant get through the day.  It easily becomes an addiction, especailly as you get better at it.
<br />

<br />
Please stop,  you dont want to be a vampire, trust me.  Natural energy vampires almost always want to be free from it, it's like your mocking them.  Not nice

			<img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> i was just trying it , i wanted to see if i will see defrance or not that is all and i stopped it from long time . 
<br />

<br />
but i dont know if it drop your tk power or it was me as always get tk energy dropped.
<br />

<br />
i tryed to take energy from light too but hmm i dont think it is good idea because we dont know whitch energy is good for us . 
<br />

<br />
all i was thinking about if we get more energy will that help in tk or not but i think it is not helpfull .
<br />

<br />
all my thoughts about how to get better im trying to find way to help us and i think alot of us are stuck in psi wheel so im searching for way to help us that is all . maybe i thought with combat way but i did not mean to do bad thing , i was think if it succed then there is other way without combat way similar to that.
<br />

<br />
by the way sometimes when i see old people i imagin that some of my energy go out of me to go inside them to help them and give them more energy to move on .

Psi vampirism is no big thing. Like someone said before we all do it to some level or another and its usually just skimming off the top of energy thats probably just gonna go to waste anyway. If the intent is to harm another person by draining however, then I'd agree with what you said about it making whoever does it an asshole. 
<br />

<br />
What horrible side effects are you talking about exactly? A headache? Fatigue? Thats not really all that horrible and only occurs if you drain too much. 
<br />

<br />
Taking someones energy screws up the astral world? Um no, thats just silly.   
<br />

<br />
Draining gives some people a buzz although I'm unsure how addictive that is. I doubt they develop a dependance on it like you suggest. You seem to be imprinting your own subjective view onto this. I appologise if I've misunderstood.

			Actually, someone on the forums (I won't say their name) said that it IS addictive and you can become dependent on it, because they have. They said that they can't get through the day without blacking out or something if they don't. 
<br />
I personally wouldn't do it because it can lower your ability in psion skills and decreases the amount of psi YOU can have. Not sure about screwing up the astral world, but it still is not nessecary to do, since we all have the capabilty to make our own energy, it's just a case of whether or not we choose to get that bit extra. 
<br />
Have you ever been on a long trek or walk somewhere and felt so tired you could die? Well, there is always that little bit of energy you can pull out of your ass, isn't there? Some people actually think they don't have ANY psi/energy left, so they drain it, which, in my opnion isn't worth getting dependent on. It's like a drug, once you've tasted it, you don't want to go cold turkey (blackout/fatigue). 
<br />
And anyways, we've gone so far off topic we might as well be talking about chickens. <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />
