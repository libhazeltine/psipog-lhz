While DanialH may not be particularly nice with his skepticism or enforcing of the rules, he is enforcing what the rules say. Also, while I actually agree with MartialArtist and the whole energy as a food idea, it isn't unreasonable to ask for proof of such an amazing feat. I remember reading a while back about a guy who went for sixty day increments eating virtually nothing. (He experimented with small portions of one food to study the effect) Sadly, I can't remember where I saw this, so I'm not presenting it as proof.

Just remember, proof is a good thing to have for extraordinary claims.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I remember reading about an Indian man who was tested by NASA.  The man reportedly went for around 180 days without eating solid foods, and instead received sustaining energy via the sun through some obscure yogic method (i think, i could be mistaken on the &quot;yogic&quot; part).  The man did however have tea and coffee, and cigarettes.
<br />

<br />
However, when you compare this man to edwardHowl, the man at least claims to have a somewhat believable source of nutrition during the fasting period.  Supposedly he was working off of some photosynthetic effect.  I believe it had something to do with sunlight and the pineal gland.  I'm still a bit fuzzy on his explanation of how it worked, but I believe that this is the jist of it.
<br />

<br />
On the other hand, edwardHowl claims to have not eaten for a month.  While that is certainly possible, it's not recommended.  As Melia correctly noted, a lack of nutritional intake will  turn the body on itself, digesting stored fats first, and then moving onto muscle and other tissues for sustenance.

<br />
Pure and unsubstantiated bullshit.  You do not get calories out of thin air.  The meditation may have staved off edwardHowl's appetite, but there is nothing to suggest that he was being sustained by energy, more likely by stored fats.  
<br />

<br />
edwardHowl, I would suggest you check out some books and articles on fasting if you wish to make it part of your lifestyle.  I agree that fasting here and there is a good way to purge the body, but it should not be done willy-nilly and without explicit knowledge of the entire process.  I suggest the same for anyone else who has read or is reading this thread and has become inspired to fast.  Educate yourself.

			i hear thinking things through is the hip thing to do, so, lets do so
<br />
lets first look at some definitions
<br />

<br />
Energy - The ability to do work
<br />

<br />
Ok, so the large amount of us on this site can agree, that doing work on, lets say a psiwheel, you are using energy.
<br />

<br />
Calorie - A unit used to represent the amount of heat needed to raise 1 gram of water by 1? C
<br />

<br />
Well, now it is questionable, but i believe there are some who can effect the heat of objects, lets say wicks of candles, and are able to heat them up to the point of combustion (which i might add is alot more than a one degree change.)
<br />

<br />
well, from this, it seems that one would be able to create calories...
<br />

<br />
i will recognize this argument, however, which i havent even seen clearly raised yet;
<br />
but ed, by exerting energy outwards onto an object to create heat, wouldnt that energy come from within, by burning calories? and havent many fellows on the site claimed to get hungry or fatigued after preforming pk and other related tasks?
<br />

<br />
good point me
<br />
i feel that energy can be drawn from natural sources, such as the earth, sun, or any of the elements as well as from eating, breathing, or drinking
<br />
so i feel one could draw such energy and continue to do the work needed in one's body to create calories
<br />

<br />
but this view is stepping into the unknown, so i cannot justify it, like many other things on this site

It is a fairly logical assumption to assume that you are converting the energy from some bodily reserve. It only becomes a flawed assumption if one is able to draw from other sources. That particular idea, however, has some very hard to answer questions inherent within it.

<br />
That is the million dollar assumption. I personally agree, but as far as your idea goes, if that isn't true, then the energy does come from you. Which would put this whole topic down, because then it would just make it normal fasting, limits and all. So if we assume that this is true, how do you think the body would convert that energy? What form does it take when you draw it from planets? Heat?  How does your body use it? I'd like to know.

Sure, energy is the ability to do work.  You don't create calories.  A calorie is just a unit of heat.  We create heat, though.  The heat we create is what roughly converts to energy.  So we'll do this simply:
<br />

<br />
I eat a hamburger.  That hamburger is said to have 500 calories in it.  That means that when I digest it, I have 500 calories worth of nutrients.  Now I decide to go workout, and I jog for 10 minutes.  Those 10 minutes of jogging expends 500 calories worth of energy.  Here we have equilibrium: I eat enough calories to provide me with enough energy during the day, and I expend enough calories to keep me from storing unwanted calories.
<br />

<br />
When you don't eat anything, you have no calories from ingested foods ready for use.  A failsafe in the human body is the digestion of stored fats and then, if a long enough time has passed, other tissues of the human body.  Pulling energy from other objects would have to introduce readily available nutrients to the body that can be digested and converted to energy for use.  Last time I checked, there is no mechanism for the human body to create nutrients from thin air like this.
<br />

<br />
As I mentioned before, the closest thing I'd heard regarding this would be the Indian man tested by NASA who claims to produce energy through some photosynthetic effect.  If I recall correctly, the method he'd use is something akin to standing barefoot in fresh soil while staring at the sun twice a day (just as the sun is rising and then just as it is setting so he doesn't burn out his retinas).  It seems, though, that these claims have yet to be confirmed.

you say, the heat we create rougly converts to energy, so how about this, we drink water, and heat it using a pk, by accelerating the atoms, moving them more quickly
<br />
thus we would create heat, that our bodies could 'roughly' use
<br />

if were still hung up on the arguement that i pointed out, that we can only use psi from energy we gain from food calories and energy we put into our bodies, then i feel were at an endpass

i would like to know if you agree or disagree with the above statement, our energy exerted through psi (if you believe that psi exists) cannot exceed the energy recieved from food, air, or beverage

   Heat it using PK by using more energy? So we use up energy to get just about... nothing... sounds logical.
