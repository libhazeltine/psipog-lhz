			i was practicing and practiced for 2 hours so i felt boring so i told myself lets make vedio so while doing one , i wanted to make some vedio and choose the good one to put it here in psipogbb but while i was doing one i was using my wabcom so i got idea that to try to move the psi wheel from the computer screen from alive show from the wabcom and try it and the i spined the psi wheel more then 4 times but that i dont know can someone do tk through screens i mean look at the alive show and manipulate the energy around the object to move from very long distance maybe from country to country or it was that my mind know that the psi wheel near me and know its location so to move it in the wabcom show it move the psi wheel near me to make it appear in the wabcom spining?

so what do you think ? 
<br />

<br />
but the idea of tk and rv make the one believe in anything <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> so i think it can be the 2 ideas are right.

			It realy houldn't matter you're still efecting an object, doing something rom a distance doesn't make it right or wrong. Might be harder or easier to do something fro a distance but its still doing it
