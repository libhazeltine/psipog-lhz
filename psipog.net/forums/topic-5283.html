			About 7 years ago I had came home one day from school and found myself sleepy all of a sudden. I gone to my bed, and in a instant a fell into what I thought was a dream. I saw a bright golden light with a girl looking at me, The only thoughts I could think of was &quot;My daughter she is my daughter, I'm so happy&quot; and repeatd this over and over in different setences. I was filled with unbelieveable happiness, that I never felt before or after. I reach up with my hands and arms to reach for her. I felt my arms and hands waveing in the air infront of me for her. Then as soon it was over I woke up laying in my bed. With my hands and arms HIGH in the air as if I was reaching for her. 
<br />

<br />
I saw this golden light again about a 2 months ago. I tried and tried again to remember what exactly what was in this dream.....I remember flashes of pain and suffering more and more, so much chaos was in this dream. I felt my chest was being torn apart. It was...breathtaking, I can't remember any imagines no manner how much mediation I tried. But this is when it gets a little religionish and I don't want to break a rule. I wont say the next part untill I have premission. So i'll leave the next part of the dream out for now.
<br />

<br />
My question is that I'm not so sure what exactly happen? answers?
