			I have always been very good with empathy, and sensing people's feelings. I can even go so far as reading some minds (but that is random and uncontrollable) 
<br />

<br />
I was with a friend, and I told him I was psychic... He said &quot;yea right prove it.&quot; He grabbed a deck of cards... and made me play a little game. 
<br />

<br />
He laid 3 cards face down (2 black 1 red) 
<br />
I sensed the red card 3 times out of 3 tries. 
<br />
Then my friend tried to trick me... He laid 3 black cards down (I don't watch him put the cards down, I would leave the room when he puts them down) 
<br />
I walked into the room... and went into the same state of mind I had the prior 3 times... When I picked a card he flipped it over and it was red. Has anyone else done anything similar? I have no idea how I did it, but it scared the hell out of me when I figured out why my friend was so frightened. I?m not sure what to even label what had accrued. Also, I have not been able to reproduce the effects... all I did was try and picture a red playing card and then I put my hand over each card... If I got a certain indescribable feeling I would say that was the card I chose and he would flip it over and reveal it. 
<br />

<br />
After the whole ordeal, I found it very hard to think clearly about anything, and I was in a panic like state. I have been reading about when people &quot;over use&quot; their personal energy feeling something like this. The feeling could have been just from me being shocked at what had happened too. 
<br />

<br />
Anyways, my main question is has anyone else done something like this before? I have never practiced any psi techniques or anything. Can anyone help me maybe work on my skills, give me tips? I feel like I am just stumbling around in the dark. I would love to learn more about this though.

			That skill would be known as telepathy, I think. Yeah. That's really useful to be able to do that, btw. You could soooo cheat at poker and win shed loads of cash at casinos. hehe. I wouldn't really panic to be honest. It's just a shock that you can do it. I wish I could. Nice going anyway. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />  Try and harness it by reading the articles and trying new stuff.

			@ Psi_Manipulator and eu_citzen, I don't think you fully understand what he told us has happened. Correct me if I am wrong.
<br />

<br />
But Tanzy, did you not mean that your friend laid down three black cards, and you picked out a red one even though your friend had not put down a red card? So it seemed like you changed a black card into a red card right?
<br />

<br />
If that is so, then it could be several things. It could be your friend making a mistake, or it could go as far as materialization of the red card.

			I think MartialArtist is right.You could have possibly teleported the black card and manifested or materialized a red card in its place..... <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> seems pretty astonishing!!!

			Yes MartialArtist has it right. My friend laid down 3 black cards to trick me.
<br />
I still pulled a red card... somehow.
<br />

<br />
There is almost no chance of my friend making a mistake, because the whole reason we where doing this in the 1st place was to &quot;test&quot; the idea. Also my friend is very good at handling cards to begin with.
<br />
This wasn't telepathy, that is reading minds correct? I did not know which card to choose via my friend, I knew which one to choose via some undiscribable feeling I got when I put my hand over the right card; Ten again, the feeling could of been comming from my friend.I really have no idea... I just know what it feels like when it will be the right choice.
<br />

<br />
Hope this clears things up... this stuff is confusing lol
