			Why on this website, is anything to do with death and the afterlife, shunned away and classed as &quot;religous&quot;. If psipog is truly a site enduring the boundaries of science, then shouldnt dying, death and the afterlife be explored as a possibilty? Why do the leaders of the site shun it away? There are many things that connect psionics to the afterlife.  The Out of Body Experience, you leave your body, doesnt that say something to you? Holy shit, I am out of my body maybe this is my soul, and this is what I am after death. Astral Projection, people go to the astral plane...have you considered that maybe...that is part of where we go when we die? Why is nobody on this site questioning the beliefs of the leaders of the site. The site was obviously started to shed more light on life, but it restricts talk about one of the most important subject, death. Psipog is a classic example of society, where everyone is a sheep. Ask questions and think for yourself.

			I agree that people should ask questions and think for themselves.  I don't tell people what to think about death, or the afterlife... as proof, you can privately ask the mods what they think about death and the afterlife, and they will give you different answers.
<br />

<br />
Death and the afterlife do fall under religion... The definition I use for religion is anything that answers the questions: 1. How did we get here? 2. What happens when we die?  The reason I shy away from the topics is because people get real emotional about answering those questions, and things get ugly.  Everyone has a different opinion, and no one really knows for sure - because no one was around when the beginning happened, and no one has died yet!  Our site is based on personal experience.  It's impossible that you have died and could tell me your experience.  It's also impossible that you have been around for a few billion years, and can talk about that.
<br />

<br />
Therefore, we just avoid the topic.  It brings more trouble than good.
<br />

<br />
There are also a lot of other websites that allow discussion of religion.  So it's not like our ban on religion would somehow stop people from talking about it if they want to talk about it.... just go to another site.  PsiPog exists so that people who DON'T want to talk about religion, and want to look at the &quot;hard data&quot;, can come here and hang out.
<br />

<br />
I can post more on this philosophy, but I have to go somewhere.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Ok, now I have more time.
<br />

<br />
The main complaint I have is that people are too quick to explain things away using religion.  It doesn't take that much effort to examine things and try to find better explainations.  By restricting religion conversation on my site, I hope to break through those explainations, to discover some better understanding.  People first thought Zeus sat on clouds and threw lightning down from the sky (did people really believe that?), but now we know a little better how lightning works.  We don't have it completely figured out, but we know what we know, and we know what we don't know - which is a great start.

			Yeah, I agree. Different people have different opinions on the life and death matter, for example, and I'm not going too deep here, God, and the Big Bang, and Heaven and the Astral Plane, which are not to be mixed up. But Who really knows?

			Who is to say that when you have an OOBE, it is your soul that leaves your body.  My biggest reason for avoiding the religion issue that there is little proof for eigther side.

			Basically I think death and the afterlife is more of when you die, you are reborn into a new body with absolutely no memory of your prior state.  But these prior bodies can be brought out by deep hypnotism/past life regression sessions.
