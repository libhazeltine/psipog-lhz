			I've recently been working on trying to change my eye colour (with no success) and I noticed when staring very closely at a mirror it seems that you can somewhat control your pupil dialation. I was VERY close to the mirror and a small lamp and when I focused on trying to open my pupils more, they would. And it was not a small change, it was very noticable. It also seemed as if I was fighting to keep them open when they should've been more dialated (seeing as I was so close to the light with my eyelids WIDE open) it reminded me of fighting the psi-wheel to continully spin one way when I first started that. However, I do not know much about how the pupils really work and if they are always opening/closing in that manner, continually adjusting. Yet I cannot seem to get past the fact that it really did seem as if I had some conscience control over them. My question to all of you is if you COULD develope 100% control over them do you think you could attain super-human night vision?...And do you think it's even possible?

			Pupil dilation is a necessary mechanism to keep you from burning up your retinas and other parts of your visual system.  It would probably be much better if you let pupil dilation remain an automatic function rather than take conscious control over it.

			To avoid the damage that Roy has described, try it in low light conditions. The better night vision you get, lower the lighting even more. That would be a safe bet. Yeah, your pupils change constantly, contracting for higher light conditions, and detracting I guess would be the word for darker areas, lol.

			Your pupils dilate to allow more light to enter your retina, there are reasons this function isn't left to the conscious mind, you can blind yourself trying to control it yourself. It would be safer, if you still want to try it anyway, to practice in dim areas but why would you want to risk something as important as your eyesight for something as useless as seeing in the dark, there are goggles you can buy to do that for you.

			What you are talking about here is the ability of eye called the power of accomodation.I suggest you do not play with your eyes because it's very very very risky.Also,forcing your eyes to see in dark makes your ciliary lens to expand.After trying that for a long time,the ability of the eye decreases.Then,when there is bright light a huge amount of light would enter your eye,which would,
<br />
a) make your retina burn and
<br />
b) makes your ciliary lens lose its main ability thereby leading you to permanent loss of eyesight.
<br />

<br />
Why lose your eyesight?Have you seen everything in this world ?I suppose no.Besides,I don't think there is anything interesting in night vision.Why can't you use nightvision googles or a torch ?
<br />
Anyway,I don't think your method is practically good,but its worth thinking.

P.S I was only thinking about how cool it would be to let them do their work (your retinas) and if for some reason you by yourself or with others, got caught in almost total darkness, then BAM! you consciously open them very wide and it's like you have your own built-in night vision goggles.

They already do jump wide open when they need to, it's just your brain needs time to adjust to seeing in the dark.
<br />

<br />
And I don't think you'd be able to train yourself to have better night vision because it simply isn't in our biology to have it.

			night vision is eye ability and humans dont have that ability but some kind of animals have it , all we can do is to control our eyes to dercrease or increase our eye sight , i can do that btw <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> .

			We're not designed for it. I mean, if we adapt to darkness, being in light becomes dangerous or very agitatable. We would become a bunch of mole rats.

I don't understand why this topic is still going, it's worthless. Night-vision is probably not practical in daily life. I could think of better uses of DMILS then controlling my dialation of my pupils

			beleive it or not, humans have the same abilitly to use nite vison as animals. Nite vision is caused by a special liqued that is around your eye. Animals that have nite vision rarely blink as much as humans so the liquid builds up and they nite vision. Humans blink constantly which wiped away the liqued ( i forget the name of the substance). Anyway if u close ur eyes for 20 minutes in total darkess and open ur eyes ull be able to see in the dark until u blink

			Night vision is only useful if you want to sneak around in the dark, which is exactly why it's something students learn in ninjutsu. Of course, most normal people don't go assassinating sentries at night time every other week, so I agree with neveza on the point that it is not useful. Of course, learning new skills is always rewarding, so it is not pointless to learn to use your nightvision
