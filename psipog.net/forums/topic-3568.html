			Ok so ive been studying telepathy and practicing hard when i can for about two weeks now and im ok at it. Today i was at a Japanese restaurant and the waitress was taking our drink order. My grandpa ordered a coke my dad ordered a coke and i ordered a water. In my mind i was thinking &quot;dam i want some tea&quot;, but i didn say nothing. as she was leaving the table she said, &quot;okay two cokes, water&quot; then she mumbled something my dad asked me if she got it right and i said lets wait. The waitress came back with two cokes a water and tea but only one cup for me. I tried to disprove myself that i did anything telepathically but i think i sent something inadvetantly. Am i reading too far into this or is it plausible?

			seems like a subconscious act. maybe you have telepathy and haven't developed control or awareness and we sometimes do these thing when we don't even know we did it. it is just breaking through unnoticed and it's your job to find it and channel it.

			It could be, but to me TPS involves beating the statistics.  I won't discuss my methods as Peebrain considers it combat, but as with most telepathy practice, if you can make pretty good stats for your sessions and improve that means your skill improved.  To me the numbers are proof as to where my skill is at.

A single event can be chaulked up to coincidence or chance or whatever, but a 70-80% success rate IMO cannot be.

Hey how's it going?
<br />

<br />
I see it this way, if you didn't verbally say tea, didn't point, or hint to wanting tea... And the waitress brought it to you, how could it not be some form of Telepathy? If you made it clear that you wanted water, and everyone was clear that they wanted coke, it's pretty clear cut.
<br />

<br />
I have had instances where I would be walking far behind someone I know (Maybe about half a football field away), and I would think their name and they would turn around and wave. Apparently, in those instances, they told me that I called them by name. I think your instance is pretty much the same, except for saying tea.
<br />

<br />
I hope that helped.
