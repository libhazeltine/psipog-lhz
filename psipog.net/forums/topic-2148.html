			The Law of Conservation of Engery says the engery cannot be creates nor destroied, only changed. Since we all draw our energy from some sorce to create out psi balls and such, I was wondering if it would be at all possible to manipulate yourself. I'm sure there would be a great risk invovled, and would not be able to be done very often. Yet still I wonder. Could we possibly speak with our subconinsiouness (sp?) and send out messages to our bodies to form to our will. Could the out lying energies be turned into complete matter, and be able to mold us. I'm sure even if this is possible it would be limited seeing as evolution would have put us with this ability if we were suppose to have it. Please feel free to leave any examples and such.

			My friend you have touched on a most important matter. You do control your body with your subconcious thoughts, and your concious. The way you think, your outlook on life, and your 'struggle' or 'ease' all physically shape your body. A wonderful, very direct quote I shall provide is;
<br />

<br />
&quot;If you want to know what you were thinking 2 years ago, look at your body now. If you want to know what you will look like in 2 years, look at your mind now.&quot; - Deepak Chopra
<br />

<br />
You, once aware, will find this quote very apt and evident. The reason this is so is because of Intention. Intention is a very very strong power. Your concious Intent, or subconcious Intent, have the power to manipulate the world around you. Here is a beautiful example (link).
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.adhikara.com/water.html" target="_blank">http://www.adhikara.com/water.html</a>
<br />

<br />
By putting your intention on the water, it literally changes the molecules. I believe the phenomenon takes around 12-24hours. Click past the first few pictures, and you will see the examples that have been subject to Intention (which can be thought, or in some examples, a physical labeling of the container). 
<br />

<br />
An interesting conclusion; your body is comprised mainly of water. If your Intention can affect water as the above link, what are the implications with regard to your body? hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I wanted to comment on Masaru Emoto's work, that you linked to.
<br />

<br />
His work should not be considered scientific for any reason what so ever.  He does not support any strict procedures, or even double blind experiments.  What does that mean?  It means he goes to people, and says &quot;Find me a crystal that represents 'love'&quot; - and of course, the person comes back with a beautiful crystal.  A much better way to conduct the experiment would be to say, &quot;I'm not going to tell you what this water represents, just find me an average crystal inside of it&quot;.  This way, the person looking for the crystals isn't biased.
<br />
