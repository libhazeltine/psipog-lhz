			Hi  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Here a nice meditation technique:
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
Length</span>: 1 Hour
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Manner of execution</span>: Sitting, eyes open, in complete, pitch black darkness.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Definitions: </span>
<br />

<br />
Complete darkness – nothing can be seen. Waving a hand in front of the nose can’t be seen.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Recommendations:</span>
<br />

<br />
A - Sitting in the most comfortable place available so no need to move will arise.
<br />

<br />
B – Better be done at the beginning of the night, when the darkness is “fresh”.
<br />

<br />
C – It is allowed to blink, but try keeping the eyes open.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">
<br />
Warning: As a meditation technique, it alter your &quot;energetic structure&quot;, so it is highly recommended to follow it exact simple instructions. If one think it would be difficult for himself doing the technique, it is advisable not to start.</span></span>
<br />

<br />
Enjoy!
<br />

			So I just have to sit there in the dark? 
<br />

I must say, I do feel different in complete darkness, but I really don't see how it can make a difference in any meditation.

			Yep, just sit in the dark, relax, and stare at the darkness!

I am not sure what is your definition of meditation, but the instructions above should bring you to a meditative state.The part with the darkness is the main trigger.

Did anyone at least tried it once?
<br />

<br />
More info about the technique:
<br />

<br />
It &quot;work&quot; on the energy aspect of the subconscious, eliminating all the crazy patterns that were created during the years, so for example you would stop dreaming of unsolved events/thoughts/feelings you experienced - probably of what all your dream are made of right now. You would start dreaming of crazy things, that don't make sense.(It will increase your chance of getting &quot;prophetic dreams&quot;).
<br />

<br />
Also it will develop your &quot;darkness body&quot;, what will for example make you enjoying real light sources like the sun or fire, and dislike the presence of artificial lights  <img src="images/smiles/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
Like I stated before it will make you enter a &quot;meditative state&quot; during the session. daa!
<br />

<br />

<br />
(I know all I said sounds a bit stupid but try and see for yourself <img src="images/smiles/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" border="0" /> )
<br />

<br />

<br />
BTW  this meditation is rooted deep in some of the Buddhism streams like Dzogchen.

			That was weird. First I had to turn my computer off because of the light from the little lights on the front, and the more I stared into the darkness the more the dull light of my window became, what I can only describe as, being infused with the darkness. You can feel the dark all around you, and I got the vibrations like I was about to have an OBE. As far as dreams go I had a dream that those little green army men (I have a bucket of them in my room, from years past) came alive and attacked me, and I had to melt them to kill them. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  But this method did put me in a meditative state very quickly.

			Darkness naturally makes you relax and sleepy.  It how our brains work, part of the reason we arn't nacturnal.  It is a good idea to take advantage of that if you want.

Darnkess is the absence of light. I don't see much to it. But perhaps on very very deep levels, there could be something to it.

Oh OK. Since it's an absence of light(energy), then it should be easier to channel other energy(psi). RIGHT???  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

Hmmm, that's an interesting thought. You're saying that since there is no light energy to interfear with your psi energy then it should be easier to make it, right?

Indeed, having a place where <span style="font-style: italic">complete</span> darkness exsists is quite rare actually. Probably a room without a window. If you have a curtain up, it probably doesn't block all of the light. (unless it is damn thick) 
<br />

<br />
The only place in my house where it can be pitch black is my bathroom...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

Hey, have you ever wondered why they call it &quot;pitch&quot; black? I don't know...
