Through auric vision or flaring, you can see it in any colour you want. But if you can't see it, you can't colour it.
<br />

<br />
So, yes, as long as you can do AV/flaring.
<br />

<br />
Oh, and ask a mod to move this to the Psi Balls forum.

			Well, i have crappy aura vision.  And i havn't gotten to the colors lvl.  I just see the energy.  It's kinda a hazy glowy kinda thing.  hard to explain.
<br />

<br />
Well, either the energy is there and it is something that is real as Pk.  Or an explaination I've read in a couple books is:
<br />

<br />
Aura readers arnt really reading aura's.  They are run of the mill(sure..) psychics that have programed thier minds to know that when they see red it means the person is angry, they see blue they are relaxed, ect.  So if that is true then yes you could program it.
<br />

			Objects, ust random objects, dont have aura's but like a cross someone has been wearing for thier whole life, or a book that you absolutly love, or a psiwheel that you have been connecting with for weeks would have and aura because you gave it energy.
<br />

<br />
Auras are a lockable subject?  I thought it was an undecided thing.

			I experienced my aura vision while I was singing in a bathroom (don't ask) at my (OLDER) cousin's wedding. I was singing some random song I was making up as I went along. And I saw this green gas expanding as I sang from my body. 
<br />

<br />
I had no idea what it was, but I paid it no mind. Then I found out I read my own aura. Twas very cool. ^^

			sounds about right!  I've only had one or two random aura seeing like that.  There is a little kid at my church that see's aure's 24/7.  he's really scared of it, It's kinda sad.  he freaks out if you ask him about it.  I think he feels like he isn't normal, a freak.
