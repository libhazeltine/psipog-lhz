			Lol, last night i was screwing around with trying to make constructs. Evidently my sub c went bananas on me and finished out a construct, when it was done i couldn't figgure out what it was. Later on, cat was chasing something around and I tried to figgure it out and went &quot;what the heck&quot; he's acting like he's chasing a mouse even though there's nothing there. Come to find out was a psimouse that was somewhat programed to act like a mouse so my cat was going insane.

			I would really like it if someone wrote an article on psipets. It could have a list of favorite commands, such as following around, precog 5 secs into future (like already said). That would be good to get ideas.

			I think psiplants sounds interesting. you could like make it drop psi seeds that will gather  ambient energy or draw energy from you to grow to be like the parent psiplant. maybe even have them grow psi balls that will go gather energy for them or that will do some task for you.

			You could make the psiplant grow psifruit! And if you eat it it would faintly taste like fruit (or really taste like fruit if it's a strong psifruit) and give you extra energy  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			That would be so cool <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  you could have like a orchard of psi trees that grow psifruits that you can go and eat (absorb whatever) and give you extra energy. and you could have like psi pet to go and gather the psi fruit for you. It sounds like a relly fun thing to do i might start making a small tree tomorow.

			i actualy did an experiment on that once i would make a psi seed that sapped energy out of other sources and make itself grow it took three days until it died heck im lucky it even got that far becuase my construct usually dont last very long

			Here is a good idea for one. 
<br />
Shape: Ball with a long needle coming out the side.
<br />

<br />
Abillitys: -Float around you
<br />
-Go were ever you tell it to
<br />
-Follow people
<br />
-Take energy from others to stay alive
<br />
-Give half of its energy to you when it is 100% full
<br />
-Once at 50% find a energy source other than your self
<br />
-Protects you from an attack by quickly taking most of the energy from the attacker
<br />
-Have the color green when 100%
<br />
-Have the color red when 50% full
<br />
-Terminate when you say terminate
<br />
-Have &quot;phantom&quot; propertys so it can pass through anything soild, Non solid
<br />
-Put your life first(If you need energy and the pet is Half way full give up most of its energy but keep enough to live)
<br />
-Turn invisable at the command &quot;Hide&quot;
<br />
-Have quick reflects
<br />

<br />

<br />
Well this is a pretty complicated Construct. 
<br />
***ATTENTION SKILLED PSI BALL MAKERS!*****
<br />
Please try to make this pet and PM me the details on its actions and if it doesn't do something right

			well i just made a cunstruct simaler to the one you came up with here is its programming hey i may just send it over there for a visit 
<br />
----- 
<br />
collect energy until you reach 40% then start sapping from me until you reach 60% then gather until you reach 100% 
<br />
----- 
<br />
able to move through walls 
<br />
----- 
<br />
collect energy to make a psi blast from its eyes telepathic blast (got to save energy) 
<br />
----- 
<br />
stay like aflame to alert how much energy (candle=-50 big flame=+50) 
<br />
----- 
<br />
play dead function explode then recunstruct like molten metal 
<br />

<br />
my secret i use a series of psi zip files which i program slowly one at a time and then isert the files in the glob of psi this procedure allows me to make complicated constructs without much trouble  try it out 
<br />
END LONG POST
