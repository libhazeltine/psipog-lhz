i was watchin bonanza and it was the episode where micheal landon went to the ghost town and was interacting with the people only to find out at the end of the show that they were all ghosts. and ben the dad said &quot;when a man knows somthing deep down inside himself it doesnt matter what others think as long as that man beleives it deep down inside&quot;

this goes for both PSI, indigo childeren and other paranormal phenomina.

But seriously if indigo children are children who have better control over psi than that means there ARE natural psions. We've already established they're aren't any so the indigo story is bullshit.

			There is no basis for indigo children. You're just saying that, MindFreak, because you think you are one because of wishful thinking. The so-called 'indications' to what indigo children are describes <span style="font-style: italic">every single child</span> that I've ever met. Ever. Including me, all my friends, whatever. I didn't know that being autistic was paranormal phenomenon. That's hilarious!!
<br />

<br />
Also, auras change color constantly, reflecting mood. That's what all of the professionals on auras say. Oh yeah, there is an easy way to confirm auras. Kirlian photography. An aura is nothing more than an electromagnetic field generated from the electricity in our minds and nerves. The belief in a label called 'indigo children' is completely different than psi, mainly because psi exists. Indigo children was just some phrase made by some drunk people.

This claim was said to be supported by experiments by the Kirlians that involved cutting part of a leaf off —the Kirlian images of such leaves, it was said, still showed the leaves as whole, as though the cutting had never happened.
<br />

<br />
Researchers at Drexel University, however, have claimed that they were unable to reproduce the effect when the glass used to capture the original leaf was replaced with new glass before the freshly cut leaf was photographed, leading them to conclude that the &quot;cut leaf&quot; phenomenon was caused by microscopic etching in the surface of the glass which occurred during preparing the images of the uncut leaf. They also reported on a number of demonstrable causes such as surface moisture and pressure which can account for much of the variations in color, shape, and size of the resulting image.

In addition to living material, inanimate objects such as coins will also produce images on the film in a Kirlian photograph setup.</span></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

That doesn't make any sense. I've never seen an aura before, so I don't know if they exist or not. Still, I don't see how that article disproves that they are non-existant, though. Elaborate, I don't understand. Wait.. they're just saying that kirlian photography is just taking pictures of the electromagnetic field of anything. There has been pictures of the same people taking pictures of their field and the colors were different with their mood. Maybe electromagnetic fields are the auras of living things? Object's fields don't change color in kirlian photos.

			&quot;Indigo Children&quot; likely did have some serious and non-fluffy meanings behind it, but now I believe it (along with the term &quot;otherkin&quot;) is just a term for those who want to feel special during their times of teen angst.  People want to be extraordinary (especially when they're anti-social basement dwellers who post on forums for a significant potion of their waking hours) and belong to elite groups.  Why else do high schools have a tendecy to be divided into &quot;cliques&quot;?
<br />

<br />
As for the original meaning of indigo children, that an increased amount of soon-to-be-enlightened/already-are-enlightened people are now on Earth for a specific purpose, I believe that.  Such people would develop psychic powers merely as byproduct of their more evolved state.  Thus a noticeable phenomenon that was observed or sensed and then classified came to be...then later misinterpreted as a way to gain acceptance from fluffy peers.  Of course I can't prove the existence of &quot;indigo children&quot; since we don't have records for how many psychics their were at given times in our history to compare the present to, but the belief in such an occurrence seems to be correct.

Alright. So, Kirlian photography is just a photograph of something's electromagnetic field. Makes sense. However, scientists disprove the idea of auras because they believe them to consistently have the same characteristics as they did, lets say, 10 seconds ago. The fact of the matter is, that they change constantly. There are other ways to take photos of auras, such as this hardware, on this site. <a href="http://www.auraphoto.com/" target="_blank">http://www.auraphoto.com/</a>

			ive been a natural at psi since i was born. ive been able to see auras and use TK since i was about 5 or 6. ive shut doors just by walking past them and thinking that they would close. 
<br />

<br />
the first time i heard of a Psiball though was when i came to this site and i made a psi ball like my 3rd time trying and the only reason why i didnt make one earlier is because i was to skeptical about it.
<br />

<br />
I also made a shield on my first try because until i came to this site i didnt know how to create one.
<br />

<br />
ive als been able to use psionics i just used it in the wrong way. as in i used my own energy instead of the earth's, sun's or moon's.
<br />

<br />
so if your gonna try and tell me that their arent naturals at psi then i will laugh in your face.
