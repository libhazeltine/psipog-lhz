			Hello,
<br />

<br />
I would like to ask what's the best dream you've ever had?
<br />

<br />
The best dream I can remember is the following (it was so reallistic, the images were so vivid and the emotions had a lot of intensity...):
<br />
     I find myself walking on a road (a downhill) with some friends, on my way back to home from school, on a bright afternoon. There was a lot of traffic (the road was full of stopped cars, as if they were trying to evaquate a city). A friend of mine and me were in front of the others and we were jumping literally the cars (!) as if we were as light as feathers.
<br />
     Reaching home at night (the day passed very quickly) I noticed a huge black hole on the sky, that was sucking air! The image had such a great detail! The hole must have been very large because although it was very high, it looked quite big. I stared at it for a moment swallowing the clouds along with air...When I enetered my house I heard on the radio: &quot;the black hole is very close to earth and scientists claim that humanity has 2-3 hours till its final destruction&quot;!!!! At that time I felt extremely anxious.
<br />
     Anyway not to tire you with all these details, I decided to go out and pass my last hours trying to fullfil my most wanted dreams...
<br />
     Then I woke up. (I can crearly remember a lot of details but I would need pages to write them)
<br />

<br />
Usually I am consious of what I am doing in my dreams (lucid dreaming) and so every emotion was very strong.
<br />

<br />
What about yours? <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Mine involved zombies.  The crazy fast kind that are in modern movies, not the dumb, slow old-school ones.  I was running around with two chainsaws killing the zombies and eventually got a tank.  Yeah, it was psychotic, but really awesome.  And my friends were there too.

			It's hard to pin down a &quot;favorite&quot; dream.  From your description, it reminded me of my most detailed dream.  I was in a city that had strange technology - there were trolly-type things, a road paved with bricks, and people everywhere.  There was so much detail, I just couldn't believe it... I was lucid at the time, so I just stood there and watched everything in amazement.  It was an industrial city, and it looked dirty, but at the same time, it looked so clear and clean.  Very strange.

			My favorite dreams are when I fly  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  I remember one time I had a lucid dream where I flew. It was so realistic that when I got out of bed I tired to fly like in my dream  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> It didnt work ofcourse so I fell.

			well one thing i always truly know about myself is that i have absolutely no fear of dying whatsoever, but i also have apocalyptic dreams at least once a week. Mine always involve aliens/UFO's in the sky, bright lights in the sky, one time i was running to a church for cover because there were &quot;flame&quot; like patterns in the sky and they were falling towards Earth, crazy. My apocalyptic dreams usually involve supernatural beings, weird &quot;signs&quot; in the sky and they are always in the summer. I wonder if the fact a forum full of people all at least somewhat versed in psychic phenomena are having frequent apocalyptic dreams could mean anything? I doubt too many people are scared or desire an apocalypse, which are usually the two main reasonings behind certain dreams.

			Well, I don't really have a single favorite, but one of my favorites was about flying. (duh)
<br />

<br />
It wasn't just one of those 'Jump up and fly around forever' lucid dreams.  I remember seeing someone doing it in my dream, and then he taught me how.  I can vividly remember how it felt to run, jump up, and glide for a little bit while I was learning.

			This one was really really good, but a few years back...
<br />

<br />
Basically involved jumping off a building and flying. Extremely realistic, could feel the pull of gravity, strain of myself keeping me in the air (I had funky wings. For some absurd reason, they were made out of styrofoam...yeah go figure!), felt wind...
<br />

<br />
Debated seeing how real my dream was for a few days after that lol. Then again, I had jumped off the 25th floor of my apartment block. Not a good idea <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Unfortunately I can't have a complete flying experience in my dreams: Either I can't fly very fast, either it is very tiring because of gravity, either I fall after a while. Although I always had lucid dreams I couldn't just fly like a normal lucid dreamer... <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
