			so i was having a dream last night and realized it was a dream. so, remembering that i could control every part of my dreams when i was lucid, i started changing things, and it was working great! but i got overexcited (i think) and the dream ended...
<br />

<br />
it was weird though, because it wasn't an abrupt ending.. it was gradual. like, at first, it was very very real, and then it quickly transitioned to what seemd like a very intense visualization, and then slowly but surely, my senses started coming back online and i was eventually unable to get back to sleep.
<br />

<br />
does anyone have advice to keep lucid? i know calming down will help a lot, but is there anything else?

			Spinning around in circles, looking at your hand, and grabbing dream scenery all help. Some people say yelling &quot;lucidity x1000 helps too. In my experience it didn't do much. Also, intense dream sensations will also help keep you in the dream. I've also had what you are describing. It happened when I first started LDing. I kind of gradually fell back into my body, is the best I can describe it as. Like the dream scenery became a visualization that I was falling away from.

			It just takes practice. When you first start becoming lucid your mind thinks your awake according to how conscious you are. So it tries to turn real world senses back on. Once you get more used to being conscious inside dreams they start to last longer.

			Used to be once I realized I was dreaming, the dream quality would slowly deteriorate (I noticed this most visually, as things would get granier and granier) and I'd eventually wake up because of it. But I've recently begin saying the words &quot;Sharpen&quot; and &quot;Despeckle&quot; (photoshop tools I use quite frequently) when the deterioration would progress so far, and saying those words in-dream would clear things up and give me more time to work with.

			Sounds good, like using commands your subconscious is already familiar with.

			yeah, exactly. Thats why instead of coming up with my OWN &quot;Superpowers&quot; and such while in a lucid dream state, I just rely on stuff I've seen in media. Dragonball Z grade strength and flight, more recently stuff from Naruto (hey, don't knock it, you'll see more outrageous stuff in anime than anywhere else. What better way to go far beyond normal physical boundaries than to jump 50 feet in the air and shoot lasers out your eyes?)
