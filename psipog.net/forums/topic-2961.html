			Th reason you can't move the psiwheel sometimes is most likely that you have practiced too much and now your brain is saying &quot;no, I can't be arsed now.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Anyways: 1-what you do before you practice on tk ? &lt;&lt;&lt;( ex : you meditation or any other thing ).
<br />

<br />
I don't usually do anything, but if I have some free time I would probably do a short meditation beforehand.
<br />

<br />
2- your method to do tk ? 
<br />

<br />
I use the just do it method. Sometimes I stare at it and it moves, but when it won't, I try and push it round. I can sort of feel the psiwheel (or anything else) pushing back at me and I have found that it goes where it wants. Strange. It has it's own mind. Mentally pushing it btw. Other times I try thinking of new methods or ones I havn't used before.

Does anyone else get a headache after PK - especially on larger objects?

			im not realy sure about what i will say is right or not , i think alot of tk and i always try to do tk any where and try by all costs to move anything even while im walking and nowdays i feel always tickling in my forehead more then before and that feeling i never felt it before when i did not know that anyone can do tk and i think i cant practice on psi wheel as you said psi_manipulator_3000 because im trying to move anything at anytime and that maybe tired me and make me dont move the psi wheel .
<br />

<br />
lol while im reading and writting here i feel tickling in my forehead .
<br />

<br />
but what i do like thinking and try to do tk anywhere on anything is that consider to be as practice or i should stop it because it is not good and try to stop my strong anxiousty to tk .

			My Warmup -  I don't do anything
<br />

<br />

<br />
Method-  When I move someone's hand or am blocking or something with my psi energy I just kind of feel it throughout my body.  I throw it in whichever direction needed if I am blocking a hand.  If I am lifting one I concentrate on feeling the energy going out of my palm and pulling their hand in my direction or a push it somewhere.  I also condense the energy if I want them to not be able to move their hand.  I can't do the whole psi wheel thing, but I would think its the same way right?                 - I get more than a headache after I pk.  I start sweating and start shaking around alot.  Sometimes my hand is in pain.

			I guess it would be okay if you were using self defense, that's my second reason for studying PK, but this is off topic... 
<br />

<br />
Anyways here's what I do...
<br />
1. Just calm down.  I like to listen to music, that always puts me in the right mood.  
<br />
2. I just kind of beleive I can, what's it worth practicing if you don't have hope anyways? The just do it method works well.  Remember to never doubt yourslef, and be in a good mood.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			1. I don't really do any prep. At all. I just glance and go with it.
<br />

<br />
2. My method basically consists of this. Look at the psi wheel (that's all I'm really capable of so far). Don't cup my hand around it, as seen in so many videos and such. Sort of think about what I want to happen, sort of think about something else. Maybe a post I recently read here, maybe something that happened not long ago, it really doesn't matter. I just need a degree of focus mixed with a bit of distraction. I dunno why, but it works.
<br />

<br />
It's like it states in all the articles. It's not really a &quot;try&quot; kind of thing. You just sorta &quot;do it&quot;. It's really weird and very hard to explain, but eventually, you get the hang of it and it's sort of easy. I don't have much control or power yet, but I'm getting there.
