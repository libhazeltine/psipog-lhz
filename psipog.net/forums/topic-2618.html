			Hey everybody, I discovered a new psychokinesis method. I read it in a book that taught psychokinesis ( I forget which one...). Basically, what the person trying to do psychokinesis does is try to &quot;feel&quot; the object as much as possible in their mind. The person should try to sense all the different qualities of the object. Then, he/she focuses psi intensely for at least 5 minutes straight on the object, fiercely thinking about how he/she wants to manipulte it. The last step, which makes this technique unique, is that the person should try to defocus their attention from the object. In other words, the person attempting PK should completely forget about the object after the intense focus. Of course, this technique is used most well with a fully relaxed mind beforehand. I have so far found this technique to work well, at least when I was relaxed enough to forget about the object. So try the technique and tell me how good it was.

(P.S., sorry I reposted this, I meant to put this article in the Psychokinesis section, but I put it in the General Discussion section instead...)

			I've had that same effect happen to me with any sort of PK. I focus like crazy on it, then relax and forget conciously, then it really works.

			yeah, after that intense few minutes of blatent staring, i seem to see it as an extension of myself. Like, i can walk around the room  and when i want it to, i just make whatever it is move by looking at it. Almost no thought involved

			I'm pretty sure I've read this somewhere before, not sure where though.  I use it a lot myself.  What you do, Carrie, is jsut focus with a clear intent in mind for a while, then focus on something else, like a radio or a tv.  However, make sure to keep the intent of spinning the wheel in mind, and if done successfully, the wheel should be more responsive.

			interesting, another method that I think relates to the 'let go' method. Some weird physics going on thats for sure, we are starting to see a pattern, I just wish I knew why it works

			I posted something a long time ago somewhere along the lines of &quot;rage and relax,&quot; and this is something I have done for a long time. It works remarkably better than most other people's methods, and I actually used it to inadvertently roll a 60lb wheight.

			I have recently stopped practicing PK, but seeing how everyone is having such success, I think I'm going to retry it, and this will be the method I use. It seems so promising.

			I've also hear this before, I think it was in one of Psipog's articles phrased something like &quot;it has to be focused inattention.&quot;  Works pretty well actually.  Seems like all it's doing is 'numbing' your conscious mind so that you can move whatever you're trying to without conscious mental blocks.
