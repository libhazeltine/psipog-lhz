			After about 2 weeks of trying to, i've finally had an LD. It went...rather wierd though.
<br />

<br />
At first, i was walking into my kitchen, and for some reason there was a Jerry Springer reject in there too (must've been because i was watching Springer earlier). So I'm looking at the guy, and im thinking &quot;thats not quite normal&quot; and then the words &quot;IM DREAMING&quot; shot into my head.
<br />

<br />
I realized i cant get too excited or I'll wake up, and then felt as though i was being brought back in a tunnel. Then i saw myself being pulled through a gravitational tunnel. I'm sure you've seen it in some Star Trek show or game (Prey). 
<br />

<br />
So I'm falling and i yell to myself &quot;Increase Lucidity&quot;, hoping it'd work. It did, and i landed in my kitchen. I turned around and saw my sister on the couch. I decided i no longer cared for her since this was <span style="font-style: italic">my</span> world. So i thought i'd shoot her. Shes a pain in the ass anyways. But i had a problem, i couldn't really do anything.
<br />

<br />
I tried to have a gun appear in my hand. Nothing.
<br />

<br />
I tried turning around and having the gun be there. Nothing.
<br />

<br />
I tried transforming my hand into a gun. Nothing.
<br />

<br />
And then i woke up confused and unsatisfied, like most of my ex's  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Question: Am i supposed to lack control the first time? Is this kind of how it went for others?</span>

Badum-ch!
<br />

<br />
anyways. i think you could have lacked control because you were expecting things to be done for you. since YOU were in control during that dream, my guess is that you need to be more assertive and... i dunno. build a gun in your dream or something. :S
<br />

<br />
this is just an educated  guess, by the way. i've only ever had  one Lucid dream. and it was a &quot; OMG i'm dreaming!&quot; *wake up* scenario.

			Control takes time to build. Don't worry about it. Congrats on your first lucid dream by the way!

			For some reason I have always had control when I have been Lucid.
<br />
Not once when I was lucid have I not have what I wanted to appear or happen.
<br />

<br />
by the way Prey is a good game you can OBE and stuff

			My first time, I didn't have much control either. When I do manage a second time, I think I'll be better at it.
