			I remembered when I first got mad because TK didn't work for me.  I quite for months and months on end untill I had this dream that I was in an arguement with my dad and I ran outside to my backyard throwing a tantrome(did I spell this right?) Next thing I knew, I threw my hand at one of my little brother's playground sets and It started to float.  Before it float, I saw a few small blurs float around and then it focused onto that one item when I put my hand towards it.  I let it go and went to another object which was a small sign.  Then I picked up my dog who freaked when she got picked up.  Then I was about to pick up a car and I stopped because I had to go inside.  I went inside, passed my dad, and then I woke up.
<br />

<br />
  After that dream, I started up TK and I then had more dreams about it.  I drempt that one time while I was spinning the psi-wheel around, and then I ended up picking it up.  I also had multiple of dreams on rare occasions(since I usualy have no dreams) that I start floating in the air and also I have trouble getting down to the floor when I do float.  After those dreams, I finaly stopped my anxious behavior and kept practicing TK, thinking that one day, those dreams will happen in real life.  I also conjured up a fact, when you know it's going to happen, you don't get that anxious and bratty that you want it to happen now.

			Good good, that sounds like a plan. Don't ever give up! And maybe those dreams woke up some skills? Only time will tell. Keep practicing.
