			ill put up pics soon but get this, i was trying to imitate the shade of red, that was on a photoshopped eyeball or a sharingan...
<br />

<br />
my eyes didnt go red, but they imitated the &quot;mangekyou&quot; sharingan in shades of green, instead of the colour, they mimmicked the shape. luckily i got pics of the whol process <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
my eyes started noormal:
<br />

<br />
then they went like a cats eye somehow
<br />

<br />
then there were colours around the eye
<br />

<br />
then there were three different colour shades aroun the eye, forming 3 triangle tpye shapes :d

			'1. Well, think about it? What controls eye colour? Scientists have discovered that it's the amount of melanin in the eyes, as I stated above.'
<br />

<br />
Actually its melanin and collagen. Which doesnt bode well. 
<br />

<br />
'2. Side effects probably aren't very serious,'
<br />

<br />
If you do indeed have the ability to alter these things you could render yourself blind. Collagen makes up the majority of your eye and if you ended up modifying it through some unexplained phenomena you could seriously break things. On the plus side I cant see any real way you could modify the collagen in the first place. The removal of melanine in the eyes I believe works through macrophages which break down the excess. If there was a way of breaking it down more rapidly youd lose melanin and the eye colour would change. (It happens with age im not sure how you would induce this earlier or whether the effects could be permanent.) Lower melanine means more potential for sun damage so it wouldnt be advisable. (Albinos need to be very careful with eye protection for just this reason.) Changing eyes to a darker colour would require more melanin. Im not an eye doctor but increasing melanin sounds like ti could lead to glaucoma (more liquid may mean more pressure on the optic nerve.) and possibly even cause melanoma in the eye if you somehow damaged the cells that produce it. That is far more speculatory though.
<br />

<br />
because of the fact that breaking down or bolstering melanin is potentially so dangerous and im not sure if any beneficial effects would be long lasting due to the body rebalancing the melanin soon after I dooubt anyone has tried to do this with traditional science. Though they have made melanin based eye wear so its feasable. 
<br />

<br />
I am somewhat skeptical as to whether this is possible at all. Though this shouldnt be an issue PazarX claims to have had drastic and long lasting effects. With photographs of this that are clearly identifiable as him, and with very different eye colour this can be immediately cleared up. The previous photos were a little lacking. Genjo's eyes showed no noticable change other than in the reflections. Polymers eyes also show no noticable change other than the iris. Mix with this the fact that eye colour naturally changes over the years to confuse anecdotal proof and weve seen no real evidence yet.

			Ive been trying to change my eye colour for about 3 weeks now, i had hazel eyes, i tried to turn them to red, but they turned yellow, so yes, it is possible, its harder than you think, and yes there are side effects, i had to stop half way through changing them because i had severe headaches, with pain directly behind the eyes.
