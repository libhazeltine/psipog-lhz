			That's probably one of the most funny, ridiculous and weird text i ever read. Though i don't doubt it would work. Nevertheless i have doubts about the specific methods.

			Sounds like a steaming pile of buddhism to me. People trick themselves into believing this enlightened state of mind that they go to brings them to a conscious being they call god. It's really just the core of yourself, everything, and the most basic idea. Also, I wanna see the scientific proof it warps your DNA. I have no problem with the enlightenment theory he has but that DNA warping is bullshit.

			Basically it goes on length about technics used to unify all of your &quot;bodies&quot; including the psychical one, and that step changes your DNA. I didn't read everything, I think you need to reach enlightenment first for that, and doing that may take several years, if not several lifes. Very few people managed it in little time, and for those who did, they basically didn't need any help.

			I enjoyed that very much. The points are solid, and those meditations are well explained. The whole DNA strand thing may be meant to be symbolic, but I get what is being said. Pretty much, the whole meditation program is meant to beter you spiritually and release your full universal potential for communication.

			I've heard about godhoods quite a lot too. Becoming a god, dna etc. Not an uncommon occult theme. But it disproves itself because of the question of:
<br />

<br />
Why would anyone post such powerful knowledge on the internet?
<br />

<br />
Which is why it sounds more like a cry for attention rather than true knowledge.

			I agree with all the possibilities this guy presents. What I don't necessarily agree with is his way of going about reaching the state of being that connects all of mind.
<br />

<br />
I think his methods could definitly work. I just don't think that's the only way to achieve those goals.
<br />

<br />
Like, I don't think you necessarily need to mediate with your spirit using thought words like &quot;I love you Mr Spirit, what can you do for me that is good and happy and full of light?&quot; and such. Communicating with the emotions of love and happiness and euphoria that such sentences are related to should work the same way, shouldn't it?
<br />

<br />
I mean, maybe he's just typing those words to convey what I just said, because you can't type out emotions in anything other than words. I dunno.
<br />

<br />
I like it though. I like his methods and I'm going to begin using them, and hopefully i'll adapt them with consistency.
