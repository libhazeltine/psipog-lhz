			I have never had an OBE that I was conscious of.  I have had them at night when I was sleeping and later woke up and realized that I did.  However, when I am awake, I can look at someone's office and watch them while they're in there.  If I can shift my focus to imagining that I am in that office looking at things from their perspective or from the perspective of being in the room, I can feel these weird feelings like i'm leaving where I am and going over there, but i never quite make it.  I think it may be because i freak out subconsciously and stop it.  Sound familiar?

			Well In an OBE you move by two ways 1st with your mind and 2nd with physical movements like jumping flying walking, running etc. Those movements are also maded with mind but they act like what we see in our real life.
<br />
I experiencie really fast changes of perspective when I'm in something that seems a &quot;preOBE&quot; when you notice your real body but you start imagining, there you can't move with the second option (well, this is what happens to me)
<br />
And when you think on something you go straightly there. Also its usual to have a &quot;third person perspective&quot;.

			do you just imagine that you're getting up and moving or walking somewhere?  I can actually feel myself trying to get up out of my body while I'm sitting down but I can't get out.  what am I doing wrong?

			I have never experienced &quot;the getting out from the body&quot; way. Normally its like this:
<br />
You're in your bed and then you think of your street and foosh you're in the street.
<br />
But then you've to realise that you did it and have to take control of the situation if not you will fall into a normal dream or you will return to your body again

			that's what happens to me when I'm awake.  I'm sitting at my desk and I imagine that I'm in the hallway, my house, or somewhere else.  I feel extreme paralysis all over, like i dont' feel any part of my body.  My head begins to spin a little and I feel like I'm coming out of myself and then it stops.  It just stops but it is a groovy/freaky feeling as I feel like i'm going somewhere.

			Man!  I was almost there yesterday.  I got off from work and laid back in my truck trying to have an OBE.  I got real relaxed and began to feel the vibrations, so peaceful.  Then I began to see the colors red and orange for some reason.  I began to try to leave my body, felt this extreme pulling forward to sit up but could never do it.  I KNOW I was on my way out of my body but never made it.  I swear it felt like 10 or 15 minutes but when I came to, 45 minutes had passed!!! I was like, whoa!.  So then I tried it later that night at home sitting in a chair.  Same thing happened.  I was trying to get my physical body to stand up but it wouldn't.  Both times I felt so much pressure but I never made it out of my body.  Is this close?

			Well it's near but you need practice, this is a thing that takes time to control someones more and others less but it needs practice. Don't get too emotionated or too stressed cause it can make the OBE fail, simply stay calm and let your body sleep, and also your head but try to stay conscious. When the time arrives you will notice.
<br />
It's usual that when your body sleeps you are able to move your etereal body but you're not free until your head sleeps.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Well think that if your &quot;soul&quot; flies away, your body is sleeping so, yes you can only do this while you are sleeping. So if you want to try it at lunch time, you will have to get your alarm clock with you  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			Yeah well if you have practice you can make an OBE when you want but you have to leave your body sleeping. You can't leave your body walking or driving  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  cause when you are out of the body, the body stays unconscious like slepping. And well I can try to make OBE's but i usually fail.  only sometimes I can really achieve one.
