			Well, i have 2 stories empathy related.
<br />

<br />
1: this one happened about 2 months ago, in a school assembly. It was some performance about fitting in and dealing with thhat sort of stuff. One part was about 9/11. All of a sudden i feel intense sadness coming from all over, even though i just made an empathy shield last night. After awhile it was really annoying so i scanned my shield, it was just about totally destroyed. only the side next to the wall (nobody was sitting to my right) was still intact. I was glad when that part was over... lol
<br />

<br />
2: this just happened tuesday of last week. It was a normal school day, and i was in my integrated technology class (where they teach you totally useless things about computers... like how to open 2 documents at the same time! OOOOO!) around the end i was all of a sudden feeling really sad and worried (i dont have any emp shields up now, i like to feel everything, even sadness so i know whats going on) later that day, i overhear some kids saying that one of the teachers was crying because their son had some sort of disease. (dont ask)
<br />

<br />

<br />
What i find useful is to make a shield beforehand, but if you ever forget to do that, just focus your empathy on somebody with an overlap emotion (like how excited overlaps bored).
<br />

<br />
RIBBITRIBBITY, OUT!

			I do believe that if you do have the potential to become an empath, but your gift is not unlocked yet so to speak, then all you need is practice and meditation. and with practise i mean like trying to feel the other persons emotion, perhaps a friend or so, it might not work straight away, it took me 24 years to get to the point i am now, but if your gift is there, it will come. and if the emotion you are sensing is confusing, look at someones body language for more clarity, so to speak. another thing i find usefull when i am trying to sence someone is that  i always look into there eyes, as if it was some sort of portal into the soul and try to listen with my heart, the heart never lies, it is the brain that makes it confusing. And last but not least, the meditation is important, to clear away other peoples feelings, by just letting go of them. It is also a good to to find yourself and your inner gifts, here on psipog are many good ways to do that.

			Hey thanks damios i will start meditating  again,i used to meditate every night but unfortunately i slipped out of that habit as i pursued other aspects of psionics and didn't feel it would help me in those fields. Now i come to think of it i wish i never stopped meditating i always used to feel so great after i had meditated for an hour or so! well thanks again

As for meditation most people don't see the use of it, even i don't do it every day, but meditation is like a path that leads into your brain, opening many doors within ones mind, it allows you to connect with your deepest thoughts, feelings and possibility's, time is endless there, that is why most meditations seem to last forever, it can calm your spirit or unleash great powers or even show you things you did not know. Meditation is the most important thing to all gifts psionic, along with patients.

			Practice and meditate?  Has anyone else noticed how this has become the psionic analog of a clueless doctor saying &quot;Well, you have flu-like symptoms, so just drink lots of water and get lots of rest.&quot;?
<br />

<br />
It's such a vague solution too, since no one ever indicates what one should meditate <span style="font-style: italic">on</span>.  Meditation will increase your focus but there are zillions of thoughts in one's mind, and just waiting for the right one to materialize is hardly an efficient solution.  I think people need to become more skilled at diagnosing metaphysical health issues or stop giving their <span style="font-style: italic">opinions</span> of the problem's causes.  Now I realize your intentions are noble Damios, but your solution is ineffective (though there is an off chance it could result in a solution).
<br />

<br />
moonrave89: Your issue is not due to empathy although empathy could be a sort of catalyst for your problem.  You need to learn the root causes of your emotions and then have the courage to rise up over what you will see are terribly petty things that are controlling your emotional state (and invariably, your life).  You need to realize that no one and no-thing can change your emotional state but you once you put the effort into creating a sturdy emotional foundation for yourself (ie. self-confidence).  Then, no matter what random feelings or thoughts wash over you, you'll be able to deal with them regardless of whether they are yours or not.
<br />

<br />
So this obviously sounds like a mountain of work and like many people, you'll have no clue where to get started (I didn't, btw I still haven't finished my work on myself after 4 years) but never fear.  You'll need tools for inputting new beliefs and states into yourself and for that I (along with many colleagues) have found NLP to be the best source of such tools.    There are tons of NLP books out there so they won't be hard to find, nor are they expensive.  You'll also likely need some other points of view on what an emotional state is, what causes it and how to deal with that problem.  The best source for that is self-help tapes, CDs, books, etc.  The vast majority of those sources are packed with good info and will help you with the third source of info: meditation.  Not just vague, old &quot;stare at a wall and think of nothing&quot; but rather meditation on a topic or question.  There's plenty of info to be found but you won't be able to digest it at a very quick speed if you don't spend a good 10x as much time thinking about the new info compared to the time you spend acquiring that new info.
<br />

<br />
Those are the ingredients in the recipe of an unshakable emotional state but there is one thing missing.  You need to actually work hard and perservere in making such a change.  I personally know it's worth it to invest in yourself like this, but if you aren't willing to work at it, you'll easily be able to convince yourself that it's not worth it, or it's too hard, etc.  Courage to challenge your current state and work to improve it is absolutely required or you'll get nowhere.
<br />

<br />
Now you have the information you need to get started, a sort of roadmap to success.  It's up to you whether you're ballsy enough to actually start travelling...

			On the contrary practise makes perfect, i absolutly understand your answer most people do say that indeed, however when it comes to empathy it is not something that happens over night, you need to challenge it, analyse your feelings and that of others, play with feelings, try to send them out or try to receive them and then tell the other if that was indeed what he or she was feeling, etc. only then can one truly understand what the differences are and tune in to the gift so to speak. that is what i meant with practise, but this is just a part of what someone could do. See i was born with the gift, i did not learn it from a book, a self help tape or a cd or just wanted to become one. I could also tell the negative side of the gift, how you could lose your self and even become completely insane, how you could lose some of your own feelings,  or how it is to feel pain and anger day in and day out, so much that it will rip you apart from the inside and change your own personality, etc. Empathy is not to be taken litely, So one of the first steps is learn how to control it or atleast try or it will go wrong. however you where right about what you said to moonrave, because it also emplies to empathy. One does need to learn the root of there emotions, learn that they control there emotions and then indeed deal with them and embrace them, i could not have used any words better then that. 
<br />

<br />
As for meditation offcourse i can tell what i do when meditating and perhaps i will one day, but for everyone it is different. See meditation is nothing more then a state one puts him or her self in, a place within the mind where he/she can create order out of chaos, especially when it comes to feelings, what btw are controlled by the brain and are felt by the heart. however for understanding it, i prefer the self exploration of ones soul, mind and heart. Because you will need to know who you are first and what you believe in and think and feel and no book can tell you that, only you and meditation is a good way to do that. 
<br />

<br />
As for techniques we all have our own and maybe the help of books and cd's and self help tapes could help you and will help you. afterall knowlegde makes you more powerfull and wise. So perhaps it does work for you and many many others, i do not deny the fact that it is working technique.  As for my helping answers, they are indeed not detailed and a bit fague, however i believe in and prefer the hard way, to learn on my own from life itself and to truly understand it, the reality. It does take a longer time, but learning from reality makes you understand it better and lets you learn from your own mistakes. What is written in a book is nothing more then information on the subject, but not what it is truly like.

			There is so much to be said about this small word. I believe empathy, as well as many other abilities, are always latently within every human being. How active or responsive these abilites are is the question. In dealing with everyones uniqueness we will all have different levels of sensitivty when it comes to sensing the emmotions of those around us.. In my experience, the more emmotions you've felt, the more you will recognize. Some people are generally numb.. others can feel anger before it gets to their doorstep in whatever form it arrives. I do agree with it being said one can be born with empathy... but how it is nurtured in the young stages of human growth, (or any stage for that matter), will determine the sensitivity of your empathy. Some people will experience very traumatizing, or inspiring events throughout the stages of their life. This is a direct result of environment affecting them. Their sensitivity levels will in turn also be effected as one grows from all experiences and from all people around them. Any emmotion felt is the brains perception of surroundings. So when you become overwhelmed with an emmotion that seems to sneak up on you... thats your brain percieving a signal in your surrounding.. depending on what the emmotion is... love or anger... or stress... I've found myself projecting alot of emmotions out I don't mean too. And other people can sense that. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see when a person is angry, sad, or happy. If you know what it is.. you'll recognize it. It's our reaction to these seperate emmotions that needs to be monitered. Sensing someones anger and then blowing up isn't a good thing to do. It's hard. But creating a strong inner smile seems to have helped me so far the most. When I start to feel the effects of others projections I just smile in my eyes and hold it. You are always your greatest enemy and friend. understanding our minds and how to deal with everything else is important in this day in age. I hope what I've said has helped. ~peace to all~

			Damios:  I must say I'm mostly in agreement with you.  Your answer simply needed a far more detailed description. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
moonrave:  No I think you got the jist of it judging by your reaction to my post.  Why would you NOT want to improve your life at the same time you learn to control your empathy?  I know no better way of gaining control over emotions, and this method happens to follow the same path as general self-improvement.  Feelings are too intricate to be dealt with in an isolated way, they're intrinsic in every second of your life so you need to deal with the shortcomings in your life as a whole if you want to control your emotions.
<br />

<br />
Also, how much self-confidence you have is relative.  Comparing how in order your life is, or how self-confident you are to the average person you encounter isn't a very useful measurement.  People in general are messed up and feel inadequate.  Judge yourself by your potential, not by others' current states.  I think you'll find you're measurement of your own self-confidence will change if you look at it this way. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			hey all again, i have a further question relating to empathy but i wont start a new thread as this one is still goood, hopefully someone replies cause it may not be read now as it is fairly old lol. Anyway as you know from previous posts i am interested in pursuing emathy and as of yet i havent realli got down and praticed it due to exams and other things but just being interested in it has seemed to increase my ability in it, mostly my sensitivity. For example when i am in crowded areas like shopping centers i get agitated easily and i feel 'full' and my mind seems really busy and i just want to leave and get away from all the people, btu i was wondering am i just creating these sensations so it seems like i am advancing or do you believe from what i have said that i am really progressing in empathy.The only reason i ask is because i have had hardly any practice in it so i dont see how i could have progessed. well i hope you all understand what im babbling about lol hope u get back soon moonrave
