			Hmmz, let's see...
<br />
I decided not to talk to much about it in school because I've had comments about watching too much DBZ and people asked me how to make an Energy Bomb  <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />  aargh!
<br />
And my boyfriend's brother is saying how I'm doing things against religion and stuff... But he was in the hospital just a while ago because he's acting very weird lately with screaming about that the world will end and stuff...(He really shouldn't read the bible while smoking joints... I'm against smoking(joints) anyway  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> )

My mom believes it could be possible, but my dad always asks me to do fluff stuff, &quot;Can you fly yet?&quot; or &quot;Can you fly the salt to me?&quot; that kind of crap.

At least my friends accept it, I even got two of them into practicing.

<br />
Drugs have a powerful effect on people. Most people who use them, do it to escape, not just metaphorically.
<br />

<br />
They cannot accept the world presented to them as it is, usually because of the stronger core values they were raised with. Most drug addicts, are good people. Lets not get caught up in 'good', and 'bad' though. Since the duality of them is irrelevant. 
<br />

<br />
I am telling you now that the people who refuse to believe/support you in your quest, whatever it may be, do so because they have an accepted  faith and have a rigid perception, and refuse to accept anything else. This is very true with religous people, but that faith could be atheism, science, even non-conformity.
<br />

<br />
All you can do for these people is accept them as they are. Truely it all you can do for anyone. Love them unconditionally and do not pass judgement.
<br />

<br />
In the bible they speak of psionics. The bible is a fascinating tool, far outdated for use in todays 'modern' world though. Do not discount a certain belief because it is not yours - challange YOUR belief, accept theirs. Know your path. Remember everything is your perception, your interpretation.
<br />

<br />
And yes, I have had condesending remarks made to me with regard to the things I know and practice. For some people they just need a little proof. For some people, you could peel back the fabric of space-time and show them the truth and they would still be incapeable of understanding. That is who they are, now, at this time and age.

			Right, back on topic.
<br />
I've gotten both, believe me. -.- 
<br />

<br />
There were the religious tracts for my birthday from one friend (*real* fun... not going into that, though. Don't want to piss off the mods.)...
<br />

<br />
But my usage of tarot cards and pendulums and the like, though they are not discussed on Psipog, have gotten me into the most peer trouble. The rwo main reactions are &quot;Witch!&quot; (No I'm not. I promise.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> ) and &quot;Ooh! Ooh! Tell my fortune! Tell me! Tell!&quot; (Do you have a question? No? I don't have time for a Year Spread. Go 'way.)
<br />

<br />
And then there's the one male who concerns himself mostly with making up attacks. Needless to say, I don't discuss Psi with him much. Don't want to encourage people like that, if only 'cuz he's more likely to hurt himself than anyone else...

			What I always say before I tell anybody about psi, is this:
<br />

<br />
&quot;No, I cannot fly, no, I cannot pass through objects, no I cannot read your mind, no I cannot make shit appear out of nowhere, and no, I cannot make fucking beams of energy.
