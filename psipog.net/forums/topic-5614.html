			I left the room to get some snacks, and when I came back, my score had risen.    <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I WAS thinking about it while getting the snacks, so I guess it's possible that I could have affected it while over there, but....  in the matter of 1 minute, my score in sliding right/left had gone up by 2 and 3 respectively, despite the fact that after 5 minutes I had only managed to get them up to 5/2(right slide/left slide).    I'll leave this running when I'm watching TV and not thinking about it to confirm my results, but, for now, I have to wonder....
<br />

<br />
Is this for real?

<br />
Ya its real but it uses random numbers so the deal is you your brain influence's the random numbers.
<br />

<br />
You don't have to worry about which number you land on your  brain already knows how to do it just , worry about which direction.
<br />

<br />
This is mirco pk but with practice of mirco pk , you can expect great results when you do macro pk. When you try to move a real object that's macro pk.

			would it be possible to put all your programs onto a little site of your own so we don't have to download them? I'm restricted to from the parental units rule XD, and idk if this is as a result or not but after I downloaded your program(with disregards to what my parents said), a few days later my computer's graphics driver went all screwy and I can only get on the comp now through safe mode. I don't think they're related but its possible. I might just need a new driver probably, it's kinda old for computers, about 3 years maybe. I think that it should last longer though because my other one is almost 10 years old and the driver never had any problems...
<br />

<br />
anyways, do what you want, just a suggestion is all...
