Considerably small in comparison to what?  I'm 5'8 and 129 lbs.  That's about average height where I live.  Apparantly I'm proportionally right in terms of height to weight, which is nice.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

But 666 works better. sin(666) = -2(phi). It's pretty much the inverse of the divine ratio.

			Fluff. I first got into psionics from 'magick' stuff. And that was all 'elemental energy manipulation magick' (waaay longer than just 'psionics') and I wanted to control air. So the fluffy Aerokinesis. Then like Pyromaniac, just Aeromaniac <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> Funny though that there's a pyromaniac and a cryomaniac in the chat somewhere...

One day one of my stranger friends tried to spell it but got it totally wrong, writing 'Lizndax' instead.  I've adopted that one as my internet name ever since.

			well about a year ago I had no idea psionics really existed. I just messed with controlling the wind and thought I was special. then talked to a friend and he had done some similar stuff. so I looked up things of that nature and came across this site. then after about 3 month in psionics decided to join, and, dispite controlling wind doesn't seem to be common, playing with wind got me started so I put the only variation I could think of that didn't sound cheesy. though now I've spent much more time on the chat so I'm not really known on the board. oh well.
