			I'm new to this forum and I was actually debating this with myself where to put this.  I saw there was a nice little introduction section, but I figured since my story is Psychokinetically related, I'll just go ahead and post it here.
<br />

<br />
My name is Tyson and I'm 18 years old.  I'm from Pennsylvania in the United States.  I still live with my parents, but I'm attending my college in this July in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Well, anyway, enough with that.  
<br />

<br />
My story is very varied on how I have become what I am today.  I began my practices at the age of 15 and who would have guessed, I was one of those anime fanatics who thought I'd be able to blow up boulders and all that.  Well, basically after wasting a month of my life trying to blast holes in my walls I decided to re-think what I was doing.  I obviously knew what I was doing was total and complete BS, simply because I was getting no results whatsoever.  So I managed to find some books in our school library about remote viewing and astral projection.  Although I didn't know much about these and I really still don't this led my way into the journey of becoming a psion.  
<br />

<br />
After reading those books and getting some terms in my head I headed to the internet and began doing some sites.  I believe I came across a site entitled forkyou.com or something like that, I may be wrong however.  Well, anyway, I remember reading a lot of information on that site and found everything there very interesting.  So I did some research on telekinesis/psychokinesis(I refer to it as PK).  I was actually very excited to learn some of the techniques that real life PKers(not player killers for you nerds <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />)  used.  So like any rambunctious teenager, I dove headfirst into the practices without reading any of the fine detail.  As expected, I had very little results and got frustrated and gave up.  I didn't relax, I didn't focus, and therefore I didn't get results. 
<br />

<br />
After phase 1 of my PK career was a failure, I started daulding in astral projection.  Amazingly, I had results the very first time I tried it, but like 99% of people, I got scared and bailed out.  I actually made astral projection practice a daily thing for about 2 months.  I never actually had a consious projection, but my lucid dreaming probably quadrupled.  I was having lucid dreams more often that any other time in my life.  Then  after so much practice I could make it to the paralysis stage almost everytime.  But guess what, I would have those scary-ass hallucinations, you know the kind the of hallucinations that come up to you and scream in your face when you are paralyzed, and instead of facing it, I gave up and pretty much haven't tried to astral project since then.  Naturally, I stopped having lucid dreams, and I still don't have them very often.
<br />

<br />
After going on a very long hiatus from anykind of practices.  I tried to work with PK again.  This time I had a broader knowledge on how to prepare and get that almighty connection with the object in question.  I had results, very promising results at that.  However, I noticed things began to happen.  Small objects would start moving on their own.  I would reach for a pen and it would mysteriously would slide away. WHOA!  This was very minor compared to with 2 others things that had happened.  The first didn't so much freak out as suprised me.  My parents and I were at a Pizza Hut having dinner and what not.  I had just finished a slice of pizza and reached for another one.  Low and behold, the minute I reach for a slice of pizza, the thing flys off the tray and hits some elderly lady in the side of her skirt.  As you can imagine, I got blamed for throwing it at the woman, even though I clearly never even touched it.  My sister and girlfriend both backed me up, but nonetheless, it didn't go well.
<br />
I guess this next incident is what did for me.  I'm still not 100 percent sure what happened, but I can only guess it had to be another random PK.  I'm in my house alone in the morning, my parents are working, and I believe my sister was at a friends house, or gymnatstics, not that it matters.  I remember walking out of my bedroom, into our hallway, went downstairs and into the kitchen to get food, simply because I love food, it tastes good, and makes me full and all that good stuff.  Well, so I go back to my room and the door is closed, I didn't think to much of it at the time, but I am almost positive I left the door open.  So anyway, I go to open the door, it won't open.  It felt like something was holding the door shut, so eventually I push the door hard enough to get a look inside and find that my chair is infront of the door on the inside of the bedroom.  That immediately freaked me the hell out.  My room is on the second story, with only one window that is straight down drop.  This chair is a good 40 pounds, so the wind sure as hell didn't blow it.  So that meant only one thing, the person who moved it was still in the room.  I honestly had no idea to do.  So I grabbed the best weapon I could find, my car keys. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />   So I manage to push my door open enough so I could squeeze in and did a thourough search of the room.  No one was in there.  Now if that doesn't freak you out, I don't know what does.  There was just something in my head telling me that something wasn't right on how that chair got infront of the door.  Not so much as it was impossible, but more so that it was in some way or another caused by me.  I can't really put words to the feelings, it's just something I understand, no one else. 
<br />

<br />
Well anyway, strike two.  I quit.  That was way to much for me to handle.  That got to me so much.  I mean, it was insane to think that I &quot;may&quot; have moved a 40lb chair subconsiously.  I mean, it's insane to think about even to this day.  I still have some random Pk phenomena happen, but nothing even comparable to that.  It just blows my mind.
<br />

<br />
Well, once again, I took another pause from all metaphysical practices.  I played the game of normal life for a while and for some reason or another I started to have some pretty severe headaches.  Keep in mind this is probably a good three months after the chair incident.  So my parents decide that it is in my best interest for me to have some kind of xray, honestly, I have no idea what it is called.  For some reason Catscan is coming to mind, but that could easily be wrong.  But, nonetheless, that's not the point.  The point is, after about 3 or 4 of these xrays from different hospitals and clinics, they could find nothing wrong with me.  Not a single thing, they had no explanation why I was having this extreme migraines.  I actually even had to go to the optometrist to make sure the headaches weren't vision related and they weren't.  So I suffered through migraines for a good two weeks.  Then I remember reading an article in a local newspaper about a new study being doing on psychokinesis in children.  Well this got me pumped once again to try and do PK.
<br />

<br />
I still had the incidents that happened earlier fresh in my mind.  But at that point I wasn't too concerned with it.  This is what suprised me the most.  Literally the same day I started doing PK again, my headaches just simply dissapeared.  If anyone can possibly explain this for me, I'd love to hear it because I have no idea why this happened.  So if it works for you keep going with it. And I did.  I was having better results than ever and to this date have never given up again.  I've had steady PK practices for about fourteen months now.  I keep a journal and write in it almost everyday(sometimes I'm too lazy to do it though).  Believe it or not, the journal actually helps.  I actually look back at my first couple entries every once and a while and see how much I have progressed to this date.  It's simply amazing.
<br />

<br />
One thing I have had to deal with is the opinions of other people.  Most people I know do know I practice PK and thankfully they are very accepting of the issue.  Most people still think it's some parlor trick, but for those select few know I am the real deal, I am thankful for.  Anyone who asks to see some PK, I will show.  I believe some people do debate this issue.  Should we keep it a secret or reveal our knowledge?  I think we all agree, most humans are afraid of the unknown.  So what if the unknown becomes something they know?  They have nothing to be afraid of.  But as always, I've had those select few who either call me a freak or say what I do is BS.  But whatever, they are entitled to an opinion, even though it is wrong <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> .  But I am just glad that most people are accepting of the fact.
<br />

<br />
I guess the whole point of this short story is get you to realize that you must never give up.  I've definately had my share of problems, but I have overcome them and have become a better psychokinetic than I ever thought I could be.  I still have an insane amount of territory to cover, but I'm just glad to know my perserverance has led me on my way.

			The headaches could have been your subconcious trying to tell you to continue practicing PK and whatnot, as they started after you quit, and stopped when you returned.
<br />

<br />
Just a guess...very good writing, excellent grammar &amp; spelling, and  a very good and detailed article describing what experiences and stuff you've had with PK.
<br />

<br />
I loved it! Great job!

			I can give one possible explanation for the migraines. For some reason I feel that the brain is capable of storing enormous quantities of psi and when there is a constant influx of psi with no outlet the pressure of the dam keeps building up and very high amounts of psi does exert an outward pressure, so with a very high psi exerting a fair amount of pressure on your brains would basically translate to migraines. 
<br />

<br />
When I overdo it on psionic activities I get pretty bad migraines, and when I don't practice for couple days whether be with psi balls or whatnot I tend to start developing migraines. So just my .02cents
