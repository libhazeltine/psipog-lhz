			Just noticed this, maybe someone else posted but I searched.  In baka's pinwheel video, why does he wave his hand like it is hot at the end?  Also, why did he not just re-film it?
<br />

<br />
Why don't you all just do the video but show all angles of it spinning, lke set up the cam on a tripod with a glass table and no blocked views.  That would DEFINETLy prove it to a lot of people.

			because that takes man power, a lot more work, a lot more time, and a lot more annoying.  No matter hw much you do in a video, someone will always argue it.

			not everyone has a glass table.. much less a tripod and a lot of free time on their hands to get the right view to prove it to all those people who really dont care to see any proof, because in their mind tis already proof there.

			I waved my hand because I got a spasm in my wrist from holding my hand VERY VERY still in order to not move any air around the wheel.
<br />

<br />
I didn't refilm it because doing PK for 3 hours can really wear you out, I just practised all day and got a crazy idea about making my own Pk video.
<br />

<br />
About multiple camera angeles, I don't have 3 cameras to film, nor can I multitask that much to decently film and do Pk at the same time. As for the tripod, I don't have one, the camera was standing on a stack of cds.
<br />

<br />
And a glass table, I also don't have. 
<br />

<br />
Hell, I can always make more videos, but I don't have anything to prove anymore, everyone knows I can do some psionics, I don't see the point.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
-edit-
<br />

<br />
Forgot to add, I did three videos and the one published turned out the best.

			I don't think you can hallucinate that well ch40s. And it's not visualizing, that's imagination....

We all doubted it at one stage. And I'm not sure everyone can keep a secret from just you and be all faking this because we so happened to pic you as the target (like the truman show). I mean, yeah, I may have seen the wheel move when really it hasn't, but that's just from starting at it for so long. *eyes blood shot*  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
And also not every video is gonna be super prooving it. There is always gonna be a skeptic picking out every single possible detail that could make it fake. I have seen skeptics picking out fake properties of a video that i was 100% sure was real. There is always something. Even if it's proven by scientists there are still gonna be people writing books on it. I call them just plain weird and foolish for being so skeptic. Not healthy.
<br />

<br />
But anyways, it's best not to bring it up really, cus it is hard to get it all realsiticly angled and such. The only good way to prove it to someone is in real time on webcam, when they have the wheel so you can't touch it.

			precisely.

<br />
Ch40s - these video?s are never meant to be proof. Video?s can -never- prove Pk or anything else for that matter, and thats not what they?re here for. If you haven?t had the experience of moving things with your mind yourself then admittedly proof is all you?re gonna be looking for in such vid?s, but realize you won?t get this information from them.
<br />

<br />
Once you -did- move things with your mind you?ll find it much more easy to tell fake vids appart from real ones. Good luck overcoming doubt, I know it?s hard, but appart from that it?s pretty much the only obstacle to overcome to start spinning and sliding things around.

what we call skepticism keeps their world in order. they're too closed-minded to accept something that turns their world upside down.
