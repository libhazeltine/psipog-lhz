			Hooray! I used that first connecting technique and the psi-wheel spun. I have control over it for the first time in months! This would be the first time in <span style="font-style: italic">four years</span> that I've been able to spin it two days in a row!

			hi to all, this is my first post here. I have a few questions for you JoeT (still regarding to the beginning of this thread) :
<br />

<br />
- in this method you use for psychokinesis, have you idea if it's required to have previous experience in psychic abilities to be able to learn psychokinesis ? Or you know anyone that was 100% normal (about never having psychic abilities) and was able to learn psychokinesis without never having learned any simplier skills before (except meditation) ?
<br />

<br />
- just wondering, what worked best for people that learned psychokinesis : practising daily a single session of 30 minutes or 2 sessions of 15 minutes ? What i am just wanting to know is if what is more important and efficient in psychokinesis learning is if it's best to practise a few minutes only but more frequently each day, or just once several minutes. I ask this because i have many trouble standing practising psychokinesis for more than 10 minutes, at least without seing it move... (the times it moves, being by wind or not automatically motivates me practising for much longer)
<br />

<br />
- please just tell me, you probably did practised psychokinesis without first having results for a few weeks ? Right ? Just tell me how the heck you did to keep you motivated to continue training if you weren't getting results in the first days or weeks. It's becuase i have a LOT OF TROUBLE overcomming this &quot;mental barrier&quot; and i need help on this, i need to have some kind of signal to know that the training is working to keep me motivated to train that much time without results. For example, did you felt tired or felt any particular energy movements (for example pressure or tingling in &quot;third eye&quot; place) or even pain in the top of the head when you practised psychokinesis ? If not, don't tell me you were able to pratice psychokinesis for that long without a SINGLE indication that the training was working ?
<br />

<br />
I really need to make such kind of questions, because it's one of the requirements to be able to stand practising so much time in a skill that takes weeks to show any results.
<br />

<br />
By the way, of course that anyone else with experience in psychokinesis can answers these questions as well.
<br />
Sorry for the length of my posts, but usually my posts are much bigger than this <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

You do not need any previous experience with PK or any other psionic skill in order to practice PK. Although it might help it certainly is not required.

Excellent question. People have different opinions and different theories on how a student should practice in order to gain results in a quicker pace. When I first started I practiced every other day for 1/2 hour. I also had a set time for example (Monday 10:30-11:00pm, Wednesday 11:00-11:30, Friday 10:00-10:30 etc) I practiced no more than that when I first started. When I became fairly decent at PK i upgraded my time of practice. What people don't understand is rushing results by over practicing is not going to bring results any faster. Take your time and play it safe and I'm sure you will receive results in a fair amount of time.
<br />

This goes back to my practice schedule. The best thing about the way I practiced was I didn't have to worry about results. I didn't go nuts demanding results like most people do for hours a day. I practiced every other day for 1/2 hour and that?s it. What kept me motivated was knowing that I would receive results. My advice to keep you motivated is imagine the cool things you'll be able to do once you've achieved this ability on a fairly decent level ( Show your friends, show your family members etc). 
<br />

<br />
Now lets get into why your having slight pressure towards the head. Your practicing to much. You need to take it easy with how you practice. Try my practice schedule, I'm sure you'll receive much faster results and the pain will go away while practicing. When you start to feel any pain while practicing you need to stop at once. Do not over practice.
<br />

<br />
Good luck with PK and if you have any more questions please feel free to ask. 
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />

			Quote &quot;You do not need any previous experience with PK or any other psionic skill in order to practice PK.&quot; Ok, it's not that i believe you, but just tell me how you are so sure about that? Because that means EVERYONE will garanteed to develop PK without any experience in any psionic skill first...
<br />

<br />
Quote &quot;What kept me motivated was knowing that I would receive results. My advice to keep you motivated is imagine the cool things you'll be able to do once you've achieved this ability on a fairly decent level ( Show your friends, show your family members etc).&quot; no no, i am not talking about that, i am even TOO much motivated like that, i may even be TOO obssessed with this ability and about any psychic ability at all because it's been 2 years and half of almost daily training and i still developed nothing ! And because of this i am constantly frustated and that's why i don't have patience to wait that long for results, because the lack of immediate results makes me immediatly think it will never work for me (specially because everything i tried until today failed) even knowing that it's normal to not give results i just find that VERY hard to believe. I know this is a matter of being positive and changing my beliefs but that's not easy and also require a lot of time, specially because i ALWAYS was a negative (pessimist) person... but now with your answers my hope is up again!
<br />

<br />
Quote &quot;You need to take it easy with how you practice. Try my practice schedule, I'm sure you'll receive much faster results and the pain will go away while practicing.&quot; ok i have three main doubts here :
<br />

<br />
First, that half-hour it's meant to do all three steps (relaxing, connecting and objective tech (the act of trying to make it move)) or all three things are done inside that half hour ?
<br />

<br />
Second, it's about praticising a half hour. That's just too much boring i can't stand that much time, the maximum i can stand looking at the psywheel or any object is 10-15 minutes (without results, because mostly when the psywheel moves and i am not sure if it was really me, i get a lot more motivated and i am able to practise almost 45 minutes). See this is why i asked that question about the practising times, if i follow all your practise schedule, but i do TWO sessions of 15 minutes each day (of course i won't do them in a row right after each other) it won't take longer time in learning the skill than when doing a single 30 minutes session ? And i mean by not counting the time to relax.
<br />

<br />
Third, usually i NEVER felt connected with a object everytime i tried to do psychokinesis. So it means that by using your method i should ONLY start doing the step &quot;objecttive tech&quot; (practise) when i start feeling connected to the object after several days of practise ? I ask this because you say &quot;Now that you have the connection with the object you will...&quot; but when i used N.I's method in the article on this website i NEVER felt connected so i could never advance to the part of willing the psywhell to move, so this means i should first learn to feel the connection before i start following the techniques to try to move the object, right?
<br />

<br />
Sorry about so many questions, but it's just things like this that i have douzens of mental blocks preventing me to use a specific training schedule for more than 3-4 days, i am constantly changing schedules, and ONLY asnwers from a person that i see that have developed this ability will solve my doubts.
<br />

<br />

Well unless you are blind, the answer would be obvious. You see it spin <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.

			I've been working at pk for some time (4 years +) and its sad to say I have had no real indication that I have done it. Reading this article does give me new hope, the main problem being I was really forceful. Another problem I guess was that I would start with big objects and althought it looked like it moved I could never be totally sure. I scared myself a few times by closing doors but I have always put that down to &quot;logical explanation&quot; which kinda sucks because there is no convincing my brain otherwise. Hopefully I can start again with the small things and prove what I already know.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

alright.

I was practicing with a large seed, but a paper object would be miuch lighter and easier. I haven't made mine spin yet, but I will practice.
