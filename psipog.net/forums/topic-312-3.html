			Woodpecker, even though you're kind of new , you have alot of pretty good opinions.....

If I havn't already said this, If the world were ready for psi then it would have already been announced worldwide because religous folk and scientists would have except the ideals of psi...which they havn't...My opinion is to keep on this way, gaining members as we go, and slowly turn this underground into a recognized group <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			only to keep threads like these from emerging. Its like religious wars. The ideas (both for and aganst) are great, and well thought out, but when you start to fight over it, thats when it becomes tryin to win first place in the special olympics. Even though you won, your still retarded.

(Disclamer: The following will be seen as very offensive to family members with the mentally disabled. The only thing i was refering too, was the pointlessness of arguing over something that has good points for and aganst. Things like that are hard to prove, and have a chance of never being proven. Think about it. Religion is only proven to those that have died <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />)

			psi, chi, energy, spiritual force, life-force.. these all mean the same thing... how hard is it to prove that every living thing.. even those not living have a design.. a signature.. an imprint... everything is composed of something... and we all share an underlying base that everything in existance shares... that is Psi.. That is Chi... that is life-force... every human is their own universe... The masses will always have skeptics... this proof you speak of... it's allready existing... some people will learn more about it... others will just simply laugh at it.. let all those be who they choose... ~Peace to all~
