			<img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> this is probably stupid but I was thinking  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> if psi = life force. Then psi pets are made from life force, so if an abject has a life force isn?t it alive? And if it was alive wouldn?t it know it was alive? So wouldn?t it have some sort off primitive awareness? And if it did wouldn?t it feel pain when you destroy it?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			Some people do think that psi pets are &quot;alive&quot;.  How can you tell either way?  No one really knows what qualifies something as &quot;alive&quot;, so it's hard to tell if what you create is &quot;alive&quot;.

			A guy at work and I had a discussion about beings that were spawned by the consciousness and energies of man. (Not trying to be religious... or anti-religious  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> ) but things like Satan, God, Demons, Angels... whatever. Though we didn't discuss the roots of them; We came to a mutual agreement that so much energy was placed into these beings from people just thinking/believing in them that eventually they became real beings and developed a conscious of their own. So, in relationship to your post I think it is possible for Psipets to become real/living and begin to feel. But, if it would require a ton of energy to do so. I'm not sure I agree with the 'because it doesn't exist on this plane it's not alive' idea. Since everything is made of energy, this plane is simply a certain vibration of that energy which we all 'intersect' on, sort of like the things/people on this plane are all in range of each other so we 'exist together'... this is my believe anyway, not saying it is or isn't... so throwing out some more ideas for consideration, do with them what you will. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			In all honesty, this question cannot be answered, because we have no definition for what it means to be &quot;alive&quot;. I could explain what I mean, but <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-definiton-of-life.htm" target="_blank" class="postlink">these</a> people do a far better job of it.
<br />

<br />
Basically, the term &quot;life&quot; is misleading, as there is really no identifiable difference between something that is alive and something that is not. The term itself is most likely just a societal construct. That gets into religion, though, so I'll leave it alone. 
<br />

<br />
To answer your question - I bet you could create a construct that had characteristics that are indifferentiable from a living thing. Would you consider, however, a psiball to be alive? A psiball is, unless I am mistaken, just an extremely primitive construct. Ergo, while a construct <span style="font-style: italic">could</span> be alive, not all constructs are.

They are very much &quot;alive&quot;, and their complexity/quality will vary.

Even an earthworm is &quot;alive&quot;, and psi-&quot;pets&quot; are more advanced then that.

I ask you: what qualifies something as &quot;alive&quot;? Complexity?
<br />

<br />
A sea sponge is &quot;alive&quot; (according to modern science), yet they cannot feel pain. My computer, however, can be programmed to respond with a scream of pain when a certain button is pressed - I can even make pressing that button hurt its internal workings. Does that make my computer more alive than a sea sponge?

ya i don't think we know enough to be able to accurately answer this question. i naturally lean more to what kinji said if i have to pick a theory, but i'm not gonna say it's definitive cause like Tas said, because the term life is misleading.

			it could be possible.. like having a split personality.. although i don't know if the concept of creating another consciousness in your mind is the same with creating a psipet.. but hey who knows.. if you lock up your emotions for so long a consciousness comes to exist feeding from that emotion.. so maybe, if you keep on feeding that psipet eno9ugh energy.. i guess it could come to life.. maybe..
