			This is my first post here and i'd like to congratulate the staff for making this forum a gr8 place. I'd like to start off by telling you of my accomplishment in telepathy and my problem. Here is what happened:
<br />

<br />
After reading the document &quot;The Psion Handbook&quot;, i knew of my limitations. I found (for me) that the best way to practice visualizations is to daydream. I daydream all the time and it has finally paid off for i can easily visualize sound, visions, taste and feelings. I finally decided to play the telepathy game where one would think of a color, visualize it going from your head to the recepients'. I did this with my sister (she daydreams alot too so that kinda makes her like me). I thought of red. I visualized a red fog or whatever going out into her. She finally said &quot;red&quot;. I was amazed since this was my first telepathic experience. She then thought of a color and sended it to me. I felt a rushing feeling towards my brain and i saw green in my eyes. i said green and what would you know, i was right. Then we moved onto shapes. There was difficulty but we managed to get it down. Then i tried to do this:
<br />
Basically read her mind without her having to send anything. Kinda like reach out into her mind and see what she was thinking. I had no success. I tried to visualize a tube coming out from my forehead to finally spray out and lightly touch hers. I didnt want to force my way into her. I had no success. Have you ne comments and suggestions?
<br />

<br />
PS: I really thank you all for doing this. I love this site already and i hope to increase my phsycic ability.

			i guess we have the same problem... what you're doing is called scanning, and i am too wondering why that happens... for now I could get mental pictures through scanning but no luck yet with sounds and words.. I am hoping that someone could share some insights as well.. all I could advice you with is read the articles more.. it'll help trust me <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I can partly scan but I suck at sending...I kind of visualize my mind going to theirs(I give it it's own sight so I can be accurate)...after that I can just get whatever but right now I can't get too far...

			what do you mean by giving it its own sight bladeslinger? is the same with your consciousness drifting with the energy you extend to the target's mind?

			Conscious thoughts are one of the lesser things of the mind.
<br />

<br />
Remember to scan the specific part of the brain that makes conscious thoughts. Do research and look at diagrams to find the area, or, alternatively, find out through personal experience.
<br />

<br />
Linking is the first step, then syncronization.
<br />
Being in a state of gnosis should help, and then you can allow your connection to control your thoughts, thus thinking what they think.
<br />

<br />
This connection is rather deep, though, so don't **** everything up! <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Also, there are forms of &quot;thought&quot; that are more useful then conscious ideas -- which can be sent. Example:
<br />
Linking two people's immune systems and slowly working on upgrading eachother.

If you want to, we could train live on msn chat:
