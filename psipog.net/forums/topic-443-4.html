			Someone mentioned about &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know&quot;; that was one kickass documentary/movie. Another thing to also think about is that discoveries never stop. Things are constantly being revised with new technology, theories, and data. One cannot &quot;assume&quot; as he said that &quot;THIS is ALWAYS THIS, and not THAT&quot;. (When you assume, you make an <span style="font-weight: bold">ass</span> of <span style="font-weight: bold">u</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">me</span>. So anyways, that guy got owned pretty hard. GG. At least he tried, right?

			i saw that documentary.  it was absolutely incredible...
<br />

<br />
The most interesting thing is what they did with the water:
<br />

<br />
They got three classes of water.  one control one that they thought bad things about and one that they concentrated good things on.  After awhile the results were absolutely breath-taking.  Magnified the structure of the water had completely changed.  one looked nice the other looked normal and the other looked disgusting.  i think you can guess which ones were which.
<br />

<br />
Simply incredible.

			What the Bleep Do We Know is a good movie, however, they pass a few things off as absolute fact that haven?t even been close to being proven. Not that I disagree with the message, however, the pictures of the water molecules specifically have NOT been tested in any logical way, and serves as sort of a backbone to the story.

He does not support double blind testing, which wouldn?t be hard to implement.
<br />

<br />
What that means is that he tells the person photgraphing the water: ?Hey, this one represents ?love?, now go find some cool crystal in the water.? And the person then finds an awesome crystal. Obviously the person searching for the crystal is now biased.
<br />

<br />
I don?t know if water crystals will behave like that. The cool thing is that there are some intelligent people who think that they will. And the other cool thing is that there are some other intelligent people who think it won?t. The stupid part is that no one else has tried to re-create the experiment using double blind procedures. Why not? It?s not that hard to re-create.

			I just saw 'what the bleep' movie just now, it is definitely a religion movie. You can get information on Quantum Physics somewhere else, this is not 100% scientific. It has people in the movie who are not even  scientists, if you are religious you may be offended by their conclusions. Ramtha lady and Steve Hagelin promote their own religious assertions in this film, which I didnt understand why I'm supposed to believe them. Just read some books on Quantum Physics you will be happier and learn more.  It does talk about Quantum mechanics and some of it makes sense(in theory) with Psi activity, but you're right they take things to be fact,  when they are not proven.

I haven't shared my psi experiences widely. Even here, I haven't related much about them. I have one or two friends that I don't have to explain anything to, for good or ill, our lives are intertwined psychically. Some time ago, I began to relate some of my expierences to a third person. He is a man in his 70's and a retired psychologist. Surprisingly, he responded with interest and an open mind, in part because I could back up my experiences. Because of that, he recommended my seeing &quot;What The Bleep...&quot; partly because of my experiences, and partly because he thought I'd like the graphics. I was not overly impresed by the movie. I  felt it was underwritten by Scientology money. I felt it addressed too many things without staying on one long enough to investigate it thouroughly. I think there are some people who need help from medication at times. The character played by Marly Matlin found herself by throwing away her drugs and finding the strength from her inner self to make the changes in her perceptions of the world. I was deeply offended by this message being treated as a cure all philosophy. 
<br />

<br />
I think that many people who use prescription drugs are in the cycle of dependence because of not being able to face their own neuroses and it's good to point things like that out. But there are some forms of mental illness that it would be a mistake to say...&quot;Oh, you can cure yourself if you had the inner strength.&quot; By merely pointing out what we know about the brain doesn't mean the will alone is the way to solve all of our problems.
<br />
 
<br />
While pointing out the complexity of the brain, the movie promotes a facile conclusion about how to view the world or people who may be having problems from within.

			I think the Skeptics section was an awesome idea. I've already had a few good laughs. My real name is zack too. Just goes to show that just because two people share the same name, doesn't make 'em the same... though Im pretty sure everyone knows that already... I don't have any proof though.. .

			The whole basis behind 'What The 'Bleep' Do We Know?' was to get people to think and to ask questions.  Essentially, they wanted people to 'think outside of the box'.  Excuse the cliche.  Of course, there is a fair bit of fact and worth found within the movie; much of the actual debate ON quantum physics is fairly concrete, but then again, how concrete could such a theory be to begin with?  We're definately making great strides in proving the existance of probability and the quantum world, but obviously we've yet to fully understand it.  If you look at the rudimentary information, though, it can easily explain the existance of psionics and how it'd work.
<br />

<br />
Whether or not Emoto's experiment has been enacted with double blind testing implemented is beyond me, but the general meaning of the experiment is profound.  I don't see any reason as to why we couldn't alter the appearance of water, or anything else, in that matter.
<br />

<br />
As for JZ Knight and Ramtha in the documentary.  Well, that's a mixed-bag.  I've heard that it's been proven that she's actually in contact, and can channel the ancient being from Lemuria, Ramtha, but still I hear of others calling it fraud.  As far as I know, several scientists, psychologists, neurologists, et cetera tested her before, during, and after being connected to Ramtha, and they found significant findings.  In being in contact with Ramtha the readings of her brain-wave activity shifts to delta, which is the state reached when in deep sleep.  In concern to her ability to walk, and talk, for that matter, is apparently subject to the lower cerebellum's doings.
<br />

<br />
I don't know whether I completely believe it or not, but I've found a VERY strong correlation between the channelling done for the past 30 years.  Every channelled entity seems to relay the exact same--or mostly exact--message.  Coincidence?  I honestly couldn't tell you.  
<br />

<br />
Just ask questions, folks.  That's it.

Then, you have to find out for yourself. But be prepared, and don't forget to make a checkpoint in case you die.

			It's perfectly fine if you can't find answers from anyone else.  You already answered your own question, though.  You would have to search for the answer yourself, and that is a life journey in itself.  And sometimes the best way to learn.  To find the answers within yourself, to truly dig deep down and look, you'll know the answers.  Maybe not all of them, but damnit, a whole lot of them.  By the by, I don't see how getting killed has anything to do with this.

What if the answers you find are clouded by misconception, and are, in essence, wrong?
<br />
What if, EVERYBODY has a misconception and gets the question wrong?
<br />

<br />
I.e., many a year ago, people thought the world was flat. it was generally accepted that it was flat, until columbus proved it false, but he was thinking radically, in their time. 
<br />

<br />
one could say NOW that the universe is infinite, and that there was no big bang, and could be considered radical as of now
