<br />

<br />
Intro:
<br />
	I always like starting a lesson with a good/inspiring/funny quote:
<br />

<br />
	&quot;I'm all in favor of keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of fools, let's start with typewriters.&quot;  
<br />
    -Frank Lloyd Wright.  
<br />
Ha ha ha
<br />
Okay:
<br />
	When you read this article, I will expect you to have read some other telekinesis techniques.  There are some out there that are really good and you can learn a lot from them.  I am only writing this article because I found that other articles on psipog do not work for me.  Try all of them and see what works for you.  Also, I expect you to be able to make a basic psiball.  Nothing fancy, just be able to make one.  If you want, you can show this article to others but for no cost.  That means NO MONEY.  I hate the idea of somebody using my work and making a profit off it.  Also, make sure you give me ALL the credit (except for you printing it out or emailing it)!  Do not say that I &quot;helped&quot; you write this.  After all, I am the one who wrote this article.  If anybody likes this article or has a question about it or a comment, email me at <a href="#">chrisking517@yahoo.com</a>.  I would love to hear from anybody who wants to take the time to read my article because this is my first article, and I want to know if it helps.  I am sorry for any grammar or spelling errors in here.  I think I got them all though.  I hope I made this article as clear as possible.  It is hard to explain how to do telekinesis.  Its like explaining how you move your arm.  Its next to impossible.  Luckily, it is not impossible so I will try my best.
<br />

<br />
Think I'm crazy?  Then read this:
<br />

<br />
	If you are reading this and thinking right now, &quot;Oh my gosh, I can't believe how many people believe in this non-sense&quot;.  I got news for you!  If you have not tried telekinesis or do not believe it is possible, you are missing out.  Maybe you do not want to learn right away.  Maybe you are not sure if this is real or not (I was this).  Well do not worry, if you want to learn this technique, great; if not, ok just listen along and see if you get interested.  All I am asking is: do not categorize this topic in your head as non-sense.  Read this article and read the other articles on telekinesis (http://psipog.net/articles.php?cat=301).  Who knows, maybe you will learn the ability and love it or decide this is not really for you.  Any answer is fine as long as you read what we all have to say.  Seriously, think about it, would we have written all these articles if it were not true?  Ok, let us get started, shall we?
<br />

<br />
Getting Ready:
<br />

<br />
	Ok.  You are ready to take the time and try to move an object with your mind.  For the beginning of this technique, I will be talking about using a psiwheel also known as the pin on wheel exercise.  If you do not know what this is, you can learn about it and make one at <a href="../show.php@id=2.html" target="_blank">art-introduction-to-tk.html</a> at the bottom of the article (right before the conclusion).  I am using the psiwheel because I think it is a lot easier to move for beginners than anything else.  If you are a beginner, which I am expecting you are since you are reading about a different technique, try replacing the paper on the psiwheel with aluminum foil.  This way, the friction is less so it is easier to move.  Keep in mind, though, doing this will increase the chance of the wind moving it, but it is a great start for beginners.
<br />
	The first thing you have to do is try to think about nothing (some people say &quot;quiet your mind&quot;).  Listen to your breathing.  Concentrate on it.  Some people meditate and some do not.  Personally, I do not but that is just me.  Try not to think about anything.  If a thought creeps in, that is your subconscious.  Identify it, and slowly push it away.  Do not ignore or dismiss it without listening to it.  If you do this, your subconscious will not be as strong during performing telekinesis.  Look at the psiwheel for as long as you need to be able to visualize it.  Do not try to move it quite yet.
<br />

<br />
Starting:
<br />

<br />
	Now, put your hands to the sides of the psiwheel.  Do not let them touch, just act as if you are forming a snowball but keep your hands separated from one another and around the psiwheel.  Start to create a psiball within your hands with the psiwheel in the psiball.  Don't worry about making it strong.  If you are good at making psiballs, it might start to spin or set on fire.  Just try not to set it on fire <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.  If it starts to spin, great, but pay attention to the rest of the article so you can do it again later without that strong of a psiball.  Feel the presence of the psiwheel in your hands.  Visualize the psiball engulfing the psiwheel with your psi.  You might feel all tingly inside and that is good.  If you do not; that?s good too.  It does not really matter.  If you feel tingly inside, you might be able to flow psi more freely than somebody who doesn't but it is quite ok if you don?t feel tingly (I like that word &quot;tingly&quot;).
<br />

<br />
Ready?  Move it:
<br />

<br />
	Once you have created a psiball around the psiwheel, visualize yourself spinning slowly at first and speeding up as you go.  Imagine you looking out one side of the psiwheel and seeing your surroundings swirl.  Feel the slight lightheadedness or dizziness of spinning.  Now envision yourself looking at the psiwheel spin.  Imagine how it feels to have a spinning psiwheel in your psiball.  Now open your eyes if they were closed or bring yourself into reality if you were imagining with them open.  If the psiwheel beings to move, you just did telekinesis.  If not, you may be trying to hard or it is your first time trying.  If it does not move, try to look away from the psiwheel and consciously think of something else.  Do a math problem in your head or something.  Keep the psiwheel in your peripheral vision.  If you start to see movement, casually turn back to it but don't concentrate to hard on moving the psiwheel.  Remember, telekinesis is an ability that takes practice.  Its like walking, you have to practice when you are a little kid until you can do it by yourself.  In telekinesis, you have to practice in order to move the psiwheel or move bigger objects.  So don't be all bummed if you can't do it the first time.
<br />

<br />
Conclusion:
<br />

<br />
	If this technique worked for you, great and please, if you want, email me at <a href="#">chrisking517@yahoo.com</a>.  Some books say meditation is a need but I get results and I don't meditate so don't think you have to.  During all this, keep your hands around the psiwheel but you don't have to concentrate on it.  Also, if you want to try another quick technique that I heard was going around; try shooting psi at one of the corners.  Imagine a beam of psi hitting one of the corners of the psiwheel.  I don't do this so I don't know if it will work but it might work for some people.  I cannot stress enough to people, try and try again if it doesn't work the first time.  You will get it if you keep at it.  Good luck.

			<span style="font-weight: bold">Rolling and Sliding Objects using Telekinesis</span>
<br />

<br />
	Like my other article, this article is meant to be typed for a new Psion to be able to read.  You can find my other article for beginners at <a href="http://psi-training.blogspot.com/2005/10/my-telekinesis-article.html" target="_blank">http://psi-training.blogspot.com/2005/10/my-telekinesis-article.html</a> .  Again, I am not liable for any injury that may occur when performing this advanced ability.  This article will be all about, as the title says, techniques to roll and slide objects.  All of the techniques that I describe in this article have worked for me so I do know that they work.  This article will also NOT cover the psiwheel.  Rolling and sliding are for people who have worked with the psiwheel and can move it fairly well (if not great).  In addition, rolling is easier than sliding because there is not as much friction.  Let us get started:
<br />

<br />
Setting up and warm up
<br />

<br />
	When you are new to telekinesis, your mind is weak.  I am not talking about your IQ, education, and those things.  I am talking about the psychic strength.  Obviously, as you know when you first started, it was hard to move the psiwheel.  You could probably make it barely budge or not at all.  Hopefully, before you attempt the techniques that this article outlines you can move the psiwheel with ease.  If you cannot, keep working with the psiwheel.  You need to build up the psychic strength of your mind to be able to move bigger and heavier things.
<br />

<br />
	To warm up, create your average psiball.  Make it as strong as you would like.  The objective here is to get your energies moving and for your mind to get into the zone of telekinesis.  Play with your psiball a little.  Make it swirl around you or play yo-yo with it.  Most of all, relax.  When you feel as if you are very relaxed and all warmed up, move on to the actual technique.
<br />

<br />
Rolling an object
<br />

<br />
	First things first.  You need something to roll.  Pick something that is completely round, not a pencil that is a hexagon.  Choose a rounded pen or lead from a mechanical pencil.  This is easier because you are not working against much backpressure.  Later, you can move onto hexagonal objects.  Put the pencil in front of you and put your hands near it.  I use hands in my articles because from emails that I have gotten and people who have worked with me, I realize that it is easier for the majority of people to do it with hands.  I will use a pencil to show how to set up your hands.  Place your non-dominant hand on the eraser side and the other hand in on the side of the long side of the pencil so that your hands are perpendicular.  With your dominant hand, point (using your index finger) at the object.  Take three deep and slow breaths (I see that taking breaths actually help people).  
<br />
At the conclusion of your deep breaths, visualize small laser shots of psi shooting from your index finger to the object.  Make them small, quick shots.  As fast as lightning and envision them striking at random places on the object.  Try to feel to impact of the psi hitting the object.  Continue visualizing the psi hitting the object but also start to visualize the object recoiling in the opposite direction.  Feel the psi attacking the object and the object being pushed.  Do this for a couple of minutes.  Some people find it easier to first transfer energy to the object before trying this technique.  Try both ways.  You might also have to change some parts of this article to fit your needs.  Not everybody works the same way.
<br />

<br />
Sliding an object
<br />

<br />
	To be able to slide an object, you must be able to roll.  Rolling is much easier to do due to friction and technique.  With sliding, you have to concentrate on applying equal amounts of force on both sides so that the object does not tip over and roll.  If you attempt to do this and you have not gotten good at rolling objects yet, you will get frustrated and quit.  If you can roll well, this is still a very hard technique.  Ok, now that that is said, onto the technique:
<br />
	Set up your hands the same way as in the rolling section above.  Relax and this time take six deep breaths but take them slowly.  When you feel as if you are very relaxed, visualize a fairly thick piece of string psi coming out of your finger.  Imagine the string tying itself in a knot around the object.  Then with your non-dominant hand (the one that should be on the side of the object), visualize a psi hand coming out from it and imagine it gripping the object fully.  Next is the barrier of the friction.  Tell yourself mentally that you can overcome the friction.  Imagine the object sliding and feel the rub between the table (or where ever you are doing it) and the object.  Feel it deep inside of you.  Make it make you shiver.  Keep visualizing the object moving by the psi hand and the psi string.  Do this for a while.  I use this technique so it does work.  It just takes a lot of time and practice to get it.
<br />

<br />
Conclusion
<br />

<br />
	You must remember that this is very advanced telekinesis.  It does take time and energy.  Please do not forget that you must take breaks.  Do not stress yourself.  Don?t wait to get a headache because that shows you that you have already overdone it.  If you refuse to take a little break from time to time, you will not be able to do it and you might even hurt yourself.  Dedicate one day per week to doing no telekinesis.  I have said it in the past and I will say it again, these techniques are very advanced.  They take a lot of practice and consistency.  Do not give up.  Giving up is the worst thing you could do.  Once again, I am open to emails about either comments on this article, questions/comments on telekinesis, or just talking.  Feel free to email me at <a href="#">chrisking517@yahoo.com</a>.  I hope you enjoyed this article.

			oh ok, those kinda thoughts. mine are like, &quot;hm this *whatever i'm moving* isn't moving yet,must be doing it wrong&quot;, or like something about the object: &quot;psiwheel is stuck on the pin&quot; or &quot;should be moving&quot; or &quot;its the wind&quot; which i heard dont help in the process. but like i dunno, do you have thoughts like that?
