			I everyone, I'am new here and french is my first language . I will try to do my best.
<br />

<br />
I've been practicing telekinesis for almost 2 weeks and it work quite weel for me.
<br />

<br />
I improve everyday and try to develop a new technique intending to have much more control. I discovered that visualisation is not a natural way for my subconscient. Kind of very complex method  for &quot;him&quot; to understand and energy consuming.
<br />

<br />
When you get a connection with the object (psywheel). You can notice very slith movement that seem's random to you at first. In fact, those are not random, they are directly linked to you. 
<br />

<br />
What I suggest is to try not to interpret them consciously, nor to try to command them. Just stare at the object and follow every tiny movement with your eyes. 
<br />

<br />
My hypothesis is that subconscient have a very good intuition to find the best (simple) way to be linked to the object. Just follow movement and think of nothing. Just try to feel how you feel inside when it moves in a way. Subconscient seems very ease that way because you let him the time to find the best way for him. This method may be much more difficult to accept for your conscient because you may feel like it is not the way you are used to control things. But remember that it is the subconscient you do the job.  
<br />

<br />
I hope this will be an interesting experiment for you. Be welcome to give me feedback.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
With that technique, ( witch I suggest to call the Passive Control training) I intend to control with &quot;natural feeling&quot;.

The &quot;Just try to feel how you feel inside when it moves in a way.&quot; part sounds very promising  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I like this a lot. It's not confusing for anyone, and it's guaranteed to give results. I will teach this to anyone who asks, parce que c'est way simpler than anything else I could parle. Also, it's easier to ecouter to.(notice all that nifty frenglish...I simply couldn't resist).

			I live in Vancouver, but we still learn french here; although, we usually only use it to make jokes about. 
<br />
 This technique works very well for absolutely any movement I can do (which is rolling, spinning, easy levitation). I also realized that this is what happens to me in spontaneous events as well.
