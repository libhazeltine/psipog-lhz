well my real name is Joe.

eh i saw some manga thing called read or die. and there was genjo sanzo, priest from Xi-You-Ji (aka journey to the west)...in this manga he breathed fire and had a nyoi-bo staff...it was fucking awesome....

			My name is from a woman who made history in Judges chapter four in the Old Testament.  She's a pretty nifty woman who lived during the time the prophetess Deborah lead Israel.  Deborah called a guy named Barak up to lead an army.  He was afraid, so she told him that a woman would have the glory of killing King Siseara, the king Israel was warring with at the time.

 21 But Jael, Heber's wife, picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep, exhausted. She drove the peg through his temple into the ground, and he died.

 22 Barak came by in pursuit of Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him. &quot;Come,&quot; she said, &quot;I will show you the man you're looking for.&quot; So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera with the tent peg through his temple-dead.
