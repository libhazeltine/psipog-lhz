			I've just been wonering how people on herer are so confident that they've done something.  I've done tp and psi-balls and gotten some pretty decent proof, but some people are definate that all of this is real.  They talk about getting blisters from psi-balls, startling strangers with heated psi, using tp to cheat on tests, and I'm starting to wonder if this is really happening or if it's all in their heads....

			i dont know about EVERYTHING they say to be true, cause people do tend to bs just about everything, including getting the right answers on the test even though they failed. noone here is going to come out and say i used TK on a t est and flunked. 
<br />

<br />
yes, its true, before there was language there had to be some way to communicate; and its up to you to figure out what that was/is

			In order to do psi effectively you have to have a confident attitude towards it. The best psions have it ingrained in their mind it exists like a religion. That's why they do it so well.

			I'm confident about it but I'm just wondering how people can talk about psi so confidnetly.  SOme people here are trying to figure out how to float while I'm still trying to flare a psi-ball.

			people that are trying to float are overconfident-morons, levitation is quite impossible, and i dont care what chris angel does either. People crave attention and they belive when they levitate they'll get every last drop of it.
<br />

<br />
now i have to disagree that psi is embeded in the mind like a religion, cause it sure isnt in my head. IRL, you cant move everything with your mind alone, you can use your mind to move something more energy-efficiently
