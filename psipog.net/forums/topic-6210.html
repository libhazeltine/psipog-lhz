			Could you by any chance show me the other 2 books you wrote? I must be honest that I couldnt understand everything in them (only read physics on share time) I'm surpise I was able to see the pion problem, something else bothers me but I can't put my finger on it at the moment..

			The other two books I wrote? Are you talking about the previous 2 editions of the Theory? They were just previous versions of the current edition. They were improved upon, and reworked, and re-written into the current edition.
<br />

<br />
I haven't written any other major works. 
<br />

<br />
Also, you have yet to provide me with a hypothesis on how Projection works into the theory. Provided you do so, and you're not just a problem-finder, STAG will do some research and experimentation in SUP, as well as uniformity of particles in matter and cohesion between particles forming solid objects.
<br />

<br />
Still a lot of work to be done with this, but we're making progress. Most of our future work will be done once the centre of operations has finished relocation in January.

			Sorry for the mistake. I don't know much about this...only that there are 3 different pions (+, 0,  -). And that they change into different things (mostly 2 photons). I gave the idea before about cosmic rays are the source of some parnomal things...but I don't feel right about it myself.
<br />

<br />
Just a thought...maybe some reaction between comic rays and pions could exist....pions do come from matter going &quot;near&quot; light speed. But what strikes odd more to me is that a pion can change into something with no mass &quot;photon&quot; and mass&quot; electron&quot;. The higgs boson field is so complex...we can't even see it.

			Man, what a ball of fluff. First off, there are no &quot;birth switches.&quot; I want some damn proof that psi is in any way related to genetics. Like real proof describing the chemical processes of some mutant proteins that cause differences in psionic capability in the population. Second off, I thought free particles were called free radicals and were just electrons. These get picked up by oxygen molecules which pile them up and cause problems. Thus the anti-oxidants. I might be wrong. Third, how do these free particles hold information? Fourth, do you know how many of these particles you would need to move stuff in PK? I doubt that kind of build up would be under science's radar.

			Niushirra, I'm not even going to entertain your comments. It's pure negativity, finding holes in my theory without giving any suggestion on how they could possibly be patched.
<br />

<br />
This is a perfect opportunity to say again that I'm looking for <span style="font-style: italic">constructive</span> criticism, not just problems! And &quot;junk the whole idea&quot; doesn't count. I want people to contribute to making it better, not just try to debunk it!
<br />

If people don't read the bloody topic post, I'll just delete the topic post and request that the thread be locked.

			Man, you're a dumbass. Fix the damn theory yourself. It's not my job to do your work. I pointed out what was wrong with it and now you're just going to give up just cause a little old me.
<br />

<br />
Here's the one biggest thing you need. PROOF!!! You got no evidence at all. You could say your proof is logic but if I don't understand that logic or anybody else doesn't you need to expand on your reasoning so it's understandable.
<br />

<br />
After you get some proof I'll try to break it down or provide proof against it. Then you reinforce your theory until it's rocksolid. Then people can start accepting it as fact.

			OK, I've said before (in another thread) that my current budget is exactly:
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal">$0</span></span>
<br />

<br />
This means that it'll take me a while to get decent evidence. I've also found some serious holes in the current edition myself, mostly with the birth-switch thing (I found out just before reading your post that it was small-time bunk), as well as the mass and origin of the particle responsible. That's what the &quot;heavy-duty work&quot; I referred to earlier is. I'm working on getting proof, but with no cash, it's kinda hard. I do what I can, with what resources I've got.
<br />

<br />
And btw, I'm not giving up. I'm just not getting faceless, nameless strangers on the internet to do my peer reviewing. I'll find someone I can talk to face-to-face to do that.
