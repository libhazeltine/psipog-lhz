			I was interested in the idea, so I did a little searching on the subject. Check out what I came up with: <a href="http://paranormal.about.com/od/telekinesispsychokinesis/a/aa110804.htm" target="_blank">http://paranormal.about.com/od/telekinesispsychokinesis/a/aa110804.htm</a>
<br />

<br />
Apparently the Air Force is conducting serious research on teleportation and has had success.
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">
<br />
EDIT: here's the link to the actual document that was released by the Air Force. Go to the section labeled p-teleportation</span> <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/teleport.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/teleport.pdf</a>
<br />

<br />
A little search on Wikipedia came up with this, although this is a less reliable source and is kinda fluffy: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleportation#Gil_Perez" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleportation#Gil_Perez</a>
<br />

<br />
I'm highly interested by this. Often I see on these forums that there's limits and PK is just a novelty, but if something like teleportation is possible, then that argument is null. Hopefully, after I gain more and more experience with PK, I'll be able to experiment with this and PK will be more than just something cool to show to people  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I myself wouldn't touch it, I hear you can get yourself killed doing this stuff.
<br />

<br />
I mean basically you are moving your whole body to a random place, and if you don't get it right, you can end up 800ft in the middle of the sky with no way out of it. I think it's all a little extreme... I mean come on, isn't moving stuff with your mind cool enough? D:

			That's a viable argument, but that's kinda like saying you'll light your house on fire by practicing pyrokinesis. With pyrokinesis, you won't light your house on fire or random objects on fire unless it is your intent. Or that's like saying you might float dangerously high, then fall to your death by practicing levitation. That would not happen, unless it was your intent. I'd assume the same applies to other situations as well.
<br />

<br />
However, teleportation isn't confined to just teleporting your physical body. You can teleportation objects and living things to other locations as well. If you're afraid of killing yourself, then you could practice on objects.

			Personally, I think it's worth the risk. Consider this. When you first start practicing telekinesis, do you instantly gain the ability to pour yourself a glass of milk with your mind? Are you capable of moving anything near that heavy or with that precision? Of course not.
<br />

<br />
Teleportation will land you in the same boat. You'll start off small. Maybe moving yourself a few feet away. Eventually, you'll be able to work that up to a few miles. Maybe in time, assuming you trained like crazy, you could travel the world in the blink of an eye.

<br />

<br />
Read the section labeled p-Teleportation. What I found most shocking was that they clearly and boldy said right away that PK phenomena is a reality and then they continue to provide several examples. They're not even critical or skeptical about PK, they just instantly confirm it as reality.
<br />

<br />
In the document, they explain how experiments in China have been able to move objects several meters and even through barriers. The results were repeatable, all conditions for sleight of hand were eliminated, and there were several eye witnesses.
<br />

<br />
... why does the general public still reject PK as a reality?

			Teleportation is psionic skill that is probably THE most useful
<br />
It have to takes some risks, but if it is posible to master it(and live to talk about it <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> )  it would be ireplacable <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			Teleportation and micro-PK are a similar concept.  The more accurately you measure the velocity of a particle, the less accurately you can measure it's position (and vice versa).  Teleportation happens all the time on a microscopic scale - simply put, a particle is actually in every possible position at the same time.  Teleportation on a macroscopic scale has been deemed impossible, but in theory, using micro-PK you could possibly, somehow get all your particles to move in a specific direction, but you could also end up splitting atoms and making yourself into a neuclear bomb. - I'm just speculating.
<br />

<br />
However, using PK, you are probably able to affect light particles... I'm not sure what this would achieve though.
<br />

<br />
Sorry for the quantum mechanics.

			Visualize it and have your intent on the object teleporting. Guides are a great help, but in the end, it is YOU that discovers how to do it.
<br />

<br />
Also, if you think about it, we constantly teleport. Physical motion could be considered teleportation. On a more noticeable level, we use teleportation when we send a psi ball to a friend and we often teleport in OBEs as well.

			That's a good point. Everything we do is just teleportation. The atoms moving in our body are moving through time and space. There is a point where they just flutter in and out of reality really fast, supposedly. So that measn that teleportation is simply speeding that process up and controling it's path.

			Sure it sounds simple, but actually doing it? I'd think that'd be one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish. That being said, its probably one of the more worthwhile things to learn. Might as well try it, huh?
