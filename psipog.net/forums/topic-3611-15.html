Perhaps this thread still has some life in it <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. Since I don't know you Fakiti I'll have to give you a corny compliment that has nothing to do with you as a person (like most of the posts on here <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />). Fakiti is unique for having probably one of if not the only avatars of a pirate on psipog. (I was descended from pirates BTW <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />).

Amazing <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />. I was sure this thread was a gonner. You don't have to feel too bad about leaving the thread, because I left it for dead a long time ago <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. 
<br />

<br />
baalzamon has good tastes (i.e. likes pirates, martial arts, Rock Lee, and the very thread itself <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />)
<br />

<br />
P.S. I <span style="font-weight: bold">WAS</span> in karate. I quit many a year ago. Unfortunately, the karate style (I fight (hypothetically fight/fight with SFG) with my own &quot;style&quot; now; free style/Bruce Lee philosophy) sucked so I didn't enjoy it much. The only thing I enjoyed was sparing because I kicked ass and was feared by almost everyone <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />. As for being descended from pirates, I actually ended up telling two of my friends that and they started calling me a &quot;bloody pirate&quot; and stuff <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. And then I screw around by stealing (&quot;pirating&quot; as they like to say) their stuff until they notice it's gone. Of course they then call me a bloody pirate as a result <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Bladeslinger is awesome because he likes weapons and violence like my brother and I <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
P.S.   I liked the website you gave SFG. I recently ordered a practice sword for about 20$ (that's with shipping added). It's black and 40&quot; long. If you know which one I'm talking about could you tell me if you can hit those things decently hard on other practice swords? It says it's made for low contact, but I don't know what's considered low contact exactly.
