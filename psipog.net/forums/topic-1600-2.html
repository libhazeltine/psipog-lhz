There are a lot of good points here.  1- I'm fine with getting the word out.  There will be one very hard point that starts as soon as everyone knows.  As you said, beople will be labeled as satan worshippers.  Some will not stop believing this, no matter what.  Soon, they would become the outcasts, though.  It just has to wait until we get backup.  Where do we get the backup?  We create it.  Tell others, and practice in secret.  You can also look for others, <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=1394" target="_blank" class="postlink">you might be surprised...</a>
<br />

<br />
2- The world probably isn't ready.  That isn't the skeptics' fault, it's ours.  This is our battle, we have to prepare for it.  The skeptics can't get any stronger, they can only weaken at this point. 
<br />

<br />
3- What do you mean, &quot;make you do stuff with psychokinesis?&quot;
<br />

<br />
4- &quot;nobody wants to date someone who can read minds&quot; They could read your mind if you were not on a date with them anyway, eh?  Okay, that's a bad point.  But seriously, if everyone knows, it will be a power struggle.  This is like saying, &quot;nobody wants to date someone who can beat them up.&quot;  No one thinks about this, and after a while, your point will be meaningless, too.  While people haven't gained enough strength or won't practice (there are people who don't work out, in fact, there are quite a few), that's their problem.  So basically what I am saying here is, after everyone knows, everything will go very bad, but will get alot better, hopefully better than when people didn't know.
<br />

<br />
4.5- EDIT- Demonstrations are very bad.  They don't usually work as a method of convincing others.  You need to get on their level and talk to them about it.
<br />

<br />
5- Niushirra, try to work on your grammar.  That was dang hard to read.

			I have a new idea. Reveal whenever you can. Like, for example, if you are sitting alone in a waiting room with like two other people you can like tear off a peice of paper from something and say &quot;hey wanna see something cool.&quot; Just levitate some paper and don't explain it. This will make THEM research it themselves. If they don't it'll soften the blow of a final reveal that I am thinking will happen.

although if your going to do that waiting room trick dont say anything to them at all, its more mystic that way and more likely to get them to thinking

I haven't heard those people in the women magazines being called devil worshippers, but I have heard them being called frauds, idiots, and other not so very kind things. That is, no one really believes them.

			I just remembered reading something in the paper a week ago or something like that. About football and homosexuality, and it mentioned a football player coming out as gay a few years back, the media stalked him, he left the team (or was kicked, don't remember), and four years later he killed himself because of that. Behold the power of the media.

			uh...

I'm not against the whole 'revealers' thing, I'm just regurgitating my only point: The people in the media are a bunch of greedy, nasty fucks who will find out information not supposed to exist, change the words around to get more money, then publish it.
<br />

Of course, they won't publish it if you're from the U.S. government and you give them alot of money...

Apart from teh funnay things they do, I can't stand to think that they can go as far as to find those sad sad stories about people who can't never saw their parents, brothers, aunts, goats, whatever. And mostly when the stories are probably fake. It gives them higher rates and such, so, whatever... I'm kinda random at this. Meh.

Is proactive the best way?  I don't think so.  I am changing my above statement a bit:  I don't think telling people is the best way, as you well know, Niushirra.  No, I am not referring to you, yourself, but those whom you have told.  He has told some people as an &quot;experiment,&quot; a name given to the situation afterwords.  All of them sorted faded away from psionics, and presto: nothing accomplished.  We just need to wait until there are enough people that do find it on their own  That probably will never happen, however, so I think that &quot;the underground&quot; is how it will stay, no matter how hard we try.  Okay, I am totally repealing my above statement.  So anyway, there may be a way to incorporate so-called &quot;revealers&quot; into society, but I don't think anyone here has a plan that will actually work.  I know I sure don't.

I was living my life fine without a care if they were real or not then kavu pounced me and threw me headfirst into psionics. Everybody wants proof though. If you keep yourself out of the media's range, like I said, underground movement, then you should be able to successfully prove to a good number of people the truth. The mysterious aspect of a revealing session serves two purposes. One: They won't know your name or anything about you other then that you can do all these crazy things. Two: It makes them want more. Those psions who refuse to give proof or hate getting word for selfish reasons are bad. If you don't want to prove proactively because you're afraid of what today's soceity could do then ok fine. You can be that way but there will be more people willing to do this. Oh yes, my expirments. They all failed basically. Actually one person may still be with the psionics but I think she stopped practicing without me helping her along and practicing telepathy with her. I had some bad experiences with revealing things to people who shouldn't know. It's a good thing they all forgot about it and don't cause problems anymore.
