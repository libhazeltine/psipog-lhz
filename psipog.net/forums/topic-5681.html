			Ok, I've been practicing pk for 2, 3, maybe 4 days... but not that much, just thought it would be good to start practicing since I could create psiballs. Well I know it isn't much, but I was finally able to wiggle the psiwheel! Just sort of, tilt it back and forth. Shake it a little. As soon as this happened, my heart leapt and my confidence grew, which I think opened the doorway to me being able to do it even more. I admit I was skeptic at first of course, but now I'm amazed. I covered my nose and mouth with my shirt, and afterwards I thought it might have been several things. I was resting my hands on the desk, so I thought since I was so excited by doing it I was shaking it. Shook it a small amount without really &quot;focusing&quot; and it didn't move at all, unless you had some kinda, microscope. I thought maybe I was breathing through my shirt, debunked that idea luckily. I thought my small hand movements might just have enough wind power to move it, and nope for that one too. My AC was off, too. I'm just so happy right now I'm shaking, gonna go to bed though. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Thanks hitorii, I just wanted to add I got a bit further and it moved more, side to side today. It wasn't like, super-noticeable from far away and such but it was going back and forth like quarter of an inch or so, but it probably could have gone further on a less friction...ful... surface o.0. It kept bouncing back and forth between the two points really wanting to move, but friction just wouldn't let it. The toothpick I used it on was a bit messed up at the tip since I used it to poke the hole in the cup XD. I guess I'll need to train more to be able to give it the amount of push it needs, or something.
