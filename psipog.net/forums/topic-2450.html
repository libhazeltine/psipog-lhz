I've heard of members having accidental PK accidents. I've happened to have several myself. If your planning to learn PK, I think you should practice safely. NI wrote a great article which contained a very intelligent paragraph.
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">The more advanced you get the more responsibility you have to take. I don't want to sound like your parents, guys, but since this article covers advanced telekinesis I think I have to tell you the dangers. Be careful what you are doing with it. Telekinesis is like fire: you could use it in many ways. Control your anger. I don't think it would be a big problem to make an artery explode in someone's head. So control yourself. The best thing is to meditate each day and breathe deep in difficult situations .</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
That article was titled <span style="text-decoration: underline">Advanced Telekinesis: How to Succeed</span>. You can read that article by going to the first link above. I suggest that you look into meditation. Meditation helps relax and clear the mind. You'll need to learn how to control your anger if your having accidental PK events such as yours. 
<br />

<br />
I hoped I helped answer your questions. If you have anymore questions regarding PK or any other psionic ability, feel free to ask. I am more than willing to help. Good luck with PK.
<br />

<br />
Take care.
