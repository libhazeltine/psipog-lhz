			I know this is my first post, but don't dismiss me as a newbie, I've been lurking these forums for the past year and a half. =p Anyways, I've noticed that aside from Maxxus, most people have been pussyfooting around phasing because they fear it will hurt or they will get stuck. There's been alot of &quot;I'll wait till someone else does it first&quot; or &quot;If someone else tries it maybe I will&quot; type posts.  I think it's time somebody conducted a serious study of this skill, and it might as well be me. 
<br />
  Study Outline:
<br />
Phasing partially (hands or fingers through objects)
<br />
Object Phasing (objects through objects)
<br />
Whole Phasing (my body xD)
<br />
    I realize the potential dangers and pain(I don't think it will hurt but, you never know)  that may be involved, but I think that somebody should research it for the benefit of the rest of the community. If anyone else wants to do this  with me feel free to post. Please no flaming, if you think I'm an idiot or borderline mentally retarded, you might be right, but I really don't care. I'm going to post bi-weekly my results I've had since the last post.(kinda like a blog I guess?)

			Rainsong said something like, 'if your chest phases, you will die'. I know i passed through the sofa, but i think that was just lucky that nothing happened, so i'm not going to intentionally try walking through a wall......Hmmmm, i wonder what the inside of a wall would look like?

			We havn't had many sources for phasing information, so this would be a good idea, well seeing as our one source strongly advices against it it may be a dangerous idea, which brings me to my second point.
<br />

<br />
If you are going to make it a legitimate study, at least as legitimate as it can be, then your first concern really needs to be safety. Like planning for as many eventualities as you can think of. For example, If you are successful with phasing your hand, and you decide to try your body, maybe you will want a friend there, so there is someone to call for an ambulance if things go downhill. Or asking a relative to check on you in 40 minutes or something.
<br />

<br />
It may be possible that there is a safe way to phase, assuming that it's possible, and you dear sir are the person to find that way, so good luck to you!

			I'll gladly help you study phasing, Elrond.  I don't believe that it hurts unless you are untrained or unfocused.  Phasing is like the Dark Arts around here, if you even mention it you're marked a noob or something much worse so be careful and watch yourself.  So how do you plan to study phasing?

I've phased quite a lot but accidental in my sleep where I fall through the bed and out the living room ceiling and it didn't hurt me at all...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  I've also partially phased in my dad's arm and it didn't hurt me or him. It just felt like a slight pressure.. Kind of like going through water except not as dense...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  I know, confusing isn't it?

			XnovaX thanks for the ideas about safety, I'll be sure to put those to use. Kow, I'll try to videotape myself, but I don't have a webcam, I just have a digital camera but it can take video. Maxus, Rainsong also said something about falling through the desk one time and I'm fairly sure she's not dead. =p Mikeofmind, thank you for offering to help. The first thing we need to do is attempt to phase our hands through an object using the method Rainsong described in her article. I'm trying to put my hand through a window, that way I don't have a mental block about how thick it is.

			Like other people have said, safety first.  And I read both articles on phasing and she said something along the lines of, &quot;some of the particles of what you phase through do not leave your body.&quot;  So I'm assuming some particles get stuck when they are passing through you, she said that you would die because of particles getting stuck in your vital organs.  But I think that phasing is just a level of skill.  Like a psi wheel, at first you can barely move it but then it gets easy, likewise at first you probably can barely do it and it hurts, but with enough practice you will get better and it will be easier to move through objects and you will encounter less resistance.  
<br />
But if you are going to do a scientific study, then before trying to phase your hand, try to phase a small living organism.  Something like a worm or other kind of bug.  If the bug rolls over and dies after a few phasings you will know not to do it.  It would also be a good idea to have a few control bugs(ones that are not phased at all) on hand so if they all roll over and die at about the same time then you will know the phasing didn't kill it.  After that, provided the bugs lived, then move on to your hand.  After a few phasings try to put your hand under a microscope to see if there are any foreign particles in it. 
<br />
Good luck.
