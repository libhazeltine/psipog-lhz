			I had this dream and in it I was basically flying around, following these two people. I was just always with them, yet, they took no notice of me. I could sense their fear and tiredness? I was trying to help, but, couldn't. Then I moved away to a street. I know this street, then realize I know this place! It's a long way from home! Then I see a crystal ball. It starts to glow. I am afraid that this is what I want to get away from,yet I go towards it anyway. As I peer into this unknown glass, I see a room, a study of some sorts. A man comes in, I see him as old and frail, yet dangerous. I fear he sees me just as    clearly as I see him, so I turn to leave, alas, he spots me. His face frowns with anger and shock, yet a certain degree of expectation shows. I fear for me safety and run towards my two friends from earlier, yet find them to be dead, bitten my a cloaked man, who turns to meet my gaze then my view is turned upward and I wake up.

			Could be a dream that is foretelling something. Although that is very unlikely.

The world would have blown up if all of my dreams actually meant something.
