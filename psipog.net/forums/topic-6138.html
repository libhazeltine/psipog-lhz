			Lately, I've been studying pressure points and the affects they have on the human body. I've been studying them for martial arts as well as for more effective healing processes. I would just like to know if anyone knows any websites with legible Meridian diagrams.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> I learned a few techniques but they're pretty much useless because I'm not sure where the pressure points are.
<br />
-thank you
<br />

<br />
And if anyone else is interested in Kyusho techniques, PM me and I'll give you websites for basic techniques.

			Well, I don't know any websites... but Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming has a few books out that detail the major meridians and meridian points. Google him, he's probably one of the best at making the books understandable.

			I'd reccomend not trusting web sites. There's too mych fluffahness out there. if you don't want to find a real 'teacher', look for some of Yang's books. They have a fairly good pressure point and meridians diagrams, covering the major ones and they label them pretty good, with warnings like:
<br />

<br />
&quot;DEATH MAY OCCUR IF HIT&quot;
<br />

<br />
And all sorts of other things- like how to induce vomiting via pressure points, and how to lock up someone's breathing, even if only temporarily.
<br />

<br />
Don't take any of these points lightly, people.

Yeah you're probably right. I found that some of the websites teach real healing points and fake hurting points.

Most of the websites are bad IMO. Bad idea to trust the Net on this subject, just IMO.

Ceck out Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming's books- they're about as accurate as you can get, and detail only a very few injury points(enough to use if needed, but not enough to abuse)
