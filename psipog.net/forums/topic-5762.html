			Even though it's been a short time since I've started the psi-wheel, I feel that I have completed my task, which is having it move both ways under somewhat of my own control.  With that being done, I feel that it is time for me to move on to the next object, as I've heard if you stick to the psi-wheel too long, you may become dependent on it.
<br />

<br />
Problem is... I don't know what to start out with.  I feel like I only know how to spin an object left and right, not move it or roll it.  I've tried balancing foil (basically just an upside down psi-wheel) and sliding that, but I can't seem to even make it budge.  Same thing with pencils on an inclined plane and toothpicks.  I don't really know how to think when I try to move it..
<br />

<br />
I think what started all this is when I read NI's Power vs Control sticky.  He says to not force it and just &quot;let it happen&quot;, but at the same time, you can't just sit there and wait for it to happen.  So that leaves me confused as to how I should think/feel/do.  Do I concentrate on the object?  Do I listen to music to take my mind off of it and &quot;let it happen&quot; that way?  Do I just stare at it until it moves?  I dunno!
<br />

<br />
So if anybody here has some helpful tips to help me out, I would really appreciate it (and I'm sure there are many more out there with the same problem as me).  For the record, I have read every single TK article on psipog.net, so please do not direct me there, as I have exausted that information and can still not perform what I'm aiming for.  
<br />

<br />
Also, if you could say what the first item you worked on after the wheel...that would be helpful too  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I know I can do this, it's just I don't know how to &quot;just do it&quot;.

			lol..when I get bored of the wheel, I take it off my thumbtack and try to slide it.  I basically try to slide anything around me thats small.  
<br />

<br />
My suggestion is use a piece of tin foil, put it on a surface, turn a ceiling fan on high, and just try to move it.  The ceiling fan will move it of course, but try to control where it's blown to, and what not.

			The reason why people start with the psiwheel is because their using basic physics to help them improve their PK skills; it minimizes friction so less energy is needed to move it (that was a duh moment). 
<br />

<br />
So going along with that, try to come up with ways to moves objects that create as less friction as possible. one way to do this is take a string, attach one side to a tennis ball or something of that sort and then attach the other side to the ceiling. Lay under it so you are looking up at it and try to spin it and move it. That may help, but again try to go along the lines of less friction = better possibilities.

			Thanks for the new activity...but what about after that?  When I do finally get to trying to roll an object...wouldn't I be in the same position?

			Try making a small tinfoil pencil (roll it up &amp; tiny bit of tape)=very light with little friction
