			hi this may sound a little weird but ever since i started psionics my hands have developed new lines and the lines are more prominent in my right hand than my left and i think that is due to me being able to draw psi to that hand more than the other hand. my question is does anyone have the same symptoms or any ideas why this is happening? thanks bye

			I asked since &quot;liny&quot; isnt a word, Liney is.
<br />

<br />
This bring me back to the fact of thinking its the lines in my palm, which are the only real lines except the one at your fingers where the phalanges joint. If its palm though, I answered that, but you said I missed the point, what lines are you talking about exactly if not palms. I can see my hand prints if thats what else you mean, like finger print but its all over my hand.
<br />

<br />
Though if its lines in the skin I always have had lines at the top of my hands, they stop near the tips of my finger, some smoother skin right before the nail, other then that a bunch of lines. Though my hands have always been that way, I assumed it was maybe since I dont use lotion on my hands, though odd my arms have no such lines on them and I can visibly see where the lines begin on my hand, which is right at the wrist.

			dude it was a simple question that is very easy to answer i am sorry but your buerocratic ways of answering a simple question is confusing me. i am sorry if i have seemed incompetent but i have this weird stuff going on with my hands and was wondering if anyone else had it too. also liny was in quotes because it was not a real word i just identified for you because you asked. again i am sorry if i have offended you in any way and please if you want to talk about hand reading start another topic on it mainly because i dont know anything about it and was trying to get a number count on how many people have the same hand effect

			I'm trying to figure out what your asking exactly, there are tons of lines all over our hand, I brought up palm reading because there is lines in your palm and they are dominant lines and the most noticible on the hands, I assumed you were trying to link the two together, I dont know how to read any of it, I know of it though. Why do you think I was going over ALL the lines on my hand, for you to pinpoint. Liney is far to vauge for me to pinpoint which lines since there are lines all over our hands.

			oh sorry i was asking if from when you started psionics if your hands palm has changed. for example my hands had only 3-4 lines on them and now my hands have so many lines that I can find new lines every single day. that is it sorry for the misunderstanding.

			What he's asking is, since you started using psi, have your hands, especially the one that you channel more energy through, begun to get more lines on them. Thatisall.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Can't say I can notice any difference in my hands from comparing memories of them. Mostly they've been this way for a long while, but i've had early childhood psionic experiences and may have been psionically active (RVing) subconsciously for a long while before I started actually practicing, possibly the new lines started then I just got used to the current array. I dont notice any new bigger ones, though on my thumb pad (near the base of the thumb) there are a bunch of smaller lines, I never really paid them any mind, but i'll have to keep an eye on my hands now as I progress in psionics.
