			I'm sure you've all heard of those people, who for some reason are always nameless, that when in deadly situations can pick up cars slightly or do other things through an adreneline rush.  What if you used something like this to improve your psionic abilities?  If you wanted to get better at RVing then tell your sub-concious that you're blind.  Make yourself actually believe that you are blind and you'll turn to other ways of seeing.  Or maybe you want to work on PK, then tie your hands behind your back and tell yourself that you need to move (insert object here) from point A to point B or else.  My first time on the psiwheel I told myself that a <span style="font-style: italic">had</span> to move it and what do you know it work within 20ish minutes.  For me, my mind kept telling me &quot;just move that paper with your hand&quot; so I had to take away all the possibilities except PK.  So what do you think about it?

			i think its a good idea you could probably use it to teach a baby tk aswel (i dont mean tie the baby up) i mean show the baby yourself doing tk then put something like a sweet just out of there reach and see if they can do it, if they cant tell them its ok and give them the sweet anyway <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			That's a good idea, johnyo5.  And maybe saying &quot;lie to yourself&quot; isn't the best way to put it.  It's more like tricking your mind or confusing it.  You grow up learning to think with logic so your sub-c wants to move it with your hand.  You have to make it look for other ways to accomplish it's task.  I guess rewards could work too.

			Mike, that is a smart idea, i will try that.

<br />
I have been trying to move a psiwheel, but i cant, maybe it is because my mind knows that i can just move it with my hands.

			That is actually a really good idea to tell people to lie to themselves. I done it before and it worked and I went through some bad times with my family and friends and it seems to &quot;fuel&quot; telekinesis. It's a great idea  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			ya its conditioning your mind to believe something that in the beginnning is a lie. it's like pretending, after a while your mind 'believes' the lie and thats when you begin to see results when conditioning your mind. 
<br />

<br />
So let's say you have been telling yourself that you can PK. Eventually after a while you will be able to do PK. Simple as that. It's convincing yourself that something is true.

			I have recently become more interested in the true power of the mind.  What if collectively our minds have limitless potential?  If a massive group all believe in something then it comes to existence (trying not to get into religion).  Like people who emotionally damage others.  Tell someone they'll never amount to anything and eventually they'll believe it.  I'm going to research psychology and the way the brain works more in the next few weeks/months and start writing down my thoughts more often.  I'll post back periodicly with more senseless bable...
