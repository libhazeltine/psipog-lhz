			Does any get this,
<br />
Like when i'm in school I can move things really without focusing hard.
<br />
like here is an example,Im in algeba 2 and I useally make a top to the psi-wheel and just leave it on the coner of my desk because i know i'm not gonna pay attenionin class.So I'll look at it will move with ease.until
<br />
I start to put all focus on it and it will stop or give me the weakest movement.
<br />
So i just give up on it and it would start back up again.
<br />
(when i mean move I mean slide and spin)
<br />

<br />
does anyone get this and if you do u have any clue what to do to help me
<br />
all i want to to is control it by will not learn math

			It sounds like the air conditioner is messing with it, but you might be stopping it with psi. Try it under a bowl if possible so you know it's you and not the A/C.

Well anyways, I know that when I am in algebra class (not paying attention) I'm not really thinking about anything. Just staring up and counting the dots on the ceiling, you can call it a &quot;trance&quot;. And when you are in trances it is easy to focus on things without really trying. So that could be why it is easy for you to perform this at school. Because when you go home all you can think about is, sports, tv, video games, homework, late homework, later homework, failing English, getting your parents to sign your progress report for English class. Basicly your mind is filled up with useless thoughts you don't need. So try to get in your school mindset at home.

			This used to happen to me. It could be that when your staring at it your looking straight at it. When you &quot;don't pay attention&quot; you turn your head and attention toward the teacher or front of the class room. Your nostrils can in turn blow air at it from that angle. This is the usual answer for me if it happens like you described.

			Yeah, I'm bored out of my mind at school, I just find it easier to do PK, unless I'm asleep.

			Well I am pretty good at the psi-wheel now, ( i can spin it under glass easily ) so here is my 2 cents, assuming it isn't wind...
<br />

<br />
 You're trying too hard, it works better when you don't ( conciously ) try.
<br />

<br />
 This is why when you turn your attention away it works and when you turn your attention back it doesnt.

			I can sense energies fairly well. I have always found the a school or classroom environment has a high degree of &quot;energy&quot;. I cannot really elaborate any further, though I do have some theories as to why this is.
<br />

<br />
There is a fairly large number of people in a school, and they are in a fairly small area, densely packed. these people are, for the most part, using their minds, generating &quot;energy&quot; in the process. This energy is therefore quite abundant in such an environment, and is subject to manipulation by those who know how.
<br />

<br />
I am getting into the quantum realm by sgguesting this, so I'll say no more, since I have very little idea of what I am talking about. But I DO have an idea, so I had to speak my mind.
<br />

<br />
EDIT:
<br />

<br />
And regarding your question as to why it moved less when you focused harder... well, probably because you were concentrating, not focussing. In the UYTA manual, of which I hold not too much credence with (I'll always favor my own ideas regarding psychokinesis' and other such thing over others), the author speak of how focus is the opposite of concentrating, consisting merely of holding the object in your mind, not making any particular effort, besides the barest thought of moving it.
<br />

<br />
I have proven to myself that this seems to be the case, as when I practise PK, maintaining focus proves to be more difficult than the act of hard concentration, and is always, for me anyay, more fruitful.
<br />

<br />
Focussing seems to be akin to the &quot;emptying your mind&quot; style of meditation, but instead of emptying your mind completely, you let the object remain.
