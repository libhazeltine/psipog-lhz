			From my vantage point I have seen few attempts to add wisdom. Others seem more inclined to roll down the hill of attack which is their right; however I must point out the heavy weight that falls on progress. The topic of Inner programming has a humble challenge that if anyone is able to simplify the lesson between conscious classifications and the remaining subconscious differences a great respect will be at hand.

			About your question.
<br />

<br />
Maybe to let some thoughts through, you could continue with your earth shield metaphor and visualize the good thoughts you would like let through as geysers - hot water springs? Water is generally held as life-giving, and therefore it would be generally positive. Plus, geysers only allow for one-directional movement. So it wouldn't let your thoughts out. Or rather, wouldn't let bad thoughts in.
<br />

<br />
It makes sense to me, but let me know if I misunderstood your question.

			Interesting idea september. The geyser would act as a filter for thoughts while the concept fits confidence accordingly. How then would someone relate the visual of rushing water with thinking? Old faithful might have more uses then reliability lessons.

			Well, as you referenced, Old Faithful supposedly goes off on a regular basis. So, like you said, it would boost self-esteem - you <span style="font-style: italic">will</span> be able to filter your thoughts successfully. However, thoughts stream continuously.
<br />

<br />
So perhaps you could imagine the filter as not a geyser, but a fountain? Or maybe a continuously spraying spring. Then envision that you're holding the plug to the fountain, or a giant cork to plug the spring.
<br />

<br />
However, that makes the solution seem so artificial.
<br />
What do you think, an__St? How can one define a naturally occurring solution?

			Well to be honest people say you should separate <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> from the continuous stream. For the most part I don't understand that. Thoughts cause me to react no matter how much I ground. Wonder what would happen if you started labeling the reactions so with practice you could just say &quot;oh that was [insert word] not me&quot;.  However it can't be that easy, what's your take september?

			So maybe one shouldn't bother separating one's own emotions and reactions from all one's surrounding emotions. However, this bothers people.
<br />
But why does it bother people?
<br />

<br />
Surely emotion is only empowering. It is what makes people people, instead of unfeeling beings walking through life, unflinching. It allows for love hate happiness sadness. But knowing other thoughts... that is power, I suppose. So maybe we are simply refusing power on terms of courtesy, when by all means, we should probably know each other's thoughts. However, this process was probably devised (if it was devised) with the thought that people wouldn't be dishonest or keep secrets. So it has been lost...

			That reminds me of a business theory I've been applying to people. What is the most efficient way to get what I want? Not being big headed, or rather telling the person what they need to hear. 
<br />

<br />
September I got a feel from that last post advice should be concealed somehow; meaning some answers aren?t for everyone. Is that the direction you intended?

			Well a self induced tranquilizer slows down everything  <img src="images/smiles/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Moving with a more consistent speed I will address a direct question. Empathic overloads, as mentioned by SheepKing, are a reaction to memories not the memories themselves. Hope I got that right. Now shields, to my knowledge, are used to decrease the power of reactions and in time eliminate them. 
<br />

<br />
Would building your shield over and over be more effective then holding a visual?
