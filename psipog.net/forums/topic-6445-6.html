In fact, it is the other way around. First you think, and then you feel. Emotions do not exist without a thought prior to their manifestation. So it is the mind, the thoughts that make us experience an emotion.

There are still things enlightened people must do to survive in the society we live in.  There is also a self-determined purpose they will pursue because they are manifestations of loving action.  Without fear, prejudice or ego, they will help others in their lives.  There is plenty to do without desire being involved.  You simply don't understand desire-free, loving action because you've so rarely experienced it and so you can't conceive a person's entire existence being comprised of it.

<br />
Enlightenment does not come without emotions.  In fact it comes with bliss far more pleasureable than the relatively minor emotions you currently feel.  Again, the only reason you have such stilted views of enlightenment is because the only way you could life the way enlightened people do (in general, because their lives are extremely varied but they do have common aspects) is a terribly unhappy one.   You've got so many desires that the life of an enlightened person would not satisfy them and so you'd be an emotionally-shutdown wreck, and so you've assumed all enlightened people are just total wrecks who refuse to accept that fact.  The problem is that you're assuming the way they think and feel follows the same mechanism, which it doesn't and thus, they are in fact very happy and emotionally expressive.

			O wait...DUH! It just occured to me.
<br />

<br />
I totaly forgot something. Even if emotions do choose what we do first, our thinking always have that final decision. And that memory of that experience is tranfer into our memory, and of cource that emotional memory is also recorded. Memories can always be review and thought about. Such as thinking about a father you may have hated, and finding some good things about him. In a way our emotions are simply what we have programed by what we have thought of before....we are still in control.
<br />

<br />
Even how we feel is before what we can think. What we think can still control how we feel.

Proof is simple. Imagine something happens to you, someone dies in front of your eyes. If you do not have one single thought about that situation, than you will not experience any emotion regarding that situation. If you do not have thoughts at all, you will not experience any emotion at all. Emotion is a sensation in the body triggered by thoughts. 
<br />

<br />
You said something as following: sometimes we feel even before we can think about it.
<br />

<br />
I can understand why it seems like this is the case, but it isn't. You DID think before the emotion arised, however, these thoughts were very subtle and unconscious so you did not notice them. it were no conscious thoughts that you noticed, but it were automatically generated thoughts. Generated by the conditioned mind that has learned how to react on certain situations. So as I said: proof is simple: if something happens to you, you will think about it. It may be on a conscious level or on a unnoticeable level. But fact is, it were thoughts that created the emotions not the situtaion itself. If it really was the situation itself causing the emotion, than you would also experience an emotion about something that happens to you, even when your thoughts do not notice the situation. Imagine you are thinking intensely about a girl you just met at a party. You are not present at all in your current situation. you are walking home or something like that, thinking about her.. and something happens there that threathens you, or offends you or hurts someone else. It happens right in fron tog you, but you are so caught up in the thoughts about the girl, that there is no possibility for the mind to create thoughts on what just happened in front of your eyes: hence: you experience no emotion concerning that situation.
<br />

<br />
Observe yourself when dealing with situations that seem to trigger anger or otehr emotions. Be alert, be conscious and observe your own mental activities. You will see that emotions comes after the first, quick thoughts that are most of the times unnoticable for our noisy minds.

			What you guys are trying to argue is whether length came first or width came first. Each mental charateristics controls the others and is a product of the others. Perceptions trigger emotions that trigger thoughts that control the emotions and warp the way we perceive things. Sometimes perceptions do trigger thoughts first as MA said but it really is all just one big mess. This topic is about intelligence though and not thought or emotion.

Thought and emotion are such integral parts of intelligence that they have to be examined in our little discussion if we want to cover as much of the topic as we can, which is essential to our understanding of ourselves.

			I think that neither intelligence, emotions, or thought are flawed. In general intelligence is intelligence; the capactiy to learn, think abastractly, and comprehend ideas. An emotion is a psychological response and thoughts are  mental processes. I think the real flaw in humankind is <span style="font-style: italic">free will</span>. Any thoughts on this?

			Niushirra: It is true that once the initial unconscious thoughts are expressed, and the appropriate emotions are felt, then everything just turns into a messed up web of thoughts and emotion.  However, you're only looking BACK on your experiences and seeing that convoluted web and assuming that's all there is, that there's no chronological order in which that web was made, no systematic process behind it.

Fact of the matter is our subconscious minds intercept and filter our sensory data before we ever consciously experience them.  That same filtering process that skews our views of reality determines our emotions to more powerfully support those views it imposes.

This is true but the two halves of the mind are part of the same machine. The conscious mind is the actual entity we label ourselves though. The subconscious connects the machine like body with the creativity of the mind. The conscious receives things in this web but the web is interchangable and no one thing comes first. The point though is that none of it matters. Think about Einstein's work and how he showed time and space were intertwined. Well think of a mental dimension of the universe in the same way. We know that velocity affects time and in some way space. (As you near the speed of light, time slows down for you and your mass becomes greater. Mass being the amount of space the matter in you takes up.) I believe that there is one pure mental &quot;location&quot; for everything in the universe. Just like everything in the universe has a physical location and a temporal location they also have a mental location. This mental location is very simplistic and connects everything we can experience. I believe there is also a phenomenon known as life where a bunch of molecules go through complex interactions that create consciousness and thoughts and emotions and perceptions. This is the physical particles and energy warping the single mental location into a lot of complex mental patterns. That's what we are. Blast me down.

			The thing is, is that humans in essence don't really have free will. 
<br />

<br />
Humans are machines like I said, the brain is you. 
<br />

<br />
At the moment my subconscious precedes my conscious, if I act, I act willfully, will which comes from the subconscious, if I decide, I decide on the logic and notions which come from the subconscious. If I do not act, then I have no will, therefore when I act I act on will. 
<br />

<br />
I am like a child, who thinks he is making big decisions but is really being guided by the hands of a teacher.
<br />

<br />
Myself, I will listen to the logic of my subconscious, I have no reason to think things and to search for things if the subconscious does not give me things to search for and things to think. But in truth who is doing the thinking, because it is not you, who is searching, it is not you. I am acting on thoughts that are acting on me. 
<br />

<br />
It's like the conscious is half-blind and the subconscious produces phenomona. If you think about it, it is like neither exists but they both together cause confusion and pain.
