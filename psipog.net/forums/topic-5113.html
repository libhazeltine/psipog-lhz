			Yesterday i decided i would try to stay awake again, have a lucid dream, maybe an OBE, whatever. I doubted this would happen,as it was only my second day of trying. After a while of lying there relaxed, my body began to stiffen up, pretty normal i guess. Half an hour later, i couldnt feel anything, normal again. 20 Minutes after that, i felt this...warmth come over me, like a wave of heat, i thought this might've been normal, since ive never actually stayed awake that long while relaxed.
<br />

<br />
So I'm sitting there, chanting to myself &quot;I will not fall asleep&quot; and &quot;I will have a lucid dream, and kept my eyes shut. I noticed something amazing, i saw some sort of blue fireworks, then a lime-green colored wave of water going around and around in my head. Thing is, when im lying down i usually have to swallow,otherwise i feel like choking. 
<br />

<br />
As I'm watching the lightshow, im still thinking &quot;I will not fall asleep. I will have a lucid dream&quot; and i somehow appeared on a roller coaster. I was already aware of this, so i decided to wait it out, see what happens.  It rode up, down, left, and right for a while, and at the end it derailed and i went soaring, and then came down, and i felt like i was actually falling. Upon landing,i  felt nothing, which was a bit discouraging. 
<br />

<br />
I then gave up on having a lucid dream at that moment, and decided i should change how im sleeping, so i dont have to swallow so much. I move my body slowly, barely able to feel anything, and prop my head up a bit higher on the pillow. i wanted to remake this Lucid Dream/ Hypnogogic images, or whatever they were again. Sadly, i couldnt, my body just wasnt into it.
<br />

<br />
Question: I'm sure those images were real. I saw them clear as day, but after sitting for an hour i couldnt get my body to fall asleep completely. The only problem was getting my head to fall asleep. Is this normal? Is the head the hardest part to relax?

I think that might be your problem, you have to fall asleep, just not all the way. If you were spending that much time in a hypnagogic image, I would say you were quite close to getting into a dream. If you hadn't of moved, you probably would have made it. Also, concentrating too hard will prevent a dream from coming, you have to relax your mind to a certain extent too.

			Thats my guess, yeah. I've layed in bed for over an hour without even getting to hypnagogic imagry becuase of how hard I was concentrating. Its all a matter of degrees. Finding the right level.
