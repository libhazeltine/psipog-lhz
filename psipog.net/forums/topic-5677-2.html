It's incredibly rude of you to try and dissuade Grintoth in this manner.  To perhaps give you an additional perspective of your statement, I would compare it to a pushy atheist berating a peaceful, religious man about the error of his belief.

I am also losing hope.  I'm losing the hope that a well-mannered, intelligent skeptic can exist on this forum without having to, periodically, be warned by a moderator to keep their abrasive, self-righteousness down to a dull roar.

I've made psi-balls and made psi-wheels spin, but I really think I'm wasting my time here.  It almost seems like when a psi-ball flares, you are simply visualizing the light a little too well.  Do people on here just say that they scared their cat with a psi-ball or made a pencil float to feel better about themselves?  I know I'm about to get a ton of people yelling at me, but I don't see any other explanation for telekinesis.  Every time I post on this site, there's always someone here to ridicule me, tell me I'm doing it wrong, or tell me that I will never understand how to do whatever it is I'm trying to do.  When I make a psi-ball, sure, I can feel it.  It feels warm and strong and everything, but that could easily be my mind creating a visualization for me.  Whenever I mention something like this, everyone says that I will never progress in psionics because of my disbelief in it.  Doesn't everyone have to question it at some point?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

it seems to me like you're just gettin bored. people get like that after a while...they practice for hours and after a while it just gets boring. instead of the like the cool skills..i practice skilsl that ive incorporated into my everyday life...like empathy, telepathy, dmlis. things like that.
