			Hi,
<br />
  Ive been practicing for a while, and I cant move neither.  I read the forums and some techniques, was wondering if there is anything new anyone has come with in the past few weeks that worked for them.
<br />

<br />
 Thanks ahead for the tips.
<br />

			well ive used a few techniques before. one is to just put your hands in whatever way comfortable around the psi wheel(or dont use them at all, doesnt matter really), and dont even concentrate on it. just watch and &quot;observe&quot; it while thinking about nothing else either and you might get a movement after a while.
<br />

<br />
another one i tried is to focus on the psi wheel, and then find a memory of yours, try to find a really strong memory that makes you feel an emotion, it could be anger happiness or whatever. thats worked for me also.

			I have been practicing everyday, about 30-45 mintues, about 2 months.
<br />

<br />
 I tried using my hands, but I dont feel a psi ball.  I read alot. Tried buying a few books on ebay, since Barnes &amp; Nobles dont sell books on Parapsychology anymore. Or at least not by me.
<br />

<br />
I tried not thinking about anything. ( although its difficult )
<br />

<br />
How about telling it to move? In your mind. Would that might help?
<br />

<br />
I know there are no steps on this and everyone is not the same.  Its inspiring to read others experience.
<br />

<br />
 Thanks
<br />

			hmm, you havent seen any movement before? i got my first movement in 2 days, i guess im just faster then average. but just keep at it and try many different techniques until something works for you, it will eventually. dont let anything discourage you. meditating can very much help you think about nothing if youre having no luck. listening to music helps some people too. hope i helped.

ya alot of people use yoga to relax themselves. you should keep doing it. and also once in a while you should take a day off if youre feeling too drained.

 Or...... you can try sleeping with your eyes open. Well if ur not careful you will just kinda fall out your chair and wake back up. Always makes me think about sleeping. I don't think you should ever take anything I say seriously. I'm a newb full of crazy things in my head. Wait, but then wouldn't your subc not be able to think if ur sleeping or what??? But there's a section on dream phenomenononoenen and stuff.

I love the way you spelled &quot;phenomenon&quot;.
<br />
 <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> That isn't meant to be sarcastic, I really do love the way you spelled it.
<br />

<br />
Wouldn't sleeping with your eyes open be kind of hard to do...unless you were sitting in the dark, then you wouldn't really notice...

I had the same problem when I first started, I only got it to wiggle a tiny bit after a month of practice!  
<br />

<br />
My personal suggestion is this:  Take a break from practising PK.  Either stop doing psionics for at least a month, come back to it, and I *mostly* guarantee you will be able to move it...alternatively, you could do other skills for a month.  You be the judge though.
<br />

<br />
Another thing you could do if you dont want to stop:  Put it under glass, and practise that way for, 3-7 days??  Then take it off after that amount of time, and it just might move...cuz the mental block for psychokinesis has been &quot;rearranged&quot; to make it seem impossible under glass, but plausible out of it...just retraining the subc.  Hope this helps.

			Want to make things easier? Make a HUGE psiwheel. Get a sheet of loose leaf notebook paper, and square it up, the holes in it are fine, just leave those. It'll end up being around 6&quot; by 6&quot;, make your psiwheel and find a way to balance it. Maybe on a pen/pencil shoved in a shoe crammed tight with a few socks. You might even have to put that whole set up on a couple books if the wheel is still hanging off and dragging. Forget about the toothpick, just focus on psiwheels. For some reason larger psiwheels are easier to move, even if they move more slowly. Good luck!
