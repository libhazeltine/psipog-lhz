			Hello, I have been trying to OBE for a couple nights but I cant get the vibrations to come. What I do is lay down and try to not move anything. After a while my body starts to feel numb (falling asleep?) but from there nothing happens, what do I have to do next?

			This isn't that easy to learn. This takes a few months to get down more often then not. That is really fast, actually. At any rate, just keep trying, and don't worry, a few days of no results is completely normal.

			I am in the exact same position except i have been trying for almost a year... So far I have learned that laying still every night isn't all you need to do and to keep trying just doesn't help. There's gotta be something more. I have told myself to leave my body over and over. I have not been able to. What else do you have to do besides lay still beacuse I have been doing that for a very long time

			I believe it's not only letting your body completely go to sleep but somewhat your mind also. I am under the impression you musty be <span style="font-style: italic">in between </span>the awake and dream state. Start trying to let your mind slowly drift into the dream state, but make sure you do not go all the way otherwise, you sleep  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  ...that's why it's so hard. You must be able to stay in that &quot;halfway&quot; state of mind without falling completely asleep.

			I have just recently started doing OBE practice. And I seem to run into the same thing. But I do have a lot of experience with Motionless Meditation (found in the Meditation section on this forum) and you basically do the same exact thing...and I have been through some deep stuff but never came out of my body. One of the only things I can never let rest is my tongue. I just don't know where to put it! I tuck it up but it gets very tired. I really need to find a good relaxation for my tongue. 
<br />

<br />
I would like for someone to right a word for word story on OBEs. What I mean by that is, they should right down everything they do, and think of. And then maybe we can replicate those actions. If someone has already written a very detailed OBE experience I would appreciate to be pointed into it's exsistence. I have read the OBE articles on Psipog but that's about it.

Ryan you must stop giving advice on things you do not know. If you've never OBE'd how do you know that's what you should do with your tongue. Yes it seems like the right thing to do but still....you speak so surely about these things yet you haven't even done it yourself...Please stop advising people on things that you <span style="font-style: italic">think</span> is right. Until you know for fact or from experience quit telling people the right or wrong way to do things....sorry if that sounded a little harsh it just makes me sick when inexperienced people make assumptions and spread them as if it to be the truth.

I do not want to PM you, I want to finish the conversation here so others can read it. I never said anyone OBE'd using their tounge, where did that come from?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" /> ...that's fine if that's how you did it but fatman or whatever was asking how he should position it while trying to OBE...If you've never OBE'd either, you do not know forsure that is how to position it....although I do think you are right to simply relax it, <span style="font-style: italic">you </span>are giving advice on something you haven't even done yourself, so how do you <span style="font-style: italic">know</span> that's right..please tell me

Wow your an ass...what the fuck are you talking about...you can't honestly think that I believed you can OBE with your tongue.

			I can't believe it. The more of your past messages I read the more I cannot believe how ignorant you can be. You spout bullshit every other messege you wright. You need to seriously step back and look at what you've written. Almost every &quot;fact&quot; in ALL your posts is based on completely nothing but your own beliefs. Either that or you butcher what the true names, facts or theories really are. I'm done with this thread and arguing with you because based on your past messeges I can see it's a lost cause.(As I'm sure many others who take time to read them will to) Please do us all a favor and find out what the FACTS are before posting....I know this sounds terribly harsh but it's ridiculous I can't even get through 5 of your messeges without seeing some kind of mistake. The brain and what part controls your dreams, the &quot;quantam theory&quot;, you controlling moths.....Don't expect a rebuddle from me if you comment on this messege because there won't be one...I'm done arguing with some kid who misconstrues almost EVERYTHING scientific he mentions.
<br />

<br />
P.S sorry if that very harsh but I hate people making errors when quoting scientific facts/research

			(c'mon ppl, lets not fight ;D)
<br />

<br />

<br />
I've been practicing for just over two months now and as of the past week or so I'm getting the vibes just about everytime I try, so maybe I can shed some light.
<br />

<br />
-How I get the Vibes-
<br />

<br />
 I suppose the best place to start is from the beginning (duh)....So Ill start from there. (don't worry ill get to the vibes)
<br />

<br />
The first thing you need to keep in mind to make your practices productive is to keep your body still without fighting your body. I figured out that the whole time I thought i had been relaxed I had actually been really tence. Your body moves and jerks naturally so don't fight it, just let your body do what its gonna do (Im sorry if this is somewhat vague).
<br />

<br />
Some people suggest visualization, montras(sp?), and many other techniques to put your body to sleep. But I found, for me at least, the best way to put your body to sleep is to...well go to sleep. Usually I let my mind wander off long enough to start cooking up a dream, then once ive notice i let my mind wander (it sounds wierd, but its true) I let my self snap back to conscienceness. At this point my body is asleep, and I should be midway between sleep and awake. But how do I know if its time for the vibes? Well I have two ways of knowing. Usually, I just know when they're about to come. But that dosn't help you guys out, does it? Well alright, here's the other. When I first lie down I see swirling colors and whatnot (afterimages, etc.). But when when im in the right state of for the vibes everything on the back of my eyelids is very still (aka your mind). So you should see blackness as opposed to anything else.
<br />

<br />
Ok, now its Vibe time! Now this next bit is hard to explain, but Ill try my best. Focus your eyes so that the blackness is a 3d plain (you'll know what i mean when you get there) now let loose of all muslce control and wait, but make sure you keep everything realxed. Since your semi-conscience your mind'll wanna keep the muscles &quot;primed&quot; for use. Don't let it, just relaaaaax. To keep your mind clear, preoccupy it by controling your breathing. And when you do this for long enough youll feel your body stiffen and then the vibes will just come. But when they do, DON'T get exicted. Just say to yourself &quot;Oh, it's the vibes. That's nice.&quot; (not outloud btw). And continue to control your breathing.
<br />

<br />
Sorry for such a long post, but it seems that this is a common problem that I more recently surmounted then alot of the more experianced members, so by hammering out all the details I more readily remember would be an assest. If there's anything you need me to explain better, please pm me.
<br />

<br />
Good Luck
