			This has been my latest point of thought. While it would be both arrogant and also by my knowledge of who's where currently innaccurate to say we have all the best minds here we have some good people. There are resources here that could be put to use. Since a lot of us are very busy, meetings would not work but semi-private forums could allow people researching/working in a particular field to exchange information and discuss ideas. It is likely that we could accomplish at least some small strides with a system like this, and it wouldn't hurt to much to try it out. To preserve both the integrity of who's inputing ideas and possibly safety issues depending on what level of stuff is being talked about it would probably be best to have this on an invite or request basis, which is the only negative point. The permission giving could be more subsidized though to take the potential strain off the moderators, at least in some of the less intensive or dangerous areas.
<br />

<br />
I am interested to see what other's thoughts are on this.

			A special forum for friends or workers? I like it. However, this would increase the job of psipog moderation by like 20x. That is if it would be moderated at all. Also, the bandwith consumption would also increase drastically. However, I do see the positive side for it. It is a good idea. However, for now it has to be in PM's.

			Easy solution, get your own forum.  Lazier solution: MSN group.

			What's stopping people from exchanging ideas now?  The problem I find isn't that we don't have a suitable mechanism for them - the problem is that no one actually does intelligent research (minus a few people).  What studies do you want done?  Do them.

			Right now I have no idea who might be working in what as with probably a lot of other people in this forum, that and research is a lot less daunting if you can divy up the work on it, if its split between 10 different people at least some of the people could still be useful without extensive time put into it, so if someone sees an area where people are already working they might be less reluctant to spend some time pitching in. The semi-private nature is also a hand too since for example the stuff I do in the interests of tring to manage and generate energy better could be very dangerous if an unexperienced person tried to do it, so I can't just throw it out there for all to see.

			Hmmm.... good point.... but even with such a forum, or mechanism to post these things, what makes you think all these people would rush to post all their research. For example, I don't share my research until I have completed it, for fear of someone taking my idea (I don't mind if my idea is used after I have finished). If you are looking to do studies though.... It might be good to have a volunteer forum, and people can be given tasks to do by the experimenter. That still could be done over chat, or PMs though. And, if what you put out there could be put to bad use, maybe you need to put a label on the title- ADVANCED Use and own Risk... I really don't see whay it necesitates a new forum.
