			I mostly have attempted to avoid fighting, but there was one time which it was unavoidable.  I was at a party, messin around with this other guy (who APPARENTLY has some psychological issues... or hes just an asshole...) he was kicken this chick spinning on the ground so i called him a lameass...
<br />

<br />
anyway
<br />

<br />
he got all pissy nd started askin if i wanted to fight, naturally, i didnt want to, because i know this guy carries a knife.
<br />

<br />
he threw the first blow- i let him so i didnt get hit by the cops-but after that i took him out with a hip throw to arm bar... so the pressure points were unneeded...
<br />

<br />
ended up only severly hyperextending his arm... so his wailing on the ground was unneeded

			Hi,
<br />
I'm new to this Forum and this thread caught my eye.
<br />
It is really cool to hear about all the different people doing different martial arts and merging them with Psi.
<br />
I myself do Bei Shaolin Chuan a.k.a. Northern Shaolin Kung Fu.
<br />

<br />
Do any of you know what Chi Gung is?
<br />

<br />
If so...do you think that is a good way to meditate?
<br />

<br />
oh, and good luck finding someone to teach you Ninjitsu, you do know that is the art of assassination...I think you mean Jujitsu. Many people do. Ninjitsu is hardly practiced anymore, do to the fact it was created out of neccesity...and now that neccesity is gone.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for being!
<br />

			Yo i got three books of chi kung or gung but i found it so boring, to stand for 20mins, holding a massive chi ball lol, but i think its good, well its ancient chinease and anything about psi which is from  india or china should work. and i think they teach ninjitsu in uk but i dnt think its the proper assination type.

			The sternum is usually said to be the place where psi is produced around here I believe.... 
<br />
I don't know why he said that. It's probably just psi at its most basic. He kind of takes it for granted that you know the reasoning behind it.

			Hey, I've been looking at psipog for a couple of months, but I've never gotten very many results with psi. I just wanted to post that traditional nin-jutsu is hard to find outside of Japan if you're looking for a reliable teacher. There are a few derivatives, that still provide traditional nin-jutsu, but a little bit of controversy surrounds which one is the closest to traditional.
<br />

<br />
I myself practice To-shin-do which is a modern form of nin-jutsu taught here in the U.S. It is lead by Stephen K. Hayes who trained under Masaaki Hatsumi. If you're interested check out <a href="http://www.toshindo.co.uk" target="_blank">www.toshindo.co.uk</a> for a few new UK To-Shin-Do centers.
<br />

<br />
Although I haven't been successful at psi, I would assume that it would help keep the emotional aspect of the fight under control. It could definitely help you ease someone's anger and help them to not start up a fight.
<br />

<br />
This is all theoretical so don't take my word for it.

I do Tai Chi while practising psi, and the way I encorporate psi into my forms is making psi balls around my hands when moving, and on the end of a chain I push them forward (something to the effect of a very weak force push from star wars). It works very well if you can attain the focus to do both simultaneously.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

 You dont have to. Taiji is designed so that energy (I beleive its Qi but if  you thinks its all one then yah psi) flows and maximizes preformance.
