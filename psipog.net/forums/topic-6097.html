			today i cut my hand realy deep with a can and it hurt, so i remebered that somone mencioned that u can heal urself with psi so i &quot;tried&quot; a couple of times to make them so they would heal my hand and a couple of hours later it didn't hurt and the tisue of my cut was 80% healed.was that the doing of the psi to heal it faster or was it just my body healing it fast? <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
EDIT
<br />

<br />
now like 6 hours later the blood of the scab like completly covers the remains of the cut and is a cut no more!
<br />
was it psi healing it? because it takes a couple of days and medicated bandaids to heal the even slightest wound for me.

			Psi can definately be used for healing, yes. I'm studing a bit into it myself. I can heal minor headaches or any sort of random aching on myself, and was able to help with someone else's headache several thousand miles away (on IRC). I haven't tried to heal any cuts of mine yet, so I don't know how that'll work out.

			u all know how scabbing works rite? platelets and RBCs clotting, blah blah blah....
<br />

<br />
so in theory, one could use tk to clot these shits up at a faster rate, thus sealing the injury <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			or it might scab faster if your having an adrenaline rush.. right?  I'm sure it will scab at all different speeds.  Try to prevent a bruise or making a bruise go away, that's not to bad.

			having an adrenaline rush would actually hinder clotting.....
<br />

<br />
that hormone prevents clotting acually, similar to mozzie's saliva
