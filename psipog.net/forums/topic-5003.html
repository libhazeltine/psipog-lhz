			Did your skills in the psionic field ever made you think you were 'chosen'. Be it for what ever reason, did you think you were 'special' and therefore 'better then others'.
<br />

<br />
 Did you think you were an individual who's chosen by something higher to come and bring a new light to this world or did you make sure to stay grounded (pun intended) and keep a sceptic eye on each and every step you make along this road called Psi.
<br />

<br />
In short; How firmly did you keep your feet on the ground?
<br />

<br />

<br />
As for me; I noticed that I'm no longer the fluff I was in the beginning. When I just started out years ago I was certain I was special and therefore better then others. But now I know that I'm just walking down the same path as everyone else, I just choose to step on some different tiles then others. 
<br />

<br />
So yeah, I say that psi helped me become a better individual myself, but in no way more deserving then any other human being.

			meh... every kid goes through it when they start practicing.
<br />
it's when it becomes part of their actual routine and carries on past &quot;a phase&quot; that it gets bad.
<br />

<br />
heck! i can remember when i first started out that i thought there was going to be some kind of mass revolution with psions taking over the world.
<br />

<br />
fortunatley for me, Psipog has kept me sane ;P

I've never, ever seen DBZ. I generally don't watch any TV. So when I was very new to psionics, I fell for the fluff sites. Yes, <span style="font-style: italic">those</span> fluff sites. The ones that you could stuff a few pillows with and have the best sleep ever. 
<br />

<br />
Wow. Thank goodness for Psipog, intelligent conversation, and most of all, the ability to grow and mature!
<br />

<br />
(Doesn't mean I don't wonder what it would be -like- if there were a big psionic revolution. But I don't hold much faith in anythign like that ever happening, let alone soon.)

			the revolution is happening... but not in the way most people think... slowly, ever so slowly, spirituality will be restored to the world.  It is happening and, though it doesn't include energyballs blowing up tanks or telepathic domination of the senate, we are all a part of bringing about The Awakening of the earth and an eventual return to awareness of The Source where the real battle will be revealed (for more information you can send me a personal message.  I'm forbidden by the admins from elaborating further on the public forums)
