			This is sweet, there's a flouresant lamp by the computer that i noticed that was on, I pushed the button to turn it off, a second later it came back on, i pushed the button again and watched the bulb, almost like a short right at the connection point where the juice flows into the bulb flickers couple times and darn thing is on again. Now if I can just figgure out how to control it so i don't need to push the button to turn it off .... Will keep experimenting on this <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			sounds fun if you master it.  like you could turn off the lights in a classroom, throw something at the teacher, then turn them back on. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> it would annoy the teacher and freak everyone out.

			Now that would be useful in my ICT lessons, since everyone keeps turning off my computer with unsaved work on it. (Bastards). I could get them back...haha! Even better, turn off someones CD player/iPod. hehe. Unless it's only with lamps. I think i'm diggin too deep...
<br />

<br />
(edit) It could be the lamp...try it with some other lamp.

			<span style="color: darkred">That's amazing, but I agree with psi_manipulator. I think that you should test it out on another lamp, just so you'd be sure that it's you and not faulty wiring in the lamp by your computer.</span>

			What you describe isn't the result of general electrical PK but rather just disturbances caused by the energy your body eminates.  The interaction between fluorescent lights and your energy field is what causes it to flicker, turn off, turn on, etc. so you won't find this ability transfers over to turning on other devices.  It is certainly fun though, and works on all fluorescent bulbs like those in houses, schools, offices and streetlights (thankfully not traffic lights though!).  It's become a frequent occurrence for me to walk down a street at night and have lights systematically dim as I approach then brighten again as I become far enough away.

			What's strange is, one night, while I was preparing to practice Telekinesis, I was charging myself with energy.
<br />

<br />
Ironically, the computer monitor (which had been turned off) turned on for an instant, then turned off.
<br />

<br />
I didn't think it was me. I thought it was merely some strange fluke.  But as I kept practising Telekinesis, the computer monitor suddenly flipped all it's lights on and turned all the way on.   I was apalled...

			hehe, you folks wanted my testing on other lamps. Got around to testing it today, some lamps i can do it with others i can't. Also lightswitches when they are in half position not fully on or fully off i can turn on or off depending on my mood :O still draining but can feel that i'm getting stronger at this.

			Well a new update, gah I wish my digital camera worked, but I'm one of these people who have to wear hearing aids due to being born with a hearing loss. Anyhow, I had a screw nearby my hearing aid battery container and there is some major magnetic attraction there. Using the head of the screw I can magnetize it enough to hold up the battery container WOWIE!! Need to find a cam or something that nature to show you :S
