			So I was reading <span style="font-style: italic">Psychic Discoveries</span> by Ostrander &amp; Schroeder (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1569247501/sr=8-1/qid=1144856936/ref=sr_1_1/002-3510709-1103228?%5Fencoding=UTF8" target="_blank" class="postlink">click here</a>), and they have a chapter on &quot;Pyramid Power&quot;.  They talk about how the mummies in egypt were dehydrated and how it confused scientists... then talked about how one guy thought the shape of the pyramid, the location of the body, and the alignment of the pyramids played an important role in the mummification process (that was unknown to modern science).
<br />

<br />
To make a long story short, he devised this experiment that &quot;proved&quot; the power of pyramids.  The idea is to take a small cardboard pyramid, dull some razor blades, then stick them inside the pyramid at the center, and the razor blade is suppose to sharpen itself.
<br />

<br />
Sounds kinda crazy... so I did a search on the internet, but didn't really pull up any SOLID information.  Mostly just people either saying, &quot;that's bullshit&quot; or &quot;that's awesome&quot; without any evidence to back up either opinion.  So I decided to take the book authors up on their offer, and conduct my own experiment...
<br />

<br />
Using the dimensions they gave in the book, I constructed a proportional pyramid out of cardboard.  I got some gillette razor blades from the store, and am using three of them to compare for the future.  The dimensions of each side piece are 10.3cm on the sides, and 10.9cm as the base.  The height of the side piece is 8.75cm (math is good).  Using four of the side pieces and taping them together makes a pyramid with an elevation of 6.85cm.
<br />

<br />
[image removed -- inside zip file below]
<br />

<br />
I have three blades.  One I won't touch (labelled &quot;New&quot;).  Another I will only dull (labelled &quot;Dull&quot;), and the third I will dull and put it in the pyramid (labelled &quot;Pyramid&quot;).  I've finished setting it up, and all I need to do is dull the blades (I'm thinking I'll rub them on the concrete sidewalk outside), and then place the appropriate blade in the pyramid.
<br />

<br />
Here are pictures of everything: <a href="../pyramid-2006.zip">pyramid-2006.zip</a>
<br />

<br />
So why is this a big deal?  For one, I'm just a curious guy, and it's giving me something to do <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  Two, anyone notice how similar a pyramid and a psiwheel is?  If I get results with this experiment, it might mean ... SOMETHING <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.  It's a start <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
Tell me what you think!
<br />

			What the hell? This couldn't work, it just dosen't make sense. If it works I could only think of one possible explanation. You were thinking about the razor getting sharper and that the pyramid makes it sharper so you unintentionally used psi to sharpen it. I think the pyramid might have nothing to do with it. If it actually does work and it dosen't work without the pyramid then the pyramid could be a psionic amplifier. I really don't see how this could work without psi though. Also, how are you testing sharpness?

			I'm using visual inspection to see how sharp they look.  I'm also thinking about cutting paper to compare as well... but I'm not sure how well it will work.  I'm messing with it right now, I'll try some things out.

			Visual inspection will only go so far. I would suggest trying to scratch them on something like a soft rock. If you use almost the same amount of force you should get some results you can clearly see on the rock. Only lightly scratching the rock should work. Cutting paper's a good idea too.

			Well, I just wanted to know how much it changed <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I don't know how else you could 'track' the changes - it'd be pretty hard, and definitely..um, what's the word...something like opinion.
<br />

<br />

Because there are no numbers for it, it becomes a qualitative (right word?) assessment rather than a numerical one...

			This was on mythbusters and they said it was busted.

so unless it is done with unintentional psi,

or you just dont trust mythbusters and beleive that they are a part of a big conspiracy ring trying to supress us through entertainment and science

			And I thought I was the only person who got that book <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
I've thought about doing the experiment time and again... But, never managed to pull it togethor.
<br />

<br />
Maybe I should run it too, and I have lots of hair to dull razors on. *ponders*
<br />

<br />
----
<br />

<br />
As a second thought IF indeed the razor is becoming as sharp as the first use... Why not move on to test out if you even need the pyramid at all? We'll see if it's the pyramid doing it, or if it's your mind. Maybe I'll just wait to see what you get and then prove you wrong/right. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			A few years ago I did a report on something to do with Egypt and stuff and I had to build a pyramid and things. I learned that pyramids are said to have magical powers that can do certain things. I never heard about them sharpening blades or anything but doing other stuff instead. One of the things was purifying water or something. Maybe I'll look into it.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: I did some researching, but not much. I was thinking though...maybe it isn't just the pyramid. It could be tons of factors that activate the pyramids magical powers or something. Something the egyptions might of known. Like the sun, maybe the sun had to be facing a certain direction for the pyramid to use it's power. Maybe the pyramid has to be a certain size. Something...

If the sharpening doesn't work try a piece of apple inside and outside and see what rots first.

			There's alot of already known scientific things as to why an apple would rot slower within the pyramid, sorry.

			Looks nice, Peebrain! I'd like to suggest you all to visit this interesting link: a 44m high (!) pyramid near Moscow, designed by Alexander Golod engineer. <a href="http://www.pyramids.ru/english.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">Here it is.</a>

			Well, it's been a week.
<br />

<br />
Judging from visual inspection, the blade doesn't look any different than what I took pictures of last week.  But it's hard to tell.  I'm going to take pictures tomorrow morning, so that I have the same lighting as I had with the original pictures (assuming it's sunny out tomorrow <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />).
<br />

<br />
Since I already have the pyramid set up, I would like to try the rotting-fruit idea.  I'll take an apple from the chow hall, and cut some chunks out of it.  One chunk I'll put in the pyramid, another chunk I'll put under plastic cup next to the pyramid.  This way they both get the same amount of light.
<br />

<br />
I'll post pictures tomorrow morning.
<br />

<br />
One thing I learned about the razor experiment is that it's hard to test for a razors sharpness.  I might have damaged the razors too much for it to work as well - the book talks about sharpening a slightly dulled razor.  But my razors were messed up pretty bad on the rock I scraped them against <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  I might have to try the razor experiment again without ruining the razors as much, after this fruit one.
<br />
