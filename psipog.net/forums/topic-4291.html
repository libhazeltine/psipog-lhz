			If someone THINKS in another language and they don't speak English (born in France and never learned English),  would it be impossible to use telepathy with them?  Or are thoughts a universal language and languages are just the way we interpret them?

			From my experience, while people think in their native languages (most usually - though it should be noted that many people who are &quot;good&quot; at &quot;languages&quot; tend to think in the language their speaking), the majority of people think in a kind of &quot;concept-thought&quot; that is most easily received telepathically. This is the primary reason &quot;tell me what I'm thinking&quot; can become problematic - the words don't come so easily as the ideas.
<br />

<br />
Cross-lingual telepathy is quite possible, but requires reliance on this kind of concept-thought rather than the words themselves. However, telepathy seems to also aid in translation processes, as it's easier to derive the original speaker's meaning to avoid errors in interpretation.

What you're saying is that when overcoming the language barrier, we must use things like sound and picture to stimulate the other person, instead of using conventional words.

			More or less, yes. Though concept thought tends to exist without even images. It's more...abstract even than a platonic image.

			I've done telepathy games with a Finnish person, and he was sending in Finnish, but I recieved perfectly fine in English. I've also sent in French to this same person and it still worked out fine. It only seems that concepts are the only thing that matter in thoughts, not native langauges.

			My happy-christian friend know a guy missionaring down somewhere in Africa, somewhere with a very native language, and the preacher spreads his cause using tonguelanguage given through his holy spirit or something like that, and he can actually communicate through this to find out in his head what the african ppl are talking about, but he says afterwards &quot;I have no clue what I'm saying, I just reply and they understand me&quot;.

While animal telepathy is certainly possible (indeed, some animals are quite telepathically active) it is not the &quot;end of story.&quot; The fact is (and I say this in direct opposition to many current linguistic theorists) that many animals have the capacity for language. Corvids and dolphins are good examples. I wrote a paper for a Language Development class arguing that the definition of language as a distinctly human feature is not sound, because crows have been demonstrated to have language.
<br />

<br />
Indeed, ultimately part of language the use of symbolism to represent our abstract conceptualizations of the world. We are not the sole animals to do this - though our use of symbolism is somewhat unique (the verdict is still out on whether or not dolphins or corvids are actually expressing abstract concepts - telepathically, I would say that they are).

			Of course not. The mind does not work in words of human language, in fact, it does not work in words at all. The exact thing words are translated by your brain is unknown.

			Good question. I have absolutely no idea, but hey! You'd probably have to resort to sending pictures and things, instead of words. I certainly think in English, but I don't know... maybe on another level of thinking there is a universal language.
<br />
Or you could just learn French.
<br />
You know, if everyone practiced telepathy and &quot;talked&quot; with pictures then we'd never have to take languages at school? EVERYONE, GET YOUR TELEPATHY ON!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
