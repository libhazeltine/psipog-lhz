			Alright, I've been trying to induce an obe since last July on and off (more on except for the past month). But it seems that I can't seem to be in the mood to do it while my house is quiet. I'll be lying there as the vibrations start, doing everything like a good astral projector (so to speak) when....*DOOR SLAM* &quot;Where in God's name is my drink!&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Kinda makes it difficult to remain relaxed and empty minded XD.
<br />

<br />
I've read in several sites that playing some music as white noise to drown out whatever is happening around you could work, but it's not as good as a quiet environment. I've experimented with this along with a blindfold a couple of times and i remember seeing a fuzzy version of my room. (i wouldn't call it an obe, but it was something.)
<br />

<br />
So here's my question (sorry for ranting); have any of you had any sucess with music playing? If so, does it stop when you leave your body, or does it continue to play inside your mind?
<br />

<br />
Any answers would be appreciated
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your time,
<br />

			I wouldn't play music. I've had some small success with binaural beat generators, but if I play it loud enough through headphones to drown out external noise, I get a headache after ~15 minutes.
<br />

<br />
I've had external noise to deal with nearly the entire time I've practiced OBEs. What I've done is a little bit of self-programming. I've programmed myself to &quot;sink&quot; deeper into trance whenever I hear an external noise. It took a while for me to master it, but creating and conditioning the reflex was worth it.
<br />

<br />
I originally started this at home, where I had my own room and the noises I had to deal with were random creaks coming from the house, or cars driving by outside, stuff like that. I'm at college now, with a roommate who snores. The self-conditioning work so well that, the past couple nights when I've had the room to myself and no snoring roommate, I actually had a little bit of trouble reaching the trance state!
<br />

<br />
So, that's what I reccomend. Condition yourself to go deeper into trance whenever you hear an external noise.

			Thanks alot. I;ve been working on doing just that too I was just wondering if I could use music as at least a back up. I'll just keep working with controlling mental states. It takes a bit longer but as you said, well worth it.
<br />

Thanks again,
