I think it may be a real flared one, but he must've practiced making a flared one like, every single day for months, heh. It might just be good video editing, though. I sent a message to the maker of the video to get some details.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, it'll probably help people with visualizations, and it's just a cool video, and looks like good editing.

			Yeah, it does seem like rubbish, however... It doesn't take any more energy to make a psiball flared ; It's all about the programming.

			never heard that one before. might be possible.  i read that u have to make it spinn super fast and then light will erupt out of it. nut it only lasts a couple seconds.  ask that guys method for his success if it was even real.

even if flared (wadeva that means anyway), the psi is only amplified so that non-sensitive people can &quot;see&quot; the psi

			How do you know? I've heard about many instances where it was easier to see the flared psi-ball in darkness. The theory behind this being that the dense energy begins to create photons, the essence of physical light. Have you ever taken a picture of a flared psi-ball? I bet you haven't even seen one. So, I ask once more. How do you know? I'm not saying that I know, but you are saying that you know, based on nothing at all. I am purely speculating, but it is speculation based on the experiences of others who have been successful in flaring.

			great point.... i HAVE NOT flared before..... but i think i know the tech, saw many different ones lately....
<br />

<br />
but i DO know wad psi is.... it is a different energy form that is not on the physical plane..... the &quot;dimension&quot; so to speak, where matter, gluons, photons, gravitions, weak force particles exist....
<br />

<br />
psi falls under a different plane, one that i do not want to name as there are many opposing theories on which plane does psi fall in (but definately not the physical plane)
<br />

<br />
from wad i know (might be very little, and thus wrong), flaring is the &quot;explosion&quot; of a concentrated psiball.... as in a very dense one....
<br />

<br />
this just suddenly release a large amount of psi, at a very high rate.... thus, a person not very sensitive to psi would be able to percieve it at a visual scale...... 
<br />

<br />
now, to why i do not flare.....    i can see psi, auric vision, as some call it..... so if i can see it already, i do not need to flare it to make it visible, rite?

			You still don't know any of that for a fact, except for the auric vision thing. Again, STOP stating things as 'fact' without backing yourself up with real information.
<br />

<br />
We don't know enough about psi to know what, or where, it is. We just know it is there, and we can program it. Flaring is simply the creation of photons through practice and focused intent, which is programming.

What do you mean by non-sensitive can you define it? do you mean only some people can see psi balls or only some people can actully do it? Because to my knowledge everyone can do it, its just a part of you.

			lol I can't believe how much know-it-alls are on this site. (I too have been guilty of this  <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" /> ) I would also love to hear how theorist &quot;knows&quot; all these things.

I mean if you understand you know very little, as we ALL do, why would you continue to spout &quot;facts&quot;? Your name is theorist, yet it seems you don't even understand what it means. A theory (which is EXACTLY what you posted), is only that. <span style="font-style: italic">A theory, not fact</span>.
<br />

<br />
Don't get too worked up over this everyone, I noticed theorist likes to preach about <span style="font-style: italic">his facts </span>a lot. Sometimes he speaks as if he's been a guru for years and sometimes the comments he makes, make him appear obviously inexperienced. C'mon theorist you didn't know the difference between flaring and clairvoyance  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> ..I'm not trying to cut you down as I'm sure it seems, I'm just getting bored of reading <span style="font-style: italic">your facts</span>. Sorry for the insults in advance  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
