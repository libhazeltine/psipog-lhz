			I was just wondering:The matrix may be real in some sense....I was reading an article on how the world or our &quot;reality&quot; may be an illusion created by some higher being...Scientist noticed that how could the earth be just close enough ti the sun to get warmth and just far enough to not freeze over and thay said that they noticed a spike in some graph tests that they do in space and for some reason the time on earth stood still for exactly 6 seconds.They said that the &quot;higher beings&quot; might have lost attention for a split second and almost lost control of our &quot;reality&quot;...This leads to the there is no spoon question...Tk may be easier if we believed this...Just a theory...Sorry for the long post....What do you guys think?

			Matrix effect?
<br />

<br />
Well if you meant like the movie matrix then...No.
<br />

<br />
There are ways to speed or slow perception and with decades of training you can move faster then other people, but not matrix fast, the shaolin monks are an example, they have trained their body and minds to move at faster speeds then us, it is how they can punch at nearly three times our speed of a normal fast punch, or so this is what I read on the forum a while ago.
<br />

<br />
At any rate, no I do beleive it is still a major impossibility to be fast enough to dodge bullets. Further more I dont particuarily believe in Intelligent Design nor do I in most religions, now please dont spark a religious conversation off this...please. Also &quot;higher beings&quot; I really find that farfetched.
<br />

<br />
At any rate your looking to far into a movie, even if by the extreme offchance that most of all the acclaimed scientists in the world are wrong and this is a 'simulation' do not count on doing anything like in the matrix or being &quot;the one&quot;.

			The article itself can pose no real solid proof other then speculation of thoughts. The only real truth and proof that can be given is if someone broke this &quot;matrix&quot; and somehow &quot;rejacked&quot; back into it and then relayed us the information, untill then it is just a theory, like many others around the world. Sometimes people get so caught up into the questions that have perplexed man they cling to the theories that can't be proven in our times, questions such as &quot;what is the meaning of life&quot;, &quot;why are we here&quot;, &quot;what is REAL, what is REALITY?&quot;. To me this seems like another attempt to speculate the worlds great questions, but again, no real proof can be given short of the impossible, or what seems impossible by modern standards/thoughts.

			The logical meaning of life and why we are here? To propagate our species and keep the human race alive.
<br />

<br />
The meaning people seek beyond the cold and obvious fact, well if I knew that I would be writting books on it. Life has its own meaning to every person, each person will know their meaning and why they are here in due time, no one can tell you what it is, for it is different for everyone. It is something we all have to experience and learn for ourself, something that I think can never be told.
<br />

<br />
Ofcourse this is pure speculation on my part, I have yet to understand the why's, but rather am content with myself being here. I do not need to seek our a purpose of life and meaning to enjoy my life, but I do philosophize it for fun from time to time.

			If that's true how did we be into existance? Any being like you say looses track or gets distracted at all is not able to make the universe. There is an explanation for the 6 second stall but we have not found it yet. Maybe it's a sign. But the most unlikely reason is that the being &quot;got distracted.&quot; I'm sure the being would know its limits.

Back to the topic, I don't think this is an illusion. Illusions can feel very real, but I don't think a world with such pain and death and etc. can be an illusion.
