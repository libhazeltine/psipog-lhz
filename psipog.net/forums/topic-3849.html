			Alright, so last night, I fell asleep in my bed right?  Funny thing is, I woke up at 3:30 a.m. with a telephone in my hand, but I was not in my bed.  I was on my couch in my living room.  I do not remember anything with a vivid extent, but I do remember picking up the phone and hearing the &quot;clicking&quot; noise when you pick it off of the charger.  Is there a reason as to why I suddenly sleep walked?  And why the phone? 
<br />

<br />
Also, I have always been waking up at the exact same minute according to my clock.  Always 6:12 a.m.  no matter if I fall asleep at 10 the night before, or right up to the minute before 6:12, I always seem to awaken at that time.  What is wrong with me!!?!?!?

			Who says there's anything wrong with you?
<br />

<br />
usually people sleepwalk because of something traumatic happening to them or being under increased amounts of stress. the fact that you picked up your phone was probably irrelevant because you were probably just enacting a normal day (or close enough)
<br />

<br />
as for the waking up at the exact same time every day, it's quite clear that you have trained your subconscious into waking you up at the same time each day. i do the same thing, as my alarm is less than perfect <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

hope that helps. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			my girlfriend does that, once we had a 3 hour chat, the conclusion of which was, she suddenly said &quot;morning max&quot;, and i was like yea, but she'd been sleeping while id been talking to her, she couldnt even remember talking to me, or sitting up and getting a drink, theres also these people who have weight problems because they fall asleep, then like 5-10 mins later, they go and get a full blown meal, while theyre still asleep, im sure youre just sleepwalking, happens to many, many people

<br />
maybe you should write all thoughts about things related to your night dreamwalking.
<br />
telephone.. chair.. and other things in that time they begin to hapen to you
