			I've been wondering for a while, how would you get to the &quot;astral plane&quot;? I dont know if theres any articles on it because i only checked for a few seconds, but i would like to know how to go to the astral plane. If it really calms you down as ive heard, id love to go there, because i just lost a friend.

			The Astral Plain has no articles here due to the fact that it is usually highly tethered to religious talks, I am guessing. Astral Projection is practiced though, from what i've read it seems to be in near the same way you achieve an OBE, but im still not so very clear on the difference in how to go from one to another, though I do understand the difference between the Astral, 'Ether', and OoBE enviorments.
<br />

<br />
Sorry I can't be of more help, try running a search via Yahoo or Google if no one else has a site or technique on it.

<br />
 yeah if you want to calm your self you can <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  sorry for you friend though  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Heres where you can find an article on what your looking for Aye:
<br />
1. Go to psipogs &quot;links&quot; page
<br />
2. Click on the &quot;active psy&quot; link
<br />
3. click on the &quot;playful psyhic&quot; link 
<br />
4. Under advanced skills click on &quot;astral projection&quot;
<br />
OR just go here <a href="../activepsy/book4.html" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/activepsy/book4.html#_Toc472931498</a>
<br />

<br />
The site explains that AP is another form of RVing except you just dont go to a physical place, you go to an astral one. I haven't done this for like a year and am going to start messing with it some more and see what happens. 
<br />

<br />
Shadow, it also says that AP is very similar to OBE enviornments you should read the article too. As for the &quot;ether&quot; realm/enviornment, I have never heard of such a thing...
<br />
PS.Im pretty sure that active psy is a good site (the article on magick just says that its out there and doesnt tell how to do it so dont think the sites fluffy cause of that...) I also made my first psiball there and it flared automaticlly  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Astral projection is not religious. All psyhic techniques have religious conatacious here at psipog we strip them of that.  We can logically talk about astral projection without including religion.   
<br />

<br />
Besides the standard guide here I suggest that you use binary beats or some form mental hypnosis or trance work to accend to the astral plane.

			&quot;ether&quot; I'm sure is referring to the &quot;etheric&quot; plane...
<br />

<br />
From what I've heard, the etheric plane is the physical plane's mirror, and the one we usually visit in an OBE. Everything from the physical plane has a real-time duplicate in the etheric.
<br />

<br />
The astral is one step above that, and isn't directly connected to the physical, so it doesn't directly mimic the physical.
<br />

<br />
I haven't achieved an obe myself yet, so I can't confirm 100%, but this is the common theme.

			The astral is certainly more distantly related to the physical world, but the effects of certain beings in the astral can have huge effects in the physical world regardless.  I would NEVER call the astral calming.  It's the antithesis of calming, swarming with astral entities (some mischieveous, some powerful, and some just plain evil).  The astral however does not have the same physical restrictions, so you can teleport, fly and zoom about at will.  You also percieve yourself to be far more metaphysically powerful but ultimately it's just entities toying with you, lending you abilities so you're preoccupied when they steal energy from you.
<br />

<br />
This would all be less threatening if the majority of people weren't totally oblivious to the existence of these entities.  So they go about using their amazing, pointless abilities and then all of a sudden they're feeling tired, mentally clouded, confused, sick or going nuts (depending on the amount of shit that hits the fan for them while in the astral).  After all, the Devil's greatest trick was convincing man he didn't exist (I know it's religious but it has a moral <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />).  Basically anyone who knows as little about the astral as you would fall under that &quot;majority&quot; category.  So I would strongly advise not going into the astral, ESPECIALLY if you're not in a good place emotionally, which losing a friend will certainly cause.
<br />

<br />
Also, the Etheric doesn't directly mirror the physical.  There are many differences as well as a lack of entities.
<br />

<br />
And how is astral projection religious?  Most major religions condemn the separating of consciousness from body if anything since it's seen as &quot;evil magics&quot;.  And it can be personally experienced, so I see no problem with talking about it.

			whoa lb have you been to the astral plane? it sounds pretty intense.
<br />

<br />
i remember hearing somewhere a few years ago that there were different astral planes. like different levels or something. each having different unique characteristics. i don't know if its true, but that's what i heard and i don't know much about anything related to the astral plane.

			There are supposedly something like 12 levels of the astral with the 1st (the etheric) being the closest to the physical as far as laws of physics and things like that go.  I really can't say whether these levels exist and are set up in this way because I've found no such division.  There just seem to be degrees of realism as fas as I've seen.  The only division I've found is between the etheric and astral planes.  The residents of the etheric try to keep the door to their plane closed at all times.  So when you hear people teaching techniques to get to the etheric or talk about their experiences in the etheric, they're either full of crap or were in an area of the astral NEAR the etheric.

^ For those of you who want more education about the subject. ^
<br />

<br />
What I do astral things I don't have a deep OoBE.
<br />
'Astral' is one of the layers of energy/substance that our bodies have.
<br />

<br />
Humans, angels, etc -- each have composite bodies.
<br />
Composite beings are sometimes invinsible, and are the higher beings.
<br />

<br />
Purely astral beings -- that I've met -- some of these are quite mortal... I thought it was because they were not composites, and had no soul[?]

&quot;why do they want to keep the doors closed?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Depends which realm.
<br />

<br />
Some places don't have anyone &quot;keeping the doors closed&quot; -- they are just hard to get into.
<br />

<br />
If a realm has guardians, it is probably a realm that a group of beings actually BUILT, like a city, and they have security for it set up.
<br />

<br />
[edit]
<br />

<br />
Banishing realms are like prison dimensions/areas.
<br />
If you open one of those, it's like a jail-break.
<br />
Suddenly a bunch of cons swarm out, and you may get killed or damaged as they come out &amp; a few effect you. Don't do it!
