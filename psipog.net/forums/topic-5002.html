Psipog is a website that most obviously deals with psionics.  I'm sure your question was just mere curiosity, but you won't get many good responses because of the nature of Psipog's content which, again, is psionics.

			Actually, a lot of people tell me that the psionics presented on PsiPog is very similar to Chaos Magick.  I've read about it, and it's interesting... but it's online presence is very unappealing.  The communities are full of egotistical people with &quot;I'm right, everyone else is wrong&quot; mentallity.  I don't think people should label it as fluff so quickly - if it makes sense to you, and you want to use it, go for it.  If I were raised in a magick setting instead of an agnostic setting, PsiPog might be Chaos Magicians in Pursuit of Guidance ;-P.  The ego stuff, and the filler stuff bothers me, but some of the beliefs are interesting.

			yeah, but there's some logical inconsistencies in chaos magick, for example: How exactly is it documented that a sigil flares white hot before blackout, if you're supposed to forget it?

eh... I better stop right now before I go into a rant...

but, Black Sun sorcerer, would you happen to know of any ways to attain a gnosis state without doing retarded-ass things?

			Don't get me wrong - I definitly think psionics as presented on PsiPog is a better choice for me.  I'm just saying that labelling it as &quot;FLUFF FLUFF FLUFF FLUFF&quot; is a little too hastey.  Magick DOES produce results.  And some ideas I've read that fall under Chaos Magick are interesting (well, the ideas that were written in plain english, and didn't require me to skip over half the words).

old habits die hard, i'm afraid.

i'll take a look into chaos magick. it's just that i'm most likely expecting stuff about &quot;extending your inner soul&quot; and generalisations.

			Interesting. 
<br />

<br />
I reccomend avoiding internet chaos magick, and the general crude graspings of people without a basic understanding of the magicks that evolved long before Chaos Magick existed in the first place.  There are many fluff chaos sorcerers, just as there are many fluff psions.
<br />

<br />
Constructs and sigils are similar in many ways, which is why I felt the need to ask. 
<br />

<br />
I reccomend you read Psychonaut and Liber Null before you completely decide your opinion of chaos magick, and what it means. The philosophy of chaos magick is really the only important part of the belief; everything else is fallicy.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I find there are two ways to reach a gnostic state that works best for me, one is a general subconscious slip that is the result of basically listening to loud music in headphones for a good half hour. Eventually you'll realize, you've turned your brain off.
<br />

<br />
The second is basic meditation, which has uses in all schools of magick and psychic phenomenon apparently. 
<br />

<br />
I appreciate your opinions however.
<br />

<br />
...Though, I might reccomend something to all whom are willing to scream fluff so quickly... Find your neighborhood psychonaut, and see whom is more capable of making the weather move <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.

			While Chaos Magic is not exactly my cup of tea, it really is not that different from psionics, on the grand scheme of things.  In fact, if you are using Chaos Magic to produce an effect that can be observed by a third party, it _is_ psionic, by the basic broad definition of the latter.
<br />

<br />
There seems to be an idea floating around that psionics is inherently better than other forms of energy work.  In this case, I am using the word &quot;psionics&quot; in the relatively limited sense referring to the approaches to energy work typified by the methods espoused here, and in related sites, as distinct from various forms of sorcery, witchcraft, ceremonial magic, chaos magic, and the like.  This idea that it is &quot;better&quot; is horsepucky.
<br />

<br />
If it works, run with it.  I'm a psionicist, and I generally prefer psionic methods.  However, I am familiar with ceremonial magic, and practice it semi-regularly.  I've practiced assorted kinds of folk magic, including the ever-popular candle magic, knotwork, crystal-workings, and elemental magic generally.  I've pulled random spells from role-playing game rule-books and made them work.  The structure of psionics is such that you can make most magic systems work, if you have any kind of skill at all.  
<br />

<br />
My knowledge of chaos magic is much more limited, but I would not dismiss it as fluff based solely on what I've read online.  Take a look at a good ninety-percent of psionics sites and try keeping a straight face when explaining why psionics isn't fluffy.
<br />

<br />
End of rant...for now.
<br />

<br />
*dusts off soapbox, and steps down, so the next person can use it*
<br />

<br />

<br />
BlackSunSorcerer:  Thank you for pointing out those two works.   I've not yet read Psychonaut.
