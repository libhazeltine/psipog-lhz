Well, we cant be sure, if it's the spirit (soul) that comes out of body, or if it is the mind that gather information, or if it's the brain that can simulate the world. <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" />

			Someone said something about different planes, and that follows really close to that thing I read. He said he flew up and went to different places. Its pretty long so I cant tell you everything that was said but I will see about getting the website so you can all read it.

			IMHO, no.
<br />

<br />
Psionic activity requires brain activity.
<br />
OBE's are a psionic activity.
<br />
Death annuls brain activity.
<br />

<br />
No brain activity=no OBE.
<br />

<br />
However, I do believe that the spirit/soul can leave the body after death.
<br />
Whether permanent or not depends upon the conditions that cannot be known by Man.
<br />

<br />
[religion]
<br />
I do, however, believe in alternate planes of existence: each plane is a step closer toward That Most Effulgent.  Reincarnation occurs within each plane and serves to elevate a being as many times as necessary until the being can achieve the next plane.  The final consciousness is that of either Heaven (after Purgatory, or course) or Hell.
<br />
[/religion]
<br />
Of course, this is all my opinion.
<br />

<br />
A little long, but its nice to relate these things once in a while <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Edit [addendum]:
<br />
[religion]
<br />
Edgar Allan Poe wrote that the fulfilment of the soul is the acquiring of knowledge.  A secondary purpose of reincarnation and multiple planes of existence is to fulfil the soul until it receives all that a being can know in Heaven.
<br />

<br />
Then our definition of death would have to change:
<br />
<a href="http://m-w.com/dictionary/death" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://m-w.com/dictionary/death</a>
<br />

<br />
Applying your theory:
<br />
By definition, this existence cannot be death; cognitive function exists, so therefore, the next life would represent the opposite of cognitive function: nothingness.
<br />

<br />
Of course, this is only true if the dictionary definition of death is correct.
<br />

<br />
I do understand what you mean, though.

			The ideas expressed above are all good and interesting, but do understand- modern science, as good as it is, has to label something somehow. That's the goal. They find the best possible way of defining something, and then it becomes 'law' (depending on the circumstances). I asked my physics teacher if she thinks the laws of physics can be broken. She said yes. I asked her why she thought they could, and I'll never forget what she said.
<br />

<br />
&quot;It's the best we've got to go by right now, so until another way comes, we'll stick with it.&quot;

			I hope that this is the case. I am an atheist and I fear death, because I do not know what will happen to me. I don't want to just disappear. Could the ability to have OBEs a sort of evolutionary step for man kind to 'cheat' death so that the soul can live on. Thankyou for this idea. It  makes me feel better about death. I had hoped to learn how to heal to make me live longer and stop myself from aging.

			Ignium, I dont think you have anything to worry about when it comes to dieing. &lt;---  that sounds weird  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />   But some people who OBE have seen people who they knew to be dead. So I dont think you will just disapear. And you dont cheat death by having an OBE, some research has shown that everyone may leave there body while they sleep.

			I've thought about this a few times before, but this theory is dependent on two big IFs. The first is IF psionic activity doesn't rely on the brain(the physical form of human reasoning), but actually relies solely on the mind(the non-physical form of spiritual knowledge). IF the mind supposedly can never die, then psionic activity will be permanently active in death, which could easily result in OBEs. After all, if we existed as spirits without minds in death, then how do actual, 100% genuine possessions, channelings, or clairivoyance of the dead happen? Well, that is IF an OBE state is even possible during death(OK, so it was three IFs).
<br />

<br />
As far as the OBEs and seeing the dead, there's one more IF:Maybe in death, it's possible for free travel between what we know as an OBE(kind of like a middle realm) and the true &quot;otherworld&quot;. This would explain why there wouldn't be large masses of souls seen during an OBE.

			I have thought this would be logical, but since there is no way to be sure, I voted &quot;maybe&quot;.  If it is, what exactly could you do as a projection?  Can you interact with the real world?  Do you have to be a psychokineticist in order to do so?  Could you speak telepathically to people?  If you could, I think people would know about this.  If not, dying and becoming a projection doesn't seem that great.
