			Well, this might be possible. I have theory based on my beliefs you see.
<br />

<br />
I believe, that everything is one. We all are made of the same stuff, atoms and such. So borders are just an illusion, simply put, you are a bunch of atoms and the chair you sit on is a bunch of atoms, you are the same.
<br />

<br />
Now, since everything in fact is one, so is thought and knowledge. Then it should not be a difficult task for a psipet to access that knowledge.
<br />

<br />
To the practical part: You program your pet to search for people who have A LOT of energy, since they might be gifted with higher knowledge of psionics and you tell your pet to scan him (his/her mind actually) for psionic knowledge. You tell your pet to learn from his/her sub-c and when the pet thinks it can't hold anymore, it returns to you and you scan the pet to find out what it has learned.
<br />

<br />
It might've just picked up flaring or let's say, phasing or something like that.
<br />

<br />
Ofcourse, this is just my theory and i haven't proven it, since my pets have been fairly simple and i probably can't make a pet decent enough for this task.
<br />

<br />
Well, alot of people might think it's bullsh*t, but i urge you to try it out before you bludgeon me to death.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Psi is a pandimensional mater, a mater which we still don't understand truly, so don't say that psi isn't able to do things that we can't do, becouse you are wrong. hehehe.You guys are talking about psi as if you know each and every single secret of it, as if you have studied it for more than a millenia. I to have studied psi for about 6 years, energy manipulation is my speciality, altough I still didn't learned to flare. I choosed to expande my sensitivity for energy, to see it with auric sight, to feel it, not to see it. Credendo vides = 'By believing, one sees.'

That is my final word. (momentarily)

fair enough.  my only criticisms of this is we still don't know for sure what psi is:  is it pandimensional matter?  is it electromagnetic fields?  is it something else?  we don't know yet, not enough research has taken place.  
<br />

<br />
we aren't saying that psi isn't able to do things we can't.  we are saying constructs can't do things we can't do.  the main argument supporting this is how do you teach something to do a task, when you yourself don't know how to accomplish it?  you have a point though, there might be a way around it, but we haven't found it yet.  until we have found it, we will only consider your theory and not fully accept it.  from all our our years of experience (combined is over 200 years of experience) we have found that you can only program constructs to do something that you can do yourself.  how do you teach something like scanning to a construct, if you don't know how to project your energy into the target's field and read the feedback?
<br />

<br />
 if you keep saying that we are wrong in our beliefs and opinions, you will lose credibility.  you are the one presenting this belief to us, so you need to do anything in your power to keep your credibility.
<br />

<br />
instead of providing us with theories and ideas, why don't you provide us with detailed step by step walkthroughs so that we may try it ourselves.  in every thread that talks about techniques and what not, you see the author provide walkthroughs and descriptions in how to accomplish the task.  give us these descriptions so that we may try for ourself.  
<br />

<br />
and stop calling us narrow-minded.  for someone that has 6 years of experience with psionics, you sure know a little about how much fluffiness and lies one has to deal with.

			if you could program psi to do somthing you couldnt do, then i would be able to move a boulder with TK...i would simply program the psi as you say, and the boulder would move...so...why not? because your wrong....we can only make a psiball without doing it before because we LEARNED HOW TO DO IT! and to program somthing to flare you must LEARN HOW TO FLARE before you can program somthing to flare! get it through your thick head! <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />

IF constructs affected physical matter you could, but i don't believe they do.  i doubt you can program a construct to use any scale of PK...at least i haven't found that true (neither did the guild).

			Oh they most certainly do affect physical matter. It has been proven over and over again, that you can make a magnetic psiball, a hot and cold psiball. If heat and magnetism aren't physical properties, then I don't know what is.

But yeah, you can't literally push a car with a psiball, it would be much easier to turn on the starter or just make gasoline in one of the cylinders to detonate and make the engine start.

 Now I don't entirely believe in this either, but, you know how to flare, what to do, ways to do it, etc., even if  you cant do it, right?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Perhaps you know how to flare but your conscious mind prevents you from doing so. If psiballs are performed without the use of the conscious mind it happens outside your body and so the conscious mind doesn't react to it. 
<br />

<br />
At least that's my thought on the matter.

but that's through electromagnetic waves and radiation.  i'm talking about using PK or physically pushing objects.  i know that they can heat up things and cool them down...guess i should have explained it better.

But yeah, i'm pretty sure you can't program a psiball to do PK by itself, since even we do not, in our conscious mind, understand how we do what we do. I'm pretty sure that PK requires the presence of a brain and a construct can not do PK by itself.

			I was wanting to say that you communicate with your subconcious, sending to him &quot;commands&quot; to program a construct to flare. This recuires great meditation and a open mind, but yes, a construct can be programed to do something you can't. I just posted wrong at first. Found my mistake.
