Karate is famous for its? focus of KI in a linear path.  Practitioners are able to break boards and bricks with their bare hands and feet due to extending KI into the object they focus their blow on.  This ability is fairly common and can be learned quite easily.  There are people that can break the top off a standing bottle with such a focused blow.  Masutatsu Oyama toured the world in the nineteen fifties and sixties with demonstrations of board, brick, ice and rock breaking.  He fought and killed numerous bulls with his bare hands.  He is now teaching Karate in Japan and has adopted a more peaceful existence although his students are still known for their extraordinary power.  More striking to me are examples of precisely focused KI.  The ability to break the bottom brick in a pile of three, without a blow, but by merely laying a hand on the top brick and focusing the KI through the two bricks and breaking the third.  Here is an example of the ability of one Karate Master, Hirokazu Kanazawa, taken from Moving Zen, C.W. Nicol:  ?Another pile of three old bricks was placed.  He determined to put his spirit or ?KI? into the middle brick.  With a shout, he struck the top of the pile of three bricks, and at times we must accept the incredible, for it was the middle brick, and only the middle brick, that cracked through the middle.  There was no trick, and only an audience of a few students.?
<br />

<br />
Practitioners of Aikido also develop extraordinary powers, as in the case of an eighty-six pound teenage girl defying a two hundred and twenty pound man to lift her off the ground, and he cannot budge her due to the fact that she has extended her KI through her legs and into the ground, rooting her to the earth.  Aikido is a unique martial art in that rather than practicing for years in order to develop a focused flow of KI, it begins with KI.  One cannot practice Aikido without first developing their flow of KI.  Thus, Aikido is a very esoteric art, being based exclusively on the use of the flow of KI.  Advanced practitioners of Aikido develop their KI so that it becomes a permanent aura around them, which can serve as an extra sense, or even as a shield.

Chi Kung (&quot;ancient Chinese version of yoga and meditation&quot;)
<br />
Many are familiar with the Hindu traditions of these arts in India, but the Chinese contributions have only recently become known outside of Asia. Differing martial systems utilize parts of some or all of these practices. First, and always, is good health. Without health, All is Lost. Proper circulation of blood and breath is essential. A strong wei chi or defensive chi (immune system), alert senses, good balance, reflexes, and coordination all lead to a higher order of wellness. This produces a second response: good martial skills. Without the essential components above, martial art skill levels are limited. When strong chi is combined with focused mind intent in a physical technique, that movement is far stronger than it would be otherwise. At the highest levels of skill, this can result in chi experienced as a form of bio-electrochemical energy, projected into an opponents vital organs to cause immediate or delayed internal damage (Dim Mak or Dim Muk meaning &quot;Death Touch&quot;). A very few are able to use projected energy to effect an opponent at a distance (kong jing/empty force).

   That link doesn't work. I went to the home site... and it looks like they're trying to sell you their services. I wouldn't trust them.
<br />

<br />
   Extending your ki into objects? No... body weight and speed are enough. The quality of wood, the grain, etc help out too. Anyone can break wood if they're going with the grain. Have you ever seen a Viking? Remember how they had painted shields? That was so that the enemy wouldn't know which way the grain was going and thusly wouldn't be able to break their shields quickly. Do watch Penn and Teller's Bullshit?
<br />

<br />
   Breaking a brick without hitting it? Are you sure that really happened? I'd love to see that. Maybe you can get us a video? Hopefully not some home made video, but I'm guessing if I get anything that'll probably be it. Oh well.
<br />

<br />
   I forget the exact explanation of how only certain boards a broken in a pile... but here's an easy way to do it. Use fake materials. Yep, that's right.  Get real cement blocks and set them up where ever. Get a crappy cement looking block and place it where ever you want to. Then hit it. I've impressed people with that before. It is quite fun... go try it. Don't be stupid about it though.

   heh, I know someone who do aikido. He is in one of my martial art classes. He's one of the oldest students and he sucks about as much as the newer students. He believes in that ki crap... but he can't do anything at all. I know someone else who practices aikido. They don't believe in ki. It's not a requirement. (Don't waste your time on aikido)

   So all gymnasts should be good martial artists then? All they have to do is try? heh, I'd say most athletes require those attributes. That alone doesn't lead to greatness in any one thing though.
<br />

<br />
   Focus? Yeah, I think that's another thing most sports require. If you don't focus enough you can mess up. Take football, golf, or any martial art for example. Or hell... posting on a forum or writing a letter. You usually do better in those by focusing. You don't need any &quot;ki&quot; for any of those to reach your peak limits.
<br />

<br />
   heh, I don't believe in dim mak myself. No touch knockout? I'd love to see that. Paralyze me with a touch or two? Please, go ahead.

			Damn that guy is nuts! However it makes me wonder if someone can learn to seperate energy from martial arts.. meaning that one can just stand there and use energy, as opposed to using both martial arts and energy.

			Personally I don't think the physical and mental forces need to mix, the way I see it is that there are certain pressure points, or nerves we can hit in the body to screw someone up. It wouldn't take much energy to internally attack the desired spot. If I can hurt my arm by putting a psiball on it, then yeah.. Don't try it on yourself, unless you know what you're doing -.-

     I personally don't care what you believe if you desire to believe that the world is flat, feel free I could care less, I am certain in those excepts from those web pages that there ARE enough keywords for you to look stuff up.... for yourself(watch out for christian sites calling martial arts Satanic though). The main probelm with &quot;skeptics&quot; on this site is that are lazy fools trying to feebly disprove everything in hopes of maybe learning something, my view on it is, if you care sooo much about it LEARN IT BY YOUR DAMN SELF. Personally I know nothing about martial arts metaphyics is my passion in life so hard luck trying to squeeze any more information from me.

   er... I research martial arts several hours each week. And by several hours I mean more than just a few. I've looked up all that trash before... I simply don't believe any of it. I've met people who claim to do that before and no one has ever done anything to me. It's usually just used by fat people who are too lazy to practice real martial arts.
<br />

<br />
   Watch the &quot;Blow me.&quot; stuff. I've been nice, you should do the same. Since you weren't though... please, don't talk about stuff you don't know. If you don't know anything about martial arts don't talk about martial arts. I don't know anything about cars so I don't talka bout cars.

			Well, I orginally didn't intend to talk about martial arts specificly, I was just saying that in my studies I stumbled across something mentioning it, and do you not believe in programming either? I am certain a skilled psion could paralyze/kill you with a programmed psi-ball or mentally suggest to you to go to sleep.... Has nothing to do with martial arts per se, but if one could do that with just energy, I'm certain it could be incorperated into a punch, especially if you read the anchor article, you can tie a psi &quot;ability&quot; to an action or word.... seems possible to me

   I believe in programming. Enough to do that? Not sure about that. I'm still deciding.

			No, the anchor article talks about tying psi &quot;abilities&quot; to movements and or words(movements could be a punch)
