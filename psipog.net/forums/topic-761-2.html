			Seeing &quot;auras&quot; is just seeing energy. It's synaethesia in my opinion, and it can't be good for you to practice it.
<br />

<br />
By the way, auras don't do anything. Waste energy.

			Can these 'psipets' be flared?? Has anyone ever tried this 'detailed flaring'.....I doubt anyone did but if you did what did you see? Flaring a psicat for example...wouldn't it be interesting? It would be spectecular that's for sure

			Agreed, Wolflion.  But when I flare my psiball I only get a few small points of white light that appear and disappear quickly.  I'd have to get alot better in order to make my flaring into any distinguishable shape.
<br />

<br />
After reading this thread I decided to make my very own psi pet.  It was nothing very complicated - simply a psiball I programmed to follow me around, and gather more energy for itself as needed.  It lasted for about three days.  On its third night its energy became very erratic (and it kinda got annoying - the constant feeling of energy moving around me), so I got rid of it.

			I've made a small menagerie of psi-pets myself. I have two dogs I have that follow me around most of the time, a little sprite guy that can multiply himself to do what I need him (them) to do (like making me aware of all things in my environment), a bird that can do some minor healing, an energy generator construct that is attached to my back, a weird mirror construct that I use to help clear my mind, and finally, two ghost/humanoid-like things that I use to send telepathic messages. I have several more planned too, like a personal psi trainer construct. I haven't really got that one thought out very well, though.
<br />

<br />
For my programming, I use this procedure. First, gather some energy, form your construct's shape, and shell it. Second, tell the construct &quot;from now on, you will exist by gathering as much energy as you need for operation, from the earth, as long as it doesn't affect the operation of living things that need this energy. You will exist until I say your name, &lt;insert construct name of your preference&gt;, three times verbally in succession.&quot; The first part prevents the over- or under-nourishment of psi energy and the second prevents the accidental destroying of the construct. Now, the only thing left is to give the construct whatever abilities you want.
<br />

<br />
Also, I usually don't notice when my constructs are around since I haven't trained my sensitivety very well yet, but when I tell them to be at a certain place, I can run my hand through that area and notice the significantly higher temperature, so I know they must be there. Since I can't do PK at will very well, this heat was the thing that finally got by skeptic friends to believe in psi. I even had one ask me to make a pet for him. The construct he wanted me to make was a miniature pink hippo with blue and green eyes named Alfredo. I did make it so that both me and my friend can control the hippo. He doesn't know, though *begin maniacal laughter*. Psi-pets are definitely one of my favorite likes so far. Still, I'd rather have them flared permanently.
<br />

<br />
As an added note, I am getting the feeling that little kids' &quot;imaginary friends&quot; are not actually imaginary, but constructs, since small children are more psychically &quot;in tune&quot; and those friends behave like constructs, from what the children imagine. Maybe they aren't that crazy. Just a thought...
<br />

<br />
P.S. Thanks Vladimir and PsionicJason for the whole psi-pet idea and Vladimir for the generator/power plant construct design and idea.

 Wanna know my experiences? Basically I was one of the first to actually introduce to ideas of Psi-Pets to PsiPog in the chatroom. I've made all kinds, monkeys, cats, dogs, even mystical creatures for others who didn't know how. Quite frankly, I'm a bit offended. You know why? Because it's kinda like an inventor (me) who invents something but gets no credit whatsoever. But thankfully I don't do it for the credit. I just find this sorta hilarious how some people actually think they know what the hell they're talking about. You don't know much unless the inventor informs you.

Hey, relax! They aren't trying to steal your precious invention, it may have been original to you, but many things are original to other people but have been done already as well. They aren't trying to steal credit, they are just sharing thoughts, ideas and creations of their own. Plus no one is making a profit off the idea, it's called sharing. I try to teach that to my 4 year old students.

			Glad to see you back Sam.  No, I'm not going to give you credit for &quot;creating&quot; psi-pets, unless you mean the term, which may or may not be yours (not sure).  quasi-AI programming has been thought of by people ever since the term &quot;programming&quot; was used to describe what we do to psi.

			Eh, I suppose I did come off alittle too strong there. I've always been the type who can get mad easily over some of the most unnesessary things. Forgive my rudeness. But anywho, I'm going to be writing an article on Psi-Pets pretty soon, so I can teach others, who may not know what it is. Nice seeing you, Suntzu.
