			Iam a moderated psi user, and now in the vacation I will train harder to arive to the elites.
<br />
As I read posts through the forums, I realized, that most people can't do flaring, but for example their psi pets do, and etc...
<br />
And now mostly I am doing the weisest thing that a psion can do.
<br />
Leave psionics to the greatest psion of all times: psi itself. Program a construct to draw psi, shell it, flare it, make it ready for further programing, and so on. Hey, it works for me all the time. I even made a psipet like this, which lasted for days, before I destroyed it. I was wanting to make a etter one.

Psi energy is not an enlightened being of some kind.  It doesn't &quot;know&quot; how to do the stuff on it's own.  It just does what we tell it to do.

			Psi does can do things that you can not do. How do you make a first psiball, if you havn't made on in the first place. ? . You only send a message to your subconcious, to form the ball. Your subconcious then transmits programing informations to psi, which performez them. Even if you can not perform it conciously, your subconcious can, to a sertain degree. After training, your concious mind takes over this performing, , until then, you rely on your subconcious. Training to communicate with your subconcious can enhance the final results befor taking over total control.

			I'll agree with you that your subconscious can be &quot;smarter&quot; then you.  However, your subconscious is still part of you, so it's still _you_ doing it.  Making a psiball is programming psi to be round, you're doing it (with or without your subconscious).  If you program a psiball to flare itself, and it actually does flare, YOU'RE flaring it, hehe.  Then, if you wanted to, I guess it would be possible to program that construct to flare other constructs...but &quot;meh&quot;.  
<br />

<br />
However, if you're programming a construct to recieve TP signals, you'd still need TP in order to be able to view the information, yourself.  Hehe.

			All that I am saying is that psi is able to do things that you normaly can't do. Psipet does form the link, so it can do it, but you need to learn to read the information, but the psipet did form the link, heh. Yes, it can flare psi, even if you can't. HEHE. Psi is a pandimensional mater, a mater which we still don't understand truly, so don't say that psi isn't able to do things that we can't do, becouse you are wrong. hehehe

 Now I don't entirely believe in this either, but, you know how to flare, what to do, ways to do it, etc., even if  you cant do it, right?

			Yes, you still know how to do it, the theory, even if you can not do it. Your subconcious knows that to, but only after you get enlightened about it( the information) so does the subconcious process the information, allowing you to do it. But only with practice you can tell your subconcious to perform the task, and after that your subconcious mind takes over the process.

			how can i put this simply...
<br />

<br />
it takes practice and conditioning your body.  a psiball is just psi energy shaped into a ball.  that's it.  flaring a construct is a skill, and isn't considered manipulation of energy.  flaring is different than manipulating.  when you flare, you are &quot;telling&quot; the construct to flare.  the construct is psi energy that you manipulated.  when you are manipulating psi, you aren't &quot;telling&quot; it what to do, you are shaping it; like it's clay.  flaring is telling, or programing the construct to do a simple task.  
<br />

<br />
so, when you create a construct and program it to flare itself, you can't program it to unless you yourself can flare a construct.  in theory, you can program a construct to create psiballs since you can already do that, you're just manipulating energy.
<br />

<br />
in response to you saying that psi can do things we can't do, well, that hasn't happened yet.  in order to make psi do something, you have to know the steps and details of what you want it to do so that you can program it to go through the motions.  how can you &quot;teach&quot; a construct to flare if you don't know the steps?  that's like saying a sword knows how to kill people and can do it on it's own, even if the weilder doesn't know how.

This post makes no sense, you're going to program a construct to perform abilities you cannot do itself, what psi energy has a mind of its own?

you have to keep in mind that the psions that have been on these forums for a while have been faced by a myriad of fluffiness.  we need some sort of proof, or an intelligent argument to base our opinions off of.  so far in this thread, there wasn't any.  when we challenge you like this, you need to stand strong to your beliefs and &quot;sell&quot; us your idea.  we aren't narrow-minded, just sick of the fluffiness and the &quot;one-time-members&quot; who just post a little, and it's all about nonsense.  also keep in mind that some people on these forums have been studying psi for quite a while, and have heard just about everything.  i myself have been studying psionics for at least 7 years now, i know elliptic, rainsong, NI, and peebrain have been studying for just as long, if not longer.  and also, when so many people are trying to tell you something, at least consider it.  in all of our experiences, we have ALL found that constructs can't do anything that the psion themselves can't do (creating/manipulation of a psi-ball excluded, see my above thread).  whether this is a consistant fact for all of us, a coincidence, or we just don't know the process is still in the air.  we just know what we have experienced, that's how we learn.  if you have something new to teach us, then by all means, teach us.  when a school teacher is faced by a rowdy class do they give up?  no.  they continue to try to teach.  when we challange your beliefs you need to stand up, speak out, and prove it to us.  that is how you earn respect on these boards and how people listen to you.  not by backing down from a challange.  rise above, and if you're up to it, give it another try.  i'm sure some people will listen.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
