Well, you know, if it's not a eye-trick, just videotape it, and we'll know for sure what happens then (either you go through the straw or it's your vision that becomes distorted by staring too long at the object... ) Very easy to find out with a camera.
<br />

<br />
what do you think?

			I know its not a trick of the eyes, as my finger phased through it, i only used the term 'Semi Teleportation' as i didnt know there was a word for Phasing, and obviously, there is.
<br />
Now, about the video, i have to buy a new camera, because i did Baka's test, where you move the PsiBall towards your computer monitor, to see if the contrast goes 'funny'. I used to much energy for the PsiBall, my monitor has permanently changed a shade of green, and my camera got fried. Should be getting an even better camera in a month or two though.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			maxus dude, i dont think you get what people are saying about the magnetic push, cause you keep saying you didnt feel anything back to them. From what you already said this isnt true you felt a magnetic push, and they are trying to say that this was you feeling the straw bending when you touched it.

			I think im on a different wave length to everyone here, im saying that i felt a magnetic push, like a build up of static electricity, and everybody is telling me that that happened when i just pushed the straw, but i keep telling you people, and no one seems to be listening, that i phased through the bloody thing. I do agree that what i described about the walls turning purple was almost certainly dry eyes, but the fact that my finger passed through the straw is undeniable. I dont get whats so hard to understand.

If you don't believe him, then your time could be better spent in the Skeptics forum.

Skepticism is nice, but after 7 times of maxus affirming that his finger DID go through the straw, I thought that you would either except it, or keep your doubts to yourself.

			I don't doubt you, if you reckon you did it you probably did. Awesome. But up until you explained what the magnetic push felt like it kinda just sounded like you felt resistance pushing against you when your finger reached the point where the straw was, which sounded like you were feeling the straw.

Sorry to disappoint you but its got nothing to do with numbers. Reading something 7 times or 55643543 times will not make any difference to me. I respect your personality, respect mine as well. I haven't said anything wrong so far, at least that's my feeling.
