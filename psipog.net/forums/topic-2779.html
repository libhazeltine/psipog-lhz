			This is weird and there are many explanations, but i'm just checking peoples opinions on this in case it could have been pk. 
<br />

<br />
The story goes as follows:
<br />

<br />
Earlier today, I went on a bike ride with my step dad and sis. Twas fun, but when I got back and went into my room, one of my plane models was on the floor by my tv (this model is quite heavy, made of solid plastic). I wondered why it was there, when where I left it was on a shelf over my computer, which was over 4 metres away. Basically, it was over the other side of my room.
<br />
 At first, I thought it was my mum who had somehow moved it there, but when I asked her she said she didn't go in my room and no one else had. The window was open, however, it was at an anlge where any amount of gale force wind wouldn't budge it because it was around a corner, and the wind wouldn't have been at the right angle anyway. 
<br />
The rest of my room was in the same place, except for my computer, which was on a different screen. I had left it with iTunes maximised, and when I saw it, everything was minimized. And the forum was one of those windows minimized! So I hope my mum wasn't checking and saw it! Oh, and the strangest thing was that as I was walking up the stairs to go into my room, I heard a noise, like a light banging, as if something fell on the floor, and before I noticed that the plane was on the floor, I felt this feeling as if I wasn't alone. Like another presence. Oh, and also, there is a desk between the floor where the plane landed and the shelf it was on, so I don't know how the hell it got there. 
<br />

<br />
The question: Was this me? Did I accidentely do pk on my bike ride? Was this some poltergeist thing?!? Or was this something else?

			Nope. Sometimes my psiwheel will randomly move when im not looking at it. It usually just goes crazy for no reason. Sub-c thing. So I was thinking if it could have been something simliar to that.

			Well, what you described sounds a lot like RSPK*. The tingly feeling you got, and the 'not alone' feeling - all very reminiscent of my own experiences with this kinda thing. Did the rool feel sorta cold, or cooler anyway, at all?
<br />

<br />
It's possibly a number of things, maybe you'll have to wait and see if it happens again.

No offense, but I think my mum would have noticed a step ladder up the side of my house. lol

And, Aether, my room is always really cold anyway.

			Hmmm. There's too many possiblilities to be sure. 
<br />

<br />
First, since you mentioned the window was open, it's quite possible that it blew from the shelf and to it's position, regardless of what was in the way. Didn't necessarily have to happen in one fel swoop either, could have taken a few gusts to get it that far. 
<br />

<br />
You also mentioned feeling another presence - well it's quite possible there's another person living in the house, or at least visiting. Have you noticed anything else like this before?
<br />
I don't discount this possiblitiy mainly because of my experiences. A short story to illustrate.
<br />
When I was in my late teens and starting college, I moved into my parent's basement. Our house was built on the spot where we took down an old stone cottage, on the shore of a lake. It wasn't isolated and was a small community with a fair number of people in the summer.
<br />
Shortly after moving down into the basement I started hearing some strange things - odd creeks and groans which I just wrote off as th ehouse settling and me being a little jumpy. I don't believe the house was settling at all.
<br />
I clearly remeber several different nights when I would hear the basement steps, coming from the main floor, groaning and creeking exactly like someone was walking down them - though noone was at 3am - I know that for sure. The steps would continue down and around the corner, through a short hallway and into the main room of the basement. Form there they would shuffle across the carpet and into the bedroom, which was raised and also creeked when walked on, then all th eway up to the side of my bed.
<br />
I was terrfied - hell thinking back now it STILL scares the crap out of me. I did, on occasion, get the courage to goo looking for the source of the sound, which I never did find.
<br />

<br />
And, of course, you may have actually moved it with PK as well. While I doubt it was done while on your bike I wouldn't doubt that you may have done so when you felt the other presence, or perhaps while heading to your room.
<br />

<br />
There's a few options and I wouldn't discount any of them. Unfortunatly due to the number of possibilities you'll probably never be 100% on what happened and will either have to remain undecided, or pick the answer you're most comfortable with.
<br />

			Well, first of all, i'm completely certain that it was not the wind. It actually would be impossible, both with the way the window open(away from the shelf) and also because it would have to go round the curtains, the big cd holders, my computer screen, desk and up onto my shelf. And even if the wind bent around those objects, it would have to pull the plane, beacuse there was a wall resting against the plane. If the wind had pushed it, the plane would have been somewhere completely different. I'm stumped. I may have done it when I was walking up the stairs...hmmmmm.

Haha, just kidding. Yeah, I can control other people's psi-wheel's with my subconscious [weird, eh?], so you probably did the same thing I did.
