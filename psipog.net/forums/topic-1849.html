			ok so, psi technicly exists in the earth, and all living things, and it is possible to absorb it for your own use. so would it be possible to put a super dense construct programmed to absorb energy into a &quot;real&quot; object , like a pencil, or jewerly, so you could have a bunch or stored psi to use when you need it, so you dont have to spend the time to take it from the earth. 
<br />

<br />
might this work?

			If you practice using your own energy, eventually you'll start producing enough that you won't have to draw from other sources. However, I hear (well, read actually, because I'm not so lazy that I have to use text-to-speech) some people use quartz and copper to store psi for later use.

			I personally don't believe it's possible to draw from sources other than the earth, because from what I can tell, with my not-so-great psi-sensitivity, earth energy is nothing but decayed psi (probably through people grounding all over the world, over a long time), which could probably be put to some use if it was cleaned/depatterned,  making it fit for psionics.
<br />
Just make sure it's depatterned first.

But it is still usuable psi. I'm pretty sure it can't be clean or dirty.

You could decide to leave the dirty patterns out and take the clean part. Kind of like taking gold from a rock and leaving the rest.

Psykiller: Why would you use a sword-shaped construct on a daily basis anyway? I can't think of any use apart from practice or destroying constructs in a fancy way.

Sorry then <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> . Depatternize and &quot;take the gold out&quot; sound really different to me.

			What if you tried storing psi balls/constructs in small round shaped glass bottles and programmed them to take energy from another source, or several for a few weeks. Would the bottle break? What would happen? You could maybe tell it to try and flare when it has enough energy and also glow.
