			After 3 weeks away, it actually does seem like a good idea.

But 5/hour is slightly restrictive.

I kinda like the idea of 10/2hour.

			I think that is because in edit, it is also a submit button. They drain 1 from your remaining posts everytime you click them with a valid post (1 word or more).

			I would have to agree that the idea sounds, great. But many ideas sound great only to fall flat on their faces. For example: Communisim, give everyone a job and pay everyone the same amount. It also sounds great on paper, everyone is equal. But as history shows Communisim didn't work.
<br />

<br />
I'm a pretty newbish on psipog, I tend to read more than post, most of the time due to fact that I can't honostly say something thats productive or When I have a good thought it gets jarbled when I try to explain outside my head.
<br />

<br />
But There are people here on psipog who seem to be able to think clearly and easily explain their thoughts on paper (the internet actually)  Their insight and wisdom has helped me many a time and if they can only post 5 times it really restricts not only the intelligent people who help but the people who need help.
<br />

<br />
So All I'm asking is that the post count be raised a to 6 or 7 so I'm able to get the help I need.
<br />

<br />
I love psipog and will still come here if the post is 3 an hour but I know that some really intelligent and insightful people will leave to find another forum, and I'll lose even more valuable help until no one's left to post.

But unless you type at the speed of sound, and your posts are at least 1000 characters, you really have no reason to complain.
<br />

<br />
True, some answers to questions may be shorter than others, and be less explanatory. 
<br />

<br />
But, it has always been obvious that if there is a problem, it is better to suggest a solution than to remove everything.
<br />

<br />
My idea would be that if the mod/admins see that a certain member is an 'extremely good member' (define it yourselves, it doesn't have one.), who helps the community, answers questions, etc, they would have a vote in a topic on whether to raise posts/hour for that specific person.
<br />

<br />
An unrelated suggestion is that we should have a FAQ section. Quite obviously, we'd add on. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

It's actually not, 10/2 hour is less restrictive than 5/hour. Mathematically, it's the same.
<br />

<br />
But if you manage 10 posts in one hour, and you're done for the day, then that's 'fine'. I just log in now 30 mins to the hour and just get my 10 posts in that 1 hour, where half an hour overlaps between the two hours.
