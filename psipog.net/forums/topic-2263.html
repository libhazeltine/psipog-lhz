			I have a suggestion for anyone trying PK with the Wind:
<br />

<br />
1) Take a walk and connect your hands energetically while you walk ( think of strings of energy or a psiball )
<br />

<br />
2) As you are walking, you are building Kinetic Energy that can be translated into Psychokinetic Energy
<br />

<br />
3) I move my hands in a rhythmic pattern as I walk while maintaining their Energetic Connection ( very similar to liquid dancing )
<br />

<br />
4) Pay close attention to how the wind is communicating ( it helps to think of these as a communication between you and the wind as opposed to forcing it to do this or that )
<br />

<br />
5) Turn your attention to connecting the Energy you have built in your hands to the Energy of the Wind
<br />

<br />
6) Be Patient.
<br />

<br />
I think you'll be delighted with the results !!
<br />

<br />
Have fun
<br />

			I must admit that I did to begin with ( Aerokinesis ).
<br />

<br />
Then, Peabrain informed me and I quickly changed it. I just didn't know any better.  Some people actually challenge the use of the word Psychokinesis on Wikipedia.

			Today being my first attempt at Wind pyschokinesis, i went outside and meditated for a couple of minutes. and then i offered sage to the four directions of wind and asked them one by one to blow on me. I'm pretty sure it worked, but being outside it could of just been luck... but it did blow from each different direction every time.

			My experience has been that you can always second guess yourself. What matters is if you truly felt a connection. I also find that it helps to focus on communicating rather than ego-based control.

			Sorry to burst your bubble, but wind will change directions several times a minute, by itself, but its a great placebo effect none the less. 
<br />
Just keep thinking that its you doing it, and it will help with other areas of Pk.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I think that I'm moving air when I try to move my psiwheel 'cause I almost always feel 'wind' on my hand when I try to move the psiwheel. It MIGHT be the ac bouncing off 2 walls though, but it's not likely.

			Instead of trying to change wind-directions, try making it storm, but hold back a little bit, as not to cause damage or something. Just make the wind blow real hard in the area you are in. You will know it is you once it starts to storm <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />. I don't know wether I have a natural connection to weather systems, but if that is not the case, then I must say affecting the weather is one of the simplest phenomena out there. You might get results immediately, and some pretty serious results too. What are your experiences with the weather system? I would like to know wether or not you find it easy as well.
