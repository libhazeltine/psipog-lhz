Well whatever...i dont know how it works. I think its what you make out of it.

It could be too that it is all by genetics and you dont have any influence. This would be equalized by having no free will at all.

If you consider my ideas insane, then you're considering the amassed body of psychological and medical literature insane.  It seems a bit childish to turn your back on established science because someone on a forum thinks you make no sense.  A deterministic view of human development is for those who have resigned to a fatalistic view of life.  If genetics determined who we were and how we acted, then there wouldn't be nearly as much diversity as there is.  Nature and nurture, genetics and environment both affect how an organism develops.

Not sure.  Usually people engage in debates and arguments to try and get their point across, and usually their point is one that they believe in.  If you're just arguing for the sake of arguing, then you're wasting my time.

What i wanted to say in my last post is that i don't stick so hard to my ideas like you might think. I kind of don't care, but i think it's interesting thinking about how it works, but if you don't want to understand me it seems kind of senseless to me.

I want to get beat up in an arguement with Roy! Okay, here goes!
<br />

<br />
People engage in debates and arguments to try to get <span style="font-style: italic">a</span> point across, not necessarily  their point across. 
<br />
DemonHunter cannot waste <span style="font-style: italic">your</span> time, for he does not own <span style="font-style: italic">your</span> time...even if it is possible to own time or not. 
<br />
You choose the way you use your time. 
<br />
If it is such a waste of time, you would leave this argument...or perhaps you already have...

Maybe he does understand? Maybe he just dislikes the idea, there is a differnce from not understanding the turth, from not likeing it.

			Two things.
<br />

<br />
1) How exactly would trees be wise? They sit in the sun all day, and soak up nutrients, and convert those nutrients into other forms, as well as converting carbon dioxide into oxygen (and even then, they're not that great at it, we get a LOT more oxygen from plankton). Obviously they're not too intelligent, if they were able to converse via telepathy, they could logically defend themselves through psionics as well, and thus would not be the lowest life forms on the food chain. Without intelligence (not necessarily high IQ, just understanding), how could they have wisdom?
<br />

<br />
2) You have resurrected a dead topic without really adding anything too it.

			I feel so guilty about that. I'm really sorry. But still i believe trees are very wise. Probably it doesn't have anything to do with intelligence.

Before anyone says &quot;but all will come to you if you just wait for it,&quot; I'd like to say whoever is thinking it is full of it. I could sit around and wait for happiness to come to me, but unless I get out there and pursue it, I'll never find it.
