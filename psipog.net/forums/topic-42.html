Well it really did suck for a while, but it has gotten a little better now that kurt is world champion again and edge finally became WWE champ. Screw John Cena... does nothing but kiss crowd ass to make himself look good.

But that's the point! Of course it's fake! That's why people watch it! Or rather, at least most people. It's funny because of how fake the dialogues and stuff are. Sure the matches are fixed too, but I'd like to see anyone here get the balls enough to step into that ring. Even though everything is predetermined, that doesn't mean it don't hurt to fall. Seriously. 
<br />

<br />
That's where people got a really bad misunderstanding of wrestling. When wrestling became big in the 90's, the media jumped all over it. They said that because the characters and the dialogue is fake that everything is. That's not true. People do get hurt. Bob Holly broke his neck. Triple H tore his quadricept and was out for an entire year. From a sport perspective, of course it's a sport. The only reason people don't want to call it a sport is because there's more to it than just watching people &quot;rassle.&quot; There's other material on the show that pulls in different crowds of people. Hell, my old next door neighbor watched wrestling. He didn't watch it because of the sport, he watched it because of the humor in the storylines. It's just like immersing yourself in an RPG. there's action, there's dialogue, often humor, and overall, it's a great combination.

Why the hell did I just rant on a topic that was bumped and is over 3 months old?

			meh... even though all that may be true, most of it is just physical acting and poorly at that. I have seen the six flags batman action show do a better job with their stunts than the WWE.

			From what I've heard, Hell in a cell Matches are completely real, anyway you notice it's not the same, in other matches they take turns beating each other up until someone wins, in hell in a cell, once one person's stamina is all gone,they don't get back up, many wrestlers end up in the hospital for years, I believe HHH was incapacitated for 2 years

First off, everything else on TV has ten times better acting than WWE. TV shows are fake, duh. But this one is so fake, it's funny! And the hell in a cell matches are fake too. If they got hurt, it was on accident. Those guys get paid to get hurt sometimes just because they want the money and they want to interest people. And it is absolutley nothing like everything else on TV. If you want to see real fighting, watch ultimate fighting. Now that's cool.

			I used to be into wrestling with my good bud. Then.. yeah, kinda got out of it. I'd have to pick Smackdown ^^ over Raw, why? I don't remember.
<br />
I didn't really care if it was fake or not. It was a good show to watch. When I watched it, I didn't think of it as fake or real, it's all about the story line  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />
