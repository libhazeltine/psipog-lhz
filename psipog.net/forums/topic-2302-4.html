Really? I've never seen it, nor do I plan to. I'm, ah, kind of in a weird spot regarding organized religion...
<br />

<br />
Arzhul, actually that makes a lot of sense. The tower for galdon would probably be one of the higher levels, because he has been hurt there before, which I've tried to help him through with the little psi healing I can do/guide him through. He can see, hear, and feel everything around him, and sometimes I've felt it too through our link.
<br />

<br />
Further, galdon if you're reading this, get your ass on MSN. You're freaking me out with the whole 'nowhere to be found for two days' thing. Oh, and try <a href="http://www.xanga.com" target="_blank" class="postlink">Xanga</a>.

and anatares, um, thats why i didnt mention the thing about delmr and sadera being from the future, this tower thing is hard enough to believe without trying to tell that too.
<br />

<br />
Whiteraven, a polarm is the broad term for a weapon used at the end of a pole, kinda like spears exept with something bigger on the end.
<br />

<br />
anyways, i've mannaged to consentrate enough to go to the tower again, the floors monster was pitch black, and kinda oily looking, used natural claws, and it's right arm could stretch, dunno about the left one, i'd assume it could too but it didnt stretch it. i ended up beating it a bit easily, evading and then slicing at it.

sure, but the rest up, the more ideas there are the better chance that the correct one will show it's self. and if its a test, i dont think i'm passing, i've had to retreat a ton of times on some floors.

And you said you're 19?
<br />

<br />
Regardless. I agree with Musician and with Tsn's &quot;sarcastic&quot; reasons.
<br />

<br />
Just because you think you're sane doesn't mean you're sane. An insane person does not know that he's insane. I'll leave the philosophical ramifications of that to the rest of you.
<br />

<br />
Just because someone else shares your insanity doesn't mean that you're not both insane. Look up the Jonestown massacre, the Heaven's Gate cult, the Raelian cult, and any of hundreds of other crazy cult/abnormal belief groups.

			first i will let myself to say : stop thinking about psi psions or whatever..<img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />
its maybe true but sounds so funny and dumb... its pathetic... <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> maybe its true but sounds too funny... ok <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> im happy now 
<br />

<br />
galdon <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> if you want to seek answers maybe start:
<br />

<br />
do you want to change your world ? car girls school parents.. 
<br />
are you very dissapointed about your real skills - not atractive, not strong ( pshisicaly ) and so on.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
you did watch much movies? you like to daydream? to be creative at this way?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />  
<br />

<br />
how many times a day are you &quot; here and now&quot; ? feeling your body, your breath or seeing in here and now.. or feeling that you feel now.. ? anything which keeps your here? <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> ( did you understand properly what i said ? )
<br />

<br />
do you feel pshisicaly body while daydreaming? - if yes its only your own phantasy if no when its dreams..
<br />
Dont touch this word too much.. dream obe - its all about the same..
<br />
you are in between. One way would be to alter your consciousness.
<br />
Try if you want in be here and now.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
P.S. as every soul ( you, me others ) has his angel guard - or whatever.. call it how you want.Its not on believing.It just is.
<br />
Also there are many bad spirits who like to suck energy from humans.
<br />
So you are maybe in a fight.
<br />
if you read all this im happy. I really like your saga <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> and im very surprised how you are strong. Inner strong.will..Your 3rd chakra must be in a good condition. 
<br />
P.S. pm me if you wanna nice talk about all this...
<br />
sorry about my english skills <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			well i cant blame you for having a hard time believing it, i mean, its kinda hard to prove something like this. i had a friend look at what i wrote, they told me, that if they did not know me as well as they do, they wouldnt believe a word of it.
<br />

<br />

<br />
i have a car thats as old as i am, but the fact it runs is good enough, i have a girl, though i wish i could be closer to her, my parents are... well i dont think i'd be allowed to say those words here <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

i am 19, but with a parttime job i cannot afford to move out, and my parents use the 'give us your computer or get out of the house' thing. (i earn roughly 330 a month)
