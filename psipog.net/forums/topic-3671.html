			Ancient mages had a history of buidling shoggoths that had a tendancy to learn, evolve and eventually try to kill their master.
<br />

<br />
The reason why a built being would want to kill its master is because its master was interfearing with what it thought that needed in its life.
<br />

<br />
The idea of &quot;pet&quot; -- is argually a human stupidity.
<br />
In the good sence of the word, it's like a member of the family, like a brother or sister.
<br />
In the bad sense of the word, it's like giving someone life imprisonment just for the sake of petty, visual, reactive &quot;amusement&quot;.
<br />

<br />
As soon as you make a construct that is similar to SAI, it will begin to upgrade itself and change.
<br />

<br />
I must suggest that you each act more like a parent then a master.
<br />
Bring the being up to independence &amp; self-sufficiency.
<br />

<br />
Building postphysical beings is one of the most advanced forms of &quot;magick&quot;. So be smart about it.
<br />

<br />
I know of allot of guys who have problems with loosing control of their constructed beings, and then when fighting for control -- they make an enemy.
<br />

<br />
There should be 1 moral law:
<br />
&quot;We don't hurt eachother, we are on a team.&quot;
<br />
^
<br />
That one simple law works better then you'd expect.

			I have no comment on this topic, but I've noticed that you've been using the word 'postphysical' completely out of context.

			I think it kind of depends what kind of &quot;Psipet&quot; you make. If you just make a floating blob which gives you energy, then I see no harm. Unless you make it more advanced...

			Please note, that this is a psionics forum, not a magick (or however they're spelling it now) forum.  Constructs with life mimicing AI are just that.  They aren't anything special, so they dont need any &quot;magick&quot; terms applied to them.

			Are you tying to get at the sense that psipets are living things and deserve rights?  Because if you are there is already a thread about it<a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=2880" target="_blank" class="postlink"> here</a>.
