If you want some serious response you might consider learning english...
<br />
And If you read the articles you might find the answer yourself.

I supose blowing a lightbulb is some sort of pyrokinesis, wich is a form of psychokinesis. 
<br />

<br />
Don't expect to be able to blow a streetlamp tomorrow.. it needs practice.. And a lot of it too.

I personally do not know people who blow up lightbulbs. I know a few who probably can do it, but I never heard that they actually did precisely that. Why would you want to? It is expensive having to buy new lightbulbs regulary:p. But sure, practice if you will. It is far from impossible.

			I've blown up lightbulbs... and even fried my computer once <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />.  I also used to do something strange - completely disable lightbulbs when I'm around it.  By this I mean, I enter a room and flick the switch.  No light comes on (or it comes on very dim).  So I think, &quot;Hmm, must be broken&quot;.  Then since I'm lazy, and don't replace it, I leave and a friend comes back.  Flicks the switch and it lights just fine.  This has happened to me on two seperate occasions, each occasion lasting a few months (not like one experience... I mean a daily experience with the same bulb for over the period of a few months).

It's cool... sometimes.  Sometimes it's just annoying.  Or expensive.

			Shattering lightbulbs is generally unintentional. Me and mum used to do this quite a lot, but now we have some control =P.
