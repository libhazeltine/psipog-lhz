			I'm new to this, found this site today. And want to ask some questions:
<br />

<br />
1. when i was making psiballs i found that my hands got hot while using psi... Is this usual?
<br />
2. I walked around trying to draw energy form my surroundings, after a while it felt like my hair was magnetised... is this usual too?
<br />
3. I began working with psi today, and i have made 5 psiballs and have pinged a friend while chatting with him in msn. And the question is, is that usual?
<br />
4. i can't seem to change the heat of my psiballs, is there a trick for doing this?
<br />

<br />
please don't flame me for asking

			Wow, you're the most experienced noob I have ever seen.

1. when i was making psiballs i found that my hands got hot while using psi... Is this usual? 
<br />

<br />
A. Yes, that is quite usual. Try doing the same thing without drawing psi and see if it still happens. It's by no means anything to worry about.
<br />

<br />
2. I walked around trying to draw energy form my surroundings, after a while it felt like my hair was magnetised... is this usual too? 
<br />

<br />
A. That's actually quite cool if you ask me. How did you test it?? I've never heard of hair being magnetised, only static. So...not usual, but still nothing to worry about, as long as you don't often stick your head through a large coil of wire. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

3. I began working with psi today, and i have made 5 psiballs and have pinged a friend while chatting with him in msn. And the question is, is that usual? 
<br />

<br />
A. If that's your first day then I congratulate you on that. Pinging someone is actually telepathy, so nice going. I've tried pinging and failed. I knew one person who pinged on his first day, so not too usual. But good. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
4. i can't seem to change the heat of my psiballs, is there a trick for doing this? 
<br />

<br />
A. This one has been bought up a lot. If you read some articles on the main site you will come across one that is called &quot;the art of programming&quot; by tsun zu (can't remember how hte name is spelt). That one contains info on how to program your psiballs to have either heat of coldness in them. In fact I'll explain now. Simply think of something cold or hot, or the image of what comes into your head when someone says the word hot or cold, then inorporate that feeling into the psi ball. That should work.

I never flame noobs for being curious. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
