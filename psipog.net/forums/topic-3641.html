			I wanna know if there's anything to help me get one faster. Yesterday I read an article on LD on the personal techs board so I figured I'd give it a go that night. And as soon as I stopped saying ''I'm in the mall. I'm dreaming.&quot; I fell asleep and didn't have a LD.
<br />

<br />
So is there something I can do to help?

			Do reality checks, while you aren't dreaming, say that you aren't. Point out reasons why you aren't dreaming, alot of the time when i'm running, I say i'm not dreaming! why? because I try to run in my dream, and i'm slow as a snail.  Whats the things that seperate the dream from reality? point them out very well.

Don't make half-assed replies please. And seriously, for whatever reason you may have for having only one word in your post, please, at least spell it right.

As for the question, you basically have to keep practicing. I, too, am practicing this at this period in time. You just have to keep practicing.

			Yay, looks like I came to the right place.

I've been LDing for about a year now, and it even happens to me naturally now. I'm not too experienced though, I've experimented, but I'm no expert really. So you want a shortcut huh? Well, it took me a long time, until I discovered a simple and very good way to LD. It's simple, though you have to time it right. The method is called &quot;Welcome back to Bed&quot; or WBTB. It's not too complicated, but as I said, you have to time it right and have enough motivation.
<br />

<br />
Basically you go to sleep, setting your alarm to wake you up in 5 and a half to six hours later. When you wake up, walk around and do whatever you can to not fall asleep, but don't eat or wake yourself up too much. Stay awake for an hour, then go back to sleep with some ideas of what you want to do when you lucid dream. Simple? Yes.
<br />

<br />
You're probably thinking, &quot;That's the most random thing I've ever heard.&quot; So... the way it works is basically at 5.5-6 hours of sleep your mind is sleepy, and after an hour of being awake it begins to become alert... and when you go back to sleep it's a the perfect state to LD. I'm really bad at explaining it, but there's a great forum dedicated to LDing. Look up <a href="http://www.LD4all.com" target="_blank">www.LD4all.com</a> and head to the forum, they have talented LDers and plenty of methods so you can find the one that suits you best. Goodluck, I hope I helped.
<br />

<br />
PS Sometimes reality checks don't work... like a lot of time mechanical tings don't work in dreams... such as once I was taking a bath in a dream, and I noticed the tub was overflowing, but I tried shutting off the water or unplugging the drain... but they didn't work, and I didn't catch it.... but I got it when a random wasp crawled out of the tub.... don't ask.

			What I do to get good at lucid dreams is to dream and become lucid. Lucid dreams come natural to me, like telepathy.
