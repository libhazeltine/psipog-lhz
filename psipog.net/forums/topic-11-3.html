			Most of the sources for the random-word-kinises are anime and comic books! How amusing!
<br />

<br />
&quot;Additionally, words ending in &quot;-kinesis&quot; are occasionally coined in fiction to indicate hypothetical parapsychological abilities relating to movement or environmental manipulation. They are often ascribed to superhero characters.&quot;

Where are you even getting that information from?  I googled &quot;Remote Electron Tampering&quot; and it pulled up information on VIDEO GAMES.

Hint: video games are not a good resource for legitimate information.

My original post still holds.

Err... Not good.  Yes, video games definitely not a good source for learning of psionics.  But I am surprised the video game is not calling it &quot;electrokinesis.&quot;  If it is calling it &quot;remote electron tampering&quot; then maybe it's not so far off.  Someone told me that is what the official name for it is.  I need an expert!
<br />

<br />
Oh, and I am really not a fluff.  Sorry if I sounded like one.  I have been interested in psionics since I was 6, and been doing actual research for a year and a half, so I know what I am talking about (or mostly, as it seems.)
<br />

<br />
I don't think &quot;biokinesis&quot; has anything to do with psionics, but I forget what it actually is.
<br />

<br />
PK, huh?... It's too bad Pyrokinesis doesn't have an abriveation... Then again, it really is all just the same skill put to different uses.

Biokinesis is the ability to change form (like control appearence).  And pyrokinesis does have an abbreviation.  Its called Pyro-PK <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Well, Bio-PK is more generally known to be affecting anything on a biological level.  A lot of things fall under it, not just changing appearance.  Just do a google on DMILS and you'll find a bunch of stuff.  One example that I remember is where they took cells from a person, and examined them... and when that same person was later crossing the street and almost got hit by a car, the cells in the lab showed signs of excitement.  Something like that, it's been a while since I read it.  Search.  Research.  Re-search. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I think what people call &quot;electrokinesis&quot; wouldn't fall under PK,

I think it is more on the side of Psi Manipulation than -Kinesis

&quot;Electro&quot; is a side effect of how Psi can feel/sound/behave i think.
