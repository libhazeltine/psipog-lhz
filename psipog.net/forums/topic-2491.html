			Ok first is first.
<br />
I woke up and I was singing a song &quot;Dani Califonia&quot; In my head.
<br />
I said It would be great if this was on tv. Out of intuition, I turn the tv on and bam the first channel its on the song is on. Wtf..? Im like ok thats a weird coincidence.
<br />

<br />
Then I like that new song by Fort Minor and I say DAMNIT BE ON THE RADIO. I turn on the radio and sure enough its on. I have had plenty other times like this. What is this called?

			A short and simple and accurate answer is this: It is called Cause and Effect.
<br />

<br />
The Law of Cause and Effect is a law of which we have only begun to touch the surface of understanding. Instead of weirding you out, try letting such seeming &quot;coincidences&quot; act as reassurances that everything happens for a reason (or a cause) and that there is a great deal of mystery within this world and within this universe for us to unfold.
<br />

<br />
No single human individual in this day and age will ever understand everything that can be understood.

			I think I'm with Roy on this one.  Whenever I think, &quot;I'd like to hear some Nirvana or Smashing Pumpkins,&quot; it seems I've got a 50% chance anyway with one of the local radio stations. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  It's not because I'm a precog, but because it happens all the time.
<br />

<br />
What's really great is when you switch stations and they're playing the exact same song.  Psychic linking between DJs?  I think not.

			well in a sense your right. Its a matter of probability. The number of desirable outcomes vs. the possible outcomes. 50/50 is pretty much it on the radio. And really and truely something like that is too broad to pu in the supernatural basket. Their are a hell of alot more concrete evidences for precog.

			Probability ties into Cause and Effect. What Arch Angel noticed was simply a working of that law. You might call it precognition I suppose. 
<br />

<br />
Roy, I think you may have exuded a slight overdose of skepticism with your comment there. Rather than blaming it on an overplayed song, do you think perhaps Arch Angel's mind may have simply tapped into a quantum calculation for a sequence of minor events?
<br />

<br />
After all, somebody chose to play that song near the exact moment arch angel wished to listen to it. 
<br />

<br />
Nutso as that may sound, that's my opinion on the matter... There's nothing &quot;psychic&quot; or &quot;supernatural&quot; about the workings of the laws that govern the universe. It's a perfectly natural set of processes that most people never notice and most of those that do choose to ignore out of incomprehension.

Do you ever listen to yourself!?  I think you need to take a step back and adopt some skepticism for yourself.  Ever hear of Occam's Razor?  Go with the simplest explanation?  You get an A for effort though.

I really can't help it if your flimsy premise carries no weight.  Do you not have enough faith in your own reasoning that you'd avoid elaborating on your point?  If that's the case, then don't bother writing it in the first place.

And look, I can feign happiness too, check it out:

&quot;Yaaay, Xiouslaidyn writes another terrific post about ill-represented obscure shit that you can't seriously apply to psionics because his ideas are non-objective and can't be verified.  Oh happy day!&quot;

Xiouslaidyn, you are wasting some bandwidth with very short posts. Also, don't defend yourself so zealously! I have a firm opinion too, but I know when to throw in the towel. Skepticism is good. How do you know it wasn't simple coincidence?
<br />

Roy, you're a moderator. You generally know what you're doing. Please, use that sense that I know you have, and let's try and prevent a flame war that just kills bandwidth with another locked thread.

			Just because you're a moderator, Roy, doesn't make you any more knowledgeable or special than the other posters. I know you know that, but your status tends to give weight when being viewed by the other posters. When you ask me to &quot;verify&quot; and &quot;back up&quot; my obscure comments, I assume you mean I should do this by coming up with some &quot;facts&quot; regarding the apparent coincidences and their connection to the universe.
<br />

<br />
Let me tell you sir, language is a very dull and ineffective medium of communication.
<br />

<br />
I have simply, over time, come to recognize what pagans and newagers refer to as &quot;signs&quot;. If you open your mind, the universe will speak to you, using symbols. It will use your environment and your experiences within the environment to reflect its messages in a way that a person can potentially grasp. The type of understanding required to see and interpret these messages is beyond any widely recognized method of communication.
<br />

<br />
I possess this type of understanding. Sometimes I see the message but can't interpret it, other times I can interpret it. 
<br />

<br />
I am not claiming to be special or above anyone. I am not making a statement like this to sound big and whoopy-dooish. I am simply telling Roy and anyone else who might be interested, that I cannot make you understand what I already do. You have to do that yourself.
<br />

<br />
PS: If you think that sounds guruish, then oh well.
