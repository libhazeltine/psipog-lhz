Cats don't have psionic powers retard. And they DEFINITELY don't go into a &quot;different world&quot;.
<br />

<br />
How would they?
<br />

<br />
Does any other animal do that?
<br />

<br />
And do you know what a theory is?
<br />

<br />
It's something that has been proved right many times but still has a large chance of being wrong.
<br />

<br />
So how would you prove that right may I ask?

			I can't believe this thread is still alive. Someone please tell me <span style="font-weight: bold">what makes cats differ from any other animal on the planet</span>! It's freakin ridiculous to think that because they, sleep/meditate/venture to other universes!, whatever, more than other animals, then all of the sudden they have psychic powers. Wow they give you those dirty looks all the time. They must be up to something. Probably reading your mind  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  I'd put this on the same level as thinking the world is flat. There is not<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal"> one </span>reason anyone has given me to make me even consider cats being different from <span style="font-style: italic">every single</span> other animal in the world. Besides being less intelligent than a lot of them. Even dogs are proven to be smarter and have larger brains. Parots are some of the smartest animals in the world. What about elephants. Why do you people think cats are so different. Is it really simply because they sleep/meditate a lot? Is it because they're &quot;loners&quot;? If so, that's very disturbing to hear seeing as MANY animals in the animal kingdom posses these same qualities. Please, I really want a response. 1 reason. Or your reason.

			Give a cat a psiball some day.  You'll be amazed.
<br />

<br />
Also, I've given my cat a construct which is programmed to act like a bird, before I left the house, and I've locked it so that I'm the ONLY one able to play with the programming and the function.  My cat can turn it 'on' or 'off' but that's about it.
<br />

<br />
Every time I get back home, the same construct is REprogrammed to act like a mouse, or a bouncy ball, or some OTHER form of cat toy.
<br />

<br />
Again, if it was a mouse, it'll be a bird, or a bouncy ball.
<br />

<br />
Please, do bother to explain how that happens?
<br />

<br />
Especially as AFTER my cat has altered the programming, it's virtually incomprehensible to ME or anyone else I have shown the construct to.  Just kinda think of it as if it was programmed it kitty language.
<br />

<br />
My cat is also able to tap into the various threads of psi (which are my 'alarm clocks') that I have crisscrossing my house.  And if I give my cat a PLAIN, unprogrammed psiball, my cat does all sorts of weird things.  Including ping me mercilessly.
<br />

<br />
Take care,
<br />

			Who's to say all other tame animals who are around psi a lot (as it sounds like your cat is) can't do the same thing.  Have you tried raising a different kind of animal and doing the same thing? Probably not. And even if you &quot;fail&quot; with the other animal, how do you know it just didn't <span style="font-style: italic">care</span> to play with the psi as your cat did? Some dogs are proven to be able to smell cancer. That doesn't mean all dogs can. Your 1 cat may be more sensitive to psi than others because you introduce it to it so much. Your one instance is no proof cats are anything special.

As far as I know of this psychic stuff (which I am far from any type of expert of any kind!) But I heard that you can have OBE while sleeping (if so I have it all the time then).

			I just wanted to add my 2 cents.
<br />

<br />
It seems as though, that anything can sense psi.  If your tried to ping your parents, or give them a psi ball to play with, maybe they would be swatting at it likes it's a fly.  Their sub-c may reprogram it because they don't like what it is doing and it could change according to their liking. 
<br />

<br />
So apprently those who doubt this are saying:
<br />
those people on heroes have extraordinary powers that we cannot accomplish or even amount to... um yea, with practice, dedication and what not you can do it, may take like 20 years, but w/e...
<br />

<br />
So who's to say that cats only operate using their sub-c, or do have psionic powers.  Maybe you're right and that one cat is more sensitive or better at it.   
<br />

<br />
It's like teaching psi to a child... he will be more likely to develope it faster and have more control and become more powerful.  Kittens may not have a consious that bothers them or they may all be &quot;child like&quot; (considering they like to play all the time and are very interactive.) 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, your sub-c does things when you may not try or want it to.  Cats may be able to do that same thing.  Their sub-c may just alter that psi ball to what they like.
<br />

<br />
And lastly, the whole they sleep and enter another universe. Umm sounds a little farfetched and don't buy it myself, but it is possible.  Hmm lets see.   If you have an OBE or AP your body is in a sleep like state, and well your etheric body is flying around.   I couldn't tell you if this is true or what not because I havn't experience AP or an OBE.
<br />

<br />
Question don't doubt.
<br />

<br />
P.S. I've tried, very little, to see if my cats would react to psi or if my dog would and I never got a responce.  I also never really cared lol or tried to make it well really good or easy to sense and ping them until they like tackle it.

You know I just pretty much smile during this whole message, I looked at your age and can understand what you are going through (all teenagers have admit and will). But you must admit that you can be wrong and people other then yourself can be right. True I can be wrong, but what I can saying is that I can be right. What I do is try to create a pleasent feeling while reading my messages. Simply because people think better when there happy. 
<br />

<br />
But what is even more importent is that even if all of us are wrong and you really are right has no excuss. 
<br />

<br />
Who are you to talk to others like this? You are still young compared to myself and most of the world, even most your own logic tells that you are be to yelled at. But your own attitude seems to be in more contorl then even the simplest of turths. I don't care how smart you are and what is your past. Even the most ridiculous of minds can comperhend that a terrorible eviorment can cause the most destrutive of elements to the human mind! Calling me names , no....anyone names donest have any excuess, its selfish and disrepectful! You have by far so much to learn.......learn to read between the lines......or that navie mind of yours will rot even more....

No proof or logical explanation of that. Their brains are different (MUCH, MUCH less adavnced) and therefor they most likely cannot do what we do. yes I know &quot;there's no proof of that either&quot;, but it's much more logical and plausible than the other world idea.

You know I just pretty much smile during this whole message, I looked at your age and can understand what you are going through (all teenagers have admit and will). But you must admit that you can be wrong and people other then yourself can be right. True I can be wrong, but what I can saying is that I can be right. What I do is try to create a pleasent feeling while reading my messages. Simply because people think better when there happy. 
<br />

<br />
But what is even more importent is that even if all of us are wrong and you really are right has no excuss. 
<br />

<br />
Who are you to talk to others like this? You are still young compared to myself and most of the world, even most your own logic tells that you are be to yelled at. But your own attitude seems to be in more contorl then even the simplest of turths. I don't care how smart you are and what is your past. Even the most ridiculous of minds can comperhend that a terrorible eviorment can cause the most destrutive of elements to the human mind! Calling me names , no....anyone names donest have any excuess, its selfish and disrepectful! You have by far so much to learn.......learn to read between the lines......or that navie mind of yours will rot even more....

I don't see how his logic says he should be yelled at. Cats sleep like regular animals with regular minds, or cats have special psi abilities and also travel to other worlds or have OBE's when they sleep. Which to you is <span style="font-weight: bold">logical</span>. Yes, his attitude is bad but I can understand why. It's very frustrating to be debating such a rediculous idea. (especially with <span style="font-weight: bold">no basis</span> behind it) I too, laughed when I read your post only because it seems the 1st thing out of anyone's mouth here when debating anything they have no proof for is &quot;DON'T BE SO CLOSE MINDED!&quot; It's not a matter of being close minded. He (and I), read your ideas, comtemplated them, then gave you our opinion about them. Just because we don't believe in it doesn't mean we're close minded. There's a fine line between being open to ideas and being naieve. There's no basis, scientific evidence, or logical reason at all why some might think cats have &quot;psi powers&quot;.</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody"></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

It's fine. I know how it feels to be angry at someone on here and not be able to punch them in the face  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
