			after reading all the questions about phasing that triggered me to fall through my mouse, it felt like frickin losing a limb, aka NOT FUN to do &gt;.&lt; &quot;How do I not phase?&quot; is a better question to ask honestly. btw an idea to reprogram my shields to stop it?

			Phasing yourself sounds too dangerous to do...you could get stuck in something, or something stuck in you...or cut in half if you lose focus while phasing through something. But phasing objects sounds interesting, I think i'll try that.

			Indeed, the only real fun I could see comming out of this is phasing objects combined with pk. For instance, sliding an object through a book or something. Or if there is a magazine in a drawer then phase it through or something. That would be an eye sore.

			i actaully did phasing for about 2 months a while back and i actually did it on a few occasions. all i did was get super relaxed and have my eyes closed and make sure there was a wall in front of me or something. then i would extend my arm through the wall. after i knew my  hand was in i would gently open my eyes to not break my focus and it was through. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Interesting. It seems that more people can phase faster then roll objects. (just stating given the succes rate).

			Just a little note; no deaths have been reported due to pahsing, and people who have succeeded while trying have not lost any fingers, toes, etc. Therefore, I doubt non-idiotic use of this human function is likely to kill someone.

			That's good to hear.
<br />
I have no interest in learning to Phase myself or objects...sounds too dangerous to me...it right up there with being an Empath, but someone should try this.
<br />

<br />
Phase an object...such as a pen, and PK/TK it into something solid, such as a brick, then after it is inside, stop phasing it, by either willing yourself to stop, or purposely losing your focus...I suppose they are the same thing.
<br />

<br />
See what happens. Does the pen move the atoms of the brick out of the way? or does the brick simply cut the pen into pieces?
<br />

<br />
Sounds interesting.

			I had always imagined a very gruesome sight if someone screwed up in the middle of phasing. Ahem, I had imagined the pieces of gravel from the wall get caught in the body stuck in the vessels basically the pieces were filling up the space in the body and the flesh/living material mixed and equally made way for the gravel stuck in the flesh in the brain all space was equally divided up. Gravel and flesh became one and 50% percent of the body's makeup was of gravel now, equally placed and spaced throughout the body taking places where once organs or just body had been. Disgusting. However I don't do psychokinetic things anyways.
