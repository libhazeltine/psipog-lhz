I think he didn't mean force, rather energy.
<br />

<br />
Force has something to do with it. Two particles don't start moving or collide until some sort of force is exerted on them.
<br />

<br />
And matter can be created or destroyed. Here's an example:
<br />

<br />
A high energy X-ray can collide with the nucleus of an atom and disappear and two particles, an electron and an anti-electron (a.k.a. positron), will appear in its place. So extra matter is being produced from no matter. The important thing is that the amount of total energy stays the same, but the energy can change its form from electromagnetic radiation (the X-ray) to matter (the electron and positron). Also, an electron and positron can collide with and annihilate each other, producing X-rays.

Lol, it actually equals energy. A handful of antimatter detonated would equal more or less the energy released from an atomic bomb. I think you should start reading up a bit as well. And Energy=Force is like saying Baseball Bat=Swing.

			A photon is energy; it's just the particular form that energy tends to take after a particle-antiparticle annihilation.
<br />

<br />
Light is made up of photons, y'know? <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Other common examples of energy:
<br />
kinetic - movement energy, like the energy a speeding bullet or car transfers to something it hits
<br />
potential - stored by an object being in a certain position in a gravitational, magnetic, electric etc. field - like the energy that makes a brick move when you drop it. (This kind of energy is closely related to a class of forces called 'conservative forces')
<br />
chemical - stored in the structure of molecules, i.e. bonds between atoms, like the energy that comes out of wood when it burns
<br />
nuclear - stored in bonds inside atoms (between smaller particles), like the energy released by a uranium plant
<br />
heat energy, radiation energy (photons) etc.

			Well, monatomic gold can dissappear (I read this on a link on the forum, not sure where), which means that matter can at least go away for a little while. It would be pretty impressive to see that happen, in my opinion.
<br />

<br />
And matter can be destroyed and transformed, but not created. You could theoretically take a mass of hydrogen and eventually transform it into almost any other gas, but it's silly to think any technology like that would have a use.

			That would be handy. Convert Hydrogen into something more stable, and then when you need it, convert it back. Or you could convert large amounts of non-dense elements into something more compact for easier transportation.

Matter can be created through a process called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_production" target="_blank" class="postlink">pair production</a>.  Basically, a high energy photon interacts with an atomic nucleus and forms an electron and a positron.  The minimum energy of a photon to produce an electron/positron pair is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%282+x+%28electron+mass+x+c%5E2%29%29+in+MeV" target="_blank" class="postlink">1.02 MeV</a>.  This corresponds to a photon of frequency <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%282+x+%28electron+mass+x+c%5E2%29%29+%2F+h+in+exahertz" target="_blank" class="postlink">247 EHz</a>, which falls in the high energy x-ray range.
<br />

<br />
The minimum energy of a photon to produce a proton/antiproton pair is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%282+x+%28proton+mass+x+c%5E2%29%29in+GeV" target="_blank" class="postlink">1.88 GeV</a>.  This corresponds to a photon of frequency <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%282+x+%28proton+mass+x+c%5E2%29%29+%2F+h+in+zettahertz" target="_blank" class="postlink">454 ZHz</a>, which falls in the gamma-ray range.  This energy is easily attainable in modern day particle accelerators.
<br />

<br />
As for the energy required for the materialization of matter, lets just try to materialize a minuscule 1 gram of matter.  E = m c^2. So, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=1+gram+x+c%5E2" target="_blank" class="postlink">E = 8.99 x 10^13 Joules</a>.  To give you a benchmark, the Hiroshima bomb was a 15 kiloton bomb, which corresponds to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=15+x+4.184+x+10%5E12+joules" target="_blank" class="postlink">6.28 x 10^13 Joules</a>.  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaton" target="_blank" class="postlink">1 Ton of TNT = 4.184 x 10^9 Joules.</a>)  So it would actually take more energy to materialize 1 gram of matter, than the energy released in the Hiroshima nuclear explosion!

			Y'know, I came up with this idea a really long time ago, during some idle musings in a useless class that I got 5 credits for. Unless I'm sorely mistaken, matter is, so to speak, super-condensed energy. 
<br />

<br />
E=mc(squared)
<br />

<br />
I interpret this to mean that a certain amount of mass (in kilograms), times the speed of light (in metres per second) squared, would give us the amount of energy needed to create that mass (in Joules). Inversely, if we had a certain amount of energy (in Joules), we just need to divide by the speed of light (in metres per second) squared, and we could find out how much mass (in kilograms) could be made with it.
<br />

<br />
Theoretically, this should be right. But we'd need to figure out the nature of Psi first. If it's just electrons, then we'd have a bit of a problem, because we'd need to get protons and neutrons from somewhere.
<br />

<br />
Sorry if I'm being redundant, but whatever. I'm tired. It's like, 23:08 (that's 11:08pm for you non-military types). I'm going to bed. As Violent J once said &quot;And if there's anyone we forgot, fuck you! It's like, 5 in the morning!&quot;

Your logic is kinda flawed. You mean that, the existence of a God is to balance the unexistence of a God? That doesn't even make sense. You say the balance of things depends on the existence of others, but, if something isn't there in the first place, how can you make an opposite for it?
