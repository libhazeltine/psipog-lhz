			Im assuming this'd go here but anyway.... I apparently have picked a fine time to be oversensitive and am really begining to become omnivarious with the feels of my house and my pickup lets call it of either my sub-cs walking around or another spirit in my house and for awhile tonight its been keeping me awake. Any quick thoughts to help me stop this or control it'd be better. Thanks in advance

			You could just be sensing your own Psi, if you have been practicing.
<br />

<br />
For example, if I go into my garage (decked out as a hang-out spot) when no one is in there, and attempt to sense energy, I feel it all around moving about. Alot of people hang out in my garage and there are a lot of exciting things that happen.

You can either shield, or you can actively move the stuff around (if you know how to move psi).

			No, it was actually a spirit age 18 named Katie looking for a little kid named Jason that she used to babysit, her clothes resembled that of the 1940's when my house was still a daycare thingy. Her exact ping message words were &quot;Hey, you, have you seen a little boy about or yeh tall, blue eyes, blonde hair should be wearing pants and a white shirt? I'm suposed to take him home now for dinner but i cant seem to find him, and he often hides under the matress there, Ive been looking all over here and cant find him.&quot; I answered &quot;No, sorry I havent. Well you could try his house maybe hes there already. Someone else might have taken him already home.&quot; She nodded and walked through my wall, outside, upon looking I couldnt see her anymore.  Also I do what you mentioned for tracking my sub-cs mostly, as well as basic energy movements, though I forgot to tell that this was alot more.... well best put &quot;Pugnet&quot; in my mind as for activity in my room. Ill try sheilding next time if it bothers me that bad again, although I hate to be rude to others thatre normally just looking for a simple answer.
