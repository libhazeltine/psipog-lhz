			Thank you, Apollo.
<br />

<br />
I think this community needs to see that said.
<br />

<br />
Heck, the entire OEC needs to see this.
<br />

<br />
Just … thank you.  We need to learn how to love our fellow psions, our fellow human beings.
<br />

<br />
It all comes down to that in the end.  We're all human.  We're all born.  Eventually, we'll all die.  And during our time on this earth, we need to treat everyone with compassion and understanding, not with ridicule and disdain.  All too often the latter is the case and not the former.
<br />

<br />
This entails watching our speech, being consciously aware of what we say until the time comes that we can be compassionate and kind and loving without having to think about it.
<br />

<br />
Apollo, again, thank you for making this thread.  It shows a lot.
<br />

Well, Demonhunter hasn't responded but I think I may be able to respond for him because I think the same way. (I think  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />) 
<br />
Well, with the first question about fear. Like Demonhunter said, if you let go of fear, you are able to concentrate on reality and what really is. Fear is only a distraction. Do you understand now?  
<br />
EDIT: Okay, here is something to explain it even better, pay attention to MartialArtist's Posts. 
<br />
<a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=5885" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=5885</a>
<br />

<br />
As for the second question to Demonhunter about thinking yourself as a &quot;god&quot; is very easy for me explain, because I do it. Okay, if you think of yourself as a &quot;god&quot; or something very powerful, your mind may start to think of you as that way. But you must have no doubt whatsoever. (That's how I do it) I have been thinking of myself as very powerful for many years, and it works. I am stronger than most kids at my school, except the football players that are way bigger than me and take steroids. But that is because I doubt myself about the football players. But not about anyone else. You know how some say to think positive, it is like that except being very positive  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I sorted wantd him to answer for many reasons but I admire your effort. I think fear should be paid attendsion to simply because it exist. Also I think it difficult to think yourself as a &quot;god&quot; like fingure simply to get yourself to higher grounds. To me it sounds your living a lie...look you use a lie to get yourself stronger...I simply don't like the feel of pretending to be powerful to get there. Simply because other people cross my mind.

			&quot;I agree with Apollo also but I'm interested what you think of fear? I think fear is nesscery.&quot;
<br />

<br />
You're right i think. What i experienced concerning fear is that i felt fear in specific situations and after having made up my mind i wouldn't feel fear any more. Fear seems to be for me like a limitation of your own possibilities. But fear seems to to be for me also kind of necessary. 
<br />
Without the fear i wouldn't know that in specific situations i COULD do many different things to the things that i used to do, but it is also important that i could do these things only if i WANTED to to them. 
<br />

<br />
Another thing is that these are just thoughts. But they let me do more stuff that i really like to do or let me do it easier. So thoughts seem to me very powerful. The thought of myself and everyone being a &quot;god&quot; or &quot;godly being&quot; came to me as i thought of evolution. The Evolution idea, at least how i understood it, speaks of life getting more diversity and complexity during generations and ages. 
<br />
Now, if you get back in time to moments when life didn't exist and there were just planets and stars and whatever...and get even before that to the point when there is something like a beginning of everything (IF there can be a beginning at all)... 
<br />
IF you think about that and then think about what you are, then you MUST be a part of the something from the beginning of everything. This is definately very weird and made me think about &quot;god&quot; or &quot;gods creation&quot; differently. It may be interesting that i thought of religious doctrines as bullshit before. I don't think that way anymore, though i think of religions as bullshit, but for different reasons. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;But if I love everyone, how am I going to get to kill things?&quot;
<br />

<br />
In my opinion loving everyone is a way of recognizing that everyone is the same like you and at the same way totally different. What i mean by that is that you accept and respect other people's way of living and treat them like you wanted to be treated by them. That leads to mutual understanding which is the basic for human communication and living together. Pointing that out doesn't make it easy though. Take a look at human history or at the politics nowadays and see why wars happen.
<br />

<br />
If you are now at the point of loving everyone, you won't want to get to kill things. There have to be significant reasons for letting you think that you have to kill things.

A lie is something that isn't true...am I stronger than most, yes. Then, am I lieing? I don't think you fully understand me. You must know of the powers of the mind. Mind over matter and etc. This technique is mearly just that, tricking your mind to make it so. I by no means think of myself actually as a god that can shoot lightning out of my fingers and shoot laser beams. I just make my mind make me stronger. It's just positive thinking really. Do you not believe in positive thinking?

			I feel tired today and I havent really been able to get myself to think correctly (on my level anyway). I scan through the fear thing and found it slihglty interesting. Misunderstanding you was my own fault and I sorry about that. Of cource most people think there better then most, does it make it ture? Perhaps, or Perhaps not.
<br />

<br />
Truthly I don't think there is people who are &quot;better&quot; or &quot;wrost&quot; then me. I don't want to catology people like that is sounds totaly wrong to me. I tend to think people just are better then in other things while others are better then me in other things.
<br />

<br />
As for the evolution thing DemonHunter said eariler. I simply like to put this down.
