			Personally I don't think that tarot cards actually work. They are very interesting though, and I've been wanting to get a deck. I want to go about it properly, and so consulted a friend who is into more occult stuff. He said that I <span style="font-style: italic">must</span> receive the cards as a gift, which presents a problem because I don't know anyone who would get me a set of tarot cards as a gift...
<br />

<br />
Anyways, I think you're making mountains out of molehills here. Creepy coincidences happen. But playing around with stacks of paper isn't a very good way to tell your future.

Personally, I believe Tarot cards could work, based on how pendling works. But, it's late right now, and I don't feel like typing a long explanation, so I'll leave it to you all to either already know about pendling, or to look it up yourself (I believe there's an article here at Psipog, and if not, go <a href="http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com" target="_blank" class="postlink">here</a>).

<br />

<br />
As to this future telling, I don't really see no need to know personaly.
<br />

<br />
By knowing the future I know what is going to happen and doom to do it. So I'm either really happy, or really sad. But this sort of orbits around the fact that the future is absolut which I'm not so sure on. However if the future is absolut, that really don't mean I have to follow it, I can still do what I want with the same out come.
<br />

<br />
The whole future telling don't sound right to me. Perhaps to the right people but it just don't look right.
<br />

<br />
...what exactly can I win with these points?

Sorta like the Terminator quote: &quot;There's no fate but the fate we make for ourselves.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I'm still undecided on it all. My theory is that while we have free will, some things are going to happen no matter what. Kinda hard for me to come up with an example, though. Eh, just be creative and come up with something yourself.

Well, let's look at prize number 1. It's a brand new car! *annoying game show theme starts playing*
<br />

<br />
Now, prize number 2 is a completely random amount of cash between $1000 and $50000000, the random number generated by a quantum-improbability field, which we create by cross-patching some tri-lithium ionizers through a flux-capacitor, with the energy source running through high-resistance poly-directional diodes. Will you risk it?

			An easy, yet still perfectly viable and understandable hypothesis is that any means of foretelling the future doesn't tell you the SET future, just a POSSIBLE one. Because, if you know something will happen, you can often times stop it. Therefore, If you prevent something foretold from happening (think Jonah and the repentance of Nineveh, if you know what I'm talking about), then the foretold event won't happen, and the future has been influenced. 
<br />

<br />
But, if nothing gets done to change the course of events, then the foretold event will happen as predicted. This means that free will is still a factor. Therefore, preognition is just an early-warning system, telling you about an upcoming event that can be prevented or allowed to happen.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Thus, precognition of any kind (raw, tarot, divination, prophecy, etc.) doesn't predict the way things WILL be, just how they'll be if certain variables don't change. Free will still has a place, even in a world with supernatural predetermination.</span>

			Perhaps the bad luck was just in your head. Instead of thinking &quot;I'm gonna have bad luck because the tarot cards said so,&quot; go up to a mirror, look yourself in the eye, and tell yourself &quot;I will have good luck.&quot;

Of course, that brings up this question: What if by trying to prevent that future from happening, you accidentally cause it? Like, for example, you clairvoyantly predict that a certain building is going to catch fire at a certain time, so you go there to prevent the fire, and accidentally knock over a lamp, causing the fire.
<br />

Don't you just love discussing fate, free will, predicting the future, and other such things?

Yeah, I love these discussions, because my theory always holds! As I said before, everything that's predicted is the <span style="font-weight: bold">most likely</span> future. Now, it's quite possible that you try to prevent bad things from happening, and in your exertions, you cause those very things (think Anakin-Padme problem in <span style="font-style: italic">Star Wars Episode III</span>). Your actions would be another unchanged variable leading to the incident.
<br />

<br />
This is why RV is helpful. If you get a random premonition (sp?) that a building's going to burn down at a certain time, do an RV session, with the cause of the blaze as the target. If you find that the cause is you, stay the hell away from the building. That would change a variable, and alter the outcome. 
<br />

My theory holds! <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			But, how many people would think to RV the cause of the fire? Let's say you predict that your parents' house is going to burn down in the next hour, and they live 45 minutes away. You would be in a rush to get to their house to stop the fire, and wouldn't have time to RV anything.
<br />

<br />
I think it all depends on the scenario.
<br />

<br />
Also, I think perhaps some things are bound to happen. Like &quot;Judgment Day&quot; in Terminator 3, for example. Their actions in the second Terminator movie delayed Judgment Day, but it didn't prevent it, as the SkyNet computer still ended up being created, just by a different person/group.
