			yes yes glass is a liquid.  Thens there that fancy stuff you make in middle school called like ooblek.  It's just cornstarch and water.   If you poke it really hard your finger wont go into it.  But if you just rest your finger on top of it, it'll fall in like quicksand.  that stuff was always cool

			hmm, well glass is only a liquid a supper high temps.
<br />
but i dont think it can be a solid and a liquid all the time.
<br />

<br />
but the cornstarch and water compound is actualy very close to a solid liquid. it has the dencity of a solid of somthing comes in contact with it at a high speed, but if let to set it will take the shape of its container.
<br />

<br />
it has both liquid and solid properties <img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" />

hmm thats cool. i never knew that could happen to glass.
<br />
but still the cornstarch water compound is the closest thing to a solid liquid that we have talked about here.

			Unfortunately, something cannot be both solid and liquid. The topic name is known as an oxymoron, or paradox if you want. Although the name of the topic sounds cool, it is not that relevant to what the author actually posted about. A state between solid and liquid, OR liquid and gas, has not been achieved ever, so even if there was one, it cannot be achieved with our technology.

malleable solids and low viscosity liquids would be the best way to classify materials that appear solid and liquid.

			About the glass being a liquid thing - For example, look at the really old chapels and churches. I mean REALLY old. Centuries old. Look at one of the glass window panes. The top part of the window pane will be thinner than the bottom part of the glass, which is thicker. Glass indeed is a liquid, but a rather slowly flowing one (at room temperature).

			SO, like a super uber low viscosity liquid.
<br />

<br />
hmm i might do that more on a hot day, when the heat is increased when it trys to move through the glass. eventualy over time it will slowly turn to glop.

Close, but no cigar. It is like a &quot;super uber HIGH viscosity&quot; liquid.

And what are you trying to do? I don't understand the second part of your post.

			YES sorry its high viscosity.
<br />
the higher the viscosity, the more it resists flow.
<br />

<br />
i was saying before that on a hot day the heat would increase when it moved through glass. As a result over time the glass would slowly droop towards the gavitational point ( the floor ) <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
 <img src="images/smiles/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" border="0" /> long story short, the glass melts slowly with heat.

			have you people never heard of non-newtonian liquids?  That ooblek stuff somebody mentioned is an example.  So is silly putty, gak, and all kinds of other stuff.  non-newtonian liquids act like a liquid and a solid at the same time.  Which it acts like depends on the amount of pressure placed on them, not the temperature.
<br />

<br />
also, glass is always a liquid, not a solid.  The viscosity of glass (it has a very, very, very high viscosity) is the reason it is so durable and doesn't break whenever there is a loud noise.
<br />

<br />
And just another point, is that there are a whole slew of elements that can only exist in two states, no matter what the temperature is.  I'm not sure, but I believe mercury and helium are two of them, I'm also fairly certain glass is another example.  There are also some that jump from solid to gas.
<br />

<br />
But to the point, there's no such thing as a solid liquid.  Something can not be in two physical states at the same time.  non-newtonian fluids are the best you'll ever get.
