			I just had one last night where I was some random superhero with a grappling hook and a sword, and I knew kung fu.
<br />
I was fighting some evil guy with pale ugly skin and a cape, and I was kicking his ass and then he retreated and I was using the grappling hook in a city, trying to catch up but he flew away ;-;
<br />
I gained the LD right after I fought him.

			I had a dream a while back in which I was going into a banquet hall and it was a really grey boring place and I thought 'Hell, this is <span style="font-weight: bold">my</span> dream and <span style="font-weight: bold">I</span> want it to be the banquet hall from the Harry Potter movies!' and it was. I'm still not sure if that was a lucid dream. 
<br />

<br />
It seems that if you are in control in a lucid dream, it could be anything you want it to be. So if you want it to be an anime dream, why not? Dreams as a whole, lucid or not, are likely to reflect your own experience and interests, so if you watch alot of anime or play alot of video games they're bound to show up in your dreams.

anyways, i believe lucid dreaming means a dream that you are awake in right? if it is then yah, there shouldnt be any reason you shouldnt be able to have one about games/tv shows. i normally dont realize i'm dreaming, i'm an overly cautious person, and my dreams are rather close to real life, so even if i am consious during the dream i never do anything to break the flow out of fear i might be awake.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I don't particularly care what your actual age is. It's the age you act that matters. This goes for everyone. The whole &quot;zomg I lucid dreamed into a video game&quot; thing is really f*cking lame. Sure, maybe an ordinary dream that you have no control over might be in a game. That's cool; lord knows I've had some really strange dreams; last week I had a dream, and when I woke up the only thing I remembered of it was a map of the ethnic groups of Chad (I checked later, it was partially correct). But a lucid dream? Find something better to do than live out your favorite cartoon. Or, if you want to live out your favorite cartoon, for goodness' sakes, don't tell anyone.

			So what do you do in your lucid dreams that's so much better than having a laugh? What are lucid dreams for if not to enjoy your imagination at work? And if you use the backdrop or characters from fictional settings what is so wrong with that?
<br />

<br />
So the other people on this thread are somewhat excited about their dreams and enjoy chatting about them? Again, what is so wrong with that?
<br />

<br />
You deem the subjects childish. So would it be better if they set their dreams in Dickens' London, or the Forest of Arden?

how about instead of saying 'you are all idiots for having fun in a dream' you undestand that this particular thread is about if you've ever had a lucid dream and desided to make the dream like a show or game? you ever heard of fan fictions, or game/show based RPs? well a lucid dream is better than either because its like you are there a bit more than just imagining it. 
<br />

<br />
instead of spoiling everyones fun time in this thread, or denouncing someone's serious topic because you dont believe it without proof of it's impossibility, keep your mouth shut.

I'm not saying &quot;you are all idiots for having fun in a dream&quot;.

Thank you for putting words in my mouth, though.
<br />

<br />
And I certainly believe everything in this thread as much as I believe anything here; if I didn't I wouldn't be posting here - what's the point of posting on a topic which I believe to be a bunch of lies?
<br />

<br />
With that, I will let the children have their fun.

Oh, and you need to see a psychologist.

			I dunno. I am inclined to agree, but I also have to say that, just because these people arnt in persuit of more &quot;formidable&quot; reasons for lucid dreaming, doesnt give you the right to bash it. (I know you wernt bashing it, in a sense, its just that everyone took it like that) 
<br />

<br />
These are just people that are either very new, or mildly new to things like doing anything you want in a dream. People tend to want to get some of the &quot;I have always wanted to [insert random indiana jones reject situation here]&quot; out of their systems. They will eventually grow tired of that, and try to actually understand it. Which will take researching it, and observing it through a fish-eye lense. (AKA: Scientific method thnx to keif for the new word <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />) 
<br />

<br />
But seriously, Its ok for kids to be kids. Dont waste that childhood. Its gone all too soon, and sooner than you think.

			Personally, I wasn't suggesting you were disbelieving lucid dreams. However, I'd like to find out what your point is and how you decide what is childish and what is fun? You <span style="font-style: italic">seem</span> to be using this as an opportunity to feel superior to others on the thread, if that isn't your object I'm a little confused as to what is. 
<br />

<br />
Maybe some people <span style="font-style: italic">do</span> need to consider whether what they are experiencing might be the symptoms of illness. You are hardly going to persuade them of that by sneering at them though.
<br />

<br />
Magician - there is absolutely no need to leave childishness behind when you become an adult. I haven't.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

It looks like you're stepping on everyone's toes and being a &quot;bully&quot; in a sense. Allow me to set the record straight. I think sharing your opinion in such a harsh and disrespectful manner is quite frankly stupid. Especially when you have people like me moderating the forums. I'll be more than happy to put you in your place.
<br />

<br />
I don't believe you have any right to be telling anyone how to live their lives or telling people to act their age. Look at yourself, you're completely ruining the topic discussion by stating your unwanted opinion and making people become angry. 
<br />

<br />
Have you ever heard the quote &quot;If you have nothing nice to say then don't say it at all&quot;? Well, I have a quote of my own that I follow &quot;If you have nothing to contribute to a conversation then do not speak&quot;. I suggest you follow that quote and stop acting like an immature child. 
<br />

<br />
Your obvious intention was to share your opinion by basically stating &quot;Hey, this is a stupid conversation, it sounds childish, grow up everyone&quot;. Well my misguided  friend, I personally find this topic interesting and I was looking forward to hearing any stories, ideas or experiences that the members have to offer. Do you think I'm childish? If you do, you my friend are wrong.
<br />

<br />
If you wish to share your opinion in the next topic conversation try following your statements instead of being a hypocrite. You may be sharing your opinion based on how you feel about this topic conversation but the fact of the matter is many lucid dreamers use movies, books or imaginary backgrounds to experience them in a lucid dream.
<br />

<br />
In a lucid dream, anything is possible. Even having your dream in a made up or fictional setting. Perhaps you should actually do some research on lucid dreaming before you share your opinion. That would be the intelligent thing to do. 
<br />

<br />
Please take my advice. I don't want to come back and see or anyone stating incorrect information based on how you personally feel. If you know that sharing your opinion will have an negative impact on the conversation or knowing that your opinion is negative and will upset other members, please do not post. There are many other topic discussions, don't go looking for a fight. You really don't want to run into me again.
<br />

<br />
As for everyone else, let's try to stay on topic. Let's put this minor upset in the past and let's continue the topic conversation. If I hear anymore insults or arguing, I'll be forced to lock this thread.
<br />

<br />
I myself have has many lucid dreams where I've used fictional backgrounds as my setting. Remember, in a lucid dream anything is possible. If you want to pick a certain scenario for your lucid dream, you can certainly do it. 
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />
