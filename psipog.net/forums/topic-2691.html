			i dont understand anything anyone says.. i'm stuck on a psywheel -.-... all i know is my goal is to try to move it and everyone is talking about techniques and visualizations and energies... wtf!??!
<br />

<br />
sorry for being sooo.. pesty and aggrevated but really.. what is it you're talking about.. what exactly am i even trying to visualize if i'm trying to visualize anything at all.. proper technique? umm.. all i say to myself is.. the psiwheel must move.. move it.. move it.. move it.. move it.. and of course.. it doesnt move.. what aggrevates me is knowing other people are doing techniques and visuals while i'm sittin here like a moron telling it .. or my subconscious, to move it. -.-
<br />

<br />
tips please.. what is it you're talking about.. what do u visualize.. what am i (IN GENERAL) suppose to visualize.. i've already tried to visualize it moving.. like
<br />
this flap will move from point a.. to point b.. go from a to b..

			yo! well the beleif in psionics is that any psi energy is a byproduct of your nervous system.
<br />

<br />
in order to stimulate the generation of psi energy we use visualizations (pretty much imagining it) and sometimes tactile visualization (feeling it)
<br />

<br />
the key to telekinesis is your thought patterns. add a mix of science and psionics, and suddenly it all seems logical. this is my beginner method:
<br />

<br />
think, we have various bioelectromagnetic fields surruonding our body due to the nervuos system and activity of the brain. now sit down, and just try to visualize these fields around you, from your point of view.
<br />

<br />
now think that anything in your energy field can be altered/controlled. look at the psi-wheel and start to get it into your head that its in your area, and you can affect it.
<br />

<br />
the baby steps are always the hardest, because you need to acknoweldge the existence of psionics to gain the beleif in order to progress.
<br />

<br />
so anyways, now visualize these fields coming about a foot off your body. place your hand(s) near the psi wheel and visualize a sort of hurricane brewing at the central focus point, which is the psi wheel. start to try and feel the wheel moving, like it has to, like gravity is affecting its motion.
<br />

<br />
keep trying this until you get lucky!
<br />

			Its really so hard for me to visualize anything.. if i were to imagine anything i'd have to close my eyes.. and when i do that, i open my eyes to see if it worked and it may have moved but i know i'm in a WELL ventilated room and like.. every second another breeze most likely moved it.. possibly even my breath... 
<br />

<br />
1.. i'm not a visual person.. and 2.. can u not move it just by willing it to? like repeating &quot;move it.. move it.. move it.. move it..&quot; or &quot;spin, spin spin spin spin spin&quot; etc.?

For me, I do that prior to performing PK. I don't repeat a mantra, but I do analyze all my anxieties and doubts and I reason with myself in order to dispel them, so I am eased and relaxed when I begin practicing. When I actually perform PK, I tend to avoid trying to control it, and I mostly &quot;just do it.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
That was my initial problem. I imagined I could just believe/convince myself that it would happen, which was not the case. I had to focus on the wheel and keep a clear mind. Believing is definitely part of the process, but that happens before I even begin practicing. It's part of the preparation (for me).
<br />

<br />
P.S. I have been making journal entries, since the first day I began practicing. I just put the link in my signature. I'm a beginner too, so hopefully you can understand my experience by reading it  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			so i could basicaly tell myself before i even start. I'm going to spin it. or I will spin it. etc. 
<br />

<br />
i dunno its just.. i'm so negative about myself -.- if anything i'd like to hear people's stories, of their first attempts and then their first accomplishment and how they kept going. I think that really helps a beginner (me)...

			Visualization never worked for me.  I usually just make my head feel a heavy pressure at the front of my head.  Then just do it(NI's tech).  And expect it to move.
<br />

<br />
and to Avius...

wtf?!?!?!

			I dont bother with energy or visualizations either. Some people prefer to visualize energy to help them &quot;connect&quot; with the object and move it.

I just tap the paper to spin it and then continue to move it using telekinesis. It's discussed in the link above.
<br />

<br />
It took about a week or two before I managed to move it. The paper almost stopped spinning, I kept willing it, and then it started moving faster. I only moved it about 90 degrees but I knew I moved it  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

Try placing pieces of card, like birthday cards, around the wheel to block airflow.

			by the way you're seeming so aggrevated.. relax? meditate a bit, clear your head, don't expect results everytime you do it. Sometimes it takes longer than others.
