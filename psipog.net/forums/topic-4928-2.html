			I have always been able to do stuff, especially when I was a kid. My big thing now and then was moving the air ( I'm told that's called aerokenisis, but I didn't want to say that for fear of looking like a complete fluffy-bunny). Now before anyone launches in with the &quot;yeah rights&quot; I swear I'm tellign the truth, but I managed to lift myself about a foot and a half off the ground once. I also moved my friend's ball over a fence somehow. Then there was all the precog stuff that I have always had.
<br />
I did all that for ages without really thinking about psionics and stuff, then I suppose it kind of switched off for a while, I don't know why.
<br />
 Today I can use PK on the air to great effect (Not that I can cause tornados or anything <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />) but I can't move other things when I try. I'll meditate for a while, try moving a psi-wheel, and fail. Then I'll get frustrated, and something will fall off a shelf. I kid you not.

			Not really Psionics, but when I was young, about 4 or 5, I was playing in my room.   Then, just in front of my window, there was this tall, black figure.   It had a hood of some sort on it's head, and it had HUGE claws on it's hands(kinda like Wolverine's, I suppose).   I ran SCREAMING to my parents downstairs.    By the time we got back up, there was nothing there, and the window was open.  The reason that the window being open was freaky, was because: 1. We never opened my window.   It had no screen, so my parents never opened it when I was up in my room alone, for fear that I'd fall.   2. The window was practically painted shut anyway(or at least it seemed like it to me, as it was very heavy).  I never could open that window.
<br />

<br />
My parents remember this, too(well, the me running to them, and the window being open part at least).
<br />

<br />
I won't name it a demon or anything(not here, at least) as that's borderline religious.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Something that WAS Psionic, though, happened when I was around 10 or 11.   Me and my friends were fooling around, when someone brought up DBZ(you heard me....).    We talked about how cool it would be if we could do DBZ-stuff.   After a while, we began to pretend we were doing that stuff, and then when I did one, someone noticed that something actually went into my hands.   And so it continued for several months like that, all of us creating(very basic) psi-balls(though, I'd be willing to bet the first dozen psi-balls were just our eyes playing tricks on us).   Fairly quickly, we grew out of it.   Except for me.  I continued doing basic psi-balls(without the DBZ-edge, thank goodness), even starting some basic programming(making it fly around on a pre-dertermined path, making it explode, sticky, etc.).  For several years, I just went on, practicing my(DBZ-free  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ) psi-balls.
<br />

<br />
About a year ago, I stopped it all together, figuring I'd just been tricking myself over the years.   Six months ago, I got the bug again, but this time, to see if anything like what I'd experienced had happened to anyone else.   That's when I found PsiPog.   I read about manipulation, and it was EXACTLY what I did.   From the feeling/movement of psi, right down to programming(I used to call conceptual programming &quot;Blasting&quot;).
<br />

<br />
So, in an odd, fluff-to-non-fluff sort of way, I discovered Psi Manip. on my own.

If this is true then i'm going to ask you this. Have you seen the movie &quot;The Passion of the christ&quot; or something like that. If you did then you see a bald man with a hood and all black and claws. thats the devil. and if its true about the shadows then believe it or not it was the devil. not to scare you or anything.

I've seen it, but I can't remember much of it.

Though I've got my own thoughts on what 'it' was, I'm not going to say what I think, just cause it goes into a bit of a sensitive area(i.e. religion); so we'll just leave it at what I posted.

Except that I've always had a passionate, burning hatred of naps, even when I was little I would never take a nap.   So I wasn't anywhere near asleep.

<br />
Still, it could have been an over-active imagination, but what freaks(and freaked my parents out) was that the window was open after I returned to my room(again, that window was never open while I was in there, and was too heavy for me to open myself at the time).

			As a child I have (and continue to have) clairvoyant experiences. For example my mind was wandering on the way to the mall with my mother once and I imagined myself meeting a classmate in the book store. Well, I got to the book store and that person was not only in the store; but standing in the EXACT spot I had imagined them to be in. I've also known when my friend got a new computer... it all sounds pretty useless and perhaps petty but they were, nevertheless, fun experiences. (Some people are afraid when things like that happen; but I always thought it natural)
<br />

<br />
I also was able to &quot;call up&quot; or &quot;calm down&quot; the wind just like some one else said they could. I haven't really done it lately and last time I tried it didn't work too well; however one day the wind was blowing seeminly non-stop and I calmed it for a good five or so minutes.
