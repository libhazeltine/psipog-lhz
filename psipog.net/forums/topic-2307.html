			Last night was rather odd to say the very least. I started with the now normal routine of going to bed, watching a little bit of the television and then try and have an OBE, or at least get in to the right state. I turned the TV off, and like usual, it was pitch black until my mind focused. Unlike the usual, I could see and feel a lot more entities then there normally are (sometimes there is one, but usually none) in my room. Now, when it is dark I can &quot;see&quot; things a lot better, as in things like my own energy. What I saw weren't really obvious, but I could see something maybe move in front of me, or just sense things around me.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Earlier today I noticed that my shields were pretty crummy at the moment, I was having trouble making any new ones and reinforcing the old ones. I didn't want to take them down and try because I was obviously having trouble, better to have something crappy rather than nothing at all :/.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Anyway, tonight it was more like the darkness around me &quot;embraced&quot; me, it felt evil in a way. Oddly enough, I sort of liked it instead of the normal getting scared. At first I kind of was but I calmed myself and beat the fear. I started making my body fall asleep, but this time when I would actually fall asleep I would get slightly disturbing/scary images, I can't remember any of them, I hardly could make them out when I saw them, but there were a lot. This happened a few times until the point where I think I had some sleep paralysis. The only problem was that it felt like something had me more than anything else, I remember it fully. I kept on grabbing at nothing, but constantly reach for something to grab in panic. Images were running through my vision, but I could barely see them, let alone my arms
<br />

<br />
When I realized the state I was in I calmed myself and made myself get passed the fear, even though the feeling was still there. My mind was completely calm. I decided to try and have an OBE, but it only made me wake up from the state instead of go somewhere else. When I woke up though I realized that I didn't feel like I was in my body when I was in the dream paralysis like state and I felt like I was being pulled away by some invisible force. I noticed that when I tried to &quot;leave my body&quot; I didn't have any &quot;grasp&quot; of my body at all
<br />

<br />

<br />
I kept on getting odd chills running through my spine about every 30 seconds after I had woken up fully, even though I was over the fear of it all. I still felt the presence of other entities. I decided to relax, I even managed to renew my shields at this time. I then turned on my TV and watched it for a little while. What felt like hours happened in less than two hours, I went to bed at a little over 11:00pm and finished at about 1:00am.
<br />

<br />

<br />
There is more to last night than this though. Last night I had a dream, it was still night. After a few minutes it was obviously a dream. Lucid too.  
<br />

<br />
At one point in this long dream I was eating popcorn, which I made cold, and also very warm, and also I made it feel like hot butter was slithering down my throat, it tasted really good, all the versions of popcorn.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, after getting sidetracked there, there was this guy there. Well, the figure was represented by my mother's body, and once I realized it wasn't, I could see him as something else, like a different image of what he looked like even though his representation was the same. He wouldn't tell me who he was, but he said I already knew. I threw out a few guesses of which I thought might be possible (one of the I guessed was my sub-conscious), and he said no to both guesses. I stuck with that he was one of the entities (possibly even the only one that mattered) that I felt/saw. We had a long discussion, mainly about the paranormal if I recall correctly. I don't remember any of it though
<br />

<br />
Overall it was fun talking to him, he had to leave a few times in which he left through the sliding door.  This took place in my mom's room, the furniture did switch around a little bit. Throughout the dream I'm not sure if I woke up to the physical world at all, but I definitely woke up inside my own dream, which would be when I fell asleep in the physical world. He also said that this was my mom's dream around when we first started talking. When he left I assumed he left the actual dream.
<br />

<br />
One of the times he left I said I was going to make I psiball and he said he wouldn't come back if I did... I wanted to see how strong I really could get a dream psiball. So, I don't know if that really was in my own dream, or what manifestation he that was represented in my mother's body was, but it was interesting, along with the whole night.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I feel it was a rather productive night, I got over the bulk of what I feared a lot of it pertained to what could happen while going into an OBE.
<br />

			*sigh* 30 views and no replies, oh well, I'll just delete this topic or lock it (if I am able to) in a few days or so I guess.
<br />

<br />
Also, if anyone is interested, that is if someone decides to reply, I took some notes last night to, just jotting down my experience with it, it pretty much says that what it says in the first post, less too, but it has some repetitive thoughts in it too I think, I still haven't went over what I wrote yet.

			you should make a blog ^_^ Reading huge posts like that are rather discouraging to read ;-; not to be rude, just a personal thing.

			A writing tip: white space is friendly to the eyes. 20 line paragraphs of text are not friendly to the eyes.
<br />

<br />
You should try to make a new paragraph whenever you move on to a different idea, in online writing. It may not make your writing teacher happy, but it will make your readers happy.
<br />

<br />
Readers like white space.
<br />

<br />
As for the rest of your story, uh, interesting. Not sure what sort of commentary you're looking for here...

			Yea, I kind of thought it would be discouraging :/ I was even thinking about rewriting it.  Turn it into a bunch of paragraphs rather than the big wall of text :/.  Sorry about that, I didn't really have that much time when I wanted to get it posted :/.  I will definitely rewrite it, thanks for the advice <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
About the blog, if I had one I would never update it :/, I'm really bad about those <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
I guess the commentary I'm looking for is just help deciphiring what I don't understand, like I said in the third wall of text, I wasn't sure if it was just my own dream, or dream walking.  It seemed like I was in my own dream, but the aspects of the thing telling me I wasn't, and that he left, makes me wonder.
<br />

<br />

<br />
EDIT:  Does that look any better to you? I pretty much just divided it into shorter paragraphs and changed a few minor things.  My English teacher might be a little bit happier now ^_^&quot;
<br />

<br />
The third wall of text thing would now be the 9th paragraph...
