			This is a random theory that popped in my head....
<br />
If one was to transmit binary rather than raw thought would the brain interpret the binary as the correct data.....there are plenty of engish to binary converters through google....anyone who want to try this with me my addy.

It was just an Idea....if the whole universe was programed from binary than that means our very being is numbers....binary isnt new...its ancient.
<br />
I don;t even need telepathy to try this...i'll just pick a random object convert it to binary (getting someone to pick the object for me)..and i'll meditate on the numbers
<br />
and see if the correct object comes to mind....If it did.....

I don't think our universe is programmed with binary, we don't know anything about our universe but the idea that it was created with binary seems kind of absurd.
<br />

<br />
Now if you binary to help you with telepathy, yeah it should work, I suppose it would work pretty well with people that use the computer a lot.

			I think if you can send binary data telepathically, you can communicate with computers. But that would be no communication. It would be sending data and receiving data or information. Because computers are machines. With people it would probably work if they use the computer a lot.

<br />
What do you mean by &quot;converting an object to binary&quot;? 
<br />

<br />
I should think unless you're fluent in the code, the numbers will mean nothing whether you meditate on them or not. They don't have some inate meaning - unless you're a computer, they're still just a set of numbers.
<br />

<br />
And I find it very hard to believe that our world is created out of binary.

			This is a REALLY funny thread. We're more than likely NOT in the Matrix here, and even if we were, the code of reality would be MUCH more complex than binary. 
<br />

<br />
But hey, if you're trying to access an isolated computer, or trying to figure out what's wrong with a computer when help menus are being stupid (as they usually are), then cyber-telepathy (communication with computers) would be useful. But other than that, I think just raw telepathy is a smarter idea.

			This reminded my of a documentary I saw a while ago that stated we are most likely all apart of a complicated computer program, as one day we will be able to create a theoretically infinite number of digital worlds where all the inhabitants think they are real, and as there would be so many of these digital worlds, the likely hood that we are in the real world is slim………but that really has nothing to do with this topic….
<br />

<br />
More on topic then… I don’t realy see the point in sending binary code to people through TP, as I doubt they would have a bloody clue what it meant unless they were fluent in binary code…. But then again 10101010…
