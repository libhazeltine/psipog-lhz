			I have decided that I wanted to create a ranking system that Psions may compare themselves against.  Feel free to disagree with it but do not post critisisms on this thread.
<br />

<br />
Level 0: Normal person.  Someone who doesn't believe in Psionics or has never heard of it.  Has never used any Psionic abilities.
<br />

<br />
Level 0.5: A believer.  This person has seen or strongly believes in Psionics.  They are looking into becoming a Psion.
<br />

<br />
Level 1:  The first level of Psionics.  This person has actually performed a simple telekinetic feat such as moving a Psi Wheel or a simple, light object.  Can make some simple Constructs.  Cannot use any specialised abilities such as Cryokinesis or Telepathy.
<br />

<br />
Level 2: A somewhat accomplished Psion.  They have all the abilities of Lv. 1.  Has a mild understanding of at least one of the specialised abilities: Pyrokinesis, Cryokinesis, Telepathy, Empathy, Healing, or Remote Viewing.  Can create Constructs and Shields with only mild difficulty.  Can move slightly heavier objects.  Capable of teaching a Lv. 0.5 until Lv. 1.
<br />

<br />
Level 3: A noteable Psion.  Has all the abilities of Lv. 1 &amp; 2.  Proficient in one of the specialised abilities and is beginning to dabble in one or two of the others.  Many Psions will never reach this level.  Only the commited may achieve this level.  All Lv. 1 &amp; 2 abilities are simplistic to these Psions.  The most suitable teacher for beginners.
<br />

<br />
Level 4: A powerful Psion.  Has all the abilities of Lv. 1, 2, &amp; 3.  Can use a very high percentage of the specialised abilities.  Can move heavy objects, maybe even around their own weight!  It is impossible to teach this level of Psionics, it must be learned through oneself.  Can teach anyone willing to learn.
<br />

<br />
Level 5: A legendary Psion.  There is no one more powerful than these Psions.  Who knows what they are capable of?  This may take a lifetime of training and even then unobtainable.

			Well this was not a wise idea. Comparison like this only creates more conflict amongst psions. So, being a rebel, i'm not going to rank myself by your scale and i'm just going to say: I can do psionics.
<br />

<br />
Life is not an MMORPG where you can rank yourself by strict levels and believing, that i can't do telepathy until i'm level 4....
<br />

<br />
You won't be able to do any telepathy at all if you belive that. Belief is an important ingredient while training.

no offense ultimaduck, but i'm glad baka said it, because i would have.  i don't agree with the ranking system for the same reasons as baka, but also, the way that the ranks escalate is a bit farfecthed.  it seems that each level, PK skills are increased.  well, you don't have to specialize in PK to be a notable psion.  in fact, you don't have to specialize in any aspect to be a notable psion.  it isn't how good, or how much better you are than someone, it's how much you understand.  and no offense (again), but pyro and cryo PK aren't specialized skills.  they are just using PK in a different form.  it's all manipulation, just what type of matter you are manipulating.

			Well, mr. duck, if you so badly wish to have a ranking system, start your local Psi Club and as the leader, lead as you please. I don't think i've actually heard of any psi clubs being founded recently, or at all for that matter. Maybe you can get the fad started.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			If you would absolutely have to use a linear scale (which based on my psi experiences doesn?t work at all), you would need to subtract any specifica such as pk vs. telepathy. You could probably create such a scale on intensity of success with a broad range of thought-to-be psi related skills, but that seems to be all the info you could (seriously) fit into such a scale, based on what you?re looking for.

			I meant these to be very open ended.  Use these as you please but please remember that the ranking is very broad.  I guess they would be fun if you were more powerful and could use them to brag.  I was bored and just felt like doing something like this.

I just checked the poll results and noticed someone put Level 5.  lol

			From the looks of it, I hit around 4 and 5...damn, only a year...poor ranking system. Either way, I don't think psionics is really great for a ranking system.

Maybe between 3 and 4, that'll be more probable.

Now, honestly, i think it would be pretty hard to rank a psion. Some people can move large objects and cannot move a psiwheel. Others are great with telepathy but just suck at telekinesis. There are many psionic abilities out there and you can't just 'rate' someone with a 'level'. Well you can, but you need to consider every little aspect.
<br />

<br />
But anyway. I'm level 0,75 , or something around this. I believe it, I can make psi balls, but I can't program them, and I can't move psiwheels. I have a decent skill on lucid dreaming (although i would not consider it a psionic skill) and a bit of natural empathy (i think.)
