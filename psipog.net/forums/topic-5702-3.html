He's right. We haven't had any major wars, only a true World War would be enough to put a sizeable dent in the world's growth.

			I disagree, there has been genocide all over the world that HAS put a dent in our population, but were definetly NOT a world war.  Like the constant wars in Africa.  The US's own genocide on the native americans.  Thats a few.  Wars do put dents in the population, but I just dont think it really matters.  We're all gonna be screwed soon anyway.  World can only hold so much.

			Genocide IS a part of war.  Genocide is commonplace either right before the start of a war, end, or in between.  Lets look at the most simple war to discuss.  WWII.  First off, the Nazis killing many denominations off alone caused one of the largest population decreases in history.  We aren't even talking about the KIA yet.
<br />

<br />
View this link, and I DARE you to have the pure idiocy to state that wars don't put a dent on the population.  This is statistics from WWII, and they aren't even acurate, seeing as how the number of deaths could not have all been possibly recorded.  <a href="http://au.geocities.com/thefortysecondinww2/level2/asstd/stats-wwii.htm" target="_blank">http://au.geocities.com/thefortysecondinww2/level2/asstd/stats-wwii.htm</a>
<br />
AND THIS IS JUST WWII!!!!!!!
<br />

<br />
Anyone else who says that War doesn't have a significant impact on Population should just be branded the world's largest dumbass.

Lets see Genius.  Just pretend the things in Samalia, Rowanda, etc, aren't happening.  Howabout the Genocides the Huseins commited?  ALOT of fucking people.  The world trade center.  Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi freedom, I could go on and on, and don't say &quot;There weren't many deaths in those wars/operations.&quot;  Because if you do, you're wrong.  Face the facts, war fixes population issues, period.

			Though I dont believe that last tidbit, your right.  With the US's current war alone there has been some were in the ball park of 150-200 thousand deaths.  I know you only hear about OUR troops being killed, but including Iraq's deaths, civilian or otherwise, it's a large fucking number.

			Anything less than a massive fucking nuclear holocaust won't do much for overpopulation.  You act like our population numbers are static: one million die and that one million never comes back.  Wrong.  People are still popping out babies and the population will continue to replenish itself.  And, given the greater standards of living, which lead to a longer average lifespan, population numbers will continue to rise since less people will be dying, war or no war.  This is why you have to differentiate betweeen _population_ and _growth rate_.
<br />

<br />
I constantly hear the argument that &quot;humans are bloodthirsty animals and we can never escape war.&quot;  I'm sorry, but am I the only one who thinks that our intellect and rational abilities can overcome base destructive desires?  Yes, I am, probably because everyone else gives in to a thought pattern whereby they excuse our behavior, and permit it to continue, simply because we haven't outgrown this caveman view of ourselves.
<br />

<br />
Give me a break.  All of you hoo-hah, crotch-grabbing, marine corps turned me and mah pa into a killin' machine, kill all the [insert group here], idiotic lunatics should give it a rest.  As I said before, I'm not a stinkin' hippy, but even I recognize that the way we wage war is not necessary and can be avoided with a little concentrated effort.

			You sir, are mistaken.  If we didn't have wars, natural disasters and shit, WE WOULD BE OVER-FUCKING-POPULATED.  That is a fact.  No shit people keep popping out babies, if there were no wars, people would continue to do so, and we would become overpopulated.
<br />

<br />
And yeah, it can be avoided, easily.  But you don't look at the whole picture.  If one fanatic group doesnt avoid it, NOONE does.  War isn't about what the media protrais it to be.  It's about money and politics, and yes, keeping our country safe.  Yes, killing off people in other countries does in fact keep us safe at night.

You sir, are skirting the issues.  You seem to think we're at a nice equilibrium insofar as the amount of living people on this planet.  We're pretty overpopulated in a lot of areas, and war isn't going to solve it.
<br />

<br />
I do look at the whole picture. By focusing on the money and politics asepcts, you're just focusing on one part of the larger whole.  Please don't claim to do something that you clearly don't, that's called &quot;hypocrisy&quot;.  Taken as a whole, war is about conflict between two groups.  There are other methods of conflict resolution that don't involve killing.  Killing people in other countries may keep us safe for a night or two, but not permanently because it always begets a plan for revenge or some form of payback.  I'm sure you're quite content with creating a hostile environment that our children will have to live in.
<br />

<br />
I didn't kill any Palestinians, Afghanis, or Iraqis.  And the multitude of young adults in those countries didn't kill any American or Europeans.  Why then are we afraid of each other and pushed to fight each other?  This is exactly the situation that your attitude and outlook brings.  We inherited it from our fathers, and if we continue to directly or indirectly proclaim we are helpless to stop it (as many of you do), we will pass it on to our offspring.

We really could get over war if people were willing to change and be very open minded.  Thats not going to happen anytime soon.  We'd all have to be stricken poverous to learn that lesson.  
<br />

<br />
I see no point to this war.  It seems like we just went right into it with out asking why.  I dont and never have felt threatened.  I didn't worry a terrorist was going to be knocking on my door holding a AK.  Is our country truely in a enough danger that we have to actuallly go and kill thousands of people?  I mean if we stepped up security(which we have and it seems to be working) would we have to kill?  I think we're just gonna have to be content with not being able to do jack shit.  And just wait till we 1)kill all each other, 2)the world finally gives up supporting us, 3) we wisen up.

I can surmise what you're thinking because you're so nonchalant about violent human behavior, and you even go so far as to excuse it.  It doesn't take a detective or a psychic to figure that out.
<br />

<br />
Actually, wishful thinking does a lot.  It inspires change in the individual and in society.  If you're content with remaining the same person in the same place thinking the same way, then be my guest.  If you don't evolve mentally or spiritually, you get left behind.  I'll see you in my rear-view mirror, boss.
