Ah, I actually get it. Very clever.

Damn I love proverbs/quotes.

&quot;One loses many laughs by not laughing at oneself.&quot;

~Sara Jeanette Duncan

(I found those two by walking around the library...apparently the sexsist librarian put them there. She has a whole wall of female proverbs but I picked out the least sexsist of course.)

Heh, yeah it is actually. I'm suprised you noticed. But that was just me screwing around. One of my hobbies is actually writing proverbs. I am composing a book sort of. I have lots of them at home. 
<br />
I write down the ones I make up and the ones that I find in certain places. 
<br />

<br />
Like just yesterday I found one in the garbage by Martin Luther King, Jr. 
<br />
I can't remember exactly what it said though. 
<br />

<br />
I am going to write down the ages in which I made them up as well, and then I can compare the ones I make when I am older and see how much the message changes and how much they change in general. I think it will be interesting.

&quot;Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage -- to move in the opposite direction.&quot;

&quot;Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.&quot;

&quot;Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind.&quot;

&quot;Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.&quot;

&quot;Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.&quot;

&quot;The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.&quot;

&quot;The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.&quot;

&quot;The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the the universe.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.&quot;

&quot;I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;A human being is a part of a whole, called by us _universe_, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest... a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.&quot;

&quot;Genius is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration. Accordingly, a  'genius' is often merely a talented person who has done all of his or her homework.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;If we all did the things we are really capable of doing, we would literally astound ourselves....&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Many of life's failures are experienced by people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Results? Why, man, I have gotten lots of results! If I find 10,000 ways something won't work, I haven't failed. I am not discouraged, because every wrong attempt discarded is often a step forward.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;The thing I lose patience with the most is the clock. Its hands move too fast.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Its obvious that we don't know one millionth of one percent about anything.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I believe that the science of chemistry alone almost proves the existence of an intelligent creator.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;We have merely scratched the surface of the store of knowledge which will come to us. I believe that we are now, a-tremble on the verge of vast discoveries - discoveries so wondrously important they will upset the present trend of human thought and start it along completely new lines .&quot;

&quot;Be courageous! Whatever setbacks America  has encountered, it has always emerged as a stronger and more prosperous nation.... Be brave as your fathers before you. Have faith and go forward!&quot;

&quot;Whoever undertakes to set himself up as judge in the field of truth and knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the Gods.&quot;

&quot;The problems that exist in the world today cannot be solved by the level of thinking that created them.&quot;

<br />
&quot;When you are courting a nice girl an hour seems like a second. When you sit on a red-hot cinder a second seems like an hour. That's relativity.&quot;
