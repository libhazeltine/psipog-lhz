Daniel and Roy, what is the point of this?  Are you trying to call MA a fluff bunny?  Are you trying to get the talk of chakra's banned?  What do you want?
<br />

<br />
IMO, this is all pretty childish.  Chakras are a belief.  ALLLLL it is.  It's almost impossible to prove.  MA is saying it's his opinion.  Daniel and Roy say they want facts.  Well if you can put 100% facts behind an opinion, it wouldn't be a opinion, it would be a fact.  I mean I can say movie blah was amazing, but I couldn't put facts behind it.  I could say &quot;this part was exhilarating.&quot;  But thats just something I experienced and thought was amazing, still not proof.  Chakras are a belief that so many people have experience it's just an excepted thing by some people.  In this example, is where it's close to religion.  But it's like any other psionic art where it cant totally be proven, yet can be practiced and have results.  This is why I ask again, do you want chakra-talk banned?  I'd rather just get a quick straight answer from all the mods, instead of watching you slowly break down a very smart person just becuase he doesn't have numbers behind him.  We all know MA is going to &quot;lose&quot; this.  He'll never be able to change your minds just by talk, just like trying to prove PK and prove RVing, it cant be done by talk.
<br />

<br />
so any-who *whistles off into the distance*

I don't care about chakras.  I don't believe in them, I think it's more spiritual fluff, and they don't have anything to do with psionics.  Of course, though, you're all allowed to discuss what you'd like, and if chakras is included, then go for it.
<br />

<br />
I decided to respond for two reasons: 1) MartialArtist, for some reason, thought he could add a disclaimer saying that those who don't believe in chakras shouldn't regard themselves with what he types, and 2) A lot of what MartialArtist says, not just about chakras, is made up shit.  I want the people who read his posts to do so with skepticism and to understand that he isn't much of an authority on psionics.  Sure, he can speculate all he likes, but I'm making sure everyone remembers that it's just that: speculation.
<br />

<br />
It's not my intention to slowly break down a very smart person...in fact, he's not very smart if he's allowing himself to be broken down, and therefore, I don't think you should speak for him.  MartialArtist seems well and confident in his viewpoints and has no problem using loose logic and weak scientific basis to support them, but as long as he does, myself and Daniel will be around to call him on it.
<br />

<br />
I agree that proof doesn't come in the form of talk.  That's why proof for PK and RV is in literature.  Are you yourself, Rahmid, so haphazard to put belief in something that doesn't have any proof behind it?  If so, then that's your prerogative certainly, but a foolish one.  If this is something you've experienced yourself and that is why you believe, then good.
<br />

<br />
But you make no mistake, anyone can come into these forums and spout complete and utter falsities, and I guarantee you there will be some impressionable few who will put blind faith in it.  That's why opinions and personal experiences must be challenged, at least to some effect.  I'm sure you yourself, Rahmind, have called &quot;bullshit&quot; on more than a few Psipog forum posters who've claimed stuff like &quot;yesterday I levitated mah car over mah house and my neighbors totally phreaked out!!&quot;  Well this is the same thing, only MA has better grammar.

			No there is nothing wrong with that.  But if he wants to know about chakras how about he just googles &quot;chakras&quot; instead of calling MA out and calling what he believes is false.
<br />

<br />
and to MA.  Are you stating this is fact, or opinion.  It is not clear.

<br />
edit:  @Roy.  Yes chakras are somthing i've experienced.  As for mostly what else you've said, thats all cool. And true.
<br />

<br />
As for you problem with him having the disclaimer up.  Why not?  On this forum it's relativly clear(if you look) chakras are on the &quot;aceptability&quot; fence.  He just put it bluntly: &quot;If you dont believe in chakras, this is not for you.&quot;  IMO it's not that big of a deal.

			&quot;your chakras may not produce that much energy for you, because yours are closed and rarely used. &quot;
<br />

<br />
rofl. you are apparently unaware that part of the doctrines in which chakra are based states that a chakra being closed is lethal. according to the doctrine, any closing of chakra blocks energy from flowing to it's proper place, thus certain body parts can't get enough energy, thus causing sickness or death. I read books.

No, actually you're presenting this as truth, and you do this with the weak logic and science you present in your defense. Reality is that which doesn't go away after you stop beleiving in it.

I believe it exists in everyone regardless of their belief. What I meant by: <span style="font-style: italic">&quot;And I guess that you will never be able to comprehend it because you do not believe.&quot;</span> is that he will never be able to comprehend it, because he will probably not practice trying to use or experience the chakras if he does not believe in them. And if you do not practice or try to experience them, you probably won't. If he would believe in them, he would probably practice with it and therefore become aware of it. But I belief they exist in everyone regardless of belief.

Never try to experience things seriously? You do not know me. I have had a number of OBEs in the past because I wanted to see if they were real. Guess what... I had some OBEs.

I am sorry I (mis)judged you about being narrow-minded and not willing to open up to anything new. You are right, I dont know you.
<br />

<br />
Also I did not like being called a racist, and being said that I lived on Planet X where I was right and everyone else is wrong, for that is absolutely not what I am by heart. That is opposite to my intentions why I post here. I am misunderstood when it comes to this. When I share, I do not mean to present it as being the only right thing. I mean to share out of personal experience and keep my words as personal and close to heart as possible. My words are my own and I value that quality. Therefore I might sometimes get lost in my own words and forget to mention in every line that it is my own opinion. But please realise that I do not mean to lecture truth in any way. I realise it is my opinion, and somehow I expect you to realise that I realise that as well. Just so that I do not have to state it everywhere. When I am posting something, it is always my opinion, how can it be any different? And I automatically expect others to understand that my posts are my opninion. 
<br />

<br />
As for myself, I have come to see how this is not the place for me to share my experiences. I was naïve in thinking that it was. I hope that some of my posts may have helped some people. I see now that whatever I had to do here is done. Don't see this as chickening out, it is just that I don't feel my posts are needed anymore. I was never here for my personal wants in the first place.
<br />

<br />
So when this topic dies, so will my activity on this forum. I respect both your ways of challenging opinions. I am just glad it is not my job.

I think you serve a good purpose on these forums, and I would like to see you continue to post.  You're respectful, type clearly, and follow the rules.  You seem like a good member to me, in that light.
<br />

<br />
Sure, I might disagree with you on a few things.  To use DanielH's saying: So what? <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  I disagree with Roy on a lot of things.  I disagree with DanielH on a ton of things as well <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.  Disagreement shouldn't bring about resentment or negative feelings... it should just serve to remind us that we are all different, and that no one is 100% correct about everything.  Disagreement seems pretty healthy to me - it challenges us to re-think things we might take for granted.  I've re-thought things about chakras from reading your posts, MA.
<br />

<br />
I think Roy and DanielH might have a <span style="font-style: italic">little</span> anger stored up over your opinion, but I don't see a reason for this anger.  I know they are just looking out for the communities best interest - so that's good.  And I assume you are looking out for the communities best interest as well.  See?  We're all trying to achieve the same thing <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps you just need to change your terminology.  For example, some people like the term &quot;nerve clusters&quot; better than &quot;chakra&quot;.  Saying something along the lines of &quot;there are nerve clusters near vital organs, and according to quantum consciousness theories, our nerves have the ability to extrapolate data from the quantum world into the more solid physical world that we are aware of.&quot;  This statement can be backed up via <a href="http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/" target="_blank">http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/</a> .  Easy peasy.
<br />

<br />
Chakras aren't proven to be real... but they certainly haven't proven them to be false.  To assert that either side is &quot;the truth&quot; is naive.

Angry about his opinion? Nah. If I was it'd have to be because of his not backing up what he says, but that doesn't really get me angry. If I was angry I'd edit all his posts, insult him in every post he's ever made, etc.

			<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Burden of proof (logical fallacy)</span></span>
<br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
<br />

<br />

<br />
Reversing the burden of proof is a logical fallacy whereby the normal burden of proof is reversed.
<br />

<br />
For example, it may be asserted that carrying a rabbit's foot improves luck on the grounds that it cannot be proven that it does not.
<br />

<br />
This is fallacious for two reasons: first, it requires <span style="color: red">proof of a negative</span>, and second, it places the burden of proof on the challenger, not the proposer of the idea. Formally, before a claim is made, it should be proven, not asserted until disproven.
<br />

<br />
In some cases a reversed burden of proof may be appropriate: for example, when an empirical relationship has been observed but the underlying mechanism is unknown, it may be reasonable to infer from the lack of conflicting evidence that the empirically observed relationship is most likely causal. However, according to the scientific method the relationship is not formally proven in this instance, and to assert that it is so until disproven is fallacious.

No, actually you're presenting this as truth, and you do this with the weak logic and science you present in your defense. Reality is that which doesn't go away after you stop beleiving in it.

I believe it exists in everyone regardless of their belief. What I meant by: <span style="font-style: italic">&quot;And I guess that you will never be able to comprehend it because you do not believe.&quot;</span> is that he will never be able to comprehend it, because he will probably not practice trying to use or experience the chakras if he does not believe in them. And if you do not practice or try to experience them, you probably won't. If he would believe in them, he would probably practice with it and therefore become aware of it. But I belief they exist in everyone regardless of belief.

I'm open to new concepts, ideas, and beliefs so don't assume that I'm not. What I'm not open to though is new concepts, ideas, and beliefs that lack evidence suggesting that they are real.

That is the reason why I have a better grasp on reality than someone who believes in things like &quot;god&quot; just because of a feeling or some books and a message.

Never try to experience things seriously? You do not know me. I have had a number of OBEs in the past because I wanted to see if they were real. Guess what... I had some OBEs.

I am sorry I (mis)judged you about being narrow-minded and not willing to open up to anything new. You are right, I dont know you.
<br />

<br />
Also I did not like being called a racist, and being said that I lived on Planet X where I was right and everyone else is wrong, for that is absolutely not what I am by heart. That is opposite to my intentions why I post here. I am misunderstood when it comes to this. When I share, I do not mean to present it as being the only right thing. I mean to share out of personal experience and keep my words as personal and close to heart as possible. My words are my own and I value that quality. Therefore I might sometimes get lost in my own words and forget to mention in every line that it is my own opinion. But please realise that I do not mean to lecture truth in any way. I realise it is my opinion, and somehow I expect you to realise that I realise that as well. Just so that I do not have to state it everywhere. When I am posting something, it is always my opinion, how can it be any different? And I automatically expect others to understand that my posts are my opninion. 
<br />

<br />
As for myself, I have come to see how this is not the place for me to share my experiences. I was naïve in thinking that it was. I hope that some of my posts may have helped some people. I see now that whatever I had to do here is done. Don't see this as chickening out, it is just that I don't feel my posts are needed anymore. I was never here for my personal wants in the first place.
<br />

<br />
So when this topic dies, so will my activity on this forum. I respect both your ways of challenging opinions. I am just glad it is not my job.

You can leave if you want to, but do not do so on my account.  This is the skepticism forum.  As such, ideas should be challenged moreso in a skeptical manner in this subforum than in the others.
<br />

<br />
I don't harbor anger toward you, MA.  I really don't care one way or the other.  I'm sure if Xiouslaidyn is reading this, he'll agree that I could have a heated debate with someone onto the forums, which can then spill into insult hurling in the chatroom (which happened betweeen myself and him), but when it's all said and done, I'm still a friendly enough person.
<br />

<br />
This area in the forum is for critical thinking.  This is something that I want everyone to understand.  I'm trying to set an example, perhaps a very aggressive one, but if it is too aggressive, it's because I'm becoming upset with the multitude of new users and the fluff they generate throughout the whole of the forums.
<br />

<br />
You become smart in two ways with this: 1) If you are presented with an idea that you think may not be logical or credible or worthwhile, you are encouraged to analyze it, and come to thoughtful conclusions, thus exercising the cognitive powers of the brain, and 2) If you present an idea that you think others will deem illogical, not credible, and not worthwhile, then it forces you to research scientific literature and produce creative, yet logically sound, hypotheses to present to skeptics.  This is a call to boost your brainpower, not a cue to leave.
<br />

<br />
However, if you want to leave, then I'm sure you'll find a more suitable forum where your ideas on chakras will not be challenged as much or at all because you'll be conversing among others who already believe.

Sure, I might disagree with you on a few things. To use DanielH's saying: So what?  I disagree with Roy on a lot of things. I disagree with DanielH on a ton of things as well . Disagreement shouldn't bring about resentment or negative feelings... it should just serve to remind us that we are all different, and that no one is 100% correct about everything. Disagreement seems pretty healthy to me - it challenges us to re-think things we might take for granted. </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

If I stop posting here, it would not be because of you or DanielH, it would be because I see that my posts are not that needed here. I do not feel personally attacked by any of you, like I said before, I respect your duties here as forum moderators. I think you are doing a very good job, though be careful not to give into too much to irritated emotions like anger. Because sometimes you both can get disrespectful and start to call the other person names and such. Besides that, you both are playing a perfect role as forum moderators and healthy sceptics.
<br />
When we have those heated kind of discussions, I am just playing a part in the dialog, just like you. It's like a role playing game for the best interest of the community. It might look sometimes as if I get emotional, but really that's not the case. I do not take these things personal. So thanks, but I would not be leaving on any of your account.

I'll take those into consideration. I do not know that many sites that are capable of explaining what I write here in a scientifical, proven, kind of way. I am sure there are multiple of them, but I do not really read that much on the internet, so I would not know many.
<br />

<br />
I'll think about adjusting my terminology where I feel that my words might become too vague and abstract for other people and sceptics. But like I said before, I like to use the words that come from the heart when I try to explain something. But I'll deffinately take it into consideration if in the future I feel like posting on this forum.

			Reading through several of the articles listed on the homepage and topics in the forums, we've all come across many techniques for just about every area of psionics.  For instance, there's the constant debate between people practicing psychokinetics - to become one with the object, or not to.
<br />

<br />
Point is though, it doesn't matter one bit.  If making a connection with the object works for you, then do it.  If you just tell the psi wheel to spin and it does, power to you.  If it gets you in the right mindset and yields proper results, then power to you.
<br />

<br />
Why should it be any different with chakras?  I don't believe in them, but if I want to practice something psychic, I do tend to focus energy in what would be my brow chakra and I get the feeling as though something is clearly there.  Does it mean the third eye exists?  No.  It just means that after all my reading up on the subject it seems the natural place to focus on.
<br />

<br />
In summation, I like most of what I've read of MA's and the parts that I don't believe in (like chakras) I take with a grain of salt or for visualisation purposes only.  I don't see why this should incite anger amongst other members unless he's blatently breaking a forum rule (which he must not be, otherwise there wouldn't be a debate like this).  If chakras do fall under the realm of religion, let it be stated once and for all.
<br />

Anyway, my two cents.  The three of you can go back to arguing now.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

It's a lot about simplicity. Occam's razor if I understand it correctly. Especially if they probably don't exist (like chakras).

			I admire MA's attempt to put forth his views but I think he's learning what I have recently learned from debating with DanielH.  You can not enlighten those who do not want to be.  No matter how many benefits you present, they will always find that their fears of the unknown (chakras in this case) will hold them back.  That fear is the cause of the anger that you perceive as &quot;looking out for the community&quot; Peebrain.  I assure you the motive for it is purely selfish.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I've now taken the attitude of &quot;Your ignorance is not my responsibility to remedy&quot; and DanielH and Roy have demonstrated why I take that view.  I've also stopped asking for proof because I, as well as everyone else on this site, lack the experience and expertise to actually be able to verify whether the literature provided (when it is provided) is in fact proof.  I know what is and isn't real because of my own personal experience, but I am certainly not the only one who is unable to find errors in a scientific paper because this is a site for psions and hobby-parapsychologists, not scientists.  Hold yourselves in as high esteem as you like, your attitudes of having all the answers and demanding constant proof to change your views are nothing more than ego trips.  Such behaviour is no doubt the result of closed chakras. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Try to use some logic in your posts please. I have an open mind. I'm willing to believe in chakras. As long as there is evidence supporting their existence. Should I believe something you say because you offer eternal life, unimaginable riches, and so on? That's what you're saying, right?
<br />

<br />
I'm not angry or selfish. I'm trying to keep the forum straight. I'm not the one who makes unbased claim after unbased claim. Like I said... try to use some logic.
<br />

<br />
So, because I don't have a PhD in a subject means I can't find errors in it? I don't need to be a certified scientist in something to find an error in it. If I read a paper that said &quot;Evolution is the cause of some guy spitting on some primordial soup&quot; I will be able to spot the error(s) in it. Don't you agree?
