			Okay, so here's the problem... I woke up this morning to my mom asking me where I put the key to her van.  She took my sister's car because I had no idea where it was and she was in a rush, but she practically yelled at me to find it.  Wonderful way to wake up, right?
<br />

<br />
Neither of us went anywhere yesterday, but on Friday I used the key to unlock the van and get out an extention cord.  The problem is, however, I don't remember putting the key DOWN anywhere.
<br />

<br />
It's basically a silver key, with a black handle grippy thing.  Kinda rectangular on the grip, and it has the Chevrolet symbol on it.  The unlocking part itself is rather slender, I guess.  For a keychain, it has one of those things that has buttons to lock or unlock the door from a distance, and also has a button to send off the car horn with a quick blast, and one to set the alarm so that if anybody messes with it, it honks multiple times.
<br />

<br />
Any idea where I might've put it?   <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			Update: I think (repeat: THINK) I put it on the table after unlocking the driver's side door, at which point I unlocked ALL of the doors.  I don't remember locking it again, but when I went to check the van, the doors were locked.
<br />

<br />
It wasn't on the table where I remember placing it, so did my mom take it and not remember?  If so, where did she put it?  O.o;
<br />

<br />
EDIT:  I may have picked the key up again, but the table is seriously the last solid memory of it.  However, it's not there or around where I placed it.
