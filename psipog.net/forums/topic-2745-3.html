			1. To see how far I can go.
<br />

<br />
2. I think there are many factors that limit us. For one we have to believe that we can do it, but regardless of belief the act of PK still consumes energy (imo). So even if you had perfect confidence you may not be able to move a giant boulder unless you have built up your &quot;psychic muscles&quot; enough to use the needed amount of energy. 
<br />

<br />
I disagree with the whole &quot;size matters not, unlearn what you have learned&quot; concept and will only believe it when I see someone levitate and throw a truck (or equivalent) without considerable mental &quot;weight training&quot;.
<br />
Simply put, I think that if we could live forever, then we could eventually build up enough psychic strength to move anything, but a 75 year life span just doesn't allow for enough training. What I don't know is how far we can go within our limited lifespan, and that is exactly what I would like to find out.
<br />

<br />
P.S. If there is any research that actually proves that size doesn't matter in PK, then I would love to be proven wrong.

			1. I practice because of two reasons, really. The first is that I think it'd be awesome to be able to actually use this to help me do stuff. Want a glass of milk? I'll pour it. <span style="font-style: italic">With my mind.</span> Of course, I realize this will take months, likely years, of practice.
<br />

<br />
The other is that I'm just the kind of person that always wants to explore the possibilities and understand all that I can. While I can't understand how it works, I can definitely explore it.
<br />

<br />
2. I agree with PM3000. It's all a matter of how much practice we put forth. If we practice enough, we could accomplish pretty much anything. A good idea for all psionic abilities is to pretty much erase the word &quot;limit&quot; from your vocabulary. The only ones you truely have are those you force upon yourself.

I want to prove it's existence I've used tk since I was a child but I wasn't good enough to give a solid evidence.

Yes, I believe we can move objects but a car should be too heavy.

			1) I relish the idea of being able to move something around withouth touching it
<br />

<br />
2) So far there are no given scientific limits for pk, I think there was one incident where a man or maybe he was a magician was able to manipulate items in almost every household for miles around such as rendering old or broken clocks working, moving silverware and other items etc.

			1) I've always been seeing people do amazing stuff with their TK, and I wanted to do that stuff too. Now, I want to see how far I can go, and teach my boyfriend to do it too!
<br />

<br />
2) I don't think we have limits. Limits are invisible barriers. And for people who don't want to lose control of their powers.

*thinks of dream last night* I moved a house... ^^ Haha. Better get practicing!
