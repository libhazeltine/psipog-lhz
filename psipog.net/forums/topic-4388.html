			I was meditating last night, with the help of a trance CD, and afterwards had been practicing with a psi wheel. I was completely relaxed, free from any strain. My brother entered the room, and we began to listen more to the CD, and practice psi wheel. The thing is, once he entered the room, my neck began to feel weak, and aching. This broke a little of my concentration, and not until after we finished, did my brother mention something of his neck hurting.
<br />

<br />
When he entered the room, did I undeliberatly recieve some of the achiness from him. As well, when we finished, he said his neck was feeling much better. Did I undeliberatly share my wellbeing to him?

			it sounds like empath. but at least u can controll it. I cant controll it at all with is one of the many reasons I am here. when I finally wanted to tell I told because it was to hard to hold...I told my family so that if any one is getting into a deep or emotional conversation the for then to let me know or to not get so emotional about what ever situation it maybe. the situation Iam talking about is  when my 3 year old causin said somethin that a 3 year old should never say ( my brouther was going to malast my causin) thats the, cleaned up version. any ways my casusin and brother r 2 mounths apart ... any ways my aunt told me and ..every one was u know on edge my causin, my brother, and my aunt. any ways I felt all of their emotions at once I know what each one of them was feeling and it hurt me so bad that I just had to tell some one ...so plz even though that was last winter I still need help with it.
