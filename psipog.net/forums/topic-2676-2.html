I doubt that was his exact words, but it's what he meant... now let's think about that, I don't know about you, but my first thought is: &quot;how stupid can you get?&quot; electricity is energy, and I certainly wouldn't call electricity &quot;the capacity for work&quot; I'd call it a flow of electrons. 
<br />

<br />
Matter is made of energy, it's called atoms. Atoms are pure energy.

			I don't think it helps further psionics when you get idiots from our side trying to defend it. I saw two supposedly psionic people talking on a forum and they'd spurt out their views and arguements in one post and then refuse to reply (they said to contact them by e mail if anyone wanted to talk further) Not only this but one of them had skeptics are gay in his signiture. That pretty much screams retarded fuckwit to me. It reinforces the skeptics view that we're all a bunch of kids playing around with our imagination and little else. 
<br />

<br />
Personally I think we should leave the skeptics to being skeptics. When they're ready to start exploring beyond their little view of reality they will.

<br />
Funnily enough they said something similar about us. I think it was something about our belief in our abilities making us arrogant. I think the bad apples of both sides are causing a great deal of misconceptions.

			I actually think that was a good idea. I am all for pranking people regardless of who they are. On one condition however: It must be funny. The guy couldn't get anyone on the chat channel to say anything stupid however, so he just ended up looking like a moron. There is comedy, and there is whatever he is doing. My point however is that we shouldn't get all worked up about this. If his prank had actually been funny, I personally would have laughed along with him because its funny, not because its psipog. And now, that his prank turned out to be retarded, I don't really feel that it deserves its own separate thread. It is simply dignifying a poor joke, regardless of weather it was mean spirited or not. This kind of attention to this guy is going to fuel the next moron to do something equally as stupid. 
<br />

<br />
Furthermore I agree with Dakova. &quot;Idiots&quot; (perhaps too strog of a word) defending psipog is not helping us. Lets face it, anyone with the brains to fill out a form to get a sn for this forum becomes a member of the group. This is an open community, without any kind of test for initiation. As such anyone can speak in the name of the community. In return we get people who are not qualified, speaking out for us. There are lots of qualified skeptics out there, and they will never take us seriously as long as we have people like that defending us. And yes, perhaps our beliefs have made some of us arogant. I personally try not to use the word &quot;belief&quot; all together. I try to stick to the facts. Anyway this is a tangent fit for its own separate thread.

			not only that but dogs are very intelligent.  i walked home from school everyday (i doubt she could hear footsteps from 100's of feet away).  everyday right before i got home, the mailman would round our culdisac (sp?) in his truck to turn around.  my dog noticed this (and the time of day) and whenever i got home, she was there waiting for me by observing the things around her.

			This guy was hilarious. I talked to him for a good while after the whole thing, and he'd hung around beforehand to do some research. He did a nice prank - Rainsong and I knew something was up, though. We'd been talking about it in PM.

He wasn't retarded, he's very intelligent and quite clever, and the whole thing was rather hilarious.

I seem to recall this ended with Adam banning him? We had a good time of it when it was happening, though. Rainsong and I, telepaths that we are, knew what was up fairly quickly and had a separate conversation going in private message at the time. We were both thoroughly amused.
<br />

<br />
My rambling on about dogs and telepathy was something I did quite commonly back then - I would respond to (perceived) idiots with very intelligent answers that would normally be well above their heads. The goal was to get them to say &quot;what?&quot; It was fun. Regardless, I don't think the Insolitology people are retarded. I found him pretty amusing.
