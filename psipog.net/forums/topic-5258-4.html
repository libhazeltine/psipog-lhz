At that time it was perfect Full Moon, and the moon was EXACTLY in the constilation of Aquarius.

Not that I believe much of the 2012 stuff, but it seems there is actually a change going on.

It's fairly normal for psions to go through a period of being paranoid.  Hopefully you'll figure out that YOU are creating this entire situation, and nothing wordly is out of the ordinary.  Calm down, remember to remain skeptical, and remove your expectation that something &quot;bad&quot; is going to happen.

At least the Y2K thing had a basis behind it. It was mostly hype, though. I believe there were a few computer errors that <span style="font-weight: bold">did</span> happen, but nothing serious. Anything that could have happened was fixed before the date it was supposed to happen, or made up. 
<br />
2012 has no good reasons other than lazy calendar makers, superstitions, etc.

			ok i am going to end this topic. I hope. OK OK! monkey &quot;claimed&quot; he felt something big. Then you told your friends and they Tried to look for this Massive energy and made them selfs think they are feeling it. So Pretty much this is all paranoia and nothing to worry about. Of course things are going to happen 2012. I mean the mayan calender ends. Which is a pretty big deal(Not in the end of the world sence) I mean like the calender is over and you cant do anything with it. And they will still be guns pointed and every bodys faces in Iraq, Isreal, ETC. We cant end war. It will always happen. One day the world will end. Because it cant go on for ever. Sure people say they have visions of the world ending. But we create the future. We choose on what we want to do.  In my thought, Nobody can see into the future exectly. In 2012 nothing life theating will happen to earth. So to conculde this . Monkey... It was just gas....
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Also 2012 will be good for psions because of all the hype and paranoids and all the energy flowing around it will be a good year for us. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

We don't even use that damned calendar. We use the Gregorian Calendar. Anyways, it's not like we have an ancient calendar sitting somewhere, and people make a calendar from it every year. Welcome to today, buddy, we have computers and can figure out a calendar on our own(without a computer) easily. The Mayans were just failures who got lazy making a calendar. Or it just corresponded to some event in their crazy religion. Who cares about their religions and beliefs? They're dead. We don't take into account every end of the world theory, do we?
<br />
Edit: In conclusion... it's not a big deal. At all. It doesn't matter in the slightest, actually. The Mayans and all sorts of old, useless civilizations get <span style="font-weight: bold">way</span> too much credit and I'd rather them ignored and forgotten rather than worshipped and pretended to matter.

Some people use the Hebrew calendar or other lunar calendars.
<br />

<br />
Some lunatics might use that one that was created during the French Revolution but got halted...
<br />

Some mite not use any calendar! (ok...that's stretching it a bit, well maybe not, that timecube guy would probably not or he'd make up his own lmao.)

The Gregorian Calendar is pretty much a standard everywhere(there are others used, sure, but that is used all over the place), though, and it's not like the Hebrew calendar came from the Maya Calendar. I don't think any calendar that is currently used that comes from the Maya Calendar. 
<br />
The Maya calendar really doesn't matter, and people put so much importance on it like the Mayans were all-knowing, all-seeing gods.

didn't feel anything either. and pyro shares my thoughts on this whole 2012 thing. sure, it's a rare occurance. i mean REALY rare. so of course there's going to be some hype about it. it's kindof what happened the sixth of june this year, i guess. lots of people were paranoid because they believed the world would end that day or something.
<br />
knowing how uneventful and unexciting life usually is in general, i'm semi sure that nothing will happen. i can't say for sure because i'm no precogger.

			To put my two cents in...
<br />

<br />
I didn't feel anything either (Of course, I was out like a light at that time, but... whatever...). 
<br />

<br />
And about the whole 2012 thing, I really don't know. I'm more of a &quot;cross that bridge when we get there&quot; person, and what happens happens. 
<br />
And the only thing that happened to me on the sixth of June was that &quot;It's The End Of The World As We Know It&quot; got stuck in my head ALL DAY.
<br />

<br />
So in conclusion, I'm not sure if there is anything to the predictions and the hypes. And I agree with some of the previously mentioned opinions--Shouldn't we focus more on the crap going on in the world now, and less on what -could- happen? If we fix what's wrong now, then we can prevent a lot of the bad that could -possibly- stem from it.
