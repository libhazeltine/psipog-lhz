			Whoa whoa whoa. Look, see, I didn't want this. No one is getting banned, hopefully, well, maybe except this topic if it keeps going like this. If you read my lats paragraph you would have seen that I said I was sorry and that I was in a bad mood. I didn't put my last post right, I know that and any mod is fine to edit it by me. Basically, I tried to say exactly what Salem said. And neveza, you are good at pk, from what Iv'e heard. I don't want this to affect anything between me and other group members, or anyone with anyone for that matter. Lets just accept that we all have opinions and respect what we all believe. Constructive criticism everyone....

			I understand that you didn't mean to say the things you said, psi-manipulation.
<br />

<br />
I would post a movie, if I had a video camera. I don't give a damn if you don't believe in what I said I can do, just don't assume one's skill to back up a arguement, that pissed me off the most of what's been said on here.

You must understand, flames, that I hardly induce flame wars.

Only time I use swear words..such of the ways I have, is when someone isn't reading everything or assuming what I would have said also enforce something.

The same goes for you.  You have to realize that other people are entitled to their own opinion.  You pulled the &quot;less than 100 posts&quot; flame excuse.  No.  Thats not why we are flaming.  We are flaming because we <span style="font-style: italic">were</span> being nice until you said:

Neveza can move a lot more than you probably can.  Do not talk before you know the facts.  Sean's post:

<br />
Psipog is based on <span style="font-weight: bold">personal experience</span>.  So, Sean is asking you if you have had any <span style="font-weight: bold">personal experience</span> in this theory.  Obviously, no.  You suggested that Neveza be banned when he didnt do anything wrong and you started it.

I would have to agree.  You should know what the word theory means:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Dictionary wrote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena, <span style="font-weight: bold">especially one that has been repeatedly tested</span> or is widely accepted and can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
So your &quot;theory&quot; is not really a theory because it has not been tested and you just thought it up with no supporting evidence.

			Yeah, I agree, this is getting flamy. Flames, it's' not because you have less than 100 posts. That has nothing to do with it. Someone could post over a thousand stupid posts and still be stupid, and someone could post 5 posts, but they could be the most helpful and sensible ones around. Posts have nout to do with authority on the forums. You make your own authority through the content inside your posts, not the number underneath your avatar.

			Yeah, there is a bit of excessive fighting here....  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> Not the best thing for forum memebers to do. So everyone take a deep breath. What ever was said was said, no need for apologiez or bad tempers. Just if it was said and you don't agree with it, let it go now so we can continue this discussion with respect to others. It may not be your way that everyone believes. So if you have an opinion on the subject, state it, discuss it, and then let it go. Everyone has there opinions so let them state them just as you have stated yours. Thanks <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> and have a great day. -Salem
