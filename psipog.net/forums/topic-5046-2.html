			Bill Gates is behind this. His fortunes are slipping and he wants to get it all back (and more). Think about it... he's &quot;taking it easy&quot; at work. He's focusing on his &quot;charity work&quot; now. He's been rich for a long long time... unlike the President he WILL stick around for longer than eight years... he is a master businessman (most of the time). Think about it.

True, but I can make an assumption that, if they're intelligent enough to be able to orchestrate this whole thing, they wouldn't want to waste lots of time identified as an obviously problematic aircraft after two other planes already hit buildings, because that gives NORAD time to intercept them. (which... they didn't.)

<br />
...that is just blind ignorance.
<br />

<br />
First off, google &quot;Northwoods document&quot;. Check out page 9 or 10... Why? <span style="text-decoration: underline">It illustrates plans to shoot down american aircraft and blame it on cuba as a pretext for war, amoung many other immoral things.</span>
<br />

<br />
Then, check out some of the stuff that goes on at Bohemian Grove. Don't mention the ritual burning of a human effigy to a 40 foot owl representing the pagan god &quot;moloch&quot;, the act of which in the bible is condemnable by stoning to death. You can find video of this exact ritual from the journalist Alex Jones.
<br />

<br />
Now, I realize people can, and do lie. So obviously you could claim that a) the northwoods document is a fake, and b) the video is fake. So, I'll give you some information that you can check yourself.
<br />

<br />
Look for overhead pictures of the white house. (google earth is the best for this.) Check out the streets in front of it, which form a nice inverted Pentagram. (a symbol for evil.) You can also find the shape of an owl standing on the missing capstone of a pyramid, in the same vicinity.
<br />

<br />
The obsession with owls doesn't end there. Find a dollar bill. Look at the top-right #1 on the front of it, and if you use a magnifying glass you can see a very small owl perched on the top-left of the shield encasing the 1.
<br />

<br />
If you look at the great seal in the back, the part with the pyramid. It is arranged with words in a circular design. If you circle the A in Annuit, S in coeptiS, the N in Novus, the second O in ordO, and the M in secloruM, and draw an upside down pentagram using those circles as points, you find several things.
<br />

<br />
1- it is pretty much identical (circles and all) to the pentagram in the streets of the white house.
<br />

<br />
2- The 5 letters spell out &quot;Mason&quot;, from Freemason. Freemasons are connected with the illuminati/global elite, and above the 33rd degree of freemasonry are the illuminati ranks.
<br />

<br />
Do a bit of research on the Skull and Bones secret society at Yale. Both Bush and Kerry were/are members there, and this secret society is associated with satanic rituals.
<br />

<br />
There are many other things to mention but this topic has become too long. I'd just like to end by saying that 9/11 <span style="text-decoration: underline">WAS</span> a conspiracy whichever way you look at it. Whether it was a conspiracy between guys in a cave or between politicians, is the question.

We have been a power of the world for a long time.  We did not attack ourselves.  Osama Bin Laden claimed responsibility and so we went after him.  Saddam threatened us, we told him to stop.  He said he has nuclear weapons, we sent the UN in.  They didnt find anything but <span style="font-weight: bold">chemical weapons capable of destroying 100 US cities</span>.  Oh, but thats not enough.  No.  We should give them a hug for being forceful and let them follow through with their attacks.  Bush was smarter than 49% of the country.  He stopped Saddam before he attacked.  Also, in case no one noticed, its a war against <span style="font-weight: bold">terrorism</span>.  Saddam killed about 5,000 people per week.  We took him out of office with force to help the iraqi people.  We cant just leave them without any government system so we help them set up the best form of government that we know of: democracy.  More people voted in the iraqi elections than people voted in the US elections since 1992.  That is a pretty big display that the iraqi people wanted a democracy.

Wow.  You digust me.  First of all, let me start off by telling you that Rush Limbaugh (whom it seems you like to refrence, and if not you certainly sound like him) is an insecure jackoff who feeds his feeble ego by spewing 'facts' and having people call him and tell him how cool he is.
<br />

<br />
Now that I got your attention, let me show you this:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b><a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/15854/" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.alternet.org/story/15854/</a> wrote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Strangely, the U.S. media have, with almost no exceptions, failed to mention that most bio/chemical agents have a rather limited shelf life. The few who do usually quote Scott Ritter, former UN Iraqi weapons inspector and controversial opponent of Dubya?s drive to Baghdad. 
<br />

<br />
According to Ritter, the chemical weapons which Iraq has been known to possess -- nerve agents like sarin and tabun -- have a shelf life of five years, VX just a bit longer. Saddam's major bio weapons are hardly any better; botulinum toxin is potent for about three years, and liquid anthrax about the same (under the right conditions). And he adds that since all chemical weapons were made in Iraq's only chemical weapons complex ? the Muthanna State establishment, which was blown up during the first Gulf War in 1991 -- and all biological weapons plants and research papers were clearly destroyed by 1998, any remaining bio/chemical weapons stores are now ?harmless, useless goo.? 
<br />

<br />
[. . .] 
<br />

<br />
The U.S. Defense Department?s ?Militarily Critical Technologies List? (MCTL) is ?a detailed compendium of technologies&quot; that the department advocates as ?critical to maintaining superior US military capabilities. It applies to all mission areas, especially counter-proliferation.? Written in 1998, it was recently re-published with updates for 2002. 
<br />

<br />
So what is the MCTL?s opinion of Iraq's chemical weapons program? In making its chemical nerve agents, ?The Iraqis . . . produce[d] a . . . mixture which was inherently unstable,? says the report. ?When the Iraqis produced chemical munitions they appeared to adhere to a ?make and use? regimen. Judging by the information Iraq gave the United Nations, later verified by on-site inspections, Iraq had poor product quality for their nerve agents. This low quality was likely due to a lack of purification. They had to get the agent to the front promptly or have it degrade in the munition.? 
<br />

<br />
Furthermore, says this Defense Department report, ?The chemical munitions found in Iraq after the [first] Gulf War contained badly deteriorated agents and a significant proportion were visibly leaking.? The shelf life of these poorly made agents were said to be a few weeks at best -- hardly the stuff of vast chemical weapons stores. 
<br />

<br />
[. . .] 
<br />

<br />
Iraq did produce mustard gas that was somewhat more stable than the nerve agents. It may have a longer shelf life; perhaps potent forms of this agent could still be found. But one must wonder how worried we should be about Iraq?s poorly-made agents, several years after their production. 
<br />

<br />
And, as Ritter now insists, any chemical weapons facilities operating in recent years could, like their nuclear counterpart, have given off vented gases; and any new biological weapons programs would have to start again from scratch. Both activities would have been easily detected by Western intelligence, and no such evidence has been produced. 
<br />

<br />
[. . .] 
<br />

<br />
Indeed, this administration often obscured the fact that the UN destroyed all of Iraq's nuclear weapons program infrastructure and facilities by the time inspectors left in 1998. Even if Hussein had somehow secretly imported the materials necessary to rebuild them within the past five years, even as UN sanctions, no-fly zones and vigorous spying by Western forces remained firmly in place, Iraq could not hide the gases, heat, and gamma radiation which centrifuge facilities emit -- and which our intelligence capacities would have identified by now. 
<br />

<br />
[. . .] 
<br />

<br />
At this point, with even White House insiders and media boosters admitting they no longer expect to find much, if any, in the way of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, different unconvincing storylines are being floated: The weapons all went to Syria, they were efficiently destroyed just hours before the U.S. invasion, etc. The truth, however, appears to be that Iraq was a paper tiger, with little or no ability to threaten the United States or Israel.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Seriously, it would be unrealistic to claim that Iraq is a beacon of hope for everything.  Right now, it's a shithole on the brink of a civil war.  There's no denying that.
<br />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not for 'cutting and running'.  I just believe it's gonna be a <span style="font-weight: bold">looooong</span> time before the U.S. finally leaves.

Obviously, the very idea of a conspiracy <span style="font-style: italic">theory</span> is that it is an idea, so obvious there are many of them, and alot of them are fake, but that doesn't dismiss all of them, just like eating a rotten apple doesn't mean that every apple is rotten. (wow, that was a run-on...)

Anyway, the program really ended up just stating the same generic &quot;the freemasons are mysterious, we will never know their secrets&quot; tagline that is far too common. Kind of disappointed me.

To get the full reports of everything going on, you have to drag your arse over there. Otherwise you're falling victim to government-sponsored fantasies that very well could be filtered, no matter what the station you're watching.

The news would not allow the government to do that.  Someone would leak that the government is crossing the free media right.  therefore, it would be all across america.

hmm? I rarely watch CNN.  Heck, the last time I watched it was a week ago, and even then, I hadn't watched CNN for at least a month.  I get most of my news from the New York <span style="font-style: italic">Times</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Time</span> Magazine,  my local radio news station, and a debate-oriented forum I am am a part of.  I have also read the book 'Generation Kill' written by a reporter embedded with the first wave of marines to enter Iraq.  I personally would not have felt negatively about the war if it had not been so horribly managed.  Just recently it was announced that the state-of-the-art children's hospital in Basra has basically gone down the crapper, and will cost two-and-a-half times it's original predicted price, bringing it up to around $125 million dollars.

its called &quot;Prison Planet&quot;......  Just skimming it and then reading the headlines of all the other sections:
<br />

<br />
? The Myth of Liberation
<br />
? Intentional Targeting of Independent Journalists
<br />
? The Staged War
<br />
? War Propaganda
<br />
? War Atrocities
<br />
? War Agenda
<br />
? False Justification
<br />
? Who Armed Iraq?
<br />

<br />
It sounds like this guy is out to prove the the world is bad.  I would not trust this site completely.  Especially since i have not seen a report about this on any of the major networks.  Just a warning (not that i dont need it either), dont believe everything you read, see, or hear.

You don't see reports about this on major networks because they're all controlled. The internet is really the only completely uncensored source of information, but like you said, that means you can't trust everything you read on it.
<br />

<br />
That said, Alex Jones is fighting to expose these things. He has facts to back up his claims. He's not out to prove that the world is bad, just some of the people who run it. When you first stumble upon some of this information, it does look like he's trying to pull stuff out of his ass, but he has facts to back up his claims.
<br />

<br />
I'd suggest watching one of his documentaries. Terror Storm is the newest, and can be found at the following link.
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4757274759497686216&amp;q=terror+storm" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4757274759497686216&amp;q=terror+storm</a>
<br />

<br />
Then do some research of your own to see if he's telling the truth, or if he's making this stuff up.
