			Recently, I was browsing the web when I found a site with a variety or -kinesis abilities. If I remembered the site anymore, I'd post links. I'd google it, but I'm too lazy for my own good.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, among the abilities was chronokinesis. I looked into it, and what it basically does is alter one's perception of time. For example, if you slowed your perception, everything would appear to be in slow motion. However, to those around you, you would be a speeding bullet. A really big one, too. The opposite could be achieved, as well, according to the site. Make yourself slower and the world around you bullet filled.
<br />

<br />
Now, after some time, a question occured to me. Say you needed more time, so you slowed your perception of time so that you could work much faster. How would this affect the aging process? There are three reasoning points, as far as I can tell.
<br />

<br />
The first being that, since you slowed your perspective of time, aging, an aspect of time itself, would slow, as well. Therefore, you'd age slower, sort of keeping up with this new perspective you've placed on yourself. This would actually add to your years, although you wouldn't really realize it. Say you spent what seemed to be a week in the slowed state. Maybe it was really two weeks. However, due to the aging process, you only age that one original week.
<br />

<br />
Then there's the aspect that you'd be unaltered. That time would actually flow normally, as would aging, so you'd be moving really fast, things would be slower to you, and you'd age as though unslowed. However, since you seem to be going through time so much slower, it would appear to gradually wear away at your life. You would perceive things much slower than they really occur, so you'd feel like you'd spent that same theoretical appearing week, when in reality you'd aged that full, real two weeks.
<br />

<br />
Last, but not least, there's the theory that if you speed your body up (which is what the skill seems to do - speed you up so time only seems slower), the aging process will speed up with you, causing you to age the fastest of all. Since in all the other examples, perception was slowed to 1/2 normal, I'll keep it that way for this example to make things easy. Now you've spent what you think is a week in the slowed state. However, it was really two. But, since you're aging so much faster, it really turned out to be 4 weeks, almost a full month, of aging.
<br />

<br />
Now, of course, these numbers are all hypothetical, and I don't really expect someone to spend a straight week in this state. However, over time, they could accumulate such time.
<br />

<br />
So, what is the theory for the rest of you? Slowed aging? What about normal aging? Perhaps it was actually sped up?
<br />

<br />
I don't really know what to think myself. They all seem probable and likely.

			When you do chronokinesis, it is the alter of one's <span style="font-weight: bold">perception</span> of time.  I know you said that but i am emphisizing Perception.  It would do nothing to your ageing and it would make you appear the same speed as everyone else.  The point of it is to do something like make your day/week/hour feel like it is going faster.  An example of this is when you come back from school/work and you think to yourself that the day went fast.  You didnt age faster.  You didnt move faster.  Time itself stays the same.  it is how the brain percieves the time passing.  Hope this helps.

			Agreed. It has nothing to do with psychokinesis. The only thing I could think of that could stop the aging process is &quot;Bio Kinesis.&quot; (sorry I used it for lack of a better word =\) There are these structures on the ends of a divind cell called Telomeres (correct me if I'm wrong, my bio teacher was a quack anyway). Everytime the cell divides it looses a telomere causing the aged look and which is why we die after about 100 years if not killed by disease. If you were to use &quot;Bio-pk&quot; and stop the telomeres from falling off then I would imagine you wouldn't age as fast and could live longer... This is only a theory and I am by no means suggesting you attempt it. Though, I would if I got really good at Pk and was like 70 years old.

			I do believe, I've heard that simple meditation can decrease the aging process.
<br />

<br />
Jynx, Bio-Psychokinesis, is a better word.
<br />

<br />
so, meditation and Bio-psychoinesis, would be a great benefit for the agining deduction, but we can never become immortal.

2. The only time distortion I've ever witnessed or heard from legit sources is based on distorting the perception of time.  Everyone can distort their perception of time - in fact, we all do it every night.  When you sleep, does it really feel like 8 hours?  Or maybe like 1 hour?  Meditation and trance can distort your perception of time as well.
