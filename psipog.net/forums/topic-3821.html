			Psi Armor? Having the characteristics of REAL armor? Such as Chain Mail, Plate Maile, ETC? No, you can't make Psi armor.
<br />

<br />
You CAN however mimic the look of it and give it a purpose to stop Psi <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. Also, I am unsure if anyone could flare something that large. Try Telepathic Projection instead, I used to do something to that affect.

			i dont like thinking so definitively like sheep does. like i said in another post, the application of psi seems to be absolutely limitless. so the only thing holding you back is yourself. 
<br />

<br />
there may be obstacles you need to cross; being powerful enough and such, but in the end if you do achieve that power (which i believe you can) you can do absolutely anything.
<br />

<br />
so long answer short. of course you can make psi armour. you can do what you truly think you can do.

			FreakinRican is right, in a sense.
<br />

<br />
The scope of Psi abilities could very well be limitless. I have merely scratched the tip of what could be a very large iceburge.
<br />

<br />
I think like I do because I have  established a temporary limit based on what I can/have done in the past. Anything beyond that... Improbable <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. I don't like to sound out there and claim everything is possible.

			Claiming that &quot;everything is possible you just have to <span style="font-style: italic">believe</span>!!&quot; and the like is the fast track to fluffdom. There are practical limits. If nothing else, there's a limit induced by biochemistry - our bodies can only produce and control so much before we burn out or overload. That's been well demonstrated.
<br />

<br />
Hard, physical armor would be impractical. The reason is that armor has been phased out in modern use due to the advent of the firearm, and that firearms are the most common weapons. Nevermind the fact that if you really want armor, you can buy it straight away, without having to maintain it off your field or ensure it's charged and programmed properly.
<br />

<br />
Think practical and pragmatic - what good would having armor serve? Very little. How difficult would it be? More difficult than anyone who might have that ability would want to put into it. The costs don't meet the limited benefits, so nobody who had the skill necessary (and I doubt anyone does) would even bother.

			Not everything you do with psi is practical and useful. Most of the time it's just to test ourselves and the mind. Other times it is used as a hobby. Just because you can't stop bullets wioth psi doesn't mean it's not fun to make armour.

If all he means is close-body shielding fashioned after armor, then yes, it's certainly possible, and it's possible to bring it into the visible spectrum, though not easily or reliably. I've flared shields visibly before, but neither intentionally not consistently.

It's a fair cop. I should clarify that the people who have the skill necessary to do this kind of thing tend not to bother, because the costs outweigh the benefits significantly. You'll learn when you get to a certain point that the &quot;novelty&quot; of something 'really cool' like armor that takes half you reserves just isn't worth the effort required.
