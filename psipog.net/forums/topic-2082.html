			I'm not sure whether someone else posted about this in the past but i have had a thought about programming and a way to make it easier. Although i havn't tested this out yet, i hope to in the near future. Ok, it simply goes like this:
<br />
You create a psi ball as normal but instead of mentally visualising or saying whatever it is you want it to do, you just tell it to take &quot;temporary commands&quot; from you... <span style="font-weight: bold">verbally</span>.  Of course this does involve a little bit of mental programing but in theory it should work because if it can understand you mentally, then why not verbally? 
<br />
This is theory (well, unless someone else has experimented with this) but i'm pretty confident that it will work.Doing this should make it a hell of a lot easier to tell it what to do. All you have to do is say it outloud and it will do it. 
<br />
e.g. close the door (assuming it is powerful enough and properly shelled), or scare the cat (lol) etc.
<br />
Any thoughts on this idea? Would it work?

			to me its the same thing but in different ways.....since you made it, you can tell it mentally but you can also use verbal....I might start using this instead of my usual way since I have trouble <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I've been doing that too here and there. My psi powers are still too weak to do anything drastic though ^_^ But i'll try pure verbal in a bit.

			uh i find mentally doing it easier because i follow the principle that psi is a biproduct of your nervous system, i.e. electric currents or w/e. when i think nervous system i think of the brain. when i make a psiball i can send the message via the source, the mind directly into the ball.
<br />

<br />
when i think verbal, i just think sound waves hitting the ear drum, and it will just washover :S still though, whatever works for ya!

btw says you live in england, whereabouts? i live in the southeast, just outside of london.

			I tried pure verbal, it still works just like mental for me. However if i were to do it in a public place, people would think i'm weird. I'll just stick to mental ^_^

sweet. the reason i asked is because iv gathered a small amount of UK psions, so we can chat about this shit over msn or the phone or whatever. its just abit easier than having to refer to a forum or two constantly, and besides, training days can be arranged.
<br />
i already pilgrimmaged to gloucester from london (took 5 and a half hours getting there <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> )to see a psion to practice some fashizzle.
<br />

<br />
was good, just didnt know whether youd be up for joining. its mainl me and this other dude in gloucester as we always chat over the telemophone about all of this.

I think the whole thing with this though is the emotional connection w/ the verbal commands you are giving the ball. 
<br />
So let's say you're madly in love w/ someone. What do you think of when you think of love then? Most likely that other person. Now flip it aroud; what do you think of when you think of that person? Most likely the mad love you feel for them. 
<br />

<br />
So you are sending mental commands, but they're being translated into verbal commands. I'm not surprised if it makes it easier to practice psi. 
<br />
There is a flaw though. I remember reading about one of the 'talking to your subconscious' articles and it talked about translating. It also said that you can translate poorly, since language is limited when it comes to describing true emotions and sensations.
