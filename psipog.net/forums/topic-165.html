i think it's good that they are separated because psiballs are such good starting places. I do think that if there were a basic energy manipulation section, people could post questions or comments on moving energy without having to take up space in the &quot;psiball room.&quot;

			I'd say that either the psi ball section and constructs section should be merged or that the psi ball section should just be replaced with a noob section.  It really has become more of a noob sub-forum than a strictly 'Psi Balls Only' place.

The psiball forum is kinda acting as a first-stop for anyone who doesn't know quite where their ideas should go.

It's a good point. I think the hello's/goodbyes part should go at the top so people can actually see it before they post holy bullshit. Either that or a rules section.

the problem may be that, as psiballs are the first thing we do when we start, that forum is considered as a general newbie forum, and thus, things start to mix up.
<br />
or maybe we're just &quot;untidy&quot; people!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I still think that a separated &quot;basic energy manipulation&quot; would help, leaving psiball forum for... well.. psiball stuff, but i don't know how much it'd help, taking in consideration how much people respect topics...

See ya!

Agreed i think that is a very good idea. Keeps all the &quot;unusual&quot; away from the psi ball topics too.

			Maybe something like having a subforums inside the psiball forum. The default subforum could be Psiball-Begginers, and the other could be Psiball-Expert.
<br />

That way it might be able to filter some of the more newbish bits of it and give a way for advanced members to easily look at the expert subforum.

			I think all you can do at most is maybe put rules more visable and stick another moderator or two in, psiballs are the first step in most cases so the forum is going to be a gathering point for newbies, some who don't like the whole &quot;forum rules/etique&quot; thing.

Great idea. But three, Beginners, Intermidiate and Expert would make me personally more comfertable, as I don't consider myself an expert, but I'd prefer not to have to ask something and be answered only by idiots.

			I agree subsections would be good, but you might want to split it like so: Beginners
<br />
-----------
<br />
Advanced
<br />
-----------
<br />
Flaring
<br />
Manipulating
<br />
Shelling
<br />
Energy Sources
<br />
Adding Feelings
<br />

<br />

<br />
something like that, one big one for beginners, and then for advanced it is split into the larger topics, so you have overflow in beginners, and the rest is neater.
