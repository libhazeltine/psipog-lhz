			I am going to sound like a liar and a fraud to some of you in this, but I have developed some awesome skills through personal experimentation.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Okay, now I will sound like I am making this up, but a couple of years ago, I discovered an easy large-scale skill. Changing the weather. Firstly, I created a link with myself and the sky. I sent up a piller of psi energy to act as a comunication pillar. I sent up commands in a similar way to programming a construct to tell the weather what to do. It is easy, but it requires patience. The conditions have to be right. i.e. rainclouds for rain. Making wind and making the sun come out is easy.
<br />

<br />
Feel free to laugh in my face.

			Well, before being 100% sure. Do this:
<br />
Visit a site about weather. Check the weather for the next day and change it to the 100% opposite.
<br />

<br />
That means. Look the weather for the next 12hours. It says rain? Make it Sunny. It says snow and -10C? Make it sunny and +10C. 
<br />
That's success...and not the: &quot;Today i will make it rain (seeing the thick clouds <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />)  ...and it rains&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Gl with your endeavours.

Changing the weather would likely require huge amounts of energy. Moving rainclouds, affecting massive amounts of wind, building up static charge in clouds for lighting storms, cooling the air enough to make it snow, all those are huge changes. What makes you think you can change the air temperature for a city-sized area, when it's difficult to heat up a gallon of water, or to lift a car?

			Well, you see the funny thing is that you think the world revolves around you. If this was a skill, the weather would be changing every other second all over the world and the natural cycle of things would be so incredibly messed up that lakes would form where they shouldnt and deserts would suddenly get massive amounts of rain. I think the word chaos would work the best.

			Yea, this is another one that is disproven energy consumption, one time just trying to do just play with the winds to slow the moving of a storm system an extended period of time (not even sure if it worked) took an immense amount of energy, I was basically tired out out for the next could days.

Ill give you an A for effort, but work on the grammar. Its incredibly frustrating to respond to thoughts that dont make sense.
<br />

<br />
In addition, there is no possible way for organisms to affect weather conditions. Maybe you did the snow dance before you went to bed and it snowed, good for you. Enjoy your day off of school and chock it up to coincidence.

			lol  In one of my yahoo groups called &quot;The Main Telekinesis Club&quot; there are a couple kids who claim they can create hurricanes.  I have been argueing with them and they finally gave up because they ran out of statements.  If you are here (any one who claims they can), I spit on your shoes...It is people like you that make skeptics think we are more crazy than we are.  Or as I like to call them, FLUFF BUNNIES!!!!

			the only thing i managed with the weather was when its raining and i want to smoke a cigarette or have to get out i take a few minutes time to visualize that it is dry outside until i get back inside, it has worked a few times but then it could also have been coincidence.
<br />
I wouldnt put up a claim that i can control the weather but i think its more like some form of micro pk visualize the outcome and if you are 200% sure it will happen, it could happen.
<br />
but creating rain from a blue air or something is a big pile of BullShit

What is with this fluffbunny mentality? Farting psi to fly, shooting psi to kill people, it's as if energy can do anything, in small amounts too.
