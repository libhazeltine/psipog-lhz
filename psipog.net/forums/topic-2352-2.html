			If I were to phase any part of myself, i'd do the pinky finger. Who needs it anyway ^___^ I would have a video if I could do it.

			I would try phasing since I can block out pain pretty well, but I don't know if it's the same kind of pain as getting cut or bruised (phasing is kinda unnatural, so the pain could be something I'm entirely not used to), but I can't see a whole lot of practical applications for it other than not having to put a door on my house.  If someone can think of a great use for it, please tell me.

			that's very true. it's really risky to do phasing, but i think by learning more about the world around and understanding psionic skills better you might be able to minimize the risk. this would take many years though.

i still like to think that ANYTHING is possible.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			A beter question would be to hope for a video of phasing to inanimate object through each other, or together

			Phasing CAN hurt, but I like Sky_Psion's skydiving analogy.  However rather than fear dictating whether the experience is painful or not, it's control over one's own mind.  I think I've said this before but phasing is simply a very complex application of micro-PK.  Every subatomic particle has an off chance of simply not existing and so your brain has to influence the &quot;roll of the dice&quot; of every atom so that they are simultaneously out of phase.  But when you're untrained and not expecting to phase, your mind is not totally focused on the task and you have bits of your body phasing in and out.  Rather than having every particle of your body out of phase when intersecting with another object, small pieces of it (including nerves and pain receptors) are spending the majority of their time out of phase, but not all of it.  The result is of course going to be pain as your pain receptors realize your body is &quot;severed&quot; when they pop into existence.
<br />

<br />
This idea is also backed up by the fact that when someone untrained in the practice phases, they end up part way through an object and then are able to push themselves back out of the object.  What is creating that force if not your muscles which are spending some of their time still in phase?  I seriously doubt that many people who randomly phase are also capable of PK to the level of being able to consciously move their body weight whenever desired.  And yet people who phase are not getting stuck and having to go to the hospital with inanimate objects fused with their bodies...

			A good friend (advanced qigong practitioner) told me about it, but you can find it all here:

It's pretty big, so maybe read it as your novel for a while.
