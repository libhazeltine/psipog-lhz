What if you created constructs that helped channel your energy? I figure since it takes a while to actually 'open' up a chakra, might you be subconsciously doing that anyways?

			It's possible but remember that your construct is just a middleman between your body and your energy but chakras are already there, therefore the construct would not be efficient like your energy points.

Just learn how to open them, it will make your life easier <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.

haha,

Well all I can say is that intention is enough to open these chakras. If your intention is strong, and you take a few minutes each day to clear the mind and become aware of your deepest intention to open these chakras, you will. You only need two things in your entire life to get everything you want:
<br />
Attention &amp; Intention.
<br />

<br />
Let's give them a nice name: A.I.
<br />

<br />
Intention is the wish and energy that transformes, Attention is the energy which feeds the intention. this is all you need. You don't have to think about it for the rest of the day, it just happens. Kind of when you would program a construct to do it. I am not an expert in contructs in the sense that I do not even know exactly what you guys mean with construct, but I do use intention everyday. I just have an intention and I give it the time and attention it needs to blossom and grow.
<br />

<br />
So if you would want to open the chakras, you already got the intention now:p, all you need is some pure Attention and let go fo your attachment to the result. Then everything will be done for you.

			Here is a chakra meditation:
<br />
<a href="http://www.swamij.com/chakra-meditation.htm" target="_blank">http://www.swamij.com/chakra-meditation.htm</a>
<br />

<br />
As for a site about chakras themselves, I have not found any legitimate site. There should be a few, but chakras are such a delicate subject, very subtle. it will take someone very advanced in the practice of transcendation and meditation and samadi to come up with truthful and detailes knowledge about chakras. Every mind interpretates differently. try some books.
