			Anyone else here love the DBZ anime?
<br />

<br />
I do. I have the entire Saiyan saga, the entire Androids saga, and then scattered bits and pieces of the rest as I can find them.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I just watched the Saiyan saga the last few days; then I watched the Babidi saga episode Vegeta's Pride. Man, the artwork looks so much better in the Babidi saga than the Saiyan.
<br />

<br />
Actually, from the very first episode to the last ep of the Saiyan saga the artwork gets SO MUCH BETTER. The very first episode the characters look all... wtf? goofy. Then about Ep. 10, they start looking more like the fun guys we know today, with the exception of Gohan.
<br />

<br />

<br />
[i]&quot;You may have invaded my mind and my body... BUT THERE'S ONE THING A SAIYAN ALWAYS KEEPS... <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">HIS PRIDE!&quot;</span></span>~Vegeta
<br />

<br />
Yeah, so I'm DBZ obsessed... Who knew?

			Just a little advice to you and some others. Unless you are one of those &quot;proud to be something or other&quot; people, and don't care what others think about you...then the following may not apply to you.
<br />
But, there are many people on this forum, and many others I might add. That seem to discriminate other people's likings and dislikings. In this case, some may discriminate you for liking Dragon Ball Z. It's funny, because a sort of new one has sprouted too. Naruto, people also discriminate if you like that as well. So sadly enough, I wouldn't tell people about what you like or dislike. Especially if it is something that is looked down upon. You ruin your &quot;image.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Now you people that discriminate and judge other's views so harshly should reflect upon yourselves and not sterotype others. It's sad that some must hide from you guys. I do  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

It used to be you had to post seven different ways to blow up a mountain with a Kamehameha from your 3rd physical eyeball to be looked down on for being a DBZ fan... now being a fan automatically makes me crazy?

You'd be right, as I'm only 17- any anyway, I said 'when I was your age' as my way of saying back in the day <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> I guess I should stop using that phrase now, too, huh?

Yeah... when I say I'm obsessed... I mean I probably know more about it than most people that have watched it, but I rarely bring it up, never have dressed up as a character... WTF is an Otaku? Is it like the giant monkey that Saiyans become? Anyone who thinks they're one of those needs help.

			Otaku is a derogatory Japanese term used to refer to someone with no social life. Quite humorously, many anime fans have taken to referring to themselves as Otaku, wearing it as some sort of badge of honor, not realizing what it means.
<br />

<br />
Judging by the way you talk, you are not what I would call obsessed with DBZ, nor would I say you're an Otaku.
