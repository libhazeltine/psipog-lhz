indeed, just open a large chat on AIM or MSN, and invite evryone to be there at specific time, im good with any time it is, im awake basically all night, ive bent spoons before, but that was just by myself, i hear that when groups do it, they have much better turnouts, maybe we could all do it over webcam or something.

			to apollo:  I was trying to see how it was layed out last time.  Like get ideas to go from.  I dont really know how to bend spoons.  Only did it once, heh.  But we can just fudge all that.  Just give a couple methods, they are all very similar.  But what i really want to know is:
<br />

<br />
In all the sites i went to, they say at parties, you should make it very lively and loud and rambuncious ect. This making it easy to let go, and allow the utencil to go soft.  But how are we suppose to do that while typing and trying to bend a spoon??
<br />

<br />
I say lets just do it.  I'll host I guess, but anyone is welcome to share &quot;how-to's&quot; or take charge, i'll just organize.
<br />

<br />
But first off TIMES!!!!!  Thats the most important thing right now.  What day of the week, and what time of day?
<br />

<br />
and webcams, I know nothing about them.  Sounds cool if multiple people could make videos of them doing it.  Then we could like &quot;montage&quot; the results of the 2006 Psipog Metal Bending Party(I ordain it so)!!   Live feed would be impossible for my computer, but if you could jsut record yourself we could all see them later.  And pictures too.

If you are going to call it that, you need peebrain's permission.  He is the owner of psipog and you do not have the authority to name it that.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, if you went looking, you would find little tid bits on what happened in the first 2 PK parties.  Here are some links.

			GOOD NEWS!!!  and bad news but hey.
<br />

<br />
I was talking to Apollo earlier today:
<br />

<br />
We cannot have the party on psipog IRC.  Bad news but thats fine.
<br />

<br />
Apollo volunteered to have his Wonderful website, Psi-links, to host the PK party on it's own IRC chat room.  As of now the IRC is not up, but when it is this thread will be bumped and I'll post a hopefully reasonable time and date.
<br />

<br />
Also, who has a general knowledge about how Webcams work?  er accually screw that, unless someone has a cool idea.  But, as i was saying, screw that, everyone just have camras at the ready, I wanna make a couple videos of some bendings.  at least 2, then MANY MANY pictures.  I want to try and have some good documentation.  
<br />

			what?  I've never used a IRC chat room, so i'm a lil ignorant of how it works.   And my psipog account is a lil screwy, I dont know my password and giving it my email doesn't seem to be working.  If i could get that working I could figure out the rest.

			lol.  You dont need to go through psipogbot.  read <a href="mirc.php" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/mirc.php</a> all the way up to where it says &quot;type /join psipog_lobby&quot;.  Instead, type &quot;/join #psilinks&quot; (without quotes).  Then your in.
