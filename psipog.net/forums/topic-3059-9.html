In response to your questions:
<br />
Regarding the first paragraph, most I would say visualize themselves with the new changes and it tends to be more forceful &quot;in my opionion&quot; which if it works great but I personally take a more laid back approach that if it happens great, if it doesn't oh well keep trying. Regardless how you look at the various techniques, You must Trust that your Sub-C will know what its' doing and that you won't be harmed!! if you don't have this level of trust achieved, I would forget about this!
<br />

<br />
1. For different people, different results happen, go with what you feel most comfortable with doing and use that method. I would say doing it right before you go to sleep would work best, your body is resting and your conscious mind is in the process of relaxing and drifting off which allows the sub-c free rein to start making changes.
<br />

<br />
2.  And the answer is yes.
<br />

<br />
3.  Yes, I would personally suggest using your emotional desire to bring this point home to your sub-c. Sub-c tries to keep us happy in most cases and will always attempt to protect from any eminent dangers.
<br />

<br />
4.   It varies from person to person, it probebly would go to a more natural shade of grey until you say something different, this is another example of sub-c attempting to protect, it's aware that differences in people from the society norm causes fear which would in turn bring potential emotional and physical harm to yourself.
<br />

<br />
5.  Setting a time limit tends to act as a force on the sub-c and sub-c's are notoriously known for being stubborn. Make your desires known to sub-c and then let it go at it's own pace.
<br />

<br />
6. I wouldn't worry about the impermance it's something that takes practice, and each time you practice it changes faster ect. I'd say it's probable that you could make it permanent but then that adds a whole new set of complexities that your sub-c has to deal with.
<br />

<br />
As for handling society around you, I would just tell em &quot;look i'm a unique individual learning to tap into my own personal abilities, Try tapping into yours and see what happens&quot; They might think it a bit strange but then they'd get use to it ok so you found something new but if you don't blatantly dangle it in front of their faces they'll forget about it.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Thankyou, MarcusT. I am especially greatful for your answer to #5 <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. I tried changes the color of my irises to grey last night. I spent about 20 minutes just saying they will change and about another 20 visualizing it. I couldn't hold focus for visualization constantly though. Is that bad? The most interesting, although somewhat unpleasant, experience that occurred during the exercise happened when I visualized myself with grey eyes. After a little visualization I felt pin pricks of minute pain in both of my irises. I was wondering if you (or anyone else) think it may have been instant transformation or melanin draining or something. When I looked in the mirror this morning I thought I may have noticed something different about my irises but I can't be sure. What I noticed was that there were lighter brown (my eyes are brown) rings on the outer regions of my irises. I am not sure if these were already there but they stand out a lot from the rest of the irises if you look at them at the correct angle (this has to be done at a very close range). Interestingly enough, the ring around my left iris was a bit more visible and defined and coincidentally that was where most of the pin pricks of pain took place. Perhaps more mutation occurred there. Has anyone else experienced this pin-prick sensation before while doing this?

			Ah, that is because your doing ti while your awake and somewhat forcing your sub-c to change it to rapidly hence the pin-pricks. Just tell yourself before you go to sleep and that will allow your sub-c time to adjust the levels where they need to be at a slower pace and will be a whole lot less painful if you even notice it at all in your sleep. It does sound like your moving quick though hehe.
<br />

<br />
As for your visualization question, do what you feel is most comfortable for you, in this case and all other cases with psionic activities the conscious mind is in the backseat. All you can do is try to emote your desires strongly and with it being a powerful emotion, the sub-c will try to follow your desires to make you happy.

Before I discuss what I quoted: I know you answered the the first paragraph of my first post here but I didn't really see how your response included an answer to my question about meditation (no offense). So can you just answer that specifically? (I don't have time to restate the questions, this has to be brief.
<br />

<br />
Back on topic: So do really think the pain I felt signified rapid change? I'm not sure myself. Crap I must hurry (typing this is a risk now; privacy at risk). My brother said my eyes look a little lighter. And it LOOKS as if they have changed even more now. I must provide details another time. Thankyou for the help so far. Bye.

			I had little results in a week, i don't have enough time to meditate. But my greatest problem is: I won't be able to explain this to my parents. They don't like psionics, what would they think if I said I was changing my eye color at will? 
<br />

<br />
I'll continue to try, anyway. Like I always say, reality for me is already sad enough. Time to get my hopes up and follow my dreams, even if they look silly.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

Hmm, how much time does it take for you people to change your eye color?
