			okeydokey i have to share this with all of you! i used to look at PK in a scientific manner, that i was altering electromagnetic/bio electric fields around my body, but since i adopted this method, yes iv had 100% success BUT at a far more shitty rate.
<br />

<br />
last night at about midnight i decided to give the ol wheel a spin (<span style="font-style: italic">poor pun</span>) and i couldn't be bothered to think of it scientifically.
<br />

<br />
to my surprise there was a significant change when i stopped thinking about it.
<br />

<br />
suddenly i felt really connected when i fell into a trance, and i was able to completely control the wheel. usually it would spin for however long i wanted in one direction
<br />

<br />
then i just thought in a really relaxed manner &quot;lets try the other way buddy&quot; and the wheel stopped quite abrubtly and went the other way!
<br />

<br />
fortunately i was filming this at the time!

			That's actually been the same with me. Recently, I've just been looking at it and it seems to spin more happily. I think my sub-c just does it for me, but it means I have less control over which way it spins.  Nice one on the video, sounds good to watch. I tried videoing yesterday, it was going pretty well, for bout 2 mins it was moving quickly, then I got my phone, and it didn't budge. It was like it knew. Sneaky bastard. I'll have to catch it off guard.

			well, duh, nothing can explain psi yet , so far, so it's quite ignorant to follow a theory that doesn't actually work.
<br />

<br />
IF you look at my sig, that is what I been saying for a while Although, I a bit more specific on where to stop thinking at, but its still a general rule.
