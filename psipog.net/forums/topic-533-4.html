			i hate to bring up an old topic, but i want to add my two cents.
<br />
now i read this in a book when i was like 10, so i may not remember it exactly...but the book said that there are two types of black holes. stationary, and spinning ones, it said that supposedly the spinning ones are pulled into a torus like shape from the intense gravity. while if someone were to go into a non spinning one, speghettification would pull you apart untill you are nothing more than a strand of atoms, then your mass would simply be added to it. while if one was to go through a supermassive black hole that was one of the spinning variety, speghettification would be minimal, and you would pass through the event horizon, theoretically out a white hole.
<br />

<br />
as for worm holes, they are where spacetime is bent, and then connected to form a bridge.
<br />

<br />
please keep note that all of this is theoretical, but plausible IMO...
<br />
also, im 14, so dont bash my lack of intellegence <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
on topic: ill tell you this much, if you were able to go out hat far to one, your a gonner, in OBE form your energy, and black holes are entirely capable of ripping you apart. so id suggest not to try anything of this sort.
