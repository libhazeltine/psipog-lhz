			This is one of my best friends.  She is an amazing writter.  Her star book is Esalno.  An amazing story, not completed technically, this is her second time re-writting the story.  She plans to re-write it a few more times and then try and get it published.  Her story is up there when it comes to reviews.  Her stories are all pretty good at the VERY LEAST!!(Esalno=amazing)  Well, just wanted to shove her in the spot light and give some people a good read.  This is what Esalno is about&#058;
<br />

<br />
In a land ripped apart by war, some find themselves coming down the same fork in the road in life - follow the heart or the mind? One assassin must now make that decision. Problem is... she has no heart and her mind doesn't know what to think anymore.
<br />

<br />
(and here is a longer one)
<br />

<br />
Ésalno: Aurora's got it all -- who wouldn't when the leader of half the continent has a soft spot for you? The only thing her ruler and friendasks for in return is loyalty. That's exactly what Aurora gives him, not knowing that her loyalty is worth more than anyone could imagine....
<br />

<br />
Enter the Easterner, a mercenary from the enemy kingdom of Foren, sent into the deserts of DuLexorne on a mission to smuggle a Western traitor to safety. When Aurora hunts him down and comes in for the kill, she begins to learn that her life isn't as simple as it used to be... or rather, that it never was. And, soon, she begins to understand just why her loyalty is so important, and what the Lord of DuLexorne is willing to do for it.
<br />

<br />
The plot is quite original, kind of an anesia story but it's not anesia and it's way cooler. lol
<br />

<br />
There are some not so smooth parts, and the beggining went a lil too long.  But it's REALLY and amazing story.  Please read, and if you read you MUST review at least a few times.  So have fun, check out all her stories!

			Hey cool, I'll have to check it out.

Have you ever ready Terry Brooks? I suggest the Shannara series, but the Word and the Void series is really good too.
