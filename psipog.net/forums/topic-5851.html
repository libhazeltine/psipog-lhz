			Herm, that has been debated enough, I suppose in the longevity of your life yes, in the longevity of your psi career I say no. It pretty much increases the gap between your mind and body making it harder to control your mind.

Um, how about we try incesent smoke instead.

umm no it doesn't...When are people going to stop giving advice on things they know NOTHING about. I've been smoking weed for like 6 years now...at one point like 3 times a day for a year! (stoner I know  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ) And I've experimented with it MANY times when doing PK and if anything it's actually made it easier for me<span style="font-style: italic"> most </span>of the time. It makes it 10x easier to focus on <span style="font-style: italic">one</span> thing at a time and relax...don't even try to argue me on this because I bet I've experimented with it  10x more than anyone on here...the only time it makes it harder is when you go overboard with it and then you don't even care about what you're doing and you zone out. There's nothing you can tell me about weed that I haven't experienced or researched all ready...nothing..and if you are going to research it make sure it's VERIFIED research that was done. There are sooooo many articles/documents out there from the 60's/70's/80's all speaking about experiments done(almost ALL proven to be untrue in &quot;recent&quot; experiments/reviews ) which were exxaggerated, misconstrued, or flat out lied about simply to fight the large explosion of marijuana use at the time.
<br />

<br />
P.S I can only speak about this with PK though...I haven't tried anything else high yet...also some of my best PK sessions were done when I was high..and I also do very well when not high..It will have NO long term affects on your PK. I can say this because I started smoking even before I knew <span style="font-style: italic">anything</span> about this site/abilities and I've been progressing faster than most others I've read about  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
P.S.S  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> ...smoke rings are all in the tongue and jaw..don't blow the smoke out, push it out with your tongue..practice practice  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

This wasn't ment to start an argument, but I as well have been smoking a good 5-6 years. I did however quit, when I noticed how it affect my pk. I have never met anyone besides you who claims it helps, maybe for some, but for most it wont. And don't say it's good. It just shuts up your consious mind, but then once reitred from the drug it leaves your mind &quot;burnt&quot; as they say... meh, what ever you say man. I know it doesn't cause this ... prevents that, I know just as much as you do. Just don't tell people to do it with anything that is harmful (not saying you did.)

How do you KNOW it will be detrimental for &quot;most&quot;? Because you and a couple friends came to that conclusion? I'm not condoning the use of it in any way. I'm just stating the facts and please don't make me bust out all the technical ones in the next post because I can get very scientific and it will be very long.(If you want the facts behind it I'll give them to you.) Shuts up your conscience mind?? Leaves your mind burnt?? Listen my friend, it DOES NOT shut up your conscience mind. If it did you wouldn't even know the difference between right and wrong, and you know that's untrue. And even if you meant SUB-conscious mind that's still wrong seeing as I hear mine clearer half the time. I've also stopped smoking for long periods of time and it's <span style="font-weight: bold">never</span> left my mind &quot;burnt&quot;. You're referring to the <span style="font-style: italic">stereotypical</span> &quot;burnout&quot; smoker. This is not a fact and I will prove it to you if you'd like. More often than not a heavy smokers mind is left &quot;burntout&quot; either because of other drugs taken during the large &quot;smoking periods&quot;, or because of lack of brain stimuli.

I, too, used to be a stoner, smoking about 6 times a day for a year. I agree with you on, well, all of your points about smoking it. It depends on how smart the individual is in the first place. My mind was never left &quot;burnt&quot;. However, <span style="font-weight: bold">this is just me, and everybody is affected by it differently.</span>
<br />

<br />
It's weird, you can learn how to utilize it's effects to your advantage.
<br />

<br />
However, with that said, <span style="font-weight: bold">stop trying to make little flame wars over the stupidest things</span>. It just shows people how immature you are. You could've just said, &quot;No, it doesn't, and I know from exerience.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
That would've been all that was needed. Seriously, dude. What the hell....Grow up.
<br />

<br />
Also, how the fuck can you say he's wrong? That's what happened to him. <span style="font-weight: bold">He isn't you.</span> Stop trying to impose your fucking <span style="font-weight: bold">opinion</span> on every person you don't agree with.

I think using incense and trying to affect the smoke would be a great idea. Maybe, letting a glass fill up with it, trap it in there, and see what you can do, like make a little opening in-between the smoke.
