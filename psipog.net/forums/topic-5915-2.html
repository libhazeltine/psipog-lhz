			i use magic and i have created a sevitor but they are pretty much the same thing no matter if you use psi or magic, they are still being created by us to do somthing, energy is energy no matter if you used magical or psi just different ways of making them. the second one i made didn't listen to me and still doesn't but the first she does but just doesn't show herself alot. that reminds me to feed energy to her.

oh, and i like the way it looks it looks cool.

			Servitors, sigils, and godforms are all aspects of chaos magick.  I'm suprised no one has google'd servitor yet...it's a pretty logical step to take  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Anyways, here is a link which describes it...And you might want to scroll down a bit to where it says:  What is a servitor?  
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/servitors.html" target="_blank">http://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/servitors.html</a>
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.chaosmatrix.org" target="_blank">www.chaosmatrix.org</a> is the main site, there is more information there, which also explains the name.
<br />

<br />
Also, by calling this a third grade drawing, you are personally insulting the creator's artistic ability, which some people take very personally.  
<br />

<br />
Ultimarage, psi-pets can be used by anyone, if they know how to, just like any other construct.  Also, keep in mind that this is magick, I'm not too sure if the same principles in programing apply.  But, let's just say this is psionics.  Some advanced people can create sentient, complex constructs in a matter of minutes.  It just depends on you're experience.
<br />
To answer your question, the astral plane is where you go when astral projecting, or when having an OBE.  Some people believe it is between consciousness (sp) and sub-c.  Some people believe it is between our dimension, and another dimension.  Others believe it is between our world, and the afterlife.  Basically, there isn't a 'set' definition for what or even where the astral plane is. 
<br />

<br />
Note the quotation marks around psi-pet and astral plane in metaalchemy's last post.  He is trying to use the closest terms in <span style="font-style: italic">our</span> &quot;dictionary&quot; to describe his servitor.  It isn't really a psi-pet, but that is the closest word we use to what he is trying to describe.  It might not exactly live in the astral plane, but that's the closest word we use to what he is trying to describe.
<br />

<br />
If anyone has any more questions about the astral plane, look here:
