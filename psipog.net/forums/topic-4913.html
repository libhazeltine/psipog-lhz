			Greetings

Let me begin by stating that I am extremely new to this art, and have only recently discovered this website a couple of days ago. 
<br />

<br />
     While the idea of &quot;Psi&quot; fascinates me, I feel as if I would need some real, solid proof of its legitimacy to motivate me to the extent necessary to practice and pursue it. While the videos currently posted are great, I have seen effects equally astounding through the use of magnetics and/or various camera tricks. Reading through the posts, it appears as the standard proof to one's self of the creation of a &quot;psi ball&quot; is the warping of the colors on a computer monitor. Unlike the sensations of warming or magnetisism, I feel as if this would be hard evidence of the ability (after all, the mind can to drastically alter the perception of one's reality). Please, if you have the means, post media (a video or even a picture) of this ability and make a believer out of me.

I believe that all the necessary media to inspire you to practice is already available.  If you understand that these videos can be faked, then you also understand that any video provided to you can be subjected to the same dose of skepticism.  The surest way to get proof is to try it for yourself and see if you can make something happen.  Outside of that, you can look around and find some psychology and parapsychology research articles that use statistical means to prove or disprove psi phenomenon.  Even if your eyes can deceive you, statistics cannot (if done correctly, of course).  Best of luck to you.

Ok...We get people like you come on here all the time and spam this bullshit so please stop. We used to always help out but after the tons of people who think we have something to prove to them or to anyone else for that matter we stopped caring what the hell they thought. Do you think it's our duty to convince you? It is our choice and we're damn nice to help so many people out as is...
<br />

<br />
 Why do we have to convince you? Are you unable to give it a good college try yourself or are you afraid you will fall flat on your face?(not very likely) If anyone else wants to help you so be it but I'm tired of debating people on why we should always help them, I'm ready to just argue now. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />

<br />
      Now that some steam is taken off, I will say that I won't show you but I can teach you if you read a few articles to get familiarized with terms, exercises etc.

Theres a lot of this happening lately, people join PsiPog, expect Pk to happen on their first try, and it doesnt. They then come on 'the Pog', and expect us to do it for them, to show them that it can be done. But even on the rare occasion someone does give them a video involving Paranormal means, its shot down and told its fake.

And it seems like every time someone doesn't get requested evidence, they imply that we're all delusional.  Funny how that works, eh?  We've made it abundantly clear to you how to get solid evidence, do it yourself.
<br />

<br />
So of course, ignore my suggestion to seek out research articles.  Ignore advice to try it for yourself.  Lash out and passive-aggresively accuse us of being phoneys because we're not displaying _our_ abilities in a manner that _you_ think we should.  Skepticism is fine, but you're becoming offensive and lame attempts to coax us into proving ourselves will not be tolerated.  Have a nice day.

I've done it multiple times.  In fact, one time a skeptic told me he would donate $20 to psipog if I demonstrated something psychic to him.  I read an image from his mind correctly, and he said he didn't know how I did it... and then left.  No $20, big surprise.
<br />

<br />
If anything, the skeptics have a far worse reputation than psychics do, as you can see by reading the posts on these forums.  We aren't evading you because we have no skill.  We don't jump on the opportunity to prove it to yet another skeptic because, when we succeed, ... nothing happens.  The best case is that you say &quot;coincidence&quot;.  How is that appealing to us?
<br />

<br />
A MUCH BETTER idea is that you practice for yourself.  You could get a psi ball in a day or two.  Some people spin the pinwheel in a week or less.  It really doesn't take that much effort to prove it to yourself, if you are really interested in proof.

			Alright you sucked me in, I'm beginning to believe.
<br />

<br />
After several attempts throughout the day, I began to to feel the sensation that many of you seem to be describing... kind of like grabbing a small, soft, warm pillow. Also, after focusing on an area other than my hands, I was able to feel the same sensation In the area where my focus had shifted. The thing is, when I cup my hands in a manner Identical to that which I use to create the ball, the sensation returns. Granted its much less intense than when I focus, but it is a sensation none the less. Is my mind playing tricks on me? Am I beginning to get it? Any suggestions, advice, vicious hateful flaming, etc... would be greatly appreciated.
<br />

That's normal.  You've associated your hand position with the psi ball.  So when you put your hands in that position, your mind says &quot;oh, he wants a psi ball... ok&quot;.  With a little bit of extra practice, you can break this assumption your mind has made (if you want).

I used to associate my breathing patterns with psi... so I could only make a psi ball while breathing out.  It took me about a day to break that association, and now it's no problem to send a constant stream of psi while I breathe in and out.

			Eh, I have some qualms with psiballs and the sensations you're supposed to feel.  I would relegate anything that feels tingly or feels like a change in temperature (heating or cooling) to the realm of increased circulation to the surface of your hands as caused by increased attention to that area.  What convinces me is the magnetic attraction/repulsion sensation that occurs when you make a psiball.

1. If everyone was faking it, people would be throwing media(photos, video, etc.) at everyone who asks for it.   People would also probably be saying &quot;You cannot do this, only we can.  We're special.&quot;.    Instead, people are just telling you to give it a go yourself(and, thus, allow YOU to make up your own mind, instead of us); if it's fake, you'd prolly find out pretty quickly.
<br />

<br />
2. If we did provide media, you'd shoot it down as fake, just as you shot down the media already provided.
