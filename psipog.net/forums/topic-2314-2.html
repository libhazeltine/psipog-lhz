			you have to understand that your brain is very.... make it up along the way. And what i mean by this is, when you see a shadow in your dream that looks like something, then you say, it looks like &lt;insert random monster here&gt; then it will be. You see what i mean? Even if it looks like it, if the answer is something you will fear, then totally contridict yourself and actually beleive it. Much like how you would move a psiwheel. Before you got good, you sub-conciously &quot;knew&quot; the wheel wouldnt move, but through practice in contridicting yourself, you got it to move.

you felt sleep paralysis comming on and felt &quot;trapped&quot; it wasnt that your dreams were trapping you. This is my guess.

			I used to have a weard dream when i was a kid, i was dreaming that i was walking outside my house and suddenly i saw a dark figure in cloak that started to walk towards me in the dream i ofcourse started running but no mater how fast i tried to run i allways moved so slowly and when it allmost catched me i woked up sweaty and fearful. it continued night after night untill i was tired for running and curious what would happen if it really catched me so i stopped in my dream and the dark figure walked right infront of me and stopped and stared at me and then suddenly just walked  away then i woke up and havent had that dream after that... pretty strange :S
