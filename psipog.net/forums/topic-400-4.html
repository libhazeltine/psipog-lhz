Usually an &quot;awakening&quot; takes place during puberty as hormones get released and the body changes, there are a lot of sientific things about that change that could explain it, but I'd have to dig up some things and that might take a while. Anyways it is possible the body changes in a way that decreases the ability to create sufficient energy. When a body is healthy a kids body doesn't really age as they have some different chemical thing that is also found in some animals. Anyways kids might be the fountain of youth for all we know. So it's possible that after puberty the body changes enough to show that it really doesn't produce enough energy. It's not like an awakening happens overnight as tales like you to believe. But that's just my opinion.

			As a possible psi vampire (but still skeptical) this is the way I see it:
<br />
Everything has a sort of 'life force', which is probably the same sort of thing as psi. Think of accupuncture, when the practitioner adjusts the flow of the life force to make patients feel better. This life force is somehow connected to feeling happy and well.
<br />
Now, for some reason or another (the Psychic Vampire Codex (which I find interesting, but do not fully agree with) blames it on a 'broken chakra' just under the belly button), some people don't have a good store or flow of this life force, or don't find the one they've got to be sufficient. These people tend to draw energy in to themselves, usually from things that are full of life force, like other people. Psi vampires apparently draw in energy without being aware of it.. quite often, they are attention-seeking, try to make people pity them, or try to set off emotionally charged (and energetic) situations like arguements.
<br />

<br />
If the above is true and if the ability to manipulate unseen (well, usually unseen) energy exists, then it should also be possible for someone who is lacking in life force to learn how to conciously draw it in, a bit like the idea of drawing from a source to create a psi ball.

			Okay, that was the most potentially fluffy, yet non-fluffy post I have ever read. Wow, congratulations. 
<br />

I'd like to point out a few of the things you did correctly (I hope the fluffbunnies see this and take notes):

You point out that it is your opinion, and not fact, which is good.

See above comment, except it's someone else's opinion this time.

This statement makes it clear that the following is a hypothetical situation only.

Once again, congratulations.

Is it by that guy Konstantinos? I have one of his other books, they are interesting, but I don't think he's right. Actually I pretty much disagree with allmost everything in his book.

			Some people pull &quot;energy&quot; from nearby people, without realizing it.  In the case of one person specifically, sitting near (within 15 feet or so) her for any length of time, tended to result in feeling sedated.  I was not the only one affected thus.  It became something of an on-going joke in our circle of friends at the time.  Does that make her a &quot;Vampire&quot;?  Not necessarily.  That kind of effect is noted in some of the &quot;psychic&quot; literature from a hundred years ago, so it isn't exactly unheard of.  Adjusting the outer part of the field into what amounts to an intact bubble shield tends to solve the problem.
<br />

<br />
As for other &quot;psi-vamp&quot; types?  *shrugs*  Outside of my experience, so I'll not comment on them.

			my two cents: i agree with lightbringer.
<br />

<br />
also as kind of a side note i would point out that from my mere human perspective i could create the belief that i am anything i choose.  if i really wanted to believe i was a worm in the ground i could fool myself into believing it, and i could act the part.   and if i wanted to believe that psychic worm people come to the planet from mars and i am one of them i would be able think myself into it and create sufficient proof that it was real from inside the belief system.
<br />
  this doesn't make it true, obviously.
<br />

<br />
so i wonder which came first,  the psyvamp or the person how wanted to be a psyvamp.
<br />

<br />
again, i agree with lightbringer, unless they're frying the circuts of everyone around them they're more or less functioning as normal humans function (in the culture i've been exposed to)

That is something I have been aware of for a very long time. I've always had a very active imagination, so I am aware of how real the unreal can feel (see quote <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />. This is why I always make it clear that I am not saying 'yes, I'm certainly a 100% real psi vamp' or indeed 'yes, psi and related abilities are certainly 100% real'. In fact, I sway (quite strongly) towards psi and psi vamps being a figment of the imagination. But still, if it enriches people's lives and if they don't get too obsessive, 'placebo' paranormal practices aren't necessarily a bad thing.
<br />
In fact, I wrote an article along those lines last year: <a href="http://ciepher.livejournal.com/10607.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://ciepher.livejournal.com/10607.html</a>
<br />

<br />
But then, it seems that the experiences of people who claim to be psi vamps feel as least as real as the experiences of people who claim to be able to make psi balls, shields and constructs, perform telepathy, empathy, clairvoyance and so on.
<br />
That is the problem when you get in to the realm of personal paranormal experiences, a personal experience of the paranromal is something that can never truly be proved wrong or right, precisely because it's all going on in the thoughts and feelings of the individuals involved.

			A psi vamp used to go to my school, she wasn't very friendly. I wasn't sure wether it was voluntary or involuntary but it sure bugged me. She would drain me during class, since I was the only psion in the school I was a favored target. Aside from the headaches I didn't mind it much(as I am an extremely laid back fellow), I did shield regularly and she seemed too weak to penetrate it. 
<br />

<br />
Although she would get crabby after she couldn't &quot;feed&quot; I think she's aware of her power now, since I last saw her, she seemed to drain me before I even knew what hit me. But she left and I'm alive. The moral of the story: Even though they &quot;feed&quot; they aren't always evil, after all they need it sometime too. Just shield, be cool, don't retaliate, the less trouble the better.
