			I don't get it your whole body phased you went through the sofa, not through the floor but rolled along the floor while phasing through sofa. I always feared phasing and like falling through the ground or something.

Phasing is complicated...

			Phasing, in my opinion, is perfectly scientific. The space an atom takes up is very little compared to what the 'size' is. If you can alter the magnetic force or the movement of the electrons, you could theoretically phase through something. You'd only feel pain if you triggered nerves.
<br />

You said you could get pics, right? A pic would work for me as proof.

			I ment take a picture of my living room, so everyone could see the setup of it, as everyone seems a little bit confuzzled on the subject. Some people say the sofa was against the wall, and i also phased through the wall. This is untrue, the sofa is in the middle of my living room, i jumped into a foetal position (as you do when you're having a tantrum and want to throw yourself about), meaning to land into the cushions, but phased completely through the sofa, landed on the flagstones behind the sofa (the sofa sits on flagstones, duh) and dislocated my knee, not my face.

It might be because they expected it to hurt, i expected it to feel like a slight pressure, and it did.

			you are free man...You can go through walls and solid matters and you how to do it.In my opinion anyone with already a PSI developed skill should feel proud..You have your thing..Noone can take that from you.Noone request money for that.Instead of learning stupid math equations that i will not use too much i will rather learn myself..
<br />
Btw try to fly..Try to consider the air like a wall and fly throught it in atmosfeare...I have so many ideas and i didn't develop any of PSI skills yet..is so frustrating <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
<br />
For all of you who don't understand phasing i think air and running/walking through it is a good example..Maxus keep trying and perfect the phasing and be proud of you..When nature will kill you ppl can't do to much about it.Is not important what ppl consider.PSI things are very delicate in this controlled and afraind society.Ppl are trained to be afraid of such things.Ppl are controlled this way..BE PROUD that you can experience REAL things that we are made for..GOOD luck and i am fucking happy that i joined this forum..

Also, badsykes........Every day is a new triumph, dont let anyone hold you back of what you want to do. I suggest you get learning, as Psionics is one of the best things in my life, it is great fun and trains the mind at the same time. Even though it does take a while to learn the skills, they are extremely beneficial.

			isn't that somehow dangerous in a way that since it's seems to be very new, how can you control that phasing like you want?
<br />
I explain myself (sorry if I missed a detail somewhere, that might be the reason of my question), you went through the sofa, and stopped at the flagstones. Did you think about stopping right there, or was it pure luck and in fact you could have gone a lot further... like phasing through the sofa, then through the groiund, then let's say you reach tbe first floor and still you go down to the basement, and why not in the end travel through the entire Earth and reach the other side of the planet? I'm maybe exagerating a bit, but after all, why not?

			First off, this was on the ground floor, and i do not have a basement. The ground floor is it, no more room under that, as the flagstones are layed straight on the dirt (i live in a very, very old house). After i had phased through the sofa, i was so suprised that i had done it, and scared i would go into the floor, but i didnt go into the floor, i hit the flagstones (the floor, duh) and dislocated my knee. Damn, how many times have i written that, and i think i didnt go through the floor because i was afraid it would hurt.

			So if I understand correctly now, you jumped through the sofa without touching the floor? Or did you land on the floor while in the sofa cause selective phasing while phasing your whole body would be awesome!
<br />

<br />
You seem to have had one of those in for a penny in for a pound kinda things happen with phasing.... Like you experienced it a little bit and suddenly that experience opened up the whole skill for you. Congrats!
