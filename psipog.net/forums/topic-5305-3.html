What I'm saying is that we're still very primitive, and that goes whether we accept it or not. The problem is that we see ourselves as very advanced, but in fact we have no clue what is really going on.

Sorry to burst your bubble:
<br />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f9/Three_cell_growth_types.png" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
And let's not forget the cell cycle:  (Source=wikipedia)
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Although the various stages of interphase are not usually morphologically distinguishable, each phase of the cell cycle has a distinct set of specialized biochemical processes that prepare the cell for entry into the next stage. It should be remembered that, throughout interphase, the cell carries out its normal metabolic activities and is actively engaging in transcription and translation of its genome.
<br />

<br />
In G1 phase, the cell carries on its usual metabolic activities while preparing to duplicate its DNA. These preparations often include growing by increasing the amount of cytoplasm and the number of important organelles such as mitochondria. (This is particularly important in organisms and cell types that divide their cytoplasm unevenly, as in budding yeast.) In G1 a diploid cell (such as a human cell) has a complement of 2N chromosomes, where N is the gene copy number; in sexually reproducing organisms this amounts to one chromosome inherited from each parent. The actual quantity of DNA is described as 2c, where the &quot;c&quot; value is measured in picograms and 1c is equal to the quantity of DNA in a single haploid genome. The end of G1 is demarcated by a &quot;point of no return&quot; beyond which the cell is committed to dividing; in yeast this is called START and in multicellular eukaryotes it is termed the restriction point. 
<br />

<br />
In S phase, the cell duplicates its DNA. 
<br />

<br />
In G2 phase, the cell continues with growth and metabolism in preparation for undergoing mitosis. In this quantity of DNA within the cell has increased to 4c, but the cell is still considered diploid. 
<br />

<br />
In M phase the cell segregates its chromosomes so that both daughter cells receive a total complement of 2N. The four stages of mitosis - prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase - also progress in a sequential and directional fashion, like the cell cycle as a whole. Telophase, the final stage of mitosis, is accompanied by cytokinesis; when the cytoplasm is completely divided, the cycle is complete and the new daughter cells are said to be in G1 again. The exact mechanism of cytokinesis is highly organism- and cell type-dependent; for example, in plant cells surrounded by a rigid cell wall, cytokinesis occurs via the formation of a cell plate, while animal cells are &quot;pinched&quot; in two by a ring formed from a structural protein called actin. 
<br />

<br />
Although the illustration assigns the four stages of the cell cycle roughly equal durations, a cell actually spends a very small amount of its time in G2 phase, and even less time in M phase. The overall duration of the cell cycle depends on the organism and type of cell.
<br />

<br />
The term &quot;post-mitotic&quot; is sometimes used to refer to both quiescent and senescent cells. Nonproliferative cells in multicellular eukaryotes generally enter the quiescent G0 state from G1 and may remain quiescent for long periods of time, possibly indefinitely (as is often the case for neurons). This is very common for cells that are fully differentiated. Cellular senescence is a state that occurs in response to DNA damage or degradation that would make a cell's progeny nonviable; it is often a biochemical alternative to the self-destruction of such a damaged cell by apoptosis.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

			Hi all
<br />

<br />
This is my first time posting in this forum. Usually i was just reading here because it was quite interesting. But here i want to say my opinion to you.
<br />

<br />
It seems really ridiculous to me reading the threads here and how people just dont want to understand what other people are saying. It's like when you're reading you just have one or maybe 1 million assossciatons for that and act in you're answer corresponding to the emotion and information that your assossiatons are referring to.
<br />
But you won't really try to understand that the other person wants to tell you something and what is it he wants to tell you. 
<br />
To me it seems like playing a game with the false rules and therefore not working well. 
<br />

<br />
Hope you get my point.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

JOHNNYBEGOOD, a thing i noticed is, while i was reading your posts is that every time you write an answer you only talk about science and say how good it is. Don't get me wrong, but it seems to me you dont understand what the other persons tell you or maybe you dont want to understand it. 
<br />
Well in fact that's a problem in this whole community and everywhere else, too. It is very sad i think, seeing intelligent people that don't get over the speech barrier and can't share their knowledge with other people.
<br />

<br />
In a way it's because you don't WANT to understand the other people, for whatever reasons so you should try not to be so sticky in your beliefs.
<br />
I hope not sounding offending in any way, but i just wanted to say that.
<br />
Sorry for bad english too. It's not my mother tongue. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I think having understood your point, talking about science and stuff and well yes, science is great. But i think you shouldn't let science be your god or something. Because there's something between the &quot;outside world&quot; that you explain with science and yourself, which is, well who knows.. it's the mind or your perception or maybe just yourself creating the world you are living in. Or at least the beliefs of yourself that let you see the world like you see it.
<br />

<br />
I don't want to say anything like &quot; be more open or open-minded &quot;, because it's like standard here and not recognized anymore. But you should keep in mind that you <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> be wrong in some viewpoints...
<br />

<br />
In the end it's all about the truth, but what does it help if you get stuck somewhere on the way finding <span style="font-style: italic">the truth</span>... <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I hope someone got my point.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
