			I have a notebook with diagrams for a number of simple parts which can be used to create a wide array of psi machines.  Though I am definitely not going to vector-graphic and post what I have, anybody with a little work can duplicate the parts I have so far.  They're simple.  Stuff like gears, cams, chambers, etc.  Though I do have to mention that all this looks and behaves very differently from their mechanical equivalents, their end result is the same.  
<br />

<br />
For example, the intent of the gear is designed to move rotational force.  The psigear is a triangle of routing actions which pass energy in the direction that it was passed to the blocks, and will continue to circle until it is cycled out of the gear.  A steady input and steady output makes it function exactly like a gear would.
<br />

<br />
I also have a toolkit of psi &quot;tools&quot; which I use to create various psi constructs.  Many of them are pretty obscure and serve very limited functions, so I'll list only a couple of the very useful ones here.  Just as before, these are not hard to make, and you can easily make one to fit your situation, and then disassemble it for scrap energy to do something else with.  
<br />

<br />
The most common tool that I use is the psi equivalent of a spooling needle.  When touched to one point, and then touched to another, it leaves a connection.  This connection can then be drawn taut or energizes along the needle.  The second is more like a knife, but it does not cut connections (though it can).  The knife tool can be used to splice any two elements of a construct together.  Put them in the correct orientation, and then &quot;cut&quot; them.  Two self-contained elements have become a single self-contained element.  This can also be used to separate one element into two discrete parts, and to do a number of other tasks.  The third is like a mortarlayer or spade, which can be used to control the shape and orientation of any structural energies being used, or to quickly flatten a blob of energy into a wall or barrier of the desired thickness.  It can be used to add or remove energies from such a wall, whether to make it degenerate, repel, become cohesive, or to make it solid or porous.
