			I can get it to BARELY shake if I'm lucky. I have been practicing about 3 hours (spread out through the day) a day for 2 weeks now. Sometimes I think I'm imagining it move, because it is so subtle. 
<br />

<br />
I try not to use my hands, because I don't want to become dependant on them in the future. I also do it under a glass - always - to make sure wind or heat doesn't affect it. 
<br />

<br />
I don't have one solid technique I stick to. I switch off between about four. Could this be the problem? 
<br />

<br />
I am currently switching to <span style="font-weight: bold">Chakra's technique</span> mostly. In his technique I Get myself into a mild trance like state and try to feel like I am the psi-wheel. I try to pretend I am seeing out of it's 'eyes'. After a couple of seconds of 'becoming the object', I try and make myself (it) spin left by feeling like I have muscle movement and rotating to the right. 
<br />

<br />
The problem here is that it usually doesn't spin. I just get these uncontrollable spasms all down my body. I understand the paper should be feeling these spasms. I thought about why this might be occuring and am suspecting it is because I am not fully focussing all of my feelings and awareness into the wheel. 
<br />

<br />
Another question I had was if I was supposed to lose the sensation of my physical body, because it seems as if I will always get the sensations of spasming in my own body as long as I am in it. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Another question for Chakra:</span>  I was wondering how long ago you started practicing <span style="font-style: italic">this</span> technique.
<br />

<br />
Thanx,
<br />

This could be the problem. It used to take me 5 minutes or longer to &quot;become the object&quot;.

This is something that determination can overcome. It's here that the main ingredient lays.

4 years, on and off.

			5 minutes? Woah! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> How exactly do you do it. It will probably be hard to describe but are there steps you do to 'become' the object?

			Awesome. Thanks for the tips. 
<br />

<br />
I just got back from another 30 minute practice (no music this time) and it seemed like it trembled a tiny little bit, which I guess is good after only 2 weeks. 
<br />

<br />
So you made this technique up 5 years ago and practiced it on and off all the way up until now? When you say &quot;on and off&quot;, how frequent do you mean by that? Did it take the whole 5 years to get the psi-wheel to budge at all or did it have slight rotations before then?
<br />

<br />
Thanks again for your help, Chakra.

I practiced 5 years ago and then developed this technique 4 years ago. I had been on and off, but mainly off. This was back in high school (college now). For instance if the teacher was lecturing, I'd knock down rolled up paper. I never used the psi-wheel, really. I only used paper that was rolled up. I got results from the paper after a long time. I'll just throw out on the table 20 times or so, as it's hard to remember back than.
