			So I realized the other day that whenever I do sports I use PK to make my body more efficient. Lke, becoming stronger quicker than usually. Getting into better shape without working out and stuff like that.
<br />

<br />
I've always remembered my coaches telling me that if you concentrate on what you're working on, like stretching a quad and really feeling it, you end up stretching your quad abou 50% more efficiently (depending on your skill with PK)
<br />

<br />
What I'm getting at is, it seems to me that if a noobie wants to start using PK, I think they should start by using PK in relation to your body. So many people just use it naturally. I think it's a good foot in the door and will make using PK on other things easier since you've grasped a better general understanding.

so if you listen again as your basketball coach tells you to VISUALIZE the freethrow to VISUALIZE yourself making the freethrow you will note the sense of psychological awareness that message brings.

Very interesting insight.  Maybe the reason that we are told to try and move objects just like another limb is because we use the same energy when moving our actual limbs!

			i think you might have to do a little more convincing on the blinking part...
<br />
i dont see how we use pk to blink...our brain sends signals to the muscles in our eyelids that cause it to blink.

			The effect of concentration, in my opinion, has nothing to do with Psychokinesis.
<br />

<br />
Moving your body, breathing, and all that jazz have NOTHING to do with Psychokinesis.
<br />

<br />
When you improve skills through concentration and visualization you are devling into Biofeedback, which is Conscious control of normally unconscious things. It's like improving your ability to contact each nerve cluster in your body, and manipulate them more effeciently.
<br />

<br />
Again, not a Psychic skill.

			Power of suggestion - visualising helps in sports etc because u have an objectuve for which u strive its psychological more than anything else.
<br />

<br />
MUSCLE MOVEMENT IS PHYSIOLOGICAL - the whole ATP thang is still very much a fact - I think the idea of moving an object with pk as if it was an extra limb is based on the idea that it removes mental barriers etc - u dont have any qualms about moving a finger etc. see my point? cant be bothered to elaborate.

			I don't really know what to say to that sheep. I think if someone was moving the mitochondria in the body you would be using PK because certain cells and organisms in the body work independently from the brain. They just react and do what they're programed when they see certain things occur. 
<br />
Take for example white blood cells. I fall down and I cut open my knee. The white blood cells in my knee 'sense' the wound and go straight to work to fix it up. There isn't any connection with the nervous system there, so that means that there was never an unconscious control in the first place. So, in that case you wouldn't be consciously taking control of an unconscious task you might actually just be using PK.

			In those cases those are chemical responses. E.g WHite blood cells like phagocytes respond to histamine from mast cells etc. Hormones trigger other functions.
<br />
Clotting is a chemical process.
<br />

<br />
Ultimately basic, physical, functions are reduced to the chemical etc. If there is a pk element than it cannot be the main cause or whatever of a certain function.

			thanks 626 - You bring upa good point about a possible relationship between pk and bodily functions, while ultimately they occur because of the physical, its always possible that there is some relationship, no matter how obscure it is. I mean if psi is the byproduct of nervous activity then any nervous activity may have a small underlying pk link.
