			From what I've heard from my doctor, and reading, long term memories are stored in the outer layer of the brain, neo cortex, something. anyway, memories get's saved on the brain if you strongly choose to.

			and oh yeah, i also scanned my professor once, when i was practicing in school... and when I scanned, concepts of a hospital came into my mind and that she was still new to teaching business... a week later when we resumed class... she told us that she was from bethany hospital, a registered nurse for 7 years and that she was new to teaching, about just a year... I was shocked really when the information I got from her was quite accurate at that time... but then again, it was just thought concepts and still working on it... and oh yeah, that was the time when i made my class had a headache all at the same time.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Is there any evidence that memory IS stored in the brain? Besides brain damage causing a loss of memory, which can be attributed to other things.
<br />

<br />
If that were true, you wouldn't be able to remember anything when having an OoBE (granted OoBEs are what we assume they are)
<br />

<br />
Maybe memory isn't in the brain at all, maybe the brain just interprets memories.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps &quot;memories&quot; are just instances of different time periods. Let me explain.
<br />

<br />
I view &quot;time&quot; similar to &quot;time&quot; on a dvd, in the sense that it's all there at once, but we access only one part at a time.
<br />

<br />
This lends credence to precognition.
<br />

<br />
When we &quot;remember&quot; something, we could just be accessing another part of the dvd. However, since we aren't naturally attatched to that part (not physically travelling to it), we intercept it hazily.
<br />

<br />
I think it's all really point of view. Of course, this is just me being philisophical. It probably is just stored in the brain...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

Not going to dignify the concept of memories not being stored in the brain with a response.
<br />

<br />
Let's talk about memories a bit, though: memories are formed by generation of mental cues. In fact, you do not truly &quot;remember&quot; situations. We reconstruct situations  in memory by recalling similar factors within the environment. This is why memory is not &quot;complete.&quot; Those things which we have not encoded for recall don't return - though many times we can use context to reconstruct memories with a good degree of recall. For example, when remembering a trip to the restaurant, we do not have a perfect image of the restaurant - rather, we tend to reconstruct it. We know we were at a restaurant, so we were sitting. We know who was there with us, and we can generally place where they were sitting as well. We know what kind of restaurant it was, so we can start to place the settings...and so further.
<br />

<br />
This is also why it is possible to remember things which have never happened to a person, for example, false memory syndrome, where an individual creates memories from scratch either from self-prompting or the prompting of a careless professional, and believes them to have actually happened. False memory syndrome was largely responsible for the &quot;satanic ritual abuse&quot; scare in the '70s.
<br />

<br />
Memories are most closely associated with the hippocampus, though no single brain structure has been designated as a &quot;memory cortex.&quot; As such, there is no particular brain structure which we can damage to destroy <span style="font-style: italic">all</span> memory. However, it does seem to be possible to destroy individual memories through brain damage.
<br />

<br />
As was mentioned before, there are several different types of memory, and it is classified several ways. The first classification is by time - there are sensory, short-term, and long-term memories. Sensory memory lasts only as long as the objects are being detected by a sensory organ; usually less than a second. If this information is worth remembering for any reason, it is then moved to short-term memory, which lasts approximately 7 seconds (so long as it is not reinforced). The average person can hold seven, plus or minus two (so between five and nine) peices of information in short term memory. Long term memory is information that is eventually encoded for retrieval or recall at a later period of time.
<br />

<br />
The next classification is between implicit and explicit memory. Implicit memories are those things stored into longterm memory which remain automatic - how to drive a car, how to do one's job, how to use a computer. These things don't require conscious effort, but are part of the longterm memory. Explicit memory <span style="font-style: italic">does</span> require intentional recall. Situational memory, the name of your ex-girlfriend of three years, and the telephone number for your house are examples of these things.
<br />

<br />
Explicit memory is further divided into semantic memory and episodic or situational memory. Semantic memory is the recall and storage of facts or data. This includes things ilke house addresses, as well as facts about the world, such as the number of soldiers killed at the battle of Verdun, or information about how human memory works (all that college paying off, I guess). Episodic memory, which I discussed earlier, includes memory of the impact of situations or events on us - how we felt, what we saw, what we were thinking, and so further. This is sometimes equated with autobiographical memory, which is the individual's memories of their own past.
<br />

<br />
So, to bring this back around, in the discussion of telepathic applications for memories, there are several tricks. Short of mental hacking, which is actually a rather high end and complicated application, the most direct method of tapping into memories is by use of passive telepathy while prompting an individual to remember things. The telepath may sit in the room and say something that triggers the individual to think of the desired bit of information. Very few people learn the kind of mental self-discipline required to not think about their home address when asked - the thought is often automatic, and can result in a skilled telepath learning personal information by memory rather easily.
<br />

<br />
This predicates on the information most easily available through passive telepathy being information that is just below consciousness - not yet verbalized but being actively cognated. The use of keywords and prompts, however, may be undesirable. You may not want to talk to the person at all, after all, or let them know you're looking for the information. For this reason, you might consider thoughtsending the same triggers to the mind.  Sending a prompt, &quot;remember when you went to the beach...?&quot; may trigger the individual to begin thinking about when they went to the beach. The issue here, of course, is that because we do not yet know the target's memories, we don't yet know how many times they've been to the beach. If they live in Miami, the chances are much greater that we will not get the specific episode we're intending them to remember.
<br />

<br />
Implicit memory is another monster altogether, and while it is possible to steal &quot;how to&quot; memories from other individuals, it is much more difficult - most easily done while that action is in progress. It would appear that lots of natural telepaths learn skills that they've never been shown by mere exposure, it is possible that this is done by picking up the information from another individual's mind while they are learning the task, potentially unconsciously.
<br />

<br />
It should be noted that invasive telepathic activities like those described above can be considered a form of attack, and without permission it is very rude. One should also be warned that there are lots of memories other people may have that you do not want to recall.
