			<span style="color: red">Ok, I'm haveing some problems here and wanted to see if any of you could give me some tips. Alright, the atrticle I read said to clear your mind of all thoughts, I tried but trying to clear your mind of all thoughts just brings up more thoughts and it keeps going in this cycle to where I am completly off track, any tips? Some of you might say meditation, thats the other problem, I can't relax enough to go into that state of mind, plus I find it difficult to stay still for a long period of time. I know what your thinking, man this guy has some issues, maybe your right <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> . Can anyone help me with this please? Thanks!</span>

			<span style="color: red">Well thats the problem, I don't know if I have ADD because I haven't really went to the docter about it. I don't think I do though, I can focus and accomplish things without going off track most of the time. I have no clue why I can't keep focus when trying this, maybe it's just a mental thing. Sometimes I do have a very short attention span though.</span>

			Well maybe you just need to do it more to get the hang of it. Getting a clear head takes practice too.

			Work on meditation. That's kind of a foundation. There's a couple ways you can get into the relaxed state. There's progressive relaxation where you go through the body and relax one or a couple body parts at a time, going from head to toe. Or you can try tensing all of your muscles and relaxing them, over and over, and eventually your body will relax. Rather than thinking about nothing, try thinking of a scene. Maybe a quiet place you would like to call your own, like a beach or something. There are several relaxation techniques, but the more you practice the better you'll do. I used to have a lot of trouble with clearing my head, but with some practice I had no trouble at all. When your thoughts wander either focus on your breathe or focus on your relaxed state, or the object if you're working with one. You'll get it.

			My advice is just simply relax and just focus on something that takes almost no though like your breath or a light or a flame of somesort. Your mind will eventualy clear you just wont notice it.

			A technique that may help you:
<br />

<br />
First of all, get a candle and be in a nice relaxed position and just stare at the flame, let it hypnotize you, and consider thoughts as bubbles floating through your mind, if you don't burst the bubble, there is no thought, takes a little practice but once you get the hang of it, you can have several hundred thought bubbles floating around and still not have any thoughts. Then you can just sit back, and take the time to analyze each thought bubble and letting it drift away. It's similiar to the concept of just swimming in a black sea with thousands of light sparkles around you. I hope this method helps, if not keep checking around and trying different methods.

			Then, Meditate before you practice and think about all these questions, try to answer them all, more you answer less questions..or more.
<br />

<br />
If you find these pointless questions, answer them and move on. Point of meditation isn't only clearing the mind but ponder on specific thoughts.
<br />

<br />
Over time, You'll be able to control your thoughts a bit more.
