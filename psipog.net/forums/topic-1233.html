			<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">THE MAIN POINT (condensed version):</span></span>
<br />
I have tried to psi link to a past self (5 years old), with success.  The benefit of this is the ability of quantum thought, the ability to know everything that you ever will know at one time (infinite knowledge practically).  My 5 year old self now (or did I should say) has the ability of quantum thought, and I can ask him anything, and he will almost certainly know the answer, but may not answer for reasons too long for a summary.  Since this past version of me is capable of quantum thought, he knows everything that will happen to me and has happened to me.  He told me a few days ago that I would decrease my age to 5 successfully very soon.  I tried about 4 days ago to no avail.  I just collapsed from exhaustion in about 7 seconds.  I?ve been biding my psi since then in anticipation of this decrease in age, or &quot;copy him, changing most my cells that did not exist before his time into energy, and increase my melatonin production&quot; as he put it.
<br />

<br />
Before this happened, random words would come to mind that I?d never heard before like &quot;Euclidian geometry&quot;. I fell asleep once while doing a report and found that I had already somehow researched everything while I was sleeping, and wrote my entire report including citations, after waking. I dreamed about writing my report. Has anyone else had any these things happen to them?
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">THE THEORY</span></span> 
<br />

<br />
I did not exactly condense this part.  This part was actually remade for easier understanding.
<br />

<br />
I can go through my entire theory of how this is possible if anyone wants to read it. Time is a dimension. That means that one's perception of it can change if you look at it in a different way or the object you are looking at enters a different dimension.  Let?s take, for example, sight.  Seeing an object is actually seeing the electromagnetic waves (light) given off of that object in four dimensions of our universe.  In our universe, there are 11 dimensions.  The eleventh dimension is the one that allows alternate universes, but we do not need to talk about that now.  Let?s say we can make something go ?out of phase?.  
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">an example and the rest of the theory</span></span>
<br />

<br />
I?ll give you an idea of what this is like that is easy for the human mind to visualize.  Let?s say that he have a 3d object like a ball.  We poke it through a 2d plane (or a piece of paper for the sake of visualization).  That plane can only see two dimensions of that three dimensional object, but that does not mean that the extra dimension does not exist.  Now let?s say we move this ball through the plane, not in the x,y coordinates, but through the z coordinate (that means that we are making the ball poke through the 2d plane, or piece of paper.)  To the guys in that 2d universe, the ball will at first grow as it is being inserted, and it will shrink as it ends it?s journey through the plane.  
<br />

<br />
Time is a dimension in our universe.  Humans perceive only 4 of the 11 dimensions in our universe (x,y,z coordinates and time).  Let?s say we move time into a position in which it is ?out of phase? (moving into a dimension other than the 4 we perceive).  Then we do not perceive time at all.  Now let?s say that time is partly in it?s regular position and partly in this other dimension (like the ball in my previous example).  Time directly affects the x,y,z coordinates, but now it is partly in the other dimension (of the same universe).  Thus, energy can traverse this dimension, but we cannot see the gap because it is in another dimension.  It would be quite difficult to get through a hole whose location is unknown, or even impossible to reach with our limited choice of movement.  
<br />

<br />
For the sake of explaining in further detail, imagine you are in a giant sphere.  Now imagine that you are in the middle of this giant sphere.  Now try moving around while maintaining equal distance to all points in the sphere, impossible in a 4d environment (including time).  This is where a fifth dimensions comes in.  (possibly used in astral projection since one leaves the body, thus staying in one position, yet moves around and is able to perceive in 4d, but nobody else can see or hear you in that next dimension.  You have not left our universe.  You have merely changed what dimension you are in, without moving in the 4d.)  While in the state of astral projection, one is actually ?out of phase?.  At least, that is my theory.  Astral projection should also allow one to traverse time under this theory.  This is somewhat of a combination between astral projection and telekinesis (changing a small aspect in the micro universe so it becomes manifest in the macro universe.)  The microuniverse is yet another dimension in our 11 dimensional universe.  I could go on typing for hours explaining that, but for the sake of the readers (and my fingers), I won?t.

<br />

<br />
THE LONGER VERSION (FOR THOSE WHO ENJOY READING)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Well, I've been using psi for a while now, and I decided to try something different from the usual.  Most people who use psi can link to other people with psi, but what about other times?  Well, that's probably been done, but how about with yourself in the past?  Now, ya that may sound stupid at first, but let me explain.  
<br />

<br />
First of all, this would enable quantum thought, the ability to know all that you ever will know (infinite knowledge practically).  I did successfully link to myself in the past (5 years old), but it seems that my past self has the ability of quantum thought, not me, as in right now.  I thought this would be interesting since I have almost no memory of school when I was 5 years old, yet I was in kindergarten at the time).  I remember perfectly fine before and after that period of time at age 5... In fact my first legitimate memory was when I was 1 or 2 (before my brother was born).  
<br />

<br />
Well anyways, on with the main topic.  I've also noticed some other stuff.  My other self seems to have gotten links to myself in the future.  I can ask my 5 year old self what is going on with me in the future... and... This is going to sound crazy, but it appears that sometime soon, I'll figure out how to decrease my age, or, as he put it &quot;copy him, changing most my cells that did not exist before his time into energy, and increase my melatonin production&quot;.  I did some research on melatonin.  It's a hormone that is secreted by the pineal gland.  It eliminates free radicals and creates a slightly heightened need to sleep.  Now I find it a little odd to criticize myself, but wouldn't that be the equivalent of enough energy to blow up the entire solar system?!  (Possibly more than once).  I think he means energy as in psi, but still, that's a heck of a lot of psi!    <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />
I did try to do this once already.  I collapsed out of exhaustion after an estimate 7 seconds and stopped trying at that time.  I thought that was the possible result of low sugar/potassium levels.  After that I thought I should bide my psi for a while to build up energy for what he told me I was about to do.  I haven't used much psi for 4 days now... He told me i'd have to stand still for 8 hours to do the transformation... thing.  He explained to me that I was actually not using any psi in the process of talking to him.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, I asked myself some stuff about my near future, and it has come true (I asked him what I?m going to have for dinner tonight, and he said pizza, not the home made kind- actually he didn't actually say it, I just got the sudden feeling that we were going to have pizza-).  And, well, my mom ordered pizza.  I had no way of knowing what was going to be for dinner.  In fact, I wanted something other than pizza.  He didn't really tell me more than that, but that's enough to impress me at the very least- and just now he said won't tell me anything more than that.
<br />

<br />
Before this happened, random words would come to mind that I?d never heard before like &quot;Euclidian geometry&quot;.  I fell asleep once while doing a report and found that I had already somehow researched everything while I was sleeping, and wrote my entire report including citations, after waking.  I dreamed about writing my report.  Has anyone else had any these things happen to them?
<br />
  That creates the possibility of movement through time. It would be quite difficult for a physical object to move through time, but energy may be able to pass through time. To clear things up at this point, if one enters a different dimension, they are not going to another universe, otherwise known as an alternate reality. They would be changing the properties of themselves to fit a different dimension in our own universe, which means that we may perceive it in a different way relative to the normality.

No, I have not linked with psi in the past. I've tried remote viewing to the past with some success, but then I stopped because I decided that the present would help me more.

For the evidence, seriously just summarize it. No offense, but loooooong explanations on a forum bore me seriously. Explanations like these deserve articles. If you have a complaint about this, tell me.

Edit: Read it. Sounds interesting, like precog combined with subconscious dream advice. Last paragraph is confusing though.

			i dont get it, how does linking to your past self give him quantum thought? i'd think it'd just give him what you already know. 
<br />

<br />
on the poll, i've had words pop in my head before, i researched one of them 'Inari' and it turned out to be a god from another religion, which is kind of wierd.
<br />

<br />
and i havent tried any linking yet, i got into a subconsious one with a friend by accident, but i have not deleberately tried it, much less with myself.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
as for turning into a five year old, that's kinda creapy cause several weeks ago i had a dream about that happening to me. XD i'm not sure how you'll mannage that though, but please dont use me as a guinia pig <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> took me loong enough to reach 18.

			I believe what he ment was that (...um, this is what I thought..) since he linked with his 5 year old self in the present or past, he would also linked be linked with his 5 year old self in the future, so he would be able to talk to his younger self since he knew what his future selfs knew....this is confusing...I hope I made at least some sense.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps you could give a technique on how to do that, giving yourself quantum knowledge would help in a lot of ways, including your own life...

			Okay, i'll explain what quantum thought is.  What the past version of myself said is that he has also gotton links to myself in the future, which means he could ask questions to that future version of myself and thus know everything that happened between now and then.  I'm also curious about that because that implies that one talks through the 11th dimension (alternate realities) because there are an infinite number of possible futures.  This makes it possible for me to only be asked one question in my entire life, yet he will know everything that has happened (within reasonable bounds) from this point in time to wherever the link is broken.
<br />

<br />
And yes turning into a 5 year old is a creepy idea, but don't kill the messenger.  I'm just telling you what i've been told.  My guess is that there is a purpose for this that a future version of myself is interested in.  Possibly the effects of such a transformation, to test a theory, but I should be able to change back as quickly as I became this five year old me... or not.  He did say that my additional cells that will become non existant in the proccess will be turned into energy.  The only catch is it takes a tremendous amount of energy.  It may take all of the energy that will be produced, but I wouldn't bet on that.  Perhaps the reason is to bring this psi stuff out into the open.  Imagine what a person could do with enough energy to blow up the solar system a few times (no... i don't plan on blowing up the solar system a few times).  This would allow almost endless possibilities.  Take for example, a walky talky.  Those things only have somewhere around a 30 foot range.  Let's say that is my current amount of psi.  Now let's multiply that to enough power to talk to an astronaut on Pluto (or just fry everything in a 3,000 mile radius).  Perhaps it would allow perfect telepathy or incredibly strong telekinetics.  Who could possibly deny the existence of psi with that kind of evidence?  That's the main difference this transformation is going to/would make.
<br />

<br />
I normally don't post or talk about anything paranormal unless it's already been proven to be real.  In fact, I didn't tell anyone I was a psion until I could telekinetically move things.   (It's fun to see people's reactions hehe), but if i'm unanimous on the forums; so it doesn't really matter does it?  Psipog is the only place that you are going to find my story.  I haven't spoken about this, only typed about it.  I posted this in hopes that someone else has had a similar experience since the past 5 year old version of myself refuses to tell me some aspects of what is going on.  (It could make a big difference in the timeline and possibly throw me into an undesired alternate reality, which has inevitably happened already in an alternate reality that he is psi-linked to.).  But I am very pleased that nobody has really criticized me for what's going on here.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> Psi is the study of &quot;weird stuff&quot;, so I guess it is essential to keep an open mind when studying it.

			Err... I suppose this sounds interesting, and would be a fascinating experiment, but I advise that you stop. Now. It didn't dawn on me at first, but after reading through your whole explanation, I couldn't help but feel as if there was something else going on behind the scenes. I could be wrong, mind you, but after reading that your 'younger self' is talking of increasing more melatonin into your system I became a bit suspicious.

Can't you fit the pieces together? Higher need to sleep. Falling asleep and miraculously finishing your homework COMPLETELY without any recollection of it. And to top it off, random words coming to mind. Again, I could be wrong, but it looks like you're experiencing a case of schizophrenia, or a multiple personality disorder. I'd wait a few days before continuing, but then again, I'd advise that you cut this connection at once. It's better to be safe than sorry.

			To Seraven:
<br />

<br />
He said &quot;I fell asleep once while doing a report and found that I had already somehow researched everything while I was sleeping, and wrote my entire report including citations, after waking.&quot;
<br />

<br />
so he finished the report after waking up and remembered the full knowledge that was in the report, so he had recollection of it. I don't think it's schizophrenia.

			That's true, actually. I may have misread that point, but my point still stands. I'd be careful about this whole phenomena, and not just because it's quite possibly on uncharted territory. Still, if you choose to go through with it, I'd like to hear of your progress.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I am taking precaution to this.  This is one reason I posted it here.  I wanted to know if anyone else had this happen to them and the results of it.  Anyways, to clear that dream research thing up.  It was a dream of reasearching my paper and writing it.  I actually wrote the research paper after waking up.  Thankyou arcanus for posting that.  Well, if this is indeed uncharted territory, i will Definitely  post about the experience later on.  Unfortunately, I still do not have enough psi to accomplish my task and am still biding it.  (no telekinesis, telepathy, or anything else for a while for me).  I attempted the transformation earlier.  It was... partially successful.  There were some results.  I do not mean to sound like someone obsessed with their physical appearance, but what other way is there to describe the results?  Anyways, my face began to flake off like a cracking mask, and all of my cuts have dissapeared, along with a few minor scars, but no change in height or weight or anything big like that.  I do think that is an impressive result of a second attempt.  (Earlier, I said that I would have to stand still for 8 hours.  I achieved 1 hour of this counsiously and 7 hours while sleeping by programming my Subconscious to handel the proccess.  It's basically a very strong psi link, a programmed construct managed and commanded by two users.)  Another interesting, but predicted phenomena of this link is that time seems to pass at a different rate for the past version of myself.  Time sometimes slips by or slows down on the past me's side and just seems to synchronize while conversing.  For example, he and I did a little experiment.  I talked to him and checked in again after one hour and only twenty minutes had passed on his end.  I talked to him a few minutes later, and a whole day had passed on his end.  This effect seems to occur according the will of the speaker or the person spoken to.  For example, if he is busy for some reason (sleep), then instead of waiting 10 hours, I can talk to him as soon as I want when he wakes up, or any time for that matter with little or no passing of the time that I myself experience.

			Hmm..... very interesting. I agree with taking lots of precautions if you do continiue witht the experiment, and would like to hear the results. And excatly HOW did you make a link with your past self? sorry if it takes a lot of typing lol but im curious  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Of course i'll share the information on how I got to this point.  First of all, you need to understand that time is a dimension which means that it will change depending on how you look at it.  Now, what I did is somewhat the same thing as what I do when, for some reason, I can't move the psi wheel.  I imagine that me and my objective (in that case the psi wheel, but in this case just me).  I just pretended for that time that nothing existed except for myself and the concept that time changes depending on how you look at it.  I think that describes somewhat of a meditative state.  
<br />

Anyways, I was just contemplating how psi worked, what it was and all of that stuff.  I found that electromagnetic waves or a product of electromagnetic waves is the most likely what psi is.  There have been many cases where a person is able to move things with his mind, often with little ability to control, but this is expected from an untrained person, when surounded by high voltage, EMP generators (electromagnetic pulse generators) or living in a house where the natural electromagnetic waves are very strong.  Also paranormal stuff seems to happen in areas where the electromagnetic field is abnormally strong.  Anyways, I came to that conclusion, which explains a lot about psi and it's workings.  After that, I questioned if this energy could travel through time.  
<br />

<br />
There was a particularly odd gap where I could barely remember part of when I was 5 years old.  At first, I thought of nothing, just blackness.  Then, I visualized my destination in time, just some time when I was 5, and I visualized the location, my kindergarten classroom.  I could see myself there, paying attention to what the teacher said.  The classroom and everything suddenly seemed to dissappear and I could once again see nothing.  Then a small light came on.  I was there, but nothing else under a light.  I could see my aura perfectly well at the moment, or at least as well as I know what aura looks like.  It was white and seemed like a cloud of dust, constantly in motion.  I rose in this aura up off the floor, or the floor dissappeared.  Either way I was suspended in the air, or the nothingness for that matter, and the aura suddenly flashed very brightly, and my mind snapped back to my current time and place, but I felt something different, like someone was watching, but not a stranger, a friend.  Nothing really happened for the rest of that day.  
<br />

<br />
When I went to bed, I once again, this time in a dream, found myself in the situation I had before.  It was in third person, but I felt it as if it was a first person experience.  I was floating, suspended in nothingness surounded by glowing white psi, which looked more like smoke than any electromagnetic waves that I've ever imagined.  Also, this aura seemed to eminate from everywhere within, not just the point located in the stomach that is used to create psi balls.  The aura just pulsated once in a great while.  The next day, I found myself with this dream embedded in my mind.  Only, now the aura pulsated more frequently,  It began to flash every 2 hours or so, then pulsating more often as time went by until eventually it began to pulsate every minute or less.  During this time, I also felt more and more connected to this other self, and I began to see this white aura around floating around myself, pulsating in sync with the one in my mind.  There was a final pulsation of the aura both in sync and both rather bright at this point, and the visualization dissappeared.  Then, I heard a voice say &quot;hi&quot;.  I recognized it as my own and sensed that it was my own thought, but it felt like a part of me, not like an arm or leg but as a subconscious is a part of someone, but it was unlike a subconscious in the fact that it was talking, and I could sense what he was thinking to a certain extent.  He must have thought more than I could sense because he would unexpectedly ask a question with much more information than I heard him think about before, and some things would come as a feeling, an emotion, or picture instead of a word.  I could not feel a single negative emotion (to tell you the truth, I was more moral back then than I am now).  Well, after that I said something... I cannot quite remember what I said.  I was kinda surprised that this had happened, and didn't really know what to say.  Furthermore, it was odd because he had said the first thing instead of me.  This probably meant that he had known about the connection and was waiting to say something, but anyways, what I said is irrelivent.  From that point on, I could feel a connection, like a regular tubule link from one person to another, but it was visualized as just ending a few feet from me by fading away, and I visualized the other me at the other end with the same connection.  Anyways, I've described my experience in connecting across time with myself.  Later on, when I tried to initiate the proccess of... decreasing age, I just strengthened the connection and visualized myself changing.  The other me corrected me on this and told me that that was not how it was going to be done.  The most recent attempt resulted in what I described in my previous post.^  I'll be sure to post anything new that might happen.
