			may the title be misleading, this topic does not involve cuts, wounds, or any form of bleeding.
<br />

<br />

i first learnt about psi when i was practicing shiatsu with my cousin. the tecnique we found in a book explains that increased blood flow can create a psiball. specificly the technique called for rubbing and vigourous shaking of the hands and forearms, which we did. to our amazement, we created or felt psi and a lot of it. we could feel each other from across the room.
<br />

<br />
my hypothesis for this is twofold.
<br />

<br />
one: increased blood flow helps with the generation of psi and - or releases it into the enviroment.
<br />

<br />
two: increased blood flow increases sensitivity to psi and allows us to precieve it more clearly.
<br />

<br />
i am not a sceptic nor am i a non-believer. i practice psi regularliy and attempt many different types of techniques. if for some reason, i cannot generate enough psi to work with, i will increase my blood flow to &quot;cheat&quot; per se. it has worked well as a last ditch effort. however, this method does not require as much concentration as the rest and should be used as a &quot;fire starter&quot; if you cannotget any results after a long period of time. 
<br />

<br />
i am still waiting for an answer on what increased blood flow does to and with psi. any feedback is welcome.

			Or you could just be tricking your nerves into feeling something. That's one of the problems with techniques involving rubbing your hands together. When you're first starting out, you can't tell if it's psi, or just your hands' nerves.

			When I started psi, I would rub my hands together, and then if I didnt give my hands somthing to feel, they would stay all &quot;static&quot; and such. Anyways, I could make them feel what I wanted because there wasnt really a main feeling, so they would exept what I gave. At best I had to call this biofeedback though, becauseit is a trick of the nerves.

			hmmm.... seems like this isnt the best way to go... intrestingly enough this was in a shiatsu guidebook. meh. gotta start some way or another.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
EDIT:
<br />

<br />
i recently attempted this again but instead released a lot of psi with no coherent form or shape. plus, i couldn't control it. i just felt it. because i can create psiballs with some efficency and am working on my shields, this psi i gave off seemed almost identical to the psi used for creating shields or psiballs... but that is hard to verify. i really don't know but for now i will keep this technique under judgement till i can find some hard evidence that this is right or wrong. no disrespect to anyone who disagrees with me, but i am just curious. no harm done.

			I heard of Qi/Ki/Chi being related to blood.
<br />
I watched this documentary where a man said:
<br />
&quot;Where attention goes, so does Qi and blood&quot;,
<br />
or something like that
<br />
Here is one link:<a href="http://www.damo-qigong.net/qi-theory1.htm" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.damo-qigong.net/qi-theory1.htm</a>

			yo here's another way too try it, you know when you slow down your breathing, your bloodflow will also slow...
<br />

<br />
TRY SPEEDIN IT UP BABEH!
<br />
no rubbing, just dont hyperventilate ok or peebs will have my ass!
<br />

<br />
oh yeah and dont do any of them power up thingys when your blood speed is increased, its weird and not nice.

			and have a stroke.

fortunately, speeding up our breathing does not affect our heart rate too much. exersise does however.
