I would love to fight with you! I have been practicing with by sword every night for 3 or so weeks and have been getting better! I am also lifting some weights to wield it with more ease. 98lbs? Try 184lbs man!

			Cheese, guys! I do not study any specific style or anything but I would like to go and take lessons somewhere. You guys sound really good and it would be nice to be taught by one of you. Yeah, before I go to bed, I do some situps, push ups, sword swings, and some weight lifting. I don't really have good and real swords though (replicas)...where did you guys get your swords? And if you don't use real ones in practice they are heavier than you think.

I'm so good at techniques, that I don't even use a sword. I use a huge spoon, for I need not a sword.

It's highly physically impossible for both the wielder and the person who gets hit. I could show you how it works, but I'd have to be in person.

I also have an exploding flamethrower, but you don't want me to get into that subject.

It's actually quite simple, really - it's like a flamethrower, except it has longer range, and when the flames come within contact with ANYTHING, they explode.
<br />

<br />
Best not to use it in short-range circumstances.
<br />

<br />
Yeah, I said long-range flamethrower.
