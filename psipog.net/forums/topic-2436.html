			Can you alter your DNA and reprogram it, slowly?
<br />
Become superhuman?
<br />

<br />
This is a serious question.
<br />
Moving a ball or a sheet of paper is all well and good, but restructuring genetic code? It would be a form of genetic SAI... If ever, EVER done...

			Well lets clear up some misconceptions first though, then onto this DNA question. This has more to do with Bio-PK or DMILS then it does with constructs, since there is no Bio-PK area this should of probably went into the general talk.
<br />

<br />
Onto the matter, speculation says advanced users in DMILS can alter their own DNA, do note however this is not an task done easily, verified easily, or to be undertaken lightly.
<br />

<br />
Also to become 'superhuman' you would have to know the DNA genetic code of that to recreate it, also extremely high amounts of knowledge in human anatomy, chemistry, and overall extensive knowledge about genetics and DNA. I wouldnt suggest undertaking this in the least bit, that is of course if speculation is correct. Imagine what would happen if you mess up? Imagine that, its not something easily reverted, hell not even modern science could revert you, its a path that once you try you can't go back. All in all i'd say dont try it, even if they did discover some super human genetic code.

Would you? Peebrain have said that you shouldn't take DMILS to literally in your process, maybe you don't need all these fancy knowledge, just be more encouraged in your body to increase it's processes.
<br />

<br />
Not saying, this should be encouraged since there is a slight possibility of it going wrong.
<br />

<br />
If you want super human powers, then, It'll never happen, do what most people do, go to the GYM and read some books.

The human body is not stupid.
<br />

<br />
Example:
<br />
Immune system remembers pathogens and you gain a resistence to the pathogen after exposure.
<br />

<br />
And strengthening the genes could be this simple:
<br />
Touching a strong animal, or being near one--every day. Probably at a farm, focus on connection, and trying to learn from the animal. Try to absorb understanding about bio functions, etc.
<br />

<br />
Wouldn't the body remember this in the same way as it remembers the pathogen, and afterword--apply the knowledge to slightly improve itself?
<br />

<br />
&gt;
<br />

<br />
DNA Education argument @ wolf dude:
<br />
Does a person need to understand physics perfectly before they can use telekenesis? Does a person need to know all about neurology before they can think? Or are there forms of understanding that are not words and can never be spoken? I don't think that education about DNA is needed or possible for psionic bio enhancement. Would you be willing to sit for months reading a huge sequence of genetic code? Would it be any conscious use? Could each digit be remembered? I don't think so.

			Well knowledge can only help, though in some respects your correct, we dont need to know how telekinesis works in order to use it, but if we have a better understanding of its process and how it works we can do it better and more efficiently, this was explained in NI's manual. Now then with DNA, you can try to change it off pure speculation, but this is your DNA you master code for your body, are you really going to run into a situation like that blind? With the knowledge you can atleast have a better understanding and more percise tries with what your doing not just thinking &quot;I want to do XXXX&quot; over and over.
<br />

<br />
Also if you mess up you have a better chance of fixing yourself, still small, but better. Remember your screwing around with something that is your very bodily essense, this isnt moving a psiwheel, heating a match, this is you and there will be consequences and risks, even higher if you walk into the situation ignorent of knowledge about the workings on DNA.
<br />

<br />
Do you need the knowledge to actually do it? No you dont. Do you need it to have higher success, efficiency, and overall prepared? Yes you do. Honestly I wouldnt go trying to alter my DNA with minimal knowledge on it, also without much experience in Bio-PK. This is a warning to you really, but if you don't wish to heed it, well it's not my body.

			Hey, i'm new to the forum but not to psi pog.
<br />
i'd just like to add that i've dabbled in biokinesis and done a few things. nothing to be superhuman but for a few months i changed my eye color from brown, to green, then to a bright yellow. after about a few months after that they changed back but one of my eyes is now darker and a tint of pupley brown. opps my mistake <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> but it's fun as long as u don't mind looking a little odd sometimes. the changing phase is awkward.

			i heard that the human body has automatic understanding about healing itself, and that too much knowledge about what your trying to do would be a bad thing. I think your saying you will have to program every detail, when in reality you dont. Your body knows what to do.

			Okay, in reality I think that trying to change ones own DNA would be a *very* stupid idea.  Especially slowly over time.  After all, if its even possible to do so with bio stuff, every cell contains its own copy fo the DNA, and continually replicates itself to make a copy of it.  If it were to replicate before the process was complete, you'd have a mutation on your hands.  Or, if you just plain screwed it up, you could very well end up with a little genetic mutation such as oh I don't know, cancer?  
<br />

<br />
Plus, increasing strength or something like that wouldn't be as simple as cahnging your DNA.  It would require a long, and likely very painful experience of your entire musculoskelatal  (spelling?) system restructuring itself to adapt with the changes.
<br />

<br />
Of course the body isn't stupid, but trust me messing with DNA is not soemthing that the body can fix.  Once again, cancer.  It wouldn't be a problem if the body could simply fix the error.  And being around an animal or touching it, attempting to feel out the workings of its biological systems would not helpa t all.  AFter all, if you think about it, animals have a different numebr of chromosomal pairs than we do (thats why humans can't have kids with animals) and why most species similar in genetic structure still don't mix (think donkey+horse= mule which also = sterile)  In addition to that basic, yet important difference, is the fact that most animals muscular and skeletal systems as well as immune systems work very differently from out own.  Lets say you ould learn how it worked by touching it.  It wouldn't matter because your body is ill-equipped ot mimic it.
<br />

<br />
Interesting to think about, but trying is a completely different matter.

			Teekay, I guess you don't do much DMILS then.
<br />

<br />
since most of the healing involves a form of change in the DNA.
<br />

<br />
Not saying that there aren't healing effects taht doesn't change the DNA, just most probably will.
<br />

<br />
Also, Teekay, if you can change it, you can effect another change, which can cancel out a mistake, but of course, that just theory.

			Define &quot;superhuman&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Can you use DMILS to improve your vision?  Yes.  Can you use it to increase muscle mass?  Yes.
<br />

<br />
Anything you can do to your body by &quot;normal&quot; means can be accomplished via DMILS (in my opinion).  Through lifting weights, you are sending commands to your body to get stronger.  You can still send those same commands without lifting weights.  Please note though, I have never seen or heard of DMILS being <span style="font-style: italic">more effective</span> than normal workouts though.
<br />

<br />
I mean, put yourself in your body's shoes.  It's not in your body's best interest to listen to the conscious mind... it normally thinks stupid things, and is never really sure about what it wants.  It constantly changes it's mind on a whim.  What would convince your body that your conscious mind means serious business?  Well, you could physically FORCE your body to get bigger/better.  I.e., consciously demand more physically by lifting weights, or running.  That sends a pretty direct message to your body - in a message format that the body immediately understands.  Or you can try to use DMILS... but the body won't take the messages seriously unless you are really serious about the messages.
<br />

<br />
How do you send serious messages to your body?  You can visualize yourself lifting weights.  Take 30 minutes a day and visualize yourself lifting weights... it will send a message to your body.  Visualize for 30 minutes your muscles getting bigger and stronger.  That also sends a solid message.  Will that be as effective as physically exercising?  Not likely.  But it can produce results if you get your body on the same team as you.
<br />

<br />
After you get used to communicating with your body, you can have dialogs (of a sort).  If you notice in my Out of Body Experiences article ( <a href="../show.php@id=10168.html" target="_blank">art-outline-to-shielding.html168</a> ), I write an example dialog between myself and my body, where I tell each body part to go to sleep.  If you've built up that communication bridge, it works.  If you trust your body, and your body trusts you, then it works.
<br />

<br />
One way I keep the trust between my conscious mind and my body is through only feeding my body healthy food.  I'm not perfect, and I eat cheeseburgers sometimes, but at the same time, I try to listen to what my body would like, so we can help each other out.  I know that caffiene is bad for my body, so I don't drink it.  I know that excessive sleep is bad for my body, so I try hard not to sleep too much (I used to be real bad about this in the past).  Etc.
<br />

<br />
I look out for my body... my body looks out for me.  When my body needs something, it can send me messages, and I'll listen.  When I need something, I send my body messages, and it'll listen.  If you want to just boss your body around without giving anything in return, then you'll get all the nasty sideeffects that a dominant relationship brings.  If you want to work as a team, and help each other out, then you'll get all the benefits of a meaningful relationship.

That is a load of crap.  There is the short term memory lobe (i think front right of the brain), long term memory (somewhere else), the part of the brain that one uses for art etc, and the other for math etc.  It is spread evenly around the brain.  Scientists know that by expierementing with the brain's electric signals.

			Yeah, thats how they tested some telepathy skills to. When doing telepathy they noticed an influx of electropulses to the front lobe of the brain, which explains why we feel that pressure in our foreheads or &quot;3rd eye&quot; region.
