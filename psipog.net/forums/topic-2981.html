			Yea i've noticed that too, sitting seems to do better for some reason, standing up and laying down doesn't do jack squat for me. Oh well, could be the fact sitting up, subconcious way of grounding yourself without realizing it.

			Maybe it has to do with the energy flowing throughout your body... (just a theory)  and when your spine isn't straight the energy that powers PK doesn't work right...

			Special, exactly.
<br />

<br />
Whether you believe in the chakras or not, the path energy takes through the body is straight down the spine.
<br />

<br />
Imagine a straight river, no obstacles, curves or otherwise.  The water would be able to move smoothly, quickly and evenly down the river.  If the river were curved, the water would not be able to travel as fast.  This isn't a great illustration, but it stands.
<br />

<br />
Energy flows much better with our head pointed skyward and our spines straight.  I'm sure you've all seen the standard monk meditation posture... there's a reason they sit like that, guys  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Personally I do just fine standing up.  When trying to keep a straight back sitting down I seem to do worse.  It is probably because my back starts to hurt a little and I am concentrating on keeping my back straight.  I usually stand when I pk, so it is probably why it works better for me.  It is just what I am used to.

			it may also have to do with focus (as pointed out earlier).  when laying down you get comfortable, and may lose focus on pk, even if you don't notice losing focus.  when you sit up you aren't as comfortable which makes you focus more, maybe why it is easier to accomplish pk while sitting up...i dunno, just a guess.
