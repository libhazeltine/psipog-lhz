			Hey, I'm only 13 and I find meditating exceedingly difficult. 
<br />

<br />
I was just wondering what the younger psions do (ie. under 16 yrs),
<br />
and what the older psions think.

			I'm 15 next mnonth and I think that it really depends on what the person thinks they need to do. If your a natural at stuff, then you might not need to meditate. I, myself, do meditate whenever I have the oppurtunity. btw, this really belongs in the &quot;meditation and trance&quot; forum.

			uurh.. Of course it depends on the individual, that's a given.
<br />

<br />
I think most psions below the age of 16 don't meditate at a regular basis, but have tried it. Same goes for most psions above 16.

			I don't understand how you have great difficulty meditating.
<br />
It very well should be simple.
<br />

<br />
Sit there. Close your eyes. Breathe.
<br />
For beginners, you may not think it's working because at first you really only see how busy your mind actually is.
<br />
After a few weeks or months of practice, your mind starts becoming quieter, more focused.
<br />
Just stay relaxed, breathe. If a thought comes up, just acknowledge that it's a thought, and continue to breathe. Let go. Allow your mind to slow itself. In time, your thoughts will become much more controlled.
<br />
This benefits in so many ways.
<br />
I hope this helps, I really suck at explaining things.

Best is to lay down but you can sit too if you want, just basically get into a comfortable position. Close your eyes. At this point don't just count but picture the numbers as they come up, it takes some practice but you should be able to visualize strong enough to sorta even see them (you know how even when you're not dreaming vague images can sometimes come up when you close your eyes, same idea except you're making them). This is hard, but that's the point, you'll find the effort of doing that reduces the chances of your mind thinking of much else. I usually count up to 30 but maybe you might want to go up as high as 60 or 90. After that you should be pretty focused, you can either keep counting or stop and just try to hold the feeling you have to maintain the meditation.

			I enjoy meditating... *shrugs*
<br />

<br />
I know when you first do it, it's really a pain in the ass (sometimes literally, if you're sitting still for a while!).  Now I meditate almost every night.  I find it really relaxing, and it helps me to just calm down and stop thinking about worldly problems for a little while.  Plus meditation is nearly required for OBEs.
<br />

<br />
Do people HAVE TO meditate?  No.  If it doesn't interest you, then don't bother.  However, there are different ways to meditate - not just the sitting still and think of nothing method.
<br />

<br />
One method I use a lot is walking meditation.  Basically: go outside, go for a walk, and relax.  Enjoy your time.  Or active meditation, where instead of thinking of nothing, you are intent on thinking about one subject as deeply as you can.  For example, if you got mad earlier that day because someone told you to piss off, then you can meditate on it by just sitting around and saying, &quot;Why did that make me angry?&quot;.  Come up with as many answers as you can, and ask &quot;Why?&quot; for each answer.  Get as deep as you can to understanding it.
<br />

			Thanks, Peebrain  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
My problem is that I think a lot, so it's hard for me to empty my head, so those methods you mentioned should come in handy  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
I mean, sometimes, I find it difficult just keeping my eyes closed!!!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Also, I'm just a beginner in psychics (I have no 'natural' talent), so I was probably making my presumtions too quickly  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />
I still haven't managed to have any effect on the psiwheel yet though  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Thanks again.

			Pay attention to what Peebrain said, because I agree <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
And I want to add; Performing psychic phenomena itself, is a form of meditation. Meditation doesn't have to be difficult or complicated like sitting in a difficult posture all the time thinking of nothing and keeping your tongue up against the upper part in your mouth as far back as possible, chanting difficult mantra's etc etc. There are different methods for different purposes. But meditation itself, happens to everyone everyday. Especially when you are doing telekinesis, telepathy or anything of that nature, because you are focussing and zoning in, so to say, on the realm of possibilities within.

			Im 30 and have been working with psyonics since i was 13.
<br />
mainly the abilities of aura reading,remote viewing,empathy,telepathy.
<br />
without meditation i don't believe that a person can become sensitive
<br />
enough to constantly use these kinds of abilities,atlest from my own
<br />
experiences i find this to be true.
