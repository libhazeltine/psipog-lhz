			Hey guys! A weird thing happened to me just a little while ago. Ill try to explain it as detailed as I can...
<br />

<br />
Alright, you know when you are in that really weird half-asleap state of mind, and you are in the real world, but you can pick up an object that doesnt even exist there? Anyways, one morning I woke up like this and there was a yellow, lined pad of paper on my bed (NOTE: the pad of paper was not actually there in reality at the time, but I didnt know this). On the pad of paper was written in big letters:
<br />

<br />
(my name),
<br />
I went to the office. Be right back.
<br />
--Dad.
<br />

<br />
So then I read this and fell asleap again.
<br />

<br />
then I actually did wake up, and I slept in because I thought my dad wasn't in the house and that he was at his office. Then I started to realize that may have never actually happened. I got up and looked for the pad of paper but could not find it. Then I put a robe on, and went to the kitechen to get breakfast.
<br />

<br />
My dad was in the kitchen, eating breakfast. While I was eating my breakfast, he finished his and said that he had to go to the repair shop to get some parts to fix the mule (NOTE: &quot;Mule&quot; is a small mechanical car like thing) and that he would be back soon.
<br />

<br />
Now here's the weird part: the repair shop to fix the mule was very close to where my dad's office was. The same block, actually. 2 buildings over. For all I know, he could have gone to the repair shop and stopped by his office if he wanted to.
<br />

<br />
Soooo do you think that was a psychic message or a coincidence? Please reply!

			Did you ask him if he went to his office? I mean, it's not really a weird question, and would definetly help verify what you experienced.

<br />
Maybe it was a just a dream? Precognition maybe? Or yeah... Maybe just a dream? <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			well I thought someone would ask this. And I cannot verify, because I wrote about this about a week after it happened, and now it is a month after it happened. so i doubt he could remember. But I literally wrote this down on a peice of paper so i could remember
