You have to understand how power works. For example lets take thie hierachy of this forum for example. We are all relatively low level telepaths. Because of the 80/20 rule, only 20 percent of us is really gonna take this seriously and even a lower percentage of that is gonna reach a certain level of height. 
<br />

<br />
But once that level is reached one no longer needs to reside at this site. 
<br />

<br />
So either three things happen. 
<br />

<br />
They leave this site for good and go out and use thier powers to do as they please. 
<br />
Leave this site caues it cna no longer teach them anything and do independent study. 
<br />
Or they stick around to teach us all (peebrian, JoeT, annie). 
<br />

<br />
That's because this community is not set up for super high level psychics. Because setting a community like that is hard cause the numbers are so low. 
<br />

<br />
In such a way, this site maintains balance. 
<br />

<br />
The same thing with lucid dreaming. I know for a fact htat i stop going to dreamviews.com once lucid dreams become habitual. 
<br />

<br />
These high level people know that guidance is unneccessary because those who deserve the power shall attain it. That's how the system works.

Ya actually those are good points. I didn't think of advanced psions that way. It makes sense to me. 
<br />
I think that if I was a really advanced psion I would only want to teach those that I would deem (sp) ready and worthy to learn psionics, so this goes along with the question I asked earlier 'why wouldn't they just tell us what psi is then?' 
<br />

<br />
I think in the end your conscious mind learns what it is ready to learn and I don't think a lot of people (including myself) are ready to learn the true secrets of psi.

			Same reason I don't know reveal some secrets to lucid dreamers that I don't even see in the books. Me and the authors understand. 
<br />

<br />
When it comes to some truths
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">YOU DON'T DESERVE THEM UNLESS YOU CAN FIND THEM YOURSELF</span>
<br />

<br />
Because finding them yourself means that you went through the prerequisit journey. Meaning that the losers who didn't deserve it were naturally weeded out throughout that journey.
<br />

<br />
They're are some people in this world so powerful they can heal any disease with a mere touch. Then the age old question is:
<br />

<br />
Why don't those people come out and heal the world?
<br />

<br />
It took me a year to realize that people like this existed and even longer to realize why they did what they did.
<br />

<br />
I had to evolve as a person to understand the truths behind such a statement. This is hte type of question that I wouldn't answer asked me cause they gotta find an answer for themselves.
<br />

<br />

<br />
When I become a powerful psion (i dont even consider the level i am on powerful) because of the way I am I'll write guides and teach a few. But sooner or later my mind would be drawn to other things and i'd move on.

			True. What's the point of giving someone the answers to a test? They don't learn the subject matter and aren't shown the process in which to teach themselves. What is more important is the journey rather than the end result.
