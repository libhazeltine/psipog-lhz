If you're able to move the whole weight of the object up, then yes. If every other motion is possible (spinning, sliding, etc.), then why not levitation too?

This is my opinion of course, but I believe that if you don't believe in Psionics it would put a mental &quot;barrier&quot; on your abilities. I just don't see how it could work if you're constantly thinking to yourself &quot;this isn't going to work, this isn't possible, why am I even trying.&quot;

The reason is that it worked for me.  Now I had a willingness to actually practice for 3 weeks straight until I saw results, but a belief that it would work was not what I had.  At best I had a &quot;maybe.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Also just to note, if you don't think your muscles will grow but you lift weights in a correct interval and you eat right they most certianly will.  The basic point I will like to make is that your subconscious doesn't really care what the conscious part of you thinks much.  Most people think of a lot of random and retarded crap all day.  Which should it listen to?  Anyway everyone has the ability, but only practice actually helps to convince the subconscious to let your conscious mind use that ability.
<br />

<br />
One other thing I would like to mention is...try doing a test for yourself.  Believe that you can move your car while it is in neutral, and then go try it.  How much did belief help you there?  Then try moving it by practicing for months, and see how well you have progressed with smaller objects.  Also check out my post in the Personal Techniques forum.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Also if you would like to prove to me that your statement is correct you need to provide proof that belief alone CHANGES your ability in telekinesis in some way.  I may admit that it may change it in some way, but I don't know that way, and from my experience it is not true.  At least when you start out a belief is not nessecary and when you finally move it to where you convince yourself that you are indeed moving it, then you have the belief automatically.

			It's easy to argue for both. If you don't believe, then your thoughts are much more self defeating and therefore you may make very little progress. If you just sat there and thought that every movement the psiwheel made was the wind, then you would probably give up and in that way it would have an effect. Other people might practice with a glass and still say it was something else, maybe the moisture in the air causing static electricity making it move, and give up. At the same time, another skeptic may be settled by the glass and continue practice.

I heavily agree with this, and not just with tk, with any mystic art.
<br />
If you can't believe you can do it, then you literally cannot. It's not just a mental barrier, it simply won't happen even if the barrier is not there.
