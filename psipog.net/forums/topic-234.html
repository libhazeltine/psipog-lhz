			The intent here is to get everyone to post on some neat, cool, or useful thing that they have done with a construct.
<br />

<br />
In previous posts:
<br />
Doorbell construct - construct with a set location that pings you if it detects another person
<br />

<br />
other ideas:
<br />
construct to move heat to the outsides of it's shell
<br />
construct to leave a note on (programmed to store a short telepathic message)
<br />
construct to keep shelled energy (throw energy at it before you go to sleep, and have extra energy for a morning practice)
<br />
for those that are good at detecting energy, putting a construct in a location (car, keys) then scanning for your own energy to find where the object in question is.

			For people who have family or friends who are those people who broadcast negative emotions and such, an inverted shield to keep the broadcast in.

I use it on my dad, works wonders.

<br />
Note: make sure it depatternizes the energy as it escapes, or that it depatternizes and absorbs the energy.

			Awareness Construct:
<br />

<br />
Disperse &quot;energy&quot; very thin around you so that you're aware of anything in your &quot;personal space&quot;
<br />

<br />
Energy accumulating Construct:
<br />

<br />
Design a construct to take ambient &quot;energy&quot; from the surrounding enviroment, and store it in you for later use.
<br />

<br />
(On this one, make sure you include something about not sucking energy from other humans, or anyhting that you wouildn't want to hurt.)

			A construct I have found useful in all endevours to teach is a construct filled with information. Affectively it's a psi-zip-file. 
<br />

<br />
instructions:
<br />
Basicly one creates a deacent density Psi-ball and places information into the psi-ball like programming a how-to article into the thing, It's best if your good at programming and the thing you're zipping into the ball. Be sure to tell it to &quot;run&quot; the program once activated by the recipiant, or it's just a ball of subjective, and quite uselss, information.
<br />

<br />
An example is to think of a cloaking shield, once you have the psi-ball ready, and how it works and is made. Then stuff that information into the psi-ball as best you can, this takes some skill, and then send it to the recipiant. the recipiant then pulls the construct into themselves and let the program &quot;run&quot; if done properly you could make nearly anything with this method, from a simple bubble shield to a highly advanced shield such as a chaos shield.
<br />

<br />
This is ideal to protect those of lesser skill, such as children or the newlbies in your life, whom are sensitve enough to run the program and to be harmed by one seeking to harm them. I've experimented with these a fair deal and don't think that someone should do these unless their atleast intermediate at programing or very skilled in what they're sending.

			well Here's an idea me and Vladimir came up with, it can be useful, but above all else its fun. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Critter Construct:
<br />

<br />
Make you own little construct creatures! For example, I've made a little monkey thing that sort of dangles on my shoulder and bites me, then I got Vladimir to scan it. It was fun, and we were thinking about making more creatures that are more advanced, but it was a fun and cool idea, and lets you be really creative. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> You could make creatures that look like whatever you want, and that do whatever you want. I eventually killed mine because it was hurting my neck lol.

			Yeah, it's fun because you can play god and like, make little construct thunderstorms and flood, and then some of the constructs will break away and form a cult worshipping some other deity other than me.

That would be fun =P

			On the topic of that awareness construct: Ocasionally when I'm playing games (unreal tournament especially) I try a variation of that to &quot;put my mind in the game&quot; so to speak. I have very little idea whether it works or not, at this point I've usually been concentrating so much on the contruct that someone has come along and shot me in the nose with a bolt of plasma, then I utter an expletive and forget all about my construct as I come after them with a flak cannon.

			I'm going to have to keep the four dogs quiet soon, when mum and dad get a bar, and I'm at home keeping the neighbors satisfied with the noise level.

So I thought about making a construct to deal with that for me, to ping the dogs if they bark.

			I'm still new to this, but I would like to experiment with densities and figure out if a psiball can refract/diffract/reflect light and hence become visible without the usual flaring etc.

Note the newbie's obsession with SEEING it, in our defence, our other senses are still blunted by well, living in the modern world.

create a construct to keep track of your animals. i can never find my cats unless i pin a homing beacon on them. only worked once for me...<img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
