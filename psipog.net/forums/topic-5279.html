			Hey everyone
<br />

<br />
In the last week or so I have noticed that I have become better at Precognition..
<br />

<br />
An example was at my bro's birthday on Sunday. My dad was sitting around playing guitar and his girlfriend wanted him to play a song but she couldn't remember the name of it, and I was thinking in my head the name of the song and 2 seconds later she said it.
<br />

<br />
At my job a few days later a waitress broke a plate across the restaraunt, and i was thinking.. &quot;Now watch, she is gonna tell me to come clean it up&quot;  She walks toward me and a few other people who were just standing around..walks by me about 6 feet and turns around and asks me to clean up the busted plate..
<br />

<br />
Then just last night I was talking to a girl ive known onilne for a while..and asked her to think of a time that makes her happy..I came close to what she was actually thinking..But one time i came right on.. I told her to think of a color, anything but pink...which was the color she was thinking of..So she chose a new color, and I said Blue..Which was the color she was thinking of...And then she said she had another color in thought..And i said....I sense Orange...and she said yes...
<br />

<br />
The thing is, im understand with Precognition is that with like the simple things like having someone choose a color..when you ask them to, I already have a color inside my mind that I try to push my energy into the person's mind so they think that color...
<br />

<br />
Anywho what you all think?

I think that you don't know the definition of precog.

			The last one with the colors doesn't sound much like precog. Sounds more like telepathic influence (Did I spell that right?) Try the same stuff but further in advance like imagine asking her the color and then her responding with the the color. Then actually asking her. It sounds harder but once you do that you will no thats precog if she says the same colors you imagined her saying.

None of the 3 cases sound like Precognition to me.
<br />

<br />
In Depth:
<br />

<br />
1st Case: That happens to me all the time, it just take a little working out and remembering things you've forgotten, do take a while to remember. Like if i'm trying to remember the name of a song, i'll beat around the bush with words that sound like the song name, then remember the song name instantly.
<br />

<br />
2nd Case: If you're a waiter (or whatever you do), and you're there, of course they're going to ask you to clear it up, i know because i work as a kitchen porter. If a waitress breaks something at the golf club cafe, and i happen to be walking past, she'll automatically tell me to clear it up. No big woop here.
<br />

<br />
3rd Case: This could be Telepathy, but if you only got one colour out of a few correct, it really doesn't sound like anything special is going on. Me and Tachikoma were doing some Telepathy practice a day or two ago, and he got around 90% of the shapes and colours correctly. It was actually quite astonishing.
<br />

<br />
DjWolf,
<br />

<br />
Maybe you should do a test, like....You have to get a minimum of consequtive correct answers to class it as some amazing abilities. But even if there was something 'magical' going on, it just really doesn't sound like Precognition to me.
<br />
Im not trying to burst your bubble, but as ive said a couple of times already....I think theres nothing going on.
<br />

<br />
These are only mere suggestions, my words are my own opinions. If you don't agree with them, then tough shit.

HAHA! ya they dont sound like precog to me. I don't even try to precog but I get these random few days to a week where it's kinda of scary then it dissapears for like 4-6 months. These aren't something you can guess either but I dont feel like going into detail. Trust me you'll no for a fact when you have a good precog that can't be explained.
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure what this is: When I was little I noticed I was getting really lucky at winning stuff (I don't think this has to do with precog but it was during the same days I was doing precog real well when I was little before I even knew what it was). An example would be those stuffed animals in those machines with &quot;the claw.&quot; Anyways I only got lucky and winning all the time when I believed I could. And good stuff was happening to me that I had no control over or even suggested when I was little. But if I had a negative attitude or didn't think I had good luck I wouldn't. It even affected friends. They called me thier lucky charm sometimes because I had a postive attitude when they tried to get those stuffed animals and I never told them what I did either.
<br />

<br />
Can someone explain that to me please?
<br />

-thanks ryanb21

			Thanks Bladeslinger. I just wasn't sure. But I don't get why it happened around the same days I was doing good precog without even trying?
<br />
Something totally random would pop into my mind and 5 mins later it happens. And it wasn't something that could have been predicted just by &quot;putting 2 and 2 together.&quot;
