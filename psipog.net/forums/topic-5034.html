okay. first off. i'd imagine that if you had LESS energy you'd be more likely to pass out.
<br />
to answer your question, no. i haven't. i've had a few energy 'outbusts' where i feel a sudden rush of energy and either have to expell it or groud quickly. but nothing too terrible.
<br />

<br />
Dbizket. it would be realy nice if you could tell us why you're asking this question. not just because it means we can get a more sociable climate here, but also so if anyone experiencing whatever it is that urged you to ask this question to not start another thread like a complete n00b.

			When I post, I like to post a bit and gauge the reactions in deciding whether to post more. (Usually because I get negative reactions too.) Anyways, I decided to ask because it happened to me. We were sitting outside hanging out and the one guy I was hanging with sent me a bunch of energy at once, (even though I couldn't feel it) and I passed out. He also did it to my other friend a few hours later and she passed out.
<br />

<br />
So I posted it wondering if anyone else had been in a similar situation.

			The moral of the story is never accept energy who's purpose you cant completely define. If you keep, however, having to much energy running through your system I reccomend you contact a friendly neighborhood psychic vampire and let them siphon some; i once did so, and they taught me an amazing amount about the working of energy.

Its so in born to them, its quite a beautifal thing to experience, actually.

			No. When I raise my energy, I get a little dizzy feeling, though. But it stops when I stop.

Nah, it wasn't a form of combat or anything so I had no reason to shield. Actually, I'm tempted to have him do it again in smaller amounts to raise my tolerance.
