			<span style="font-style: italic">Why would the freezing of this community stop you and others from learning and progressing? Same info will still be on-line..It is a bad case if your progression really depends on this site's interactive parts only. You should be capable of learning on your own, instead of being dependent on any site whatsoever.</span>
<br />

<br />
You got me on that.Valuable lesson,thanks.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic"> You say you feel used, but as long as you don't give your power to learn and progress away to anything outside of you, then nothing outside of you can ever abuse you. </span>
<br />

<br />
Still I do. Peebs made this site to find proof. A community rised, with lots of people doing work for it, and now he pulls the plug, just because he's reached a new phase in life and psipog doesn't fit in it anymore.
<br />
It's like setting up a club and just because you found out it doesn't fit to your views anymore you disassemble it, while others in the club still have the vision you at the beginning had.You could also just leave.And let the others go on with the club.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">What I am trying to say and warn you for is: Don't be dependent on any site or anyone to learn and develop. Take your own responsibility when it comes to your process. Peebrain is not responsible for the further growth of you or any of the other members. No one here was obligated to join, we made that choice ourselves. So we should not blame Psipog or Peebrain for creating or closing this community. Don't give away your power of growth, don't lay the responsibilities that belong to you, in someone elses hands. We should all take up responsibility for what happens to us and the way we react to it  . I believe it will benefit us all once we do that. It is a very important principle. </span>
<br />

<br />
I'm just angry and disappointed that the best resource I have stops, only because peebs has to go further.

			I understand.
<br />

<br />
Still, all I can say is: All these feelings of anger and dissapointment, come from the fact that you are mentally so attached and dependent on Psipog as a teacher. There are plenty of sources with good info out there. You might say: &quot;It is not because I am dependent on Psipog or attached to it, it is just that this is the best resource to me.&quot;
<br />
But if you look at the facts, 1) All the important info (article etc.) will still be here. 2) there are plenty of sites with comparable information. 3) there are thousands of books out there with more detailed descriptions than these articles here.
<br />

<br />
Consider this for yourself.. is it really that you are going to lose alot of valuable material and information that is absolutely nessecary for you to progress? Are you even going to lose any material and information at all? I'dd say not. What is it then that makes you feel dissapointed? Could it be that you have gotten attached to this communities interactive parts? I think your dissapointment comes from this dependency that you have developed in psipog. In a way, you gave away your responsibility for further progress to Psipog's active community and now that it is going to be disassembled, you get hurt and feel used. 
<br />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, I understand perfectly well that you feel sad about it, and you should allow yourself to feel that way if the emotion is there. But I am just trying to make something clear to you, so that it will prevent you from further dissapointment, if you apply it <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> . Just take responsibility for everything that comes to you and the way you react to it. Never give away your power to evolve, to the things outside of you. That way, eventually, no-one and no-thing can hurt, use or abuse you no matter how hard they try. And that feeling will evolve into a feeling of immortality, like nothing could ever harm you. If you really fully integrate this one simple principle of keeping all responsibility to yourself, you will experience a freedom unlike any other <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> .

It is a bit selfish to shut down this site (which is of so great use for so many) just because you yourself don't have any personal gain from it anymore.

			Yes, it's sad that Pog will go.
<br />

<br />
I've been around in various ways since the beginning, although not on this account.
<br />

<br />
I'll miss this site, but if this is what Sean thinks he'll need to do to be comfortable with himself, then it's that simple, and he has to do it, basically.
<br />

<br />
There're plenty of places for new people to go.
<br />

<br />
Psipalitium, Psionline, UPC, PSC-online, the Psion Guild, to name a few.
<br />

<br />
Take care, Sean.  May the sun always rise before you.

Maybe, I don't know.  A lot of you are under the impression that PsiPog was going to be around forever... Those expectations are unreasonable.  You act like it's easy for me to continue to maintain PsiPog.  Or that it's easy for me to pass it along to someone else.  You don't understand the things I do every day to maintain and make everything a smooth ride for everyone else.  You've just been enjoying the ride, oblivious to how much work I put in every day.  Now you're telling me that it's unfair that I'm going to stop working on it, because your ride isn't going to be as smooth?  Well... sorry.  I've found something better to do with my time.

If you're arguing about the forums, realize this: the forums have only been up since January of 2006!  The majority of PsiPog's time online has been WITHOUT forums!
<br />

<br />
On top of that, what makes these forums so special?  It's just phpBB software (freely available to anyone) and the rules.  You are free to create your own forums with the same rules.  Is it the people who are here that make the forums so special?  I'm not killing any people, you all will still be around after these forums are gone.  As other topics have been made, feel free to move to another psionic forum.  There are a lot.  Is it the mods who make these forums special?  They will be around as well, and some of them are interested in helping to mod the new community I intend to create.
<br />

<br />
I think it's selfish that others expect me to continue to bust my ass daily, to work on something where I don't believe in the ideals, so they can close their eyes and pretend that I've never grown.  So they can continue to have a smooth ride and have people hold their hand.  When I was new to psionics - PsiPog wasn't around!  Imagine that!  I spent days tracking down to find one person who &quot;might&quot; have had an OBE.
<br />

<br />
I'm sorry that I'm not going to be holding everyone's hand through learning psionics.  But you guys don't even realize that you don't need PsiPog!  All you are focused on is: &quot;PsiPog is good, it's going away, therefore that is bad&quot;.  Wake up.
<br />

<br />
Understand what I'm doing.  The information on PsiPog will still be available to everyone.  Forums are available from other communities.  Chats are available from other communities.  All the same people are still going to be around.  You can still ask questions all you want.  What am I taking away?  The fact that the chat doesn't have &quot;PsiPog&quot; in the topic?  Think about it.
<br />

<br />
After seeing these replies, I am even more glad I'm doing this.  There is a difference between loving a website, and being attatched to a website.  It's clear that too many people have grown dependant and attatched to PsiPog, and it's very unhealthy.  You've lost focus on what we've been focusing on in the first place: learning psionics.  And you can still learn psionics just as easily after PsiPog becomes archived.

			One Why ban you Pepsiboy? Two, Like I said earlier I maintain a message board with three to four friends of mine I know some of the work that goes into a message board. Granted I do the HTML editing/ construction only and Moderate but still that itself is a crapload of work. I see why Sean wants to let Psipog go as he moves on, its too much to hold onto while still trying to advance. Besides I doubt any of those complaining thought of this yet but, ever think to join w/e it may be that Seans doing next? Its not like you still cant tell everyone there about how you advanced or need help in much the same way you do here. It isnt like everyone will suddenly forget about how to help a new psion, cmon think about it. Man, I'm sorry for telling those off but seriously use common sense. And if Sean isnt even making a new message board, there are other places to go to ask for help, I've even come across a few Pog members already on Psilinks. (Its very similar, I recommend checking it out) Also like it was said relying on here to learn Psionics is a mistake indeed. I was a psion for six months before I came here. I was always throwing psi shurukens at people to weird them out  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> but that right there, the fact I was a psion without even knowing excatly what I was doing, means you need your own path and not rely on this site or nesessarily others for an intrest in psionics. Do it on your own time, your own will, your own wants. All throughout this forum I see people asking things like &quot;Can I Heal with psi&quot; *example* and youll get somone that one hasnt one tried it, or two heard from someone else that its impossible. So you get a no and dont even try it. When in reality IT DOES WORK. See? This typea behavior prevents advancement, you cant hold peoples hands forever, very much to begin, but not the whole way. You need to make your own path and form your own opinions on Psionic abilities....... I also really didnt want to say this but ever since the second I put my signature up I knew Psipog would be closing soon.

			i wouldnt want people trailing behind the more 'advanced' website thats up and coming. for several reasons. there are too many of the same thread here, there are too many of the same question (weekly), too many ignorant ppl, etc... its like you can already make a thread when you join. other boards have it so you have to make 100 posts before making your own thread. but here ppl sign up just to ask a question thats already been asked/answered/debated/re-answered.

I'm sorry that I'm not going to be holding everyone's hand through learning psionics.  But you guys don't even realize that you don't need PsiPog!  All you are focused on is: &quot;PsiPog is good, it's going away, therefore that is bad&quot;.  Wake up.
<br />

<br />
Understand what I'm doing.  The information on PsiPog will still be available to everyone.  Forums are available from other communities.  Chats are available from other communities.  All the same people are still going to be around.  You can still ask questions all you want.  What am I taking away?  The fact that the chat doesn't have &quot;PsiPog&quot; in the topic?  Think about it.
<br />

<br />
After seeing these replies, I am even more glad I'm doing this.  There is a difference between loving a website, and being attatched to a website.  It's clear that too many people have grown dependant and attatched to PsiPog, and it's very unhealthy.  You've lost focus on what we've been focusing on in the first place: learning psionics.  And you can still learn psionics just as easily after PsiPog becomes archived.

Wow, you seem pretty angry...I'm sorry Peebrain, I am hereby telling you that I appreciate what you have done and all of the work you put into this site. If you had to much work to do you could of asked for help...lots of people like and respect you, they would help, if you asked. The main thing I am sad about is the forums...I understand that Psipog's information will still be there, it will just be a fossil, an empty snail shell, with no life. Sure your not killing the people on this forum as you said, but they go here, and just here (at once, as a whole), not every single one of this people will be able to get back to toghether and talk like they do on this forum. And sure, there are other forums but as I said, not everyone of these forum members will be here, it's different, it's not the same. Well, I'm sorry. I admit I love this site and I feel connected to this site and the members. But I will be on your new site, and hopefully, if you make a new forum, I'll be there too. I hope I'll be able to see a few of the members that go on here.

It's been nice.

Count yourself lucky that a community like this ever existed, and get ready to move on! It was by no means an obligation for peebs to create and MAINTAIN. It doens't matter if you're sad and you express this by getting angry and attacking someone who has done nothing but help your development, you are in the wrong!  So grow up!

Mourn, and move on!

I think you should STFU! You dont even know if you can swear here! And you've only been a member for what?... 13 days?
<br />

Maybe you just havent had enough time to become addicted to psipog. But all i know is, psipog shouldnt go.
