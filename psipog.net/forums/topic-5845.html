			I was just thinking that everything you start off learning, you start small and gradually build up to the more advanced stuff. I mean, it's the logical thing to do, right? <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
So now I would like to ask some advice, I've been glancing at the articles on the website and while I find them very interesting and can't wait to start trying out what is being taught, I'm thinking that I should start at the very bottom and work my way up.
<br />

<br />
I know Psi Balls are of the most basic forms of Psionic manipulation, so obviously I'd start there, but I was wondering if someone who is already adept (or indeed, many people) would mind helping me come up with how to advance from there.
<br />

<br />
For example, Psychokenesis would probably be pretty advanced, so I shouldn't jump straight to that after I am confident enough with Psi balls, etc.
<br />
I also understand that alot about learning Psi is &quot;What works for you&quot; etc. But there must be some sort of pattern.
<br />

<br />
What's the next most basic thing up from Psi Balls?
<br />
Remote Viewing?
<br />

<br />
Let's have a list of what people would recommend to be the &quot;Learning Ladder&quot; for Psionics. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I suppose logically the order would be
<br />

<br />
Psi Balls
<br />
Other Constructs
<br />
Shielding
<br />
RV &amp; Clairvoyance
<br />
Telepathy &amp; Empathy
<br />
Out of Body Experiences / Astral Projection
<br />
Psychokinesis
<br />

<br />

<br />
Though I went from Psi Balls - Shielding - PK - TP

			psi balls....and no order after that is what I believe..you just honestly have to do what you think you'll be most comfortable at...everyone is somewhat different to what skills they're good at, so I don't think there's really a ladder...I went psi balls, pk(almost rolling things now, got the violent twitching) now OBE...although I think I've been doing a lot of RV and clairvoyance my whole life without realizing.

			Yeah, I started with psi-balls, and the next day I started on TK. I've been a natural empath for as long as I can remember, so I've been practicing telepathy. Then constructs, shields, and OBEs.
