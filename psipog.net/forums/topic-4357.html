			First of all a quick intro i am NorthWind many of you know me from the chat and due to popular demand ive decided to join this forum and post some of my traning techniques. Let it be known that these training techniques worked for me very well as well as many other people I taught but may not work for everyone. I hope these techniques help you.
<br />

<br />
TK = (the ability to move things with your mind if for some reason you didn't already know)
<br />

<br />
Tip) Probably the best way to start is with the psiwheel (read the articles if you don't know how to make one.
<br />

<br />
Tip 2) You cant move a chair in one day you have to start small and keep practicing.
<br />

<br />
Tech 1) use music that is 60 BPM in russia it is used for superlearning which helps people to learn entire languages in one week. For TK it really does help a lot.
<br />

<br />
Tech 2) When practicing it is more effective when training late when you are tired because your subconscience does not fight your progress as much.
<br />

<br />
Tech 3) When you do start training to try to get anything moving think past the object rather then thinking about moving the object think about your energy and move it that way.
<br />

<br />
Precog= (the ability to see things before they happen)
<br />

<br />
Tip 1) one of the best ways to start is by using playing cards. First trying to detirmine if the next card turned over will be black or red. You can gradually build up and then try to predict the exact card.
<br />

<br />
Tip 2) This skill isn't for everybody sometimes later on in your training you may see things that you dont want to see so keep this in mind before starting.
<br />

<br />
Tech 1) Think of seeing with your mind rather then seeing with your eyes
<br />

<br />
Tech 2) Might want to use 60 bpm music again it really does help.
<br />

<br />
Hope this post has helped you.
<br />

<br />
Sorry in advance for any spelling errors if there are any.

I always get random periods of tonnes of little precog thigns....just thinking of stuff before it happens not in any usual time range...sometimes its tv episodes i wanna see again or just random stuff. I'm in the middle of one of those periods now 
<br />
(funnily enough only a few days after wondering when my next one would be) so maybe i'll get somewhere with this skill finally

Reminds me of what was said in the first Matrix movie (and which I whole-heartedly agree with):
<br />

<br />
Boy: Do not try and bend the spoon. That's impossible. Instead only try to realize the truth.
<br />
Neo: What truth?
<br />
Boy: There is no spoon.
<br />
Neo: There is no spoon?
<br />
Boy: Then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.
<br />

<br />

<br />
In fact, since I just dug that out of a transcript page, I might as well make it my signature.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
