			Hey, I made a post asking about other peoples methods on how to move a psi wheel in the PK forum.  Some people told me that i would find better results if i asked it in this forum.  
<br />

<br />

<br />
So if you have any  suggestions on how to do this please help out.  When i say suggestions, i mean waht method do you use??
<br />

<br />

<br />
Example: do you visualize, feel energy, etcetera...
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Thanks

			I usually visualize when I need to, otherwise it's tactile, and &quot;just do it&quot; methods.
<br />
The best method is your own, experiment what works best with you. Try to feel the right thing to do, rather than get advice from others.
<br />

<br />
As for the psiwheel, I just try to get that feeling of &quot;push&quot; or &quot;spin&quot;. Let the feelings flow out of you, rather than forcing it.
<br />
Energy flows where attention goes.

			I personally just use the &quot;just do it&quot; method.  I've never been into energy, and I never went for the &quot;becoming one with the object&quot; thing.  I just will it to move, and it happens.

			For me, clearing my mind didnt really do much.  The method I do now.. is just do it with a bit of a change.  Instead of stating my intention and then clearing my mind, I just repeatedly say things like I am in complete control of the psi wheel and it is spinning and I know that the psiwheel will spin.  I say this throuout the session of tk and it spins pretty well.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Good luck!

			I used to put my fingers near it and push it with energy, but then I wanted to try without the use of my hands because I thought my hands might have been giving off heat which caused it to move or something like that.
<br />

<br />
So now I try to close my eyes and &quot;become one&quot; with the object.  I havent had much success so far, but I really havent been practicing that much with the psi wheel lately...I've been focusing on psi balls

			I suppose I use the 'just do it' method.  I just make sure that I'm relaxed and not paying too much attention to it or willing it to move very much.  Then my sub-c just comes along and moves it a bit on it's own.  I don't put my hand near it anymore because I worry about thermals affecting it (however little they may be), and I divert the direction of my breath away from it.
<br />

<br />
Edit:  I just thought of something else while doing my practice just now.  I find that since PK requires a bit of a divertion of attention (for me, at least), I find it becomes a little more effective to listen to music while practicing.  That way, the surface of my attention can focus on that while the rest of me moves the psi-wheel.

			Someone told me to make a &quot;string of psi&quot; connecting to the corner of the wheel.  I tried it with a covered psi-wheel and i wiggles a little.  I'm sure it'd work well with an open psi-wheel, but then its not as convincing.

			As an update, the method I posted earlier is not the one that I currently use.   Now instead of stating my intention, I just focus/look at the wheel and breath deeply.  My eyes with loose focus and everything will look wierd and they will be different shades of color.  I try to go into a  &quot;don't care&quot; state of mind, and then it just moves.
