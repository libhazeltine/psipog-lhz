Apperently when I was taking my noon nap when I was 7, I disappeared and my parents couldn't find me for EIGHT hours! My dad found me in the end sleeping on my tree house.

			My grandfather told me a story from when i was a kid. he told me i woke up from ma afternoon nap, wnt to a corner of his bedroom and took a leek, thn wnt back to bed and carry on sleepeng. =)
<br />

<br />
The other strange sleepwalk was when we were camping in an autocamp at the sea; some 50 metres from our caravan was a german man who brought me chocolate everytime he came to visit. One night i got up sleepwalking, went to his caravan and started banging on his dors yelling: &quot;SCHOCOLADE, SCHOCOLADE!&quot; in german - he than brought me back and guess what i got that chocolade <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
though i had many more sleepwalks when i was a kid.. and my mother and some girlfriends told me i still have a lot to say in my sleep.. i really hope i dont blurt out something &quot;unappropriate&quot; one night..  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			when i was little, i wanted to go to the playground.  When my parents woke up, the door was wide open.  Guess where i was <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .  My parents found me swinging on a swing.  The thing is, i know it was about a 30 minute walk there, and i KNOW that i dont know how to get there.

			Once when i was a kid, I got up and took a leak on my cousins carpet. He turned the light on and told me to tell my grandparents what I did. And guess what, I navigated though a hallway full of furniture, told my grandmother and came back to the room and laid back down.
<br />

<br />
And was told about it the next day, ain't that kool?
