			The other day, I was thinking about the properties of psi. Psi balls in particular. I thought about what happens under certain circumstances, such as flaring, the warming or cooling effects, and the Geiger counter interaction which suggests radiation of some sort.
<br />

<br />
Then it occurred to me that some of these effects can be caused by the electromagnetic spectrum.
<br />

<br />
If you don't already know, the EM spectrum is a range of wavelengths which make up light, from gamma rays at the lowest wavelength, to visible light in the middle, and then to radio at the highest wavelengths.
<br />

<br />
First thing I came up with was how the two relate. The idea I got was that psi is the manipulation of electromagnetic waves. Many of the different effects that are caused by psi can be related to different parts of the spectrum. For example, the heating effect could be caused by infra-red wavelengths, and the flaring would be caused by manipulating the wavelengths of EM waves to visible light.
<br />

<br />
The next thing was where did the EM waves come from. The first thing that came to mind was the background radiation left behind by the Big Bang (known as cosmic microwave background radiation). This is a harmless, ever-present for of microwave radiation which exists naturally, and everywhere. And it's on the right end of the spectrum for infra-red and visible light (just backing up my claims from the last part...). There are other kinds of background radiation, but to me this seems the most likely.
<br />

<br />
The next step was to figure out how this can be manipulated. Since this is the electromagnetic spectrum, I immediately assumed magnets. But since I haven't found any evidence that electromagnetism effects EM waves, the following bit is less likely than the rest of this post: As everybody should know, electricity generates a magnetic field, and electricity is present in the body's nervous system. Therefore, if I'm right about EM waves being effected by electromagnetism, it could be possible that manipulation of electricity in the nervous system, in particular the brain, is responsible for manipulation of EM waves, and could also explain how psi can be manipulated into shapes simply by thought alone.
<br />

<br />
So to summarise my theory: Psi is the manipulation of electromagnetic waves by the body's nervous system. This can explain at least some of the properties of psi.
<br />

<br />
(I realise that there is going to be big holes in my theory, first and foremost the nervous system part, since I can't actually find anything that says &quot;yes, electromagnetism can effect EM waves&quot;. I also realise that its very likely this theory is incorrect; this is more of an idea than an actual scientifically provable theory at this point.)

			Your idea was brough up countless times and I myself thought of it years ago when I started to think about this type of thing. Yes it was all discussed before and there is evidence that rules agasint your idea. I never heard of it but there was someone put in a lead vault (a psychic no doubt) and communicated with the outside.
<br />

<br />
I sometimes wonder if the body does use EM waves, but right now the evidence don't exactly sort it. What I personaly think is that the EMP waves are nothing but a byproduct of something else. Other people tend to think this way also on some grounds.
<br />

<br />
Anyway its nice that you came out with your idea.

			i remember reading somewhere that it is possible ELF (extremely low frequency) EM might be used in paranormal phenomena...but it's too low to actually study much...I dunno, just something weird to think about.
