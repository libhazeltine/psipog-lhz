			Well,I don't know where else to put this but here it goes,
<br />

<br />
I have just pretty much gotten very good at Energy Manipulation and got some skill on using telekinesis on the wind.But I like a skills equally and am having trouble choosing one.I'm not asking for someone to recommend an ability,I just want to hear the ups/downs of the following main skills:
<br />

<br />
Telekinesis,Telepathy,Clairvoyance,
<br />

<br />
After several posts I'll decide what I'll practice.Help would be apprieciated! <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Can't say much on Clairvoyance since I haven't had experience with it...
<br />

<br />
I guess it really depends on your preferences. If you want to do psionics for XXX reasons, and PK may fit those reasons better? By all means. That applies to telepathy too.
<br />

<br />
Personally I just do whatever I feel in the mood to <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			What makes you think you have to choose just one?  I can understand the rationale that focusing on one skill-set may allow you to develop faster, but it's this &quot;exclusivity of skill&quot; that can slow down the overall advance of psionics.
<br />

<br />
Think about it this way.  A trained carpenter is building a house.  The house will have plumbing and electrical in it, but he won't be installing those systems.  The plumber and electrician will.  Now, each of these specialists are well trained in their respective fields.  But let's say the carpenter knows plumbing too and the plumber knows electrical engineering.  As the carpenter builds a soffit, he sees the plans will call for a sprinkler to be installed.  Preemptively, he drills the hole in the joist for the piping to go through and builds a brace for the extension.  The plumber comes in and sees almost half of his work done and checks it for code.  As he installs and primes the sprinkler, he notices that the designs call for a can-light to be installed nearby.  An oversight on the architect's part causes the water pipes to be running through the same guide as the electrical conduit.  While it's not against code, it's still an awkward install now that the pipes are installed.  But since he knows EE, he installs a conduit for the wiring and runs fish-tape through it so the electrician won't have to install the conduit and risk damaging the primed sprinkler system.  The electrician comes by and runs the wires and installs the can.
<br />

<br />
The point is that if the carpenter and the plumber only had knowledge in their own field they still would have built the house fine, but the process would have gone less smoothly.
<br />

<br />
It's kind of an odd metaphor, but I think the point was conveyed.
<br />

<br />
Having strong roots in energy manipulation is a great thing.  It would lead me to believe that it also is why you are having problems &quot;choosing&quot;.  Fact is, all of these skills share so much in common from a fundamentals standpoint.
<br />

<br />
Learning composition enables you to become a better Oil Painter.  But the same skill can improve your photography, interior design, even the arrangement of garnish on your chicken marsala dish.
<br />

<br />
Sure it takes longer, but why limit yourself to a Crescent wrench when you can have the whole tool chest?  This goes for anything in life.  Not knowing physics won't keep you from being a capable PK'er but understanding physics can enable you te be more efficient in dealing with inertia and other factors in your practice.  Not understanding writing mechanics won't keep you from writing powerful and heart-felt poetry, but with that extra knowledge, you can convey your thoughts in a more articulate and powerful manner that will resonate with the hearts of a broader crowd.
<br />

<br />
But now I'm just rambling...  ^__^
<br />

<br />
Having roots in EM allows you to pick just about any skill you want to pursue and you should have reasonable success, effort provided.  Decide what it is that you want to accomplish and look at each skill and see how they contribute to your goals.  Don't alienate yourself from other skills, but focus on what will take you on the straightest path to your goal.
<br />

<br />
okay, I'm done.
<br />

<br />

			hehe,cool,

<br />
The reason I want to learn one skill is because I LOVE doing multiple things at once except I never get anything done,nor can I choose what to do and plus I don't have much time for more than 2 Skills.SO I would just like to learn the pros and cons of each skill from those who know a few things about it(and not just from the articles).Then I will choose what to learn first and whether or not I'm satisfied.
<br />

I think that's about all you had to say <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />, but it's a good point none the less <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. I will now do what I promised myself I'd do and list the &quot;ups and downs&quot; of the abilities based on my knowlege, limited experience, common sense/deductive reasoning:
<br />

<br />
 <span style="font-weight: bold">TK</span>
<br />

<br />
BENEFITS UPON ATTAINING TK:
<br />

<br />
1.  The first obvious benefit is you can move small objects (unless you're advanced) without touching them when you feel lazy <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
2. You could move (or possibly bend) inaccessible objects
<br />

<br />
3. You could prove a skeptic very quickly, under the right conditions, that you have at least that psychic ablility since it's one of the easiest abilities to verify without much testing (at least I think so).
<br />

<br />
4. You might be able to make (honest; not criminal <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />) money off of it.
<br />
(that's all I can think of for benefits so far)
<br />

<br />
CHALLENGES/DOWNFALLS:
<br />

<br />
1. I heard that if you want to move bigger objects you must learn how to link with the object. That may be hard for some people. I sure as hell couldn't do it nor could I understand it! But don't let me discourage you <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. I'm sure if a person is that determined he/she could do it with enough practice.  
<br />

<br />
2. From what I've read, experienced, and assumed over time I think TK may be the hardest of those 3 abilities to develop without being gifted. Then again I really don't have enough experience to say that without a doubt. It just seems like one of the most frustrating and time consuming ones to learn. This one is more of an assumption though so don't take my word for it.
<br />

<br />
3. If you use it in public you may draw unwanted attention and may be labeled as a freak <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
4. It can't really be used for getting you anywhere in life unless you exploit the ability itself to make money.
<br />

<br />
5. It also couldn't be used to help others in that many ways: &quot;Sir, I've lost my purse. I'll offer you a large reward if you find it. Do you think you can?&quot; &quot;Sure! I'll just use TK to find a clue <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />!!&quot; *he can't find shit so he comes back with a purse he stole from another woman via TK* &quot;There you go madam!&quot;
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">TP</span>
<br />

<br />
(I'll put benefits next to down falls this time)
<br />

<br />
1. You could read peoples thoughts to extract valuable info., but you may creep them out if you don't hide what you discover or something. In fact, just telling someone you can do TP may not be a good idea unless you trust them. 
<br />

<br />
2. You might be able to able to scan to find out if there's anyone you know/want to find in a particular location.
<br />

<br />
3. You may be able to help people with it but you'd have to use your wits to get the info. Also, TP wouldn't help you THAT much in life as far as things like making the right choices go.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">CLAIRVOYANCE</span>
<br />

<br />
(I've actually read about clairvoyance in a book and had two major experiences with it so I'd consider this info.  a lot more reliable.)
<br />

<br />
1. Can be used to make very tough choices if you're good enough at interpreting what you see (images may be symbolic). The problem is you'd have to make sure you don't visualize what you want to see and just wait for something to pop into your head. You also have to trust what your seeing no matter how weird it looks. If it looks strange it probably means you aren't visualizing it yourself. Also, understanding what you see may be hard.
<br />

<br />
2. It can be used to help people/solve crimes but, again, be hard to understand at times if you aren't skilled and experienced enough. I wouldn't really recommend trying to do anything major with it like helping solve a murder case or something unless you really trust your abilities and skill and have enough experience with it.
<br />

<br />
3. If what I remember is correct, it can be used for the same purpose as remote viewing but may be symbolic or vague.
<br />

<br />
4. It can tell you how to approach your day or people you encounter. Ex.- You may get an image hinting that you should be very firm and tough around a certain person to get the most benefit for that day at least.
<br />

<br />
OVER ALL DOWNFALL/POSITIVE ASPECT OF CLAIRVOYANCE:
<br />

<br />
In a book I am still reading (I've already read all of the chapters about the psychic senses and am almost finished with it) called: &quot;You Are Psychic!&quot; by Pete Sanders, I learned that there are four psychic senses: clairvoyance, clairaudience, psychic feeling, and psychic intuition. The author believes (and has most likely proven) from experience that every person has fixed differing levels of skill in the four psychic abilities. This means that you may be signifigantly better at using/developing 1 or even two of the senses over the rest. The author recommends that a practitioner finds out what he/she is best at and take advantage of it, because if you're bad at a certain sense and try for years and years to get results you could be wasting your time because you may have a stronger sense that is a million times easier to develop. What I'm trying to say is that clairvoyance may not be your thing. But I'd give it a shot never the less. If you want, you can PM me asking for info. on the book that may help you determine your strongest sense based on your experience or your personality traits that the book points to as being qualities of a clairvoyant, clairaudient, feeler, or intuitive person. I hope this helps you <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  
<br />

<br />
P.S.  ErikJDurwoodII's idea isn't so bad. If you want to develop them all at the same time you can. You'd get more net benefit out of it, especially by combining their potential <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />. But if you turn out to be way more skilled in one over the other, I'd recommend going with that one (while doing the others on the side). Because of this you may want to experiment with them all for a few weeks first.

<br />

<br />
I actually relized recently that whenever I try to read someone's mind,I get their feelings,but not emotional feelings,rather the feelings one gets when his subcounscious talks to them.
<br />

<br />
And today I also relized I was better at TK than I thought,when I was bored I made a pencil wiggle and rotate in in 3mins. and did it better everytime I tried.More Info is in my blog which can be found on my site.
<br />

<br />
So I'm taking both advices and taking up TK and Telepathy. <img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Once again thnx,I've been thinking about it for a while.
