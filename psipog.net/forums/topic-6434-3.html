			I understand now. Well, it is not a problem, just your shadow side <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />. We all have a shadow-side. It lies in the mind and we cannot see it unless we either attempt to observe it unattached to our ego, or get it reflected by someone else who notices it or reacts to it. The latter was the case in your situation as I understand it. The reflection given by that specific person you speak of, was a very direct, yet very good reflection of your shadow-side. You should embrace his words and learn as much from them as you can. More importantly, you need to remember them, not making them part of your sense of self, but remembering them and stay alert when you are acting towards others, so you can recognise your shadow-patterns and deal with it accordingly. (That means: Acepting it but intending to change it to turning inward and finding the energy there, instead of finding them in others.)

You are progressing really, so don't feel bad. All of this takes time.

			Remember SFG: &quot;Flaws and problems are merely your signposts to happiness.&quot;  Each is a lesson.  And if you are learning from those lessons rather than ignoring them, then you're on your way to happiness.  Thus, any flaw or problem is nothing more than future happiness that will flower when you put enough time and energy into it.

			Hey SFG I think I know what you're going through and I've felt it myself but dont get too down that is just self destructive.  And if you hide from people I've learned it just makes the situation a whole lot worse.  But anyway I hope you feel better and come back soon.  And dont just give up on a psionic site when pog closes.  Go to psilinks and peebrain's new site.  I guess what I'm ultimately trying to get across here is (even though it doesnt really sound like it) a lot of ppl do care about you and would hate to see you leave for good.  So cheer up soon buddy we all want to see you happy again.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

Don't let yourself be weighed down by misfortune.  That makes it only worse. Except you want it to be worse. It's your choice.
