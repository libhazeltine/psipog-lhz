			I think criss angle can do some PK, but he can't really make a show just off that. Thats probably why he has all his big stunts, which you have to be an illusionist to pull off. But surly, he knows some PK

			I don't believe in any media-hyped &quot;magicians&quot; for two reasons:
<br />

<br />
a) If I had amazing psionic skill, I wouldn't use it just to get popular (well, I would at first <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> , but here's a good analogy - say you somehow end up on another planet, with people who look human, but have no arms. They are amazed by your arms, and nag you to let them look at them. You hear &quot;move them again!&quot; every day. This would get really annoying really fast.
<br />

<br />
On the other hand, if you don't really HAVE arms, you'll like the idea of pretending to have them, because you don't really have them. In this case, you &quot;fake&quot; things for popularity.)
<br />

<br />
and b) The government pretty much controls the media. I doubt they want the general public to have knowledge about it, because if everyone was a psion, we'd quickly find new, more powerful ways to use it. More power = less control of the few over the many. Plus many people would probably use it to further their own agendas.
<br />

<br />

			I seriously think he knows some PK. I mean what kind of illusionist can push down a palm tree? Or what kind of illusionist can float from one building to another with nothing but the sky above him? He also played russian rullete and knew exactly where the bullet would be. He also said in almost every one of his demonstrations that he believes in kinetic energy.

Oh yeah, I met him before. He was busy and he needed to go to a meeting and he told me to hang out with him later  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> .

			I have no idea how Criss Angel does his tricks, but then if I did he wouldn't be a very good magician.
<br />

<br />
I think he's just an illusionist, but a very good one. Yes he does do levitations that are clearly different from the one in that video, but that doesn't mean they aren't tricks.
<br />

<br />
You may also note that in the vanish episode you see him make tons of stuff and people dissapear, you never see him bring them back. Unless he wants to be convicted of some pretty serious crimes, all the stuff he vanished he obviously gave back, but they don't show us that probably because it would give away the trick.

I believe it's called acting.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

As for being suspended by hooks, that's a display of courage and willpower, it's nothing supernatural.

<br />
It's very rare to find a magician who <span style="font-style: italic">doesn't</span> pretend to be supernatural when they are preforming.
<br />

<br />
One last thing, when he levitates other people, he always put them in a trance. This suggests that they could feel the wires (or whater else he uses) if they were fully concious.
<br />

<br />
So what is he, a megician, a hypnotist, and a performance artist, nothing else.
