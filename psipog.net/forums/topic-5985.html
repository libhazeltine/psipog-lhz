			I can't say. Really, I wouldn't mind to aim for something with psychology, but I probably won't get any where near a college.
<br />

<br />
Second choice, Martial arts...but if I can't afford college, I dont' think I could afford classes...unless I waltz right in and side kick the teacher then fight the entire place to see how far I get before the cops break in with pepperspray and nightsticks.
<br />

<br />
Either way, my future is going to be a loney and terrible. I'll try to wait it out as much as possible.

			Wow neveza that's kinda depressing...

I wish to revolutionize the way games are played today. I have many ideas for games and ideas for new &quot;consoles&quot; to make gameplay even better. I just need the money and the knowledge.
<br />
Along with that, I wish to advance my spiritual awareness.

			Heh, ideally, I'd love to act in New York, but I'm double majoring in Theatre and History with a minor in archaeology, so I'll probably end up doing work in a museum, which I'll be totally fine with.

			Right now, I'm a security guard, and hell, it's an awesome job! It's a 6-hour shift every night. 11PM-5AM
<br />

<br />
I just have to do 8 patrols, about 20 minutes each, and I can do whatever the hell I want within reason with the rest of the time. I usually read, play PSP, listen to music, go to my house and watch TV for an hour....
<br />

<br />
XD
<br />

<br />
What an awesome job. The foot patrols down the road will be a little more tedious, but I'll still have my PSP and a book or something. Man, energy drinks are great for those late-night hours. So is coffee. Yay artificial... awake-ness?
<br />

<br />
Beyond that, though, I am planning on going into the Air Force sometime in the next 6 months. I am looking forward to that, but it will be hard to adjust to such a drastic change. I'm also going to use the college money offered by them to goto a specialty music college in LA. It's called MIT, and it has 6 courses... Guitar, Vocals, Recording, Drums, Bass, and Keyboard. It may have more, though. I haven't checked on it in about a year. I'm planning on attending the Guitar and Recording courses.
<br />

<br />
Dammit, I need to form another band, or make more songs on the computer. Damn that Cubase VST, not letting Midi tracks into the mixdown file without routing it to a VST instrument, which the help file does not tell me how do to... If I found out that one simple thing, I'd be making much more songs.
<br />

<br />
As weird as it sounds, I wish to become spiritually enlightened. I also wish to get very good at psionics.
