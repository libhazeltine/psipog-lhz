			Eehm... Well some here probably know I have a boyfriend... But now I'm having a problem... I'm really really really beginning to like a good friend of mine and it is confusing me. I know I don't want to break up with my bf but the feelings are confusing me. Is it possible to make a shield against these emotions?(the &quot;liking a good friend of mine&quot; emotions) and then my next question would be: how?
<br />
Me no like confusy in my head! <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

You're not going to be able to shield out physical emotions transmitted non-psychically.
<br />

<br />
You're just going to have to deal with it.

			Decide if it is just a crush or not, I've had feelings like that about all my friends at one time or another but they faded (just a crush),and decide who you really want to be with.

			A shield wouldn't work because the feelings are inside you and it would just keep them there.  It might not be a psionic solution, but you could do what others do in interventions.  Relate this guy to something bad to you and keep this connection in your head all the time.  Anytime you see him remember that connection.  Sooner or later your thoughts will change, although maybe your heart won't.

			Bah, &quot;working things out&quot; is for psychiatrists! We want the easy way out!

Have a construct project another emotion over the top of the love whenever it pops up.

			Did you try grounding the emotion? I do it sometimes if I'm like nervouse about my grade or if jimmy's getting on my last nerve. I don't know if it'll work but it's might be worth a shot.

			i dont think this is something that there is an easy way out. any kind of psi related solution is like covering a broken bone with a plaster. it will stop the bleeding, but the bone will set badly and trouble you for the rest of your life. or, you can move it, and suffer a moment of pain, in order to set it straight and allow it to regrow fully.
<br />

<br />
this is something that your going to need to deal with yourself, without the aid of psi, and there i cannot help you. all i can say is, think carefully about your choice.
<br />

<br />
good luck.
