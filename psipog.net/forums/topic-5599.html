			Hey guys. I posted this in another online community, but I think you could also benefit from reading this.
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure if any of you remember or not, but I have made mention before that I work at an EB Games. It's a fantastic job, and I love working for them. Since they merged with Gamestop, business seems to have been picking up even more, so everyone's happy. 
<br />

<br />
But I'd like to explain a few things to some of you guys. There's certain things that EVERYONE could do that would make the world just.... one big happy fucking place. 
<br />

<br />
When you preorder a game, preordering online is really lame. Honestly. Preordering in a store though... let me tell you. The guys who work at your local EB or Gamestop absolutely love it. It makes us look good, because we're basically selling the game early (even though not completely in most cases). And it's not just a typical clerk job either- we're salesmen. Not only are we required to sell you guys games, but we need to sell pre-orders and subscriptions to GameInformer. 
<br />

<br />
Those two things are part of our employee statistics. They make us look good, and allow us to keep our jobs. Lol. 
<br />

<br />
The preorders garuantee you get a copy of the game. Plain and simple. Put 5 bucks down on it and pick it up when it comes out. See, if people don't preorder, it's basically telling the warehouses that nobody gives a fuck about the game, so they'll only send us like 2 copies. Then, you'll come in to get one, and it's already sold to someone else (probably some little middle-school prick too who gets to buy mature games for himself cause his parents dont care... what an asshole, right?). By preordering, they have to send us copies. 
<br />

<br />
And I understand you might not be to thrilled about Game Informer and paying 15 bucks for a years subscription (even though it is a good deal, i realize some of you don't read very much or care for it). However, when you get the subscription, you get a discount card for our store, so whenever you buy used games or trade in games, you get to buy used games cheaper and sell us games for more money. It's a great deal, because if you buy alot of games, that subscription will be paid off in no time, plus you'll end up with more cash. It doesn't seem like much individually, but things build up over time. You wouldn't just throw a 10 or a 20 out the window, would you? 
<br />

<br />
Basically, I just wanted to give you guys insight into what it's like and what every employee needs to get when working at an EB or Gamestop. And just in case you ever got annoyed because an employee tried to sell you a subscription or talk up a presale, now you know how it benefits us, and how it benefits you more than anything else. 
<br />

<br />
Keep it cool, guys.

			PROUD SUPPORTER OF GAMESTOP AND GAMEINFORMER!!!
<br />

<br />
I've been subscribed to GameInformer for almost 5 years!!!  I've preordered all the important games.  As of late, nothing very special has come out that has caught my eye.  Designers are losing thier touch.  We need another Halo, or Knights of the Old Republic.  Something every good X-box fan with love.
<br />

<br />
Back in the day I was in Game Stop so much, that when trading in games, the clerk would fill out half  the info on the trade in slip for me!  It was like they were stalking me, but no, I was just a major dork.  lol

			It doesnt work like that all the time. My friend is a major gaming freak and preorders each game like 3 months in advance. Yet still he doesnt get some of his games.

			I've always found EB to be exceptionally disorganized and slow.  The lines take forever and if they've got some copies of a game that didn't JUST come out, they can never find the disc.  So I wait and wait and wait until they come back from the backroom and say &quot;We must not have it even though the computer says we do&quot;.  A true waste of half an hour when all I wanted was to inquire whether a game was in and then buy it.
<br />

<br />
Recently though I agree with Rahmid, games suck in general.  Developers put their best dev teams on projects to work with new, confusing hardware and thus produce crappy games.  Meanwhile the worse dev teams work on last generation's games.  It's a no win situation and I haven't bought a game since God of War as a result.

			It's funny you mention that. I've been playing God of War (for the first time) lately. Pretty sweet game. I didn't know you could get away with that many exposed tits in a single game. XD
