			This whole topic isn't going to be just dedicated to NI, but most of it will be. Honestly this psychokinesis forum might not exist if it wasn't for him. Even if it did, it definitely wouldn't get this kind of attention. I take my hat off to you NI, I think many of us wouldn't be here if you hadn't blazed the trail years ago and clearly wrote to us all the means by which you got to where you are. I've been around even since before you believed in psychokinesis, I've seen you come a long way, and I am quite impressed. You are also a great writer, have you ever thought about publishing a book? A book about PK? It would be one of kind as there aren't very many out there on the topic as it is. 
<br />

<br />
I've been out of practice for quite awhile, but last night I had a successful seshi(that's slang for session). Not only did I learn some things but I was reminded of other things that I learned at some other point in time. Establishing an intent and LETTING it move is truely the key. I'd say that would be the best way to go about it, however you and also do small sporatic movements by using a couple of your fingers and this will sort of 'jumpstart' the movement, but I consider it to be like the icing on top of the cake and not the true focus. By jarring the object you know you're getting somewhere but you know that you won't always see the results in this way. For the beginners that have difficulties with the psiwheel, I have a trick for you. Make a bigger psiwheel. If you're really having trouble, square off a sheet of notebook paper, making a psiwheel that's about 6&quot; by 6&quot; and just find a way to balance that and it'll be much easier to move. It'll move slower than a smaller psiwheel, but it'll move much more easily. The opposite is also true. If you're looking to build your way up slowly, then just cut down your psiwheel a little bit as you go along and master each step, then if you go back to a slightly bigger wheel, it'll be cake. Good luck to everyone and work hard!

			I don't think he's that great (non-ability wise), He's just another person that can do something better then most.

Personally, his work and ideas never helped me with PK. If anything, If it wasn't for Xict's webcam shows, I wouldn't have achived my success in PK in weeks of trying.

			the suggestions written by NI have helped me many times until now.

It is rare, I have obtained better results with  bigger psiwheels , I can focus better  . it is all in my mind?. I don't think so.
