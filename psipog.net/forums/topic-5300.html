			Last night I figured that I'd try to have an OBE. I have kind of a weird sleep schedule... I took a nap at around 9:30 pm and woke up around 12:30 am. I read OBE related things for around an hour and went back to sleep trying to hit that body-asleep/mind-awake stage. 
<br />

<br />
I had some techno playing on my computer in the background (it helps me to clear my head), and I soon noticed that my entire body was getting a tingly feeling all over my body, kinda like when a limb is falling asleep. I felt this tingly feeling 2 or so times until I felt another one, and this one made the other 2 seem like nothing. It seemed that it was all I could do just to not move and not panic (when I paniced (sp), I felt the tingling feeling go away). I'm assuming that this is either my body falling asleep or the 'vibrations' I've read about. I noticed that the more my mind wandered, I felt closer to falling asleep (and then I noticed it and become more conscious and was set back a little..).
<br />

<br />
After doing the 'wandering mind and coming back to consciousness' thing, I felt like part of my hand wasn't inside of my flesh and bone hand. It was really weird at first, and figured that the feeling was my astral body (?) trying to get out of my physical body. I tried to get completely out for probably 20 minutes to no avail.. I found that at times, my music was helping me concentrate, but at other times, it was actually distracting me from concentrating (helping and hindering my concentration at different times). I was wondering if how close I was to fully projecting AND if the music is a good or bad idea? 
<br />

<br />
Any help at all would be greatly appreciated <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
EDIT: I just remembered, whenever I started to feel the tingling sensation, I had to think about breathing (got short of breath). Any suggestions to keep from having to consciously think about breathing? I'd rather not be thinking about breathing if possible <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. thanks again
