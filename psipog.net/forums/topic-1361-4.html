Jenny Greenteeth? Aughisky? Selkie?... that last one, selkie, rings a bell for some reason... but, doesn't change the fact that I have no clue what you're talking about hehe. Care to elaborate?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
Jenny Greenteeth is a mythological creature from the British Isles, probably Welsh or Irish in origin. Tradtionally a horribly misshapen woman who lurks in ponds and lakes, and drags in children who stray too close or play in weeds/reeds.
<br />

<br />
An aughisky is a horse which, when saddled, allows itself to be ridden for a while, but then leaps into the nearest body of water and carries its rider to their death by drowning. Irish in origin.
<br />

<br />
Selkies are bimorphal shapeshifters which can take the shape of either a human or a seal. When in human form they shed their seal skin, and if you find a skin and hide it you can take the owner as your wife, but if she ever finds her skin she changes back into a seal and leaves forever. Unlike the other two, selkies are considered friendly.  Same origins as Jenny Greenteeth.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The only difference between those three mythological creatures and whatever attacked you is that those three are mythological creatures, and whatever attacked you was apparently real.

Not to burst your bubble, but I've resd accounts that when the mayan calendar is converted to the one we use now, their 2012 will be in our 2008.

			sorry if this was mentioned before, but many physicists have predicted how the world will end.  something about kinetic and heat energy/transfer will end, so the world won't have any heat...but that's not supposed to happen until the sun burns out...about 4.5 billion years from now.  i think we will end up killing each other off in a nuclear/biological war.
<br />

<br />
on a side note:  did you know that the next planetary allignment is supposed to happen around 2011 or 2012?  isn't that the year everyone on this thread is talking about?  i'm pretty positive that they aren't related, or that the world will end in 2012...but it is interesting.

<br />
why couldn't you just cut the skin into 7 pieces, and hide the pieces in 7 different places? <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> then even if she found one piece of skin, she would still have 7 more to find, and thus would likely not find any, or is that cheating?

<br />
seriously, about the end of the world, well, there have been an absurd number of apocalypse theories, and I must say...
<br />

WE ARE STILL HERE!!! EVERY TIME SOMEONE SAID THE WORLD WAS GOING TO END AT SUNSET, THE SUN, APPARENTLY NOT LISTENING TO GUY, STILL PROCEEDS TO RISE AGAIN THE NEXT DAY!!

isn't it great that the universe doesn't have to listen to us?

It's actually a little more than just another planetary alignment. I forget the details, but the breakdown of it, is that 2012, dec 21 or 23, is the day that the fifth cycle, out of five cycles, shifts, which is supposedly going to cause a complete reversal of all 5 cycles. One cycle is a little over 5000 years. So, we're talking a cosmic event that hasn't occured for around 27,000 years. One that is supposedly of great importance. But who knows whether or not it will affect us? Heh, only time will tell, as they say.
<br />

<br />
And it's not some bullshit story. Astronomy has verified it all. It's a fact.... We're going to get to be around for what is basically the greatest cosmic occurance since the dawn of &quot;civilized man&quot;.

			Sticking to the original topic. 
<br />

<br />
What you experienced was a common sleep disorder (?) called Sleep Paralysis. It is quite common and 20% of the population admit to having experienced it at least once. I myself have experienced it and it was truly terrifying and realistic. I am not convinced however that I was attacked by aliens (as i thought, during the episode) or that i was being sat on and crushed by a massive force. My reason for not believing that it was real is due to the fact that it is a major part of the disease, Narcolepsy. People with the disease have episodes of Sleep Paralysis at least every day so consider yourself lucky that you've only had it once or twice.
<br />

<br />
On a side note: Everyone in the world is expected to experience an episode of Sleep Paralysis once, so wait your turn.

			Absolutley, Just take into consideration that weird things can and do happen when in a hypnogogic or hypnopompic state (falling asleep and waking up).
<br />

<br />
I'm not trying to say that the experience you had wasn't real. This is psionics after all and practically anything is possible, just remember to take it with a grain of salt.

			This might be a stupid thought but.....a while back i read a 5 page article about how any why there are people (ex: skin color, hair color, hight/size, feelings exc) and it talked about how we have been evloving from different types of human like creatures. And it discribes how humans have advanced with their mind scince the first humans....and it discribed how there is a possiblity of some sort of energy (i forgot the scientific name of the energy) in the world/universe that is helping/feeding us and our minds that is evolving us (ex: again color, hair, hight exc) and it could also be evloving our brains.
<br />

<br />
i was thinking that it could be possible that this energy could become more extream and begin evolving us even more and hence it would change us faster and begin either the end or a new beginning of humans (it is also possible that it could completly change our body forms so we would be a different type of creature)
<br />

<br />
I believe that if this happens maybe humans would evolve more into psionics or something...i dunno i may be sounding too much like X-men but my thought is far smaller then this
<br />

<br />
i believe that if this happens it could possibly happen around 2011 or 2012
<br />

<br />
i hope this is understandable (it was difficult to shorted 5 pages to a few paragraphs)
<br />

<br />
it is just a thought...it is most likely false
