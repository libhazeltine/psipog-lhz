I think that pK has almost unlimited possiblities... though I don't think I would acheive more than about 30%.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

The point is, why the close - mindedness? A close mind leads to stagnation. *Is* there a clear line between possible and probable? No. It depends on who's looking.

			Ok i'll say this, affecting the weather with psionics is POSSIBLE. Now if this is energy manipulation or extreme masterful use of Macro-Kinesis im unsure, but if one looks at this in a Macro-Kinesis way (affecting large object) then it is totally possible, mixing TK to push the wind, Cyro-PK to cool and condense the air, its all possible but would take extreme heavily exteme amounts of energy. Now thats looking at in one way, it could be energy manipulation as the guy said and require some, I dont know, all I know that be it possible by whatever means (thinking about it a lot is possible if you just mix rudimentary and known abilities, imagination can go a long way with mixing the skills) we SHOULD NOT practice it.
<br />

<br />
The weather is a very very delicate system, we all shouldnt control it and mess with it for it will have DIRE consequences on a GLOBAL scale in the end, areas that can't take extensive amounts of rain suddenly getting it from a person yearning for it. Other areas getting a bit hotter when its cold, it all affects the eviorment and the areas around you. This is not something you should go into, because one it will mess up the eviorment and balance of nature and two it could easily cause much much harm if the wrong or uncontrolled hands.
<br />

<br />
I'm not having a closed mind on this and labeling it impossible, a lot of impossible things are never that, sometimes it's impossible only because people dont take the steps needed to make it prior they expect a snap from start to finish when there are often many steps inbetween, what I am saying is we shouldnt mess with this skill, it will bite us in the butt later on, and hard.
<br />

<br />
Earth is already being stripped, abused, and polluted enough...don't mess with the balance of nature and weather....do that and Earth will become worse then it is now, think about the outcome beyond just changing the weather, because this is a chain reaction my friends, follow the chain and see how bad it can get.

			You seem like an intelligent person, wolf. Thanks for pointing out the importance of keeping the nature balanced. Indeed, we do not know how many of the natural disasters that have transpired were caused by human activity in some way or another, nor do we know how many plants have died from lack of water due to someone messing with the weather. (Psionically or otherwise.) So, good point.

			Yes, and the government is already trying to &quot;seed&quot; clouds with heavy metal type minerals, making clouds drop heavy and percipitate. The minerals )which are harmful to humans) are than rained into our water supply. So yes is messed up, and perhaps we should not mess with it. I just think its stupid for people to say it does not work.  The method I have used is basically a bit more fluffy i guess, really it has never been much more than trying to contact higher levels of entities, or I uess just a higher force, maybe psi, I dont really know... Then ttrying to telepathicly send my message, usually making pictures of the place in my mind raining or what not. I have had that work. Or somtimes I will draw a picture of earth and then draw snowflakes or such falling on a certain continent, then meditate and try to send that telepathicaly.
<br />
Other times I have just merely had the thought, never really trying to do it just wanting it on a certain day, and i told my ffriend and on that day i forgot, but it was raiing, later my friend called and reminded me and i thought it was pretty cool.
<br />

<br />
FOr a good reference on this, I found one very good book called The PK Man,    it is a very good true story about Terry somthing, I dont remember his name but he could control weather, and lightening and earthquakes at will. It is highly documented by news, and he has caused major black outs and he even predicted exactly when a whole bunch of UFO's would appear in the same place on the same day. SO he basically said like &quot; WIthen 20 days I am going to make this hole town have a blackout, followed by 3 UFO sighting seen by many people, and one very big sighting. Then there will be an earthquake one day later.&quot;
<br />
sure enough  happened.
<br />

<br />
WHY? I really do not know, but whether you use it or not is up to you, but i probaly agree with wolf on this one.

Humans have been fucking it up for the past 500+ years.

			So just because we did it in the past it justifies further tampering?
<br />

<br />
Yeah there were many mess ups on the human races side of things, WHY PUSH IT FURTHER? You know the world isnt infinite, it has limits, it has only so much it can take, dont think just because &quot;its happen in the past&quot; that it can happen infinitely in the future.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Everything breaks and nothing lasts forever, so don't try to speed the breaking of the earth, its possible, we have already shown we have the potential to ruin and kill it curdosy of some of the things in your list, so don't push the limits to see if we could.

			Wow this is quite the post. All over a bit of weather control huh. Well, I personally believe that it can happen. Especially if all you people belive in Aerokinesis just being a sub-division of PK. That would mean you could do anything with PK, move clouds(hint hint), cool them down, create gusts of wind, etc.Now do I think we should do it, not. It would screw up the 'balance of nature'. Ill write more later I have to go to gym.
