			Hi, im 14, and totally new to this Tk thing,i thought id just have a look and see what its all about, well i tried the pinwheel a few hours after reading all the material on this site, and it spun quite fast, and i was like WHOA! But i thought that it might have been a draft or something, so i went and got one of those big see through mixing bowls, stuck it over the pinwheel, and it started moving right away, i also tried Tk with a pencil, and it slid right across my desk, not in te direction i hoped it would, but never the less, it moved. Im just wondering if anyone else has had these expieriences so early on in TK practice, because apparently it takes years to move a pencil???

			Lol, years to move a pencil.  No, not years, just lots of practice.  And everyone is different.  Some people, like urself, can do amazing things their first day (and even then, after the initial &quot;fun'' of it, they have to practice like everyone else <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> ).  Others have to practice day in day out.  
<br />

<br />
Congrats though!  But!  Dont expect to have that great ability without practice, you might not be able to do it just instantly like that... A lot of it has to do with excitement etc.

			Yes, a video would be awsome, and congrats on your success I could move the psi wheel my first day, not the direction I was hoping, well I was just trying to move it, but still it moved. But I'm still there due to on/offness in practicing, so practice, Practice, PRACTICE! Get the point? And congrats again.

Kinda like if I say I can create a lightning arc that is ultra powerful between my hands &quot; just an example&quot; and admittedly I've got some capabilities with electricity but it will probebly take me couple decades to get that advanced in electro pk alone.
