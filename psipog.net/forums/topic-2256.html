			I wrote this article like last year so i thought i would post it here. I wrote it and fyrehart did some grammar and stuff. I would like to hear your opinions.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I originally made this article because my friends that I practice with wanted me to explain the different types of Visualizations and how to do them.
<br />

<br />
First I?ll make some points. You don?t make Psi-balls or do telekinesis, your subconscious does it. Visualization is just a tool to tell your subconscious what you want to happen. Your brain is like your computer system. Your CPU is your brain and conscious mind and all the peripherals like cameras and scanners are other subconscious processes. The key board, mouse, or other input devices are your way of visualizing thoughts to tell your computer what to do, and the speakers and monitor are ways the computer communicates with you. When you type or move your mouse it sends a message to the computers program and the program displays a letter or moves the cursor on the screen. Now I?ll explain the different types of visualizations.
<br />

<br />
First there is the basic visualization method, it is just like a normal thought and I think we all know to do that, but in more difficult Psionic tasks you have to do more intense visualizations which take multiple types of visualizations at the same time. This is what I am here to talk about.
<br />

<br />
The second type, which is more complex, is called Tactile visualization. You know the sensation you have when you put your hand by your head with your eyes closed and you still know were it is even when you move it around? You can use the same principal to help visualize. It takes some practice but it is helpful. Try to recreate that feeling. Feel Psi coming out of your chest and circle around your arms. Do the same thing for the rest of your body just to get the hang of it. Then incorporate that in to your psychic training. It will take practice!
<br />

<br />
The third type is temperature visualization. This has similar to the one explained above. The key is to bring back memory of times you?ve been in were you were either very cold or hot. Try to recreate the experience as vividly as you can in your mind. This type of visualization is useful in doing Pyro-kinesis, Cryo-kinesis and changing temperature a psi-ball. I also find this useful for flaring psi-balls.
<br />

<br />
The next type I will explain is speed visualization. You use it to create the feeling of speed or something moving fast obviously. If you?ve ever played Need for Speed Underground then you know what the sensation is like. When I first tried started using speed visualization I used a visualization of a very fast convertible to try to get the feel for it. But now I use a method mentioned in Robert Peterson?s book on astral projection. You visualize your self (In first person) standing by a well. I use a well like in the movie The Ring. Then visualize your self fall in face first. Then as your falling try to feel the wind in your hair. Also try to recreate the feeling of the first drop on a roller coaster and make it a constant feeling. It helps me to visualize the walls of the well flying by.
<br />

<br />
It may take days, weeks, or even months, but I would highly suggest starting with Visualizations because if you are going to get into deeper realms of Psionics, you will need all the preliminary skills first. Although they aren't necessarilly a necessity, visualizations help TREMENDOUSLY!!!
<br />

<br />
That is all.

			Hi there Genoraven,
<br />

<br />
That is a nice article there. I agree that it is important to include more senses into your vidualisations tha just vision and images. The more alive and concrete you make your imagination, the better it will be transferred to reality, if wished for.

Thanks for sharing,
