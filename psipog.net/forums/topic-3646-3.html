<br />

<br />
Ah, someone who wants to argue with me. This should be fun. I don't know why you thought that debating me would benefit your statements but it's your choice. Let's get to it, shall we?
<br />

<br />
Over the years of being around the psionic community, I've seen countless members start their own psionic related web site. Do you know how many of those communities are still around? None. You're wasting your time role playing and basically bullshiting themselves. 
<br />

<br />
Starting this website is not going to benefit you nor it's members who you get to join. None of you have the required experience or skill to teach nor give advice on any psionic related ability. How dare you even say that you're qualified to begin teaching/assisting members with psionic related issues. You've been around for how long? Three months? Maybe four? Grow up, you're not ready to help manage your own psionics community.
<br />

<br />
Allow me to show everyone what one of the captains of this new community has stated in the past. These quotes were comments that you've made in the past concerning psionics as well as responsibilities.
<br />

<br />
1) Im too lazy. If anyone wants too, feel free to write them for me Very Happy .
<br />

<br />
2) Hey, Xiouslaidyn, how old are you now. Those voices might be talking about your age and something important happening to you or the world. And if you were trying to OBE, i would stop because the FOCUS FOCUS YES YES YES might be like (dont pick on me for saying this) an evil spirt trying to take over your body when you OBE. That would suck if it was. 
<br />

<br />
3) tastekinesis-taste objects from far away!
<br />

<br />
4) You are all so lucky im here Very Happy !
<br />

<br />
(just ingore &quot;ki&quot; and replace it with &quot;psi&quot;. Its the same thing.)
<br />

<br />
Do those comments look like they come from a mature moderator who has experience when dealing with psionics? No. Actually, those comments are quite humorous. Let's go over some comments that your &quot;leader&quot; has stated during his time here.
<br />

<br />
1) First of all, 2012 is bullshit, second: on the day of slayer, I'm going to fuck up any evil presenses that come my way. Third: Did you guys play Kingdom Hearts of something and then get scared? Because this sounds JUST like kingdom hearts to me, I hope this is real though, because I might get a keyblade.

It seems as if your captain is unable to remote view lost items without the help of other members. Yet, he is qualified enough to give advice on the subject? He didn't even give out coordinates! He has no idea what he is doing. How can someone who does not know anything about remote viewing or it's protocols have the right to teach and give advice to members?
<br />

<br />
Those are only a few reasons why I believe that none of you have the right or capability to start your own psionic related community and teach other members. Obviously your all hypocrites who's goal is to start your own community with the image of the boss. Like I said, you kids need to stop worrying about politics and start working on gaining actual skill.
<br />

<br />
You tell me you have skill, let's see it. Stop by the chat room at anytime and I'll be more than happy to work with you for a little bit. We also have a program that picks up on activity that energy gives off called the Geiger program. You say you have skill, prove it. I'm sick of hearing people bullshit around, show me that you have the ability/experience to be able to instruct other members. Like I said, anytime you wish and I'll be there.
<br />

<br />
I know I'm coming off as mean however, the truth is I'm simply looking out for you all. I don't want to see this group fall and quit like all the other communities started by members who wanted to break away from the community who've helped them and start there own. Take it from me, you will not benefit at all by doing this. 
<br />

<br />
Well, this rant is coming to it's conclusion. Please understand where I'm coming from and how I'm trying to help you. However, I'm going to make this clear right now. If you call me an idiot again, you and I will have a long talk based on respect. If at anytime anyone wishes to debate or discuss your new group, I will gladly participate. 
<br />

<br />
Take care.

First of all, im not the leader. I am a helper. The site was made so people could watch each other's backs and have fun. We are enjoying it and you are just trying to kill our mood about the site. It wasnt really all about 2012. There are other things on there to.
<br />

<br />
Quotes 1 and 3 were jokes. If you might have noticed... they both have Very Happy (which really is this &quot;<img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />&quot;, not &quot;Very Happy&quot; I didnt mean i was happy... the smiley looked like he was smiling about a joke. Thats why i put them there.
<br />

<br />
Quote 2 was just my crazy idea on something. I was just trying to help someone out, which shows that i would be nice enough to do so, unlike you who would just try to break up other forums and such.
<br />

<br />
Quote 4... i hate this one and really regret saying this. Many people dont understand what i meant. I meant that they explain it as ki, but i think it is also possible with psi.
<br />

<br />
You didnt happen to get any quotes on what i did for people that was nice and the things i did right. There were 4 quotes there... 2 of which were serious. so 2 out of 233 (after this post, 234) isnt bad. Everyone makes mistakes.
<br />

<br />
And if you dont want to see this group &quot;fall and quit&quot;, then stop annoying us about it... and if you are worried, let it go...

			Honestly, I dont have any qualms with anyone from psipog, just the fact that there are a lot of little kids in here.  But, that isn't a huge issue really, just kind of an annoyance.
<br />

<br />
I dont have any qualms with the mod's here.  I think Roy has his bad days (most are <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> jk) and JoeT, u are (just as Roy is) very knowledgeable.  I would like to think that I am still welcomed here even though there is &quot;hostility&quot; between these two forums.  I did post something in the forums there &quot;about Roy&quot; but that was for a suggestion, I do not necessarily feel that &quot;allowing Roy to join so that you can fuck with him&quot; is a great idea!  It was more or less a joke.  Hopefully you didn't take offense to that.  I didn't mean for you to.
<br />

<br />
I personally joined the forum over there because I think it is going to be a huge help to my personal development of psionics.  I am the &quot;Vice Captain&quot; of Dreams (i.e. OBE'ers), yet I haven't OBE'ed yet.  I practice about 3 - 5 hours a day to do so though.  It is like the basketball/football/baseball coach that never played the sport...they have a LOT of knowledge, just haven't actually engaged in the actual event.  
<br />

<br />
Anyways,  I still stop by psipog and post and am an active member trying to help myself and others here.  I would hope that you wouldn't look at me as though I am some sort of infectious irradiated rat scampering through the cyber world of psipog <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  
<br />

<br />
BTW though, I am not dumb, stupid, or being &quot;lead by the blind&quot;.  I am extremely intelligent (  IQ-135 <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> ).  I am not a child either.  
<br />

<br />
Hopefully my being involved in MPW-13 doesn't estrange me from anyone at psipog.  I enjoy this community, and this is where I started at.  
<br />

<br />
THANKS!

Kaiandy, being affiliated with another website does not mean you will be treated as an outcast. However, the personal attacks on Roy's character that have taken place on the forums are simply not called for. If someone insults one of our members, then comes back acting all cutesy-poo homeboy friendly, expect to be on the receiving end of a verbal lashing. Being a dick is one thing. Being two-faced is another, and not one that is tolerated.
<br />

<br />
For the record, this isn't a personal attack on yourself. Just posting it here to get it out of the way. There's no offense meant.

			I never demeaned Roy.  Or any other admin.  I am not being &quot;two-faced&quot; I was actually trying to show that just because one or two people of the forum may hold grudges against one or two people here, doesn't mean that everyone there feels the same way.  As I said, I didn't mean to offend Roy, or anyone else for that matter, in my post at mpw-13.  As I said, I meant it more as a joke.

			Being involved on a another site is actually quite common here. I think ive heard Sean say that hes a member of various forums, or that he used to be. You guys probably would have been fine if you were just another psionics forum. The personal attacks on Roy didnt help your forums status either. If everyone on that site do not take it seriously, then you cannot expect other people to take you seriously either.

			On the Advice of the mod's. i have decided to leave MPW-13.
<br />
i feel that the forums have become a bit too Unprofessional for my tastes, and i feel that i still have much to learn. for this reason, i'm not going to log onto MPW-13 anymore. anyone requesting a Signature off me can kindly PM me from this site.
<br />
I've also apologised to roy and smoothed over the matter of what i said/wrote on the &quot;roy is jealous&quot; part of the MPW-13 Forums. for those who it concerns. i was having a bad day. and made some admittedly shitty posts without, as it so clearly says in this forum &quot;<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Be Intelligent</span></span>&quot;
<br />
there's my two cents on the matter.
<br />
Apologies for any inconvenience.
<br />
(i would have said i was leaving over at the mpw13 forums, if they weren't f***ed up
