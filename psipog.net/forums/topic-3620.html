			well as many of you know school desks can sometimes be slight slanted instead of just perfectly straight. Today I had an empty bottle and stood it up right on my desk (yes it was a slanted one). Well, if you tap the bottle it will continue regular movement all the down the desk, woddling back and forth not falling. As a test I wanted to try tk on it. While it was woddling I was able to slide it, and at times it seemed it was almost about to levitate. I want to try to re-create this at home but I don't know how benefical this practice could be.
<br />

<br />
So what I'm really asking is affecting objects already in motion benefical? Because if the object is already in motion it seems no matter the task it is easier. Or should you just stick to the old way.

			It could be beneficial. Think of it as sort of a half-step up from rolling objects instead of a whole one, since the object is already in motion. It might also be better for your subconscious, because you're cementing it in your mind that you can move objects with pk.

			I have experienced this as well.  It was a pan at work that i tapped and began to wobble, so I watched it.  it stopped after a few seconds.  I tapped it to get it to wobble again and began pk.  It wobbled for quite some time.

Yeah sometimes if I can focus I'll give my psiwheel a little tap then start spinning it at a normal rate.

			thats cool. I just found out, or just altered my method, that when I try to levitate it and combine an action like sliding or rolling or spinning it will happen faster or happen for the first time. And I know most of you have experience this as well.
