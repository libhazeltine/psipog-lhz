			Ok, yesterday a friend of mine was sick and i figured i might as well try healing her. but since desease is of course caused by germs, which are living beings (exept virus's) healing would just be temporary till the dammage recurres.
<br />

<br />
so, i desided to make up a way to do heal it, and came up with, make a psi ball, with red psi (represents heat if i remmember right) and tell it to kill the HARMFUL germs in the persons body, and threw in the whole draw from where to keep going, and when to stop, and that stuff.
<br />

<br />
she said it made her feel better. but i tend to go for spread results, in case it was a one hit wonder. if anyone wants to try it out and post the results if it works, it'd be apreciated.
<br />

<br />

<br />
by the way NO FORGETTING TO SPECIFY HARMFUL GERMS!!! i'm serious about that, there is bacteria living in your stomach that helps the digestive system, and you do not need to be killing them off, or you'll cause much more harm than good.
<br />

<br />
thank you ^^

			I'll give it a try after I work on my energy control a bit, I tend to put too much psi in everything I do, especially with psiballs... but it sounds like a useful ability, so next time I'm sick I'll try it out.

			I used that on a really bad ear infection during the summer.  It was the worst one my doctor had ever seen, and it was really pissing me off, so I created a psiball and programmed it, like you did, to kill the harmful germs in my ear.  I can't tell if it would have worked, though, because I had to give up.  I have this thing where I can &quot;hear&quot; energy fields (tv's make a really high-pitched, loud noise that I can hear but most other people can't, same with metal detectors, even when they're not beeping).  So the combination of a really loud, high noise and a very bad ear infection was a bit too much for me and I had to give up.  Afterwards, I haven't had an oppertunity to try it again.

			Vyaschlofisc, I know what you mean with the t.v. noises and all.  I was diagnosed with sever hearing loss when I was 15 months old.  I never thought about using a psi ball on my ears though but I think you may be right about it affecting hearing.  The buzzing is from the rapid vibrations in the air.  Ironically when I lost part of my hearing I gained the ability to 'feel' vibrations from high pitched (fast moving) waves of energy, sound, etc.
<br />

<br />
Maybe there's a way to control what you hear using the psi ball.  
<br />

<br />
P.S. my doc said that what I hear is the result of damage caused by loud noises.  and to be frank I don't agree with him, because i can adjust the buzzing a little by thinking about it.
<br />

<br />
Oh and Galdon I will definately try your idea on my friend (he has really bad sinus flares)
<br />

<br />
thanks

			I've heard of certain cultures that used their healing &quot;power&quot; as replace ments for known remedies and medicine so I'm not surprised that you are able to do this if you did, I've done it on myself and never been sick from viruses and bacterial diseases for a while.
<br />

<br />
BTW, I'm trying to advoid fancy words because I don't know how to spell them and don't feel like bothering to figure out the spelling.
