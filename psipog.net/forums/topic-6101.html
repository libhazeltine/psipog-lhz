			Ok, first the construct, I was thinking about what I would do for my first one and I came up with this, a construct that blocks radio signals.  I was always facinated with the phrase, &quot;technically non-lethal&quot; from the show Techwars, and this kinda in keeping with that, someone might think, &quot;What is the worse that you could do with a construct not designed to be offensive&quot; 
<br />

<br />
At first I wanted to make one that would drain electricity so that I could study without having to worry about someone talking on the phone in the library, but then I thought, &quot;I can't test that on my phone, not being my first construct, what if I drain the memory, also then I have to look for the battery on someone else's phone, too much work&quot; I figure at worst with something like this I could easily just put the whiole bubble over their phone without having to worry about where the battery is. 
<br />

<br />
Next the questions: How long did it take you guys to do your first construct and what method did you use ? just concentrate and visualize ? 
<br />

<br />
Do you like any particular colors better than others for reasons other than astetic  ? ( I think of makeing this one green and also programing it to block other types of EM radiation but starting with radio <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Any ideas for how this could be done ? I was thinking just of putting my phone down on a table in front of me, visualize and see how long it takes for me to make the signal bars go down... 
<br />

<br />
Last but not least, I have noticed that I can use a tiny bit of Kundalini energy to generate a very strong shield around me has anyone else experimented with this? Kinda weird though because while it is active the Kundalini area just under the tailbone tingles and I'm affraid to overuse it if possible for fear that the energy will back flow and hurt like hell &quot;anyone whose raised Kundalini energy for first time knows its painful, like your being electricuted, with slow waves of muscle spasms going up the spine.

			Alright just a question but how does this kundalini energy work? I havent read much but I tried to use it in reiki last night and ended up without any pain at all but I was completely drained in about 5 seconds after that I had a huge stomach ache all night and earlier today the stomache ache started again and both times had an emotional feeling to it like butterflies in your stomache do you know what is happening?
<br />

<br />
okay anyways i'll answere some questions
<br />

<br />
First construct took me about 2 min and all i did was visualize.
<br />
I usually think blue because its my favorite color.

			I hate that feeling from Kundalini but back to your questions...
<br />

<br />
My first construct was just to warm my leg and I prefer a flaming orb....but I usually associate colors with certain things just to help me program it correctly..

			My first construct was a warmth shield... it kept me warm in winter (duh...).  To make it I envision a green flame eminating from my chest and expanding into a shape much like the bubble shield, but with the green flames on the exterior.  When I envision it, it is mostly tactile, meaning I &quot;feel&quot; it expanding from my chest area.
<br />

<br />
I usually visualize a green liquid kind of thing, it's hard to explain.  Its mostly tactile for me though.
<br />

<br />
Blocking radio signals I think is beyond me though, but I would probably go along the routes of shielding the object from radio wavelenghts somehow.

			I think I'm of a pretty good mind set to begin hitting it hard, hehe one thing though is that DMIL practice on the eye color change makes my iris' feel funny hopefully once I reach the color I'm shooting for they will feel normal again.  By funny I mean tingleing: hold your breath until you can't hold it any longer, then release and take a huge deep breath, and that feeling in your head, is what the iris' of my eyes feel like constantly. 
<br />

<br />
I'm going through a little crisis though, because I don't know how to feel radio waves obviously... that makes it difficult to imagine how to program it into a psi ball.... but the hardest part, is the start.
<br />

<br />
So that you won't have to ask.. I am trying a few things that I haven't seen before.. 
<br />

<br />
1. Using a peridot for the desired color.
<br />
2. No mirror, I haven't actually looked directly in one for 2 weeks 
<br />
3. I do this exercise two to three times a day. morning, afternoon and bedtime.
<br />

<br />
the only indication I have at the moment is that one... the tingleing in my iris' is stronger by the day, even when I wake up in the middle of the night, I can still feel it, two my own inner image of myself has changed, I used to have to imagine the color change, now I ssee it in my &quot;mind's eye&quot; without imagining.

			You don't have to know what radio waves feel like to make it... Just do visual visualization instead of tactile visualization. Like, visualize radio signals coming from a radio tower, and then visualize them bouncing off the construct... perhaps visualize it being made of something that you mentally associate with blocking radio waves (and/or other such energy, for example, I would use lead), and make it really thick and solid, since most people would mentally associate that with being able to block things out better.
<br />

<br />
To answer your other question, the first construct I made was a simple warm psi-ball, it took maybe a minute to make it (keep in mind I didn't shell it). To make it, I simply visualized the psi as looking like fire, and I used a little tactile visualization as well, along with trying to 'will' it to be hot.
