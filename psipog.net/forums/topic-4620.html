			About a week ago, I had a serious nightmare. It was of a dog, looked like a cross between a German Shepard and a Pitbull, that was attacking me.  First, it began biting the hell out of my feet, so my natural reaction (wasn't lucid yet) was to kick the thing in the face. It became enraged and lunged for my crotch.  After it sank its teeth in, I became pretty lucid, because it didn't hurt.  
<br />
It just caused my natural instincs to go into overdrive, and I had that jump-backwards reflex going crazy.  I still didn't think of killing the damn thing so I used a technique that, after several nightmares, I learned. This was how to forcefully eject from a dream.  I used this since the dog wouldn't let go. It succeeded, but my reflex was still going, and I jumped back, halfway across the bed, almost hitting the edge.
