I wonder though, do you see the mind only as a flaw? as something bad? This is important to know because if you <span style="font-style: italic">judge</span> the mind, than you are <span style="font-style: italic">in</span> the mind, for the only thing that judges things <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> the mind.
<br />

<br />
Thats why I said to Somefatguy that he should not hate his intelligence, for it is intelligence that made him hate intelligence. So it makes no sense to hate it and neither is it beneficial to hold such judgements towards any part of yourself or other selves for that matter. 
<br />

<br />
But I'm pretty sure you figured that out LB. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

We should talk more. I want to know how you are doing and what new process has started in your life, if any. It's just that I sense some positive change on your evolutionary process so to say. Sorry if it sounds new-age :p.

Anyway, we should talk some time.

Well ya he was the one who coined it over the radio, even though he rejected it. I was sort of talking about who thought up the idea. But I didnt know that and greatly enjoy this information. Thank you. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

I guess people may not have known who gave the idea. But still dear Geroge must have been liked by his community for his theory.

Just my opinion in the matter, but I'm stating a fact. (J.K. Eldibs.) 
<br />

<br />
First of all, if there wasn't anything around before the big bang, but people say chemicals made the big bang happen, then where did the chemicals come from? Even more specific. Where did the bang come from? If there wasn't anything there, where the bang come from. I was just saying because the big bang is wrong, in my terms.

			No one thinks that chemicals caused the big bang because as you said, chemicals didn't exist.  The best guess we have for describing the creation of the universe is M-theory, which still is totally unproven.  It states that membranes of 3D space such as our own universe collided and resulted in a massive explosion within the space of the branes.  As this explosion of epic proportions took place, matter and anti-matter were being created, then destroying each other (as is their nature.  Somehow, in the first few tiny moments of the big bang, the creation of matter got a tiny bit faster than the creation of antimatter, and so not enough antimatter was available to destroy all of the matter anymore.  The matter built up and became the universe within our brane that we know today.  See, no chemicals involved <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Personally, I don't see why string theorists rule out the existence of anything within our brane before the explosion, but I haven't seen the math (and couldn't comprehend it if I did lol) and so can't really say whether or not we know if anything existed before the big bang.

Many might not see empty space as a creation, but space really is a manifestation already.

			All matter, space and time were apparently formed in the big bang. In which the universe expanded at a ridiculous rate and etc. I forgot the details but the resulting planetary bodies in our universe and other galaxies were formed due to an inbalance in matter and anti-matter which cancelled out and destroyed each other. Since there were 1,000,001 matter particles for every 1,000,000 anti-matter particles the matter particles won out and we have all existing matter today that has been here since the big bang.

If we have artificial intelligence, then what has true intelligence?

If you put someone into pure darkness, they may not actually ask for light, and that is the same for food.

			Okay...first of all...where the heck did you hear someone who said chemicals created the big bang!?
<br />

<br />
Second..from what I have read the theorists don't even bother to try to come up what happen before the big bang. Because that evidence would have been destroy during the big bang. I could go on but I think were falling behind about talking about intelligence......overall I just heard the same thing from all of you 3 times in a row.
<br />

<br />
Now next to psiready reply....you don't really seem to have much confidense in other people abilities. Just my opinion of cource.
<br />

<br />
Also about this talk about searching for the light makes me think you might have gotten it from the movie &quot;I Robot&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Some of what you have said does match the princples of living creatures. But one of the things that tend to seperate humans from animals is that there personalities exist. Like all things there are common grounds for personalities, but like all things there are odd balls. Such as laughing at someones funeral instead of crying.
<br />

<br />
I guess on some grounds that didn't really help.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I also guess you already try to take everything such as emotions and intelligence to put it into a way that can match any machine?
<br />

<br />
I already guess that you might just think giving &quot;Grace&quot; seems silly?
<br />

<br />
Its not like everyone corrects there error's but rather to choose to correct them or not. Personaly I wouldnt look for the light just right away. I sort of like the darkness and close places because it makes me feel like I'm in a cacoon. Not everyone ask for food either, some have eating disorders and don't want to get fat.
<br />

<br />
If humans are predictable then perhaps we wouldn't have all the problems you think we been having? Simply because were machines that are actions can be easily be answer before they happen. Normaly this is true.
<br />

<br />
I know none of this helps, and I think you may just be looking at me with a sad/angry look. So I'm just going to ask you a question.
<br />

<br />
How much confidense do you have in this world?
<br />

<br />
I think MA here can do a better job then I just did.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

How much confidence do you have in you? How could I ever be better at expressing something that is entirely yours? 
<br />

<br />
As for your question: I have alot of confidence in the world. Alot. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I can already see the bright enlightened future caused by mankind starting to connect and express their lives from the loving source within. Many will connect with it in the upcoming years. I repeat: Many!
<br />

<br />
Things will change drastically, not in a good way not in a bad way, but brighter, higher, possibly more pleasant. Many of us will hit new levels of existence. Can't wait <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.

1: That was Zemeon's statement, I agree it's completely ludicrous.

2: M-theory only attempts to explain the process that birthed a universe filled with matter.  I was simply presenting an alternative to Zemeon's bizarre claims about the creation of our universe, not the creation of everything (since each brane is a universe unto itself).

Psiready: People are only so robotic and predictable if they choose to be.  Most choose a feeling of false security from the inevitable changes in life and live on a sort of autopilot.  They give over their lives to their subconscious to protect them and remain in a child-like state rather than learning and growing.  This isn't the only option for how one must live though, and spotaneous, expressive, intelligent people do exist. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I was merely stating that the principle of the brain is that. The subject of what the brain learns has an infinite amont of variations.

Confidence? What OF confidence? Robots are fine from my point of view as long as they're consistent. This world is one big robot in which if you know this nothing surprises you.

See, observe yourselves. If I make such a radical statement then you will retaliate. Arguing with your own theories, or if not, simply go that direction by basically restating what the previous person said but not going out of bounds.
