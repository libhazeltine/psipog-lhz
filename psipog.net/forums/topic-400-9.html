But the FIRST time that they actually feel better is by draining energy from someone.  And the only time after that is when they drain energy.  Another interesting point is in order to do this, one must learn how to do it.  They seem to know how to do it instictivly.  Now, if for the first time they ever drain energy and they feel better, that tells us something.  They also didn't practice this until it happened, it just happenend.  Put two and two together, and it just makes sense...or at least points us in that direction.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Another incredible thing the mind does is it filters it's own feelings, memories, etc. and turn them into perceptions.  You can ask a depressed person what her entire life was like and she won't be able to tell you any significant highlights.  A euphoric person won't see any downside to the occurences in his life.  We filter based on our moods and beliefs.  So when someone says &quot;I'm a psivamp.  I know because I always felt like crap until I fed.&quot;  I would bet a fortune that they've filtered their memories based on that perception.
<br />

<br />
As for the innate ability to vamp, that's a mystery that's very easily solved.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Anyone can do it!</span>  Read it again because I know it greatly contradicts with what you've been told.  We all exchange energy with every interaction on a very subtle level.  &quot;Energy&quot; is very closely related to &quot;attention&quot; in this context.  Like in a conversation where one person is doing all the talking.  They're the one who is expending energy in the conventional sense by talking while the other is silently listening, but the listener becomes drained because they've focused their attention on the talker.
<br />

<br />
When people become or are born slightly more aware, they become conscious of this exchange.  Now even if the person doesn't have a need to take energy, they will notice an improvement in their state when they do one of those innocuous, subtle thefts of energy.  So they think they have a need for it rather than dealing with their underlying emotions problems that are causing them to not feel great about their lives, themselves, etc.  Combined with the herd mentality of wanting to be in a special group, voila.  You now have a self-proclaimed psivamp who believes they've been one since birth.
<br />

<br />
As for the rest of your post, I think I can clear up the misunderstanding there quite easily.  I never said coming off as an expert was bad or that you were taking advantage of anyone.  But people tend to gravitate to and agree with people who seem to know what their talking about because of a herd mentality.  It's not the expert's fault if others mindlessly agree with him, nor is it exploitation.  However it's not logically sound to use the fact that a bunch of unknowledgeable people agree with an &quot;expert&quot; on the subject as a measure of it's correctness.  I think we can agree on that.

			Grow up a little bit, in a few years, you'll have totally different opinion.

Not to judge on age - but some things can be.  Easily.
<br />

<br />
Try getting willing fed from by a psi vamp and see if anything bad happens - outside of philsophy - try experience.  And open your mind a little.

If you don't have any interest - you shouldn't be posting on this thread.
<br />

I mthink you misjudge people because of their age - you probably have only met the lame ass people to claim to be this or that for attention.  Not everyone is like that.  Have the emotional maturity to admit you don't know everything.

I certainly would if I was meandering around life aimlessly but that period in my life has past and served it's purpose.  Everything is a learning experience.  That one just seems to be a harder lesson for the people on this planet so they've decided it's simply a fact of life you can't escape <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Done it willingly a few times.  Had it done to me unwillingly far more often of course.  But I've learned to correct my bodily energies quite significantly so I avert any effects like what I had experienced earlier on in my life.  I used to become terribly sick and weak due to feeding from specific individuals.  Once I found that they were causing blockages as well as draining me of energy I learned to clear such blockages to an extent.  Thus I can avoid the symptoms of encountering &quot;hungry&quot; psivamps for the most part.

I've met vamps of many ages, ethnicities, religions and beliefs as well as those of varying genders, financial levels of success, etc.  I don't claim to know everything, but there are certain topics I know quite a bit about.  This happens to be one of them.  Condescending things such as &quot;putting me in my place&quot; via my percieved ignorance will not change that.

			Ok, I just have one more thing to say, mainly because this topic isn't going anywhere, and I'm sure you'll agree with me on this Lightbringer, I have better things to do  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
This last thing I will say, is something to think about&#058;
<br />

<br />
Psychology doesn't explain everything.  Physics don't explain everything.  No science explains everything.  There are things unexplainable by science, and I think that for the time being this is one of them.  You may ask how psychology fits into this, well, you seem to tie psi-vampirism with psychology.  Which is fine and good, but some things can't be explained through scientific means.  I understand that this site is very &quot;scientific oriented&quot; but we are allowed to think outside the box.  That's what psionics is, afterall.  Most scientists deny the existance of psionics, but we all know first hand that they are wrong.  Apparently there are people who, through the scientific route, deny the existance of psi-vamps, or try to put psychological labels on them.  Couldn't it be possible, or VERY possible, that this is something you have to experience first hand in order to believe in it?  Much like psionics?  
<br />

<br />
You and me aren't vamps.  We don't know for sure what it is, or why it happens, or if they are really following the theories proving their existance as the beings they are.  Maybe we have to actually be psi-vamps in order to understand, or believe.  That's a point I've been trying to get across, but couldn't quite word it right.  There are a couple people I know that blatenly denied the existance of psionics, but when I ran them through a few energy manipulation exercises, they fully believed.  I'm not saying that it's wrong to be skeptical, but to be so skeptical that you disregard any possibility that proves the exsitance of something is quite stupid (not trying to offend you).  
<br />

<br />
This is a very strange world we live in.  We don't know everything about it yet, in fact, I think we don't even know a full 1% of anything about the world.  It is very unwise to shut off some of these doors (information, possibilities) of something we barely know anything about.  At least soak up some of the things I have just said, and think to yourself.  We can't deny the existance of something we don't even know about, and may never know about since we aren't experiencing it first hand.  We can't just slap on a few psychological labels on something, especially since science can't prove everything.  That's what science is about after all, not knowing.  Not knowing so that we can find out.  We haven't found out anything yet, so we can't come to conclusions.  At least consider the possibilities before you start shutting the doors.  (again, not trying to offend you)
