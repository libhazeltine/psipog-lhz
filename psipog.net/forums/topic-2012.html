			When you leave your body, you inhabit a different sort of body. Has anyone considered the idea that maybe this body is made of electromagnetic radiation, or light. But not visible light, invisible light. So the frequency of the wave is high, maybe even higher than gamma radiation. Could there be whole dimensions made of higher frquency light?

			Hmmm I've thought about OBE-bodies just being psionic constructs. I don't believe you actually leave your body, rather, a construct moves around feeding information to your brain, giving the effect that you've left your body.
<br />

<br />
Just my opinion/idea =).

			You can do that, actually. But without sleep paralysis or altered states of consciousness, it wouldn't be very &quot;real&quot; feeling. You'd be clouded by input from the other five senses.

			If the OBE body is a construct or radiation, then you shouldn't go near black holes (tried it during RP, sucked bad). Also, I think you might be on to something. The OBE body could be made of <span style="font-style: italic">something</span>. We should continue studying it <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> .

			Your astral body, or the body you inhabit during OBE is made of the same stuff as you are in your physical body. Nothing.
<br />

<br />
It is pure energy/light/psi vibrating a certain frequency which creates and sustains its existance. It does not only exist when you go OBE, but all the time. 
<br />

<br />
This astral body is a higher vibration of your true self. If you choose to go OBE than this is is the state you are in; yet you still exist in your physical body as well.
<br />

<br />
Grounding your astral body in your physical body will result in greater peace and clarity. How long since you have taken a step, grounded in your physical body?
<br />

<br />
The astral body, the body of OBE, the plane of death, exist in the 4th dimension.
<br />

<br />
Understand, the experience of the physical, astral, light, or unified bodies are only available to the 'mind'. While you experience these different realities, know they all exist purely as your state of conciousness.

			Studies show that OBEs can be created by stimulating the right parts of the brain. It's nothing more than illusion (for a lack of me caring to put it into better words). Just your mind tricking you. This will bring up plenty of questions... like &quot;lolomg! But I metz0rz pplz in ma' OBE! Hw kan I do dat!?&quot;

Simply put... I've yet to see a _single_ OBE which cannot be explained as an overactive imagination and or false memories

			I've had an OBE that can't be explained by overactive imagination/false memories <a href="../blog/2005/11/awesome-obe.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.psipog.net/blog/2005/11/awesome-obe.html</a>.  Plenty of OBEs have been documented by Robert Monroe that also break that mold, specifically you might like to read his first book, Journeys Out of the Body.  In it he talks about multiple experiences that he strictly tests against the imagination/hallucination/false memory theory.

Do you have any links handy for said studies? (No need to go out of your way, I'm just curious as to what they say...)

However, the radiation is a far-fetched idea. Pretty creative <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  it's just that with the electro-magnetic spectrum, there is only a small portion of the spectrum that is light. Anything lower or higher is not light, it is invisible radio waves. And gamma radiation is such a high level of radiation, if your ethereal body was made up of that high of a level of radiation, it would probably harm you and the environment around your astral body. And as for the over active imagination theory, maybe you should actually try inducing an OBE, because you start feeling really wierd crap before you are actually asleep........ You don't feel it in your mind, YOU CAN FEEL YOUR BODY STARTING TO VIBRATE UNCONTROLLABLY. I don't think I have enough imagination to completely imagine that.

No, mostly because electromagnetic radiation tends to move at the speed of light, not stay in one place.
<br />

<br />
I'll keep my theory to myself, mostly because I'm still trying to figure out how to articulate it. Don't worry, it involves higher dimensions, vibrating energy/matter a la string theory, and multiple universes - enough oddities and theoretical possibilities to keep any sci-fi buff entertained.

			Or what if the frequency of light is high enough to the point where it does not actually have to move? Does anyone know the Quantum or Quantom (not sure how to spell it) thoery? I think (and if that is not the name of it then this has a different name but is a real acceptable theory). The thoery or proof (not sure if this has been proven yet) that the reason we can not reach absolute zero is because atoms are belived to be made up of something smaller, Quantums (lol not sure if this is the real name but I know that they are made of something). Basically when there is motion there is heat. The thoery is that these &quot;Quantums&quot; are always moving in AND OUT of the atom and that they pop up in random places of the universe every second, if you will (it's probly shorter than that). Basically in a different term, they teleport or move possibly between dimensions (because I cant see any other way) and eventually end back into ours (possibly the forth since that is belived to be time). Then another Quatum replaces the other one eventually. This , if teleportation is real for people, may be an answer to how it works. AND maybe the reason we feel all of those vibrations is because we have controlled every atom or quantum to start vibrating to the point where they are all syncronized (I can't spell very well) and we are able to escape from are bodies. Im not sure if what I said about the thoery is completely correct but it is really close. And I think all religions belive we have a spirit except Athiesm so I'm going to make an opionized statement. If we have spirits and have a mind capable of so many possibilites such as telekinesis, which would actually seem more unbeleiveable than this, then why can't we control the spirit, or soul, or astral body, or whatever kind of body you want to call it that can be different for some people? After all it is in a sense our core. Are true being. Telekinesis seems more fake than this because telekinesis is not a natural part of us that everyone is born with but it is still real if we practice it. Anyways if I have offended anyone in any way then I am sorry and I did not mean to. This is just all one big thoery and has not been proven yet. I am just &quot;putting two and two together.&quot;
<br />
And another thing if we are still controled by our brain when we have an OBE then how do people die and go to heaven? Eventually the brain rots but the spirit is still there.
