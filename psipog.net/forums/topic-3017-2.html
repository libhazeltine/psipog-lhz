And to flames (I think), actualy, it's not umbrakinesis (lay of the fluff terms, mods get pissed apparently), that would be shadow movement, if it was a real term. However, there is a term for what you're descibing. It's called shadowing. Look it up.

what about making the waves of light pass through your body instead of relfecting?  or just absorbing the light?  you could take your bodies natural electric field to attract the light (electromagnetic waves) and just absorb it into your body.  this would keep the light from reflecting into others eye's, and you can program a sheild to do this.  would that make you invisible, or just a shadowy figure?

this topic got me on an interesting idea.  when making a psi-ball, if you can somehow program it to have a reflective surface that reflects light, can you make it visible???</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

That's basically what I'm saying. Just allow the light to pass through you completely without reflecting ANY back and you should be completely invisible. I am surprised no one has rejected my theory yet. Perhaps it is too complex for them! Lol. Just kidding.

Well, that would make you a shadowy figure because your stopping light completely and removing it therefore giving the viewer a blind spot or w/e where you are standing (sitting ect.) But bending light around you makes the veiwer see the light when it gets reflected back and goes around where you are standing, thus the veiwer still see's everything (even behind you !)  else except the small area where you are standing. Thus you become invisible to the naked eye.

			lol ive had so many plans for actual invisibility projects.  funny thing is that i know nothing of light properties yet most of my ideas are actually already being somewhat thought of by the government before i know they are.
<br />

<br />
try making a psi ball that splits into MILLIONS of lil balls about a millimeter in length and have them surround  yourself with them and have them do these actions
<br />

<br />
&quot;reflect light to light reflected by (either adjacent bubble or bubble that is exact opposite [as in front to back] im not sure which is right)

i think being a shadowy figure would be cooler than being invisible...but maybe not as useful.  on the plus side of absorbing the light, the light reflecting off of objects still reaches your eyes and enables you to see, where as bending the rays keeps them from reaching your eyes and makes you &quot;blind.&quot;

Ah, so that's what you meant. You are saying that light rays would curve behind you and bounce back to the beholder's eye allowing them to see what's behind the invisible person. Yes, that is the only way I can see how that would work. But I do not agree with your view on my theory of light passing through a person. Light passes through glass and makes the glass almost (dirt, smudges, some is reflected back) invisible, I do not see why this would not work with people.

Edit: This got me thinking, about what kind of natural forces the shield can protect you from, heck, even protect you from light or bend it around you.
<br />
If anyone has any experiance in advanced shield conjuring, i would like you to try making a shield that bend light around you.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I don't really have any comments on the anti-gravity shield, as I've not heard of it being done before. But as for a cloak shield, I've often used shields that have used telepathic suggestion (not really bending light around me, sorry. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />) to get people to completely ignore me. It's the closest thing to pure invisibility that I can manage. Haha
