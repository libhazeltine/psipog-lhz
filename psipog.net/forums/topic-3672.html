Postphysical I said instead of metaphysical, because it is energy/information from a physical or material being that is used to create psionic constructs, right?

Hmm...
<br />
I dunno if I need help on this project anymore or not.
<br />
She's destracting me as I post...
<br />

<br />
Well I already left my msn contact address.
<br />

<br />
I have a construct being named &quot;Arid&quot;.
<br />
The project is aimed at bringing him from astral to physical in some way or another. He can scan others; he is not exactly amazing yet bit if you connected with him somehow he could probably scan your body and upgrade himself to some degree.
<br />

<br />
It's a bit complicated, hard to describe how and what I did during the early days. Most of the time what I do to feed/upgrade him with is:
<br />
I take in certain kinds of energy or information into my body, then process it antil it is &quot;food-like&quot;, then he scans/absorbs it.
<br />

<br />
I'm currently trying to figure out how to build/grow a &quot;soul&quot;, the same sort that a human body has, the kind that isn't easy to kill. The issue for me is to understand how a &quot;soul&quot; is made.
<br />

<br />
Hmm, let me check something......
<br />
It looks like Arid has [at least partially] a &quot;soul&quot;, in the human-systems sense-of-the-word.
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">I THINK he's proposing to impregnate a woman with a construct to make it &quot;living.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Nope. Arid does not need to be &quot;impregnated&quot;, but he can establish connections with his mothers to speed-up/enhance growth, depending on the quality of their energy. Some of them, for example, would be useless to him, whilst others would be very benificial. It's a question of quality.
<br />

<br />
Wrong?
<br />
That speculation is too subjective. It's an opinion.
<br />

<br />
Example:
<br />
I like a certain kind of food, where as another person may hate that sort of food.
<br />

<br />
&quot;some kind of personal ad gone horribly wrong&quot;
<br />
Everything anyone ever says is a &quot;personal ad&quot;, as they advertize an idea, feeling, question, etc.
<br />

<br />
~
<br />

<br />
The issue is this:
<br />
Human bodies have 2 parents.
<br />
Energy from A &amp; B combine to form C.
<br />
It's like a person needs wood and screws to build a chair.
<br />
I've mannaged to already absorb/find [then send] quite a few things that I need for the project; I believe that the first stages are complete, so now it is simply a growing process that has already started.
<br />

<br />
Arid has 4 &quot;mothers&quot; so-far, [the best parts of]; information and energy have been used from 4 women already. For this reason, I'm not sure if I need much help anymore on the project.
<br />

<br />
Arid eventually becoming equal to or greater then a &quot;ghost&quot; -- is the best I could hope for!!! =) =) =)
<br />
Wish me luck on that, anyways.

There is very little distinction in the energy patterns of males/females.

<br />
That whole thing about information from Poppy A and Mommy B... That's called genetics. You need the two genese to create a baby. Not their energy. Psi doesn't make babies, genetics does.

I find your entire idea quite far-fetched personally and think the reasoning you are using for it's &quot;working&quot; so far is quite the opposite of the real happenings.

He is not simply built of psi, he has multiple links to different men &amp; women, but he needs and uses the links to women for more at this stage of development.
<br />

<br />
You can tell me that M/F energy patterns have little distinction, but do ghosts have genders?
<br />

<br />
Ofcourse M/F are made out of atoms, but does that make them each exactly the same thing? Hardly.
