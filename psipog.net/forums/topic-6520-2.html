			At last, I finally have some time. Here goes nothing:
<br />

<br />

<br />
1. Like everyone else- fix the environment:
<br />
ensure the eternal protection and regulation of the environment.
<br />

<br />
2. People would not need jobs and would not need money because I would give everyone machines (which would be small handheld devices) that allow them to make anything they want appear; but of course there would be safety precautions against misuse that I’m not going to bother go into.
<br />

<br />
3. Also, I would have to somehow control population growth, maybe just with influence; it would be one of the greatest challenges to do humanely!
<br />

<br />
4. Hunting would banned except for in virtual reality games, which would be one the most fun things about my world.
<br />

<br />
5. Violence in the real world simply would not happen.
<br />

<br />
6. Prisons would not exist; criminals would be healed psychologically.
<br />

<br />
7. Same goes with mental asylums.
<br />

<br />
8. Hospitals wouldn’t be necessary, everyone would be able to heal instantly with a command word or something.
<br />

<br />
9. Everyone would be granted the ability to use psionics with ease; again, abuse wouldn’t be possible.
<br />

<br />
10. I guess, since I could do anything, I would grant everyone the power to become enlightened, attain kundalini or raise his/her consciousness to whatever level desired in an instant.
<br />

<br />
11. I would allow people to have whatever abilities they want; abuse would be impossible.
<br />

<br />
12. Technology would only be limited by the mind but would not interfere with the environment.
<br />

<br />
13. Everyone would be able to find his/her true love or at least a very close match.
<br />

<br />
14. I would probably create several more earths, with similar orbits but not too close to close to each other to give everyone more space for their mansions/homes/palaces (if they want or need any).
<br />

<br />
15. Schools would not exist, but everyone would be free to acquire as much knowledge as they want; people would just be introduced to what is generally out there especially things like enlightenment so that everyone has at least some awareness of what they can learn/experience.
<br />

<br />
16. No governments would exist because they would not be necessary what so ever. 
<br />

<br />
17. Things like racism and other forms of discrimination like social status probably would not be able to survive for long in such a society.
<br />

<br />
18. Wars would not exist.
<br />

<br />
19. Hunger would not exist.
<br />

<br />
20. As for religion, I can’t really go into that, but I can tell you that there wouldn’t be any problems with it like there are in today’s world.
<br />

<br />
In general, people would have immense freedom and opportunity. If you ended up miserable in this fantasy utopia it would surely be by your own choice.
