			Is she the real deal?  I always wanted to know wheter or not she was in a legit lab.  I saw books and stuff, but never anything that say where the place was where she did this and only a couple names.

			I said maybe, purely because I don't know. If I were to lean to one side, I would say yes, she's real, but I still went safe with maybe. I've seen some of her vids and they do look pretty convincing, plus it was before the age of photoshop and video editing, so no special effects there.

			oh yeah for got vote for my self! duh...
<br />

<br />
I say maybe.  It's definetly possible.  But what i dont understand is that I've seen ppl here such as Apollo do more impressive things and he hasn't had a heart attack.  That part is confusing.
<br />

<br />
The photoshop coment doesn't realy mean anything.  The only way to photoshope a movie is after it's been made, and it only takes an hour or so to put a whole movie on a computer.  No matter what medium even if it's big black and white film strips.  You can always photoshop anything.  Did that sound mean?  I didn't mean to if i did.

			There's a reason why she had a heart attack and why Apollo hasn't had one. Reason number 1: Apollo isn't very old compared to how old she was. Therefore, the chances are lowered significantly.
<br />
Reason number 2: She had a certain technique that Apollo (from my knowledge) doesn't use;she straigned he muscles and held her breath, which made her blood pressure hit the roof. She used to go red from doing it and nearly pass otu from what I have read. It was said that her doctor told her about her high blood pressure. That's why she dies of a heart attack. She <span style="font-style: italic">made</span> her blood pressure go up.
<br />

<br />
I meant that when the vids were made they couldn't edit them like that, and iv'e seen them, they would have looked extremely fake considering they were made back then.

			i said maybe (obviously, that's the only vote so far lol).  the reason being is that i was not there, and it is on camera.  i know that there isn't much gain in faking a video, but the claims were impressive.  the hardest thing to fake would have been the frog heart (assuming it was real).  the other part of me says it's real, simply because of the claims.  some of us here can do what she did on video, and what we do is unbelievable to others, just like how she is unbelievable to us.
<br />

<br />
BTW, male snakes do have what's considered legs.  they're little spurs located where the tail actually starts, and are used for grip during intercourse.  just a little daily fact  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.

			I voted maybe also, for all the reasons pointed out in the posts above mine.
<br />

<br />
But also, because of the situation between America and the Soviets at the time of Kulagina being a psychokinetic claimant. There's a possibility that Nina Kulagina was merely a 'Hey look what we've got!' fear tactic, and generally for the impressive-factor. However, I too think the evidence is convincing enough to lean towards a the 'yes; but uncertain' conclusion.
<br />

<br />
Along with, that, however; she could apparently tell the colour of an object by touching it, and cause burn marks on peoples skin (including her own - hope that never got out of control!). The 'evidence' I read for this seemed pretty convincing. So, assuming that these aspects of her psionic skills were legitimate; why make up the psychokinesis?
<br />

<br />
[Reference for this, I'm unsure about (since I've researched alot, and specifics get muddled) - but I'm almost certain it was from &quot;PSI: psychic discoveries behind the iron curtain&quot; a book by Shelia Ostrander &amp; Lynn Schroeder. Unfortunately, I don't have access to this right now so can't check.]

			Well, I said maybe, because even though there was no computer editing back then, there still existed some very convincing methods of trickery, and magnets have been around for a long time. Although, her feats are numerous, and not all could be faked, and I personally believe that it was all real, but there is a reasonable doubt.

			I voted yes, because the Soviet government sure took her seriously.  I can't see her tricking the Soviets like that.  If anyone's read about her, they conducted tests on her while she was using her powers, and did some incredible things (like almost stopping a man's heart) that I just can't see her faking.
<br />

<br />
Edit:  Maybe the Soviets faked it, but if that were the case, I don't know why they'd keep the faked videos a secret.

I've done that before...
<br />

<br />
I was Reikiing(healing tech, works really well by the way), long distance to a group of friends including my mom while they were speaking in front of my church.  I was trying to relax them so the entire time i had my arms crossed and was Reikiing them and i moved my hand at the end and there was a burn where my pointer finger was.  Did'nt hurt at all or anything and it's mostly gone now...  It was weird....
