			i have an example (somewhat)
<br />

<br />
my friend and i were driving down the highway.. i was the passenger..
<br />

<br />
we came close to an SUV which was driven by a moderatly attractive brunette.
<br />

<br />
now i just instantly looked at her (without too much contemplation or thinking on my behalf) and said in my head &quot;LOOK AT ME&quot; or &quot;LOOK HERE&quot; something among those lines. and it worked instantly.

			The way that I ping is by creating and maintaining a strong visual image of the person I want to ping.  I proceed to imagine myself touching the back of their neck.  The back of the neck area is pretty sensitive insofar as the tactile sense is concerned, and it usually works well enough for me.

Try it out and see if it works.  Good luck with it.

i like that technique, that should work well for me.
<br />

<br />
i usually think of the person's face (unless i can physically see them) then i send a dense beam/glob of energy into their field (trying not to break any sheilds, if there is one).  or, i think of the persons face (unless i can physically see them), project energy at them or establish a link, and scream &quot;HEY!&quot; real loud (in my head of course lol).  the second works better than the first for me, but it may be different for you.

I'm unsure of where I heard or read the technique I described.  I'm quite sure I didn't come up with it on my own, so my apologies to whoever came up with it (if it's from someone else).  The whole idea of it pivots on the neck area itself.  It's sensitive, and therefore it is probably more prone to conveying a tactile sensation, even with the slightest nudge of psi.
<br />

<br />
The back of the neck-area on some rodents (including rabbits) are photosensitive.  This is a mechanism that allows the rodent to recognize when a shadow is cast over them.  Said shadow could be cast by a predator, such as a hawk, and so the rabbit will know when to move it's ass.  I remember talking about this in PSC, so Rainsong is probably the one I can attribute this method to.

			interesting...so when you use the tactile approach, do you use remote touch or something similar?  or when you were talking about the rodents (and their photosensitive necks) are you saying that just projecting energy into their field will cause a reaction?

Wow! that's real cool!
<br />

<br />
When I ping, I just send what I judge to be 'very loud' energy at whoever I feel like pinging- too bad it doesn't work to well for me, though. I have a friend who does it this way, and it seems to work well for her. She pinged me from her house once and I was compelled to run all the way down the street from my house to hers. (If anyone has ever read <span style="text-decoration: underline">the chrysalis</span> it felt something like what Petra did whenever she was in any sort of danger)
<br />

Sorry for that useless story, though.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

I don't use remote touch or anything, to be honest.  I just think it, visualize it, and more often than not, it happens.    The rodent example was merely some food for thought and an example that area's in a biological organism's body can be very, very sensitive to something that is much less noticable than full-on contact.
