			Hi ahmed1,
<br />

<br />
This used to happen to me as well. Next time you find your stuck in a dream, become aware of sounds, the feeling of your body, the tastes in your mouth, smells and what your eyes are seeing. You may find you wake back up in your body, or you find yourself somewhere familiar like in your bedroom.  If the latter happens, your are now concious in the astral.
<br />

<br />

<br />
All the best!

			Back when I was a kid, I was aware of being in them a lot and whenever it was a nightmare I would choose to wake up. What I would do is close my eyes in the dream and concentrate on waking up...it usually always worked but it is hard to explain how to just concentrate on how to get out.

			I sometimes awake consciousness in a dream and i can't get out of them easily. I have two ways: The fast one and the slow one
<br />
The fast one is the most easy way but the most impressive and it can hurt your emotions (nothing important but it can make you really stressed). To escape from a dream by this way, simply die in your dream, the impression of diying in a dream will awake you up, you will be sweating and really stressed but you will be back into reality.
<br />
The slow one is to concentrate and try to remake the dream with your mind. For example if you see a dream monster in front of you if you convince yourself that what you see its a squirrel when you open your eyes (in the dream) it will be a squirrel. Also if you're in middle of the rainforest and you want to be in your house, close your eyes and convince yourself that you're in your house. Then you will have to convince that you're going to wake up or that you want to escape from the dream to wake up or to have an OBE.
<br />
Be warned, if you don't have control of your mind and if you think things like &quot;could it be a monster&quot; it will be a monster for sure. So don't let your mind to trap yourself.
<br />

			Personally, it wouldn't look good on your sub-c if you just give up and die. If you can, fight your way out in any way possible XD atleast if you still die, atleast you tried right? If a monster attacks, do not run, as most dreams.. they are faster than you, or always around you. Fight your fears.
<br />

<br />
I have only had a few dreams where I could not wake up. Heres the one I ended it for now with: Everything was dark, void like. Yellow glowing eyes creeping up on me, people who i love the most hurt me mocked me just by looking at me.  I was scared pretty much. I tried to close me eyes, think i was back in my bed, but no. I was stuck there, so I unleashed all my hate in the world upon my dream, unleashed everything I had. I yelled so loud, everything around me started to dematerialize, I saw myself from third person view, I was moving around so fast destroying everything in my path. and then there was just me. I broke down into nothing, I woke up yelling, and almost jumping out of the bed kicking and punching.
<br />
It seems as if it's no different than real life situations, just all fantasy like. (funny how my name says &quot;lucid&quot;, I do not Lucid dream as a skill).
<br />

<br />
If your dreams continue to trap you, keep fighting, maybe one night you'll find a way out.

			I once had a dream when I was probably about 8 or 9, maybe even 10. I was in my room going to sleep like usual, but I would enter this wierd dream, it would kind of sidescroll through with really pretty and happy scenery.  I saw it was obviously a dream so I decided to wake myself up, it worked, I was happy about it and went back to sleep The same dream... I wake myself up again thinking it was wierd.  I fall asleep again and IT WAS THE SAME DREAM.  I was like &quot;whatever&quot; and went through with it and then all of a sudden everything gains a red hue, and the voice says &quot;YOU CAN'T GET OUT NOW&quot; in a booming way.  I was thinking &quot;OH CRAP&quot; and I tried to make myself wake up the same way as before, and I couldn't.  I started to really freak out and I don't really remember what else happened.  I could feel my body too I think, but I couldn't wake up.
<br />

<br />
Often times, well used to be, I would be in a dream, usually a nightmare, and I would try to wake my self up.  I could feel my eyelids and everything, but I just couldnt' wake up.  It was really annoying, so I had to be scared out of my freeking mind <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.  Sometimes the nightmare lasted a really long time.  One of the times I even lost all sight of my dream and I could see my eyelids, but I couldn't move, not even my eyelids (dream paralysis) and I would get sucked back into my dream.
<br />

<br />
Recently, like Lucidness said, I realized the best way is to fight your fears <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  Just stay completely calm and do not fear, whether you realize it is a dream or not.

			nice post Lucidess , i think i will try to stand steel infront of my nightmares because i was always running from my nightmares and i think if i stand for it and fight it i will stop them all of my nightmares that i always have them .
<br />

<br />
about waking myself from a dream that i dont like or nightmare i simply close my eyes then i open them then i wake up <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> but sometimes it dont work so i try and try to make it work so it work sometimes and sometimes it dont work , my other way is my strong desire of getting out of the nightmare wake me up .
<br />

<br />
<img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" /> by the way i never died in dream , lol im good player <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> . maybe my fear from fail while im dreaming wake me up before i fail and die.
<br />

<br />
i edit that because i forget to say that strange story: one of my dreams that trapped me did not leave me alone till i said im sorry to 2 people in my dream about my mistake and when i said im sorry it was my choice not like the  normal dreams that you have to do something , it was my choice to say sorry and when i just said that i wake up . im the kind of people that say sorry hardly <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
i think that kind of dreams is to make us learn something from them.

			I think i know what you mean, when i was younger i would try and wake myself up in a dream, and then go take a walk and realize i was just dreaming that walk.
<br />

<br />
Usually once i realize im dreaming i force myself awake again, ill get up make sure i can feel everything, and when im certain im awake stand up and take control.

			If it wasn't a bad dream why would you want to wake up? Lucid dreaming is fun; you can do all sorts of interesting things. You'll wake up naturally when the time comes (whether by alarm or by natural awakening) - so live up the dream while it lasts!
<br />

<br />
Now, if it's a bad dream, that's a different story. But if it's a bad dream and you realize you're dreaming, you can change it to be good. So yeah.
