			Don't be too judgemental towards Neveza too soon. There have indeed been experiments with plants, like Rainsong said. I forgot the exact name of the source, will look that up later on if someone wants it. 
<br />

<br />
But this man somehow connected a lying-detector to a plant, as he was doing experiments on the plant. And at a certain time he felt the intention of burning a piece of it's leave. At the exact same moment the lying detector reacted violently. So then he thought, Ok, now I am going to think the exact same thing again. So he thought about burning the plants leave...But nothing happened. Why? because his intention was not there to really burn the plant, just to think about burning it. He noticed this multiple times with different intentions. So it seems we can communicate on a level of intentions with trees and such. Like Peebrain described himself cultivating attitudes of friendliness against the things around him. I believe that will be somehow felt by the living cells in that tree. And if it does not, then at least it makes the one who cultivates these feelings of friendliness, more friendly/happy. Because before you can send out any emotion at all, that energy/emotion must already been built up inside the sender. How else can you send it out?

			well, as i worked on improving my subcon. communication, i was asking it random questions from these questions i asked :-
<br />
What are trees ??as i was just experimenting it, the reply came :it's a peacfull way to express our emotions, still dont know what it means till now , but i think it's somehow related to what you all are discussing, and i dont know if that helped . . .

Every plant has its energy signature, and every one of them is unique. So yes, you can talk to them if you really want to, but I doubt you'll get any useful information. Talking to the universe, now that's a cool skill.

			well , my final point of veiw about that is : every creature in this universe has it's own way of thinking and getting things done, not thinking or acting in our way doesnt mean they dont think !! , maybe more simple than our thinking, and maybe more complicated for us to understand, what i mean is that our brain is the thing we were meant to think with,it'll be the same if it was our heart for example.... i hope somebody got my point afterall.

I think we have no idea what's going on around us. That's why we feel the need to explain everything in a matter which the majority of material-oriented people will understand and accept as &quot;the truth&quot;. Sure, things can be explained but have you ever thought about why the simplest stuff has never been explained, like where exactly IS our consciousness, or why does the grass grow anyway? Or how does an embryo grow up and become a living fucking organism. That's why it's so interesting to me that when you're in a deep state of meditation, or astral projecting, or on a psychedelic drug, or enlightened in any other way, artificial or not, you SEE things differently. You get all the answers before even asking. You simply know it can't all be that silly as the scientist declare.
<br />

<br />
We live in an illusion, and our main goal is to get out of it and see what is really going on around us. And why.

Note: I understand this post may seem silly or even offensive to some, so I'm declaring it as my personal opinion and if you like it or not is up to you.

I think we feel the need to explain and understand everything because we DO know what is going on around us. Not only that, but we want to learn MORE of what is going on around us.
<br />

<br />
The reason we might not fully understand things like the &quot;consciousness&quot; yet is because the technology we use to study it hasn't been around for very long. Now that we have the technology it shouldn't take too long... hell, we already have a lot of plausible theories on that. Your answer: It's in the brain.
<br />

<br />
What do you mean why does grass grow? Why does it exist in nature? Why does it grow when it's planted? I'm not sure what you're asking... I' sure we know about how grass grows...
<br />

<br />
Embryo development? We know about that too. The technology for that is relatively new too by the way. I'm not sure what you mean we don't know... it grows up... cells get together and do their thing... everything starts to work as one... and there you have life.
<br />

<br />
Meditation... bah. Meditation redistributes lots of blood and activity in the brain. Things are so different when you meditate because different/more/less parts of your brain are working than normal. I can't remember any time when it's &quot;less&quot; (Total that is) though, so strike that for now. Just less in different areas.
<br />

<br />
So... I'm not sure what you don't understand.

Yeah, what thing do they do exactly? How exactly do they do it? How exactly is it possible that matter can reproduce or regenerate itself? I could go on but I'm gonna stop <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.

I know what you mean exactly DanielH because I was thinking the same way you do not so long ago. It doesen't matter, because I want to describe something that 1000 men couldn't put to words if they worked their ass off. It is not something you could describe or investigate, it's something you feel deep inside you. I cannot explain better than this, for that I'm truly sorry.

Well, that depends on what kind of cells they are. Skin, nerve, liver, etc. There are lots of different kind of cells. Look them up some time. How they do it? No idea. Ask a neurologist... I was listening to a podcast on this, so I know they're the right people to ask.
<br />

<br />
Are you talking about matter as in organisms?
<br />

<br />
You should get back with science. It describes the Truth.
