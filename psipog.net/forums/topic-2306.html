			I've noticed, when I moved the lamp (in the video I uploaded) that I felt as though there was a &quot;muscle like switch&quot; in my head. I also feel it when I move lighter things like paper. When any of you have moved an object have you felt that? Or am I just being weird?

			When i get warmed up, the center of my forehead gets alot of pressure, as if my mind is extending his hand and reaching out.. or something. Yes it would feel like a switch. For me it feels like a confident insanity feeling and i can think &quot;I can move this, just gotta.. ______&quot;

			It grows the more focus I put into it. It's like all my nerves are firing. But my consciousness is placed in the object so the object starts to move.

			i found out when i was able to move the psiwheel, and a few feathers a few months back....{and i cant seem to do so now....it sucks...its like a writers block or something for pk} that i felt as if my mind was tensing up like your body when exercising....and it tensed up and made the psiwheel move and feathers move....but now that i took awhile off for vacation from it cuz it got boring....i cant seem to make the psiwheel move now.....i still get the tensing effect though....so i guess i gotta stregthen my mind up a lil bit.....{i think the mind has the same effect when not in use....it tends to get weaker like the muscles in the body after inactivity....so i'm gonna work on it ....a whole lot more......it'll make things interesting....thats for sure.....}

			I sort of believe that you(we) are working the cortex or frontal lobe in a new way which gives us this feeling, yet, it could also be BioFeedBack, so I never really know, but I do get the same feeling.

			Ever since I've started doing telekinesis, as soon as I grasped that feeling at the top of my head, it makes the psi wheel move in a certain direction, and it's like there's a second muscle lower then that, which makes it spin the other way...You explained it perfectly and you said exactly where it is.

			i never experiece muscle in all of my head or skull but i experienced the forehead or the third eye and i rare feel it before i use tk but after i practice tk now it rare dont feel it lol , every day i feel it and im practicing for to use it when i want to use it and here something might help you to get that feeling in your forehead or the third eye . 
<br />
put your index finger so close to you third eye then look behind your fingers between your fingers too and try to make your hand relaxed and the easyer way is to do that after while when you are practicing tk . 
<br />
you can feel that too while rv too . it help you in tk good . 
<br />
good luck all

			I find that whe nputting a lot of focus into moving the wheel I too get that feeling, but it's right on the top of my head. The more focus I use the more intense the feeling - it can almost be distracting, but it's also an excellant way for me to tell when I'm focused enough and am having some serious effect on the wheel.
<br />
I have yet to move anything bigger than the Psi wheel but when I do, I'll definatly post whether the feeling was more intense of not.

			This sounds like an increased amount of blood flow to your brain. It's easy to feel when you don't use your brain a lot (or certain sections of it). You might be talking about something else though... I'm not sure.

			I get that feeling too.  I usually do better the more i work up that feeling.  I think it maybe the &quot;PK muscle&quot;.  OR just my head playing tricks, either way it helps me.
