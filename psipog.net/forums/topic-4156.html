			Every week or so, I have dreams that relate to:
<br />
- an abandoned house in the middle of some creepy-looking forest at night, house seems haunted
<br />
- me being there, usually fighting with resident-evil like zombies or some whacky ghouls, sometimes other beasts
<br />
- usually there is a complex labyrint through the house which I have to pass
<br />

<br />
This has been happening to me for like a year now. The house is somehow different from different angles, like when dreaming that I'm in front of it it seems smaller and more simple, but when I'm walking through it it seems very complex and big.
<br />

<br />
Now don't get me wrong, I don't consider these dreams a nightmare, because they're really not that scarry as they sound. Actually the only scary part of the dream is the conclusion, where I run away from the house and beasts hunting me, going through some dark forest. Then I usually wake up.
<br />

<br />
I will try to describe my last 3 dreams I recall that fall into the &quot;repetitive dream zone&quot; <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
1) This one I had about three days ago. I was in the house again, and I know there was a very complex maze through it, and I had troubles finding exit. When I finnaly did, there were full of girls from my life everywhere, the next thing I remember is being given a revolver gun, kinda like a magnum, anyway there were zombies again and I was shooting them them but as I kept on doing so they still crawled towards me. I then ran away from them with a bycicle through some very creepy forest road.
<br />

<br />
2) I dreamt this about two weeks ago: I was in the middle of a forest, there was no big house this time just a small bunker-looking construct. I was inside it, I think someone else was with me as well, anyway, a bear came to the house and he didn't let us leave. Then I had to run through the forest away from him. This dream is different from others because there was sunlight in it, not night.
<br />

<br />
3) This one is from some time ago, and I would forget about it have I not made a picture that keeps reminding me of it. Anyways I was in the house in the middle of a forest again, but this time I was alone and there were full of monsters. This dream was actually the most intense and most frightful of them all, that's why I remember it so vividly. The most psyhotic part was when I have somehow ran out of the house and slamed the door a really creapy resident-evilish zombie dog would jump onto the part of the door that's covered with glass. At that time I woke up and felt my heart beat go like a drum solo and my face pouring in sweat. That's actually weird because I hadn't had a nightmare since I was 6 and monsters usually don't freak me out when in a dream, instead they usually make me aware of the fact that I'm dreaming so I confront them. With this dream it wasn't like that.
<br />

<br />
Also there is another repetitive dream I'm having, but this one waits for a longer period of time before reappearing. It's about me and some XXX person (I really never found out who), sitting in a wooden floor just few metres above the sea and there is nothing but a small wooden house and some large rocks there, everything surrounded only by sea. Unlike the dreams previously described these one make me feel very happy for some reason.
<br />

<br />
I should also state that none of the repetitive dreams I just described were lucid, in fact I think I never had two lucid dreams that seemed similiar in any way.
<br />

<br />
Anyways (sorry for making this post so long, here goes the actual reason I opened this thread <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />), I want to know if anyone else has had similiar experiences with dreams repeating themselves. I think it's an interesting topic.
<br />

<br />
Second, I would like to find out (psychologically) why do the dreams repeat themselves and what (if anything) do they want to tell me.
<br />

<br />
peace ?

			I have them all the time! They are very normal, and almost everyone has them. They physchologically are telling you the same thing. They are based on your feelings fears, wants etc. They will not change unless you yourself change. And they will always be repetitive unless you take control in your dreams, because you remeber the old dreams, and it's like a movie then. You just let it go like the other ones. 
<br />

<br />
If you want to be lucid during these dreams, do an RC whenever you see something out of that dream that reminds you of something in that dream. Also do an RC when you think about this dream. Then soon enough you will lucid dream when you have that repetitive dream again.
<br />

<br />
I find them annoying, but they make wonderful oppurtunities for LD's.
<br />

<br />
Happy Dreaming!

			So you think when I figure out what is wrong and &quot;fix it&quot; the dreams will stop repeating? Hmm that makes me wonder <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />. I have no idea why the dreams would make me kill zombies in a haunted mansion again and again ... and it's been like 4 years since I last played resident evil <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />. I don't know this is really weird.
<br />

<br />
Yeah it seems like you could jump to LD more easily, but for me it's usually only like half lucid for some time and then it's non-lucid again because I seem to be in a deep sleep whenever i get these kind of dreams.
<br />

peace ?
