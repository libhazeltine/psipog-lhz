			Alright, for awhile i have practiced cryokinesis without any results....
<br />
so i stopped practicing
<br />

<br />
just a few minutes ago i went to get a pop. i got out a glass and poured the pop out, and the pop froze as it came out...
<br />
then the top got frozen shut with pop! I was pretty freaked out, cause the pop wasn't very cold. my brother said the fridge might have been too cold, but then he got a pop and it was normal!
<br />

<br />
has anyone else had experiences like this without even triing?
<br />
is this normal for a psion with little practice?

			You, my friend, are just now noticing the effects of what I like to call &quot;Cerebromuscular Distraction&quot;, or CD for short. I call it that because you're trying to do something with your mental muscles, and when it doesn't work, you get disheartened and stop trying. And then, suddenly, when you're distracted by something else, your desired effect takes place!
<br />

<br />
Peebs documented it a while ago with regular PK and a psiwheel. He tried so hard to make it move, and it remained still, then when he looked away, it spun like no tomorrow! It's also the main technique on fork-you.com, where you're told to do all the focus stuff, and then distract yourself to let the force get to the object.
<br />

<br />
It's a curious little effect. But when we can find time, STAG will be looking into it.

			SO? I've had such experience before. I don't treat it as psionics at all.
<br />

<br />
I've had soda that have frozen and some that aren't. It happens.

Quiet, you! I'm trying to teach a newb about a strange phenomenon! 
<br />

<br />
lolz, just joking. It might be CD, but then again, it could just be whatever has made your pop freeze.
