Sure, that is the most common view. 
<br />

<br />
But, at this moment. You can't actually call Tankdown stupid. Because, apparently, we don't know the answer. If we did, and the answer was stupid, then Tankdown could be labeled stupid because of this thread. 
<br />

<br />
Although, Tankdown did respond with an &quot;A+&quot; towards the answer of &quot;because.&quot; And since that seems to be the answer, then I'm afraid this whole topic is very stupid. (no offense Tankdown)

*Does not disagree*

I think this is one of the shortest posts I've ever written (not THE shortest, mind you), so I'm just gonna throw this sentence in here it make it seem longer. Then, I might, you know, abuse something, maybe commas... maybe those... three periods... I forget... what do you call them?
<br />

<br />
Anyways, getting to the point, while agree that this topic is a little stupid, it does show some basic concepts in understanding the English language, which I have just previously abused. It also shows that people's responses to seemingly illogical questions can indicate some of their &quot;inner workings.&quot;

THANK YOU SOME ONE GOT THE FREAKING POINT!
<br />

<br />
As to where I got this question is from a guy who got it from his Professor. He told me his story about how some of these college studies would write page after page during the class hour. But everyone didn't get the 100% expect one guy who wrote on a little paper &quot;Because&quot;.
<br />

<br />
What I said is what I thought of this question. There may be other answers that explains why this is the answer. But it is how I thought. (I like being tricky <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> ). So yes I don't understand the answer myself.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

Sure, believe whatever you want. But just think for a second. You asked a question, asking for the right answer, right? The question itself was a bit vague, so to speak, so I wondered what you were looking for... it's as simple as that. If you want to believe I'm just 'jumping in' to make myself look smart, be my guest. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Believing anything you want is what I wanted to point out. And you never really answer my question...you simply contuine to read through the posts to see what everyone else said. When you heard the answer you seem to come to ask this question, but at the beginning when you read the question you had to first think of that subconsciencly before looking over everyones work. That is something I am annoyed with most..but what is funny is that even if you did put it down, you would still have been wrong and miss the total purpose of this topic. 
<br />

<br />
But of cource my own self being is what you are aimming for, seeing that you are not the selfish type that you commonly think yourself as. But of cource I see that as silly still seenig that everyone I seen feel slightly more speical then everyone else with the help of psionics. As enlighten as everyone is...your all just as sinful inside the subconscience. Of cource accpting it is the first state of healing...but people still do the same thing over and over again.

Well when all of you say this question as vague...I saw beauty and wanted to share it. I was offended by this like most people would and tried to get you to see what I saw...
<br />

<br />
What you said is nothing real new to me...and you answer my question with a another question which in the first place I ask for a answer..Of cource you have your reasons but I have other responbilities to deal with first.
<br />

<br />
You are right I saw from what I believe from only from what I have heard. However you have just the same of problem as me and everyone else don't you?

But just think for a second. You asked a question, asking for the right answer, right? The question itself was a bit vague, so to speak, so I wondered what you were looking for... it's as simple as that.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Believing anything you want is what I wanted to point out. And you never really answer my question...you simply contuine to read through the posts to see what everyone else said. When you heard the answer you seem to come to ask this question, but at the beginning when you read the question you had to first think of that subconsciencly before looking over everyones work. That is something I am annoyed with most..but what is funny is that even if you did put it down, you would still have been wrong and miss the total purpose of this topic.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

My answer was honestly the first thing that came to mind.  I found it somewhat funny.
