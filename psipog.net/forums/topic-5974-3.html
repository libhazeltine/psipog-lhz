			Saying that there are non physical, semi detetactable organs that control energy is like me saying there's a giant dragon in my garage. People have to just saying things and saying well they could be real. It's either fake or true. Right now psi is fake to me because there is no proof. It's probably true and there is evidence for it but the evidence is terrible.

			What I mean by that is that the organs exist in the form in the mind. So in a way they wouldnt exist, but due to pisionics being that of the mind organs can be created from them just be having a feeling that they do.

So in a way if you beleive it would exist they mite just would. Most likely wouldnt change anything...But if you don't it wouldnt really matter now would it?

bout the pineal gland being a spiritual organ....

to clear confusions, i actually meant that the pineal gland crosses over to the Third-eye spiritual organ, if there is such an organ...

I wouldn't really call them organs though since the person makes them themselves. The topic is about the pineal gland though and that is definitely not what you described.

			When you walk bare foot, an important gland in the brain's center called the pineal gland or the third eye is activated.  The big toe of the foot represents this gland.  25 years ago it was considered a useless gland.  Now it has become an important gland for study and up to now, about 18,000 papers have been published about it.  It has always been known as the Seat of the soul.  The Pineal gland has optic nerve endings.
<br />

<br />
This is sun gazing and has to do with pineal gland cited: <a href="http://www.solarhealing.com/sgprocess.htm" target="_blank">http://www.solarhealing.com/sgprocess.htm</a>

			Seven, what are you babbling about? Third eye being acivated just by walking around barefoot? That makes no sense, as any forces being applied to a bare foot would be applied by one in a sock as well. The whole &quot;sun-gazing&quot; thing is REALLY fluffy too. It reminds me of the &quot;Pranic Breathing&quot; or whatever it's called, where people starve themselves and try to live on air and water alone. What the hell does looking at the sun have to do with improving quality of life or developping photosynthesis???

Niushirra, I was playing Devil's Advocate, in case you didn't catch on. I don't believe that the pineal gland has anything to do with psi effects at all, but I was just throwing the idea out there to see some good, solid thought. You still haven't told us about the function of the pineal gland that you spoke of earlier.
<br />

<br />
In addition, I admire your skepticism in the face of bad evidence. I must say, the evidence that's readily availible does suck, and thus the best evidence is personal experience, for now. Maybe things will change in the future...

Thats because I left out the 2nd part. As we think each a different part of our brain is turn. By just rotting your mind and watching tv, parts of you are not on. Whats to say about the psi world?
<br />

<br />
If you believe it exist the something would turn on. Normaly your imaginetation would turn on for this. But what if your thoughts wish to past over the real world? What would turn on? If the brain believes it can do it would it do it? I don't think the pineal gland is it, but I'm not neruoscientist or any form of expert.

			I know it was fluff just trying to put more out there to see if anyone can bring any stuff out about a person I read about who did sun gazing and was in a us laboratory and went at least 200 days only needing water. His pineal gland was much bigger. Let me dig up some stuff. 
<br />

<br />
The pineal gland secretes melatonin that affects certain cycles of the brain. It is also light sensitive and the amount of light affects the amount of melatonin made.

This one is more real and the person who did it is a neurologist so more legit.

he goes 411 days without food and the average pineal is 6*8 mm and his is 8*11 mm

Functions of the pineal gland:
<br />
1) What I just quoted.
<br />
2) It's in the center of the brain and thus light cannot get to it. 
<br />
3) Lizards have a similiar structure on their head that they use to detect things above them.
<br />
4) 3 leads to the conclusion that this is a vestigial structure.
<br />

<br />
Now 7, tell me by what process in the pineal gland would this person who fasted use the sun's energy for themselves and how the sunlight penetrates skin, bone, and brain tissue.

<br />

<br />
The above article documents the true function of the pineal gland. In humans, there is no suggestion that it is a perceptory organ in any way, shape or form.
<br />

<br />
In lower vertabrates, however, it seems to have a perceptory function of some sort. The tuatara's &quot;pineal body comes through a hole in the skull to the surface and has the form of a crude eye.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Still doesn't really give us conclusive information, but it gives us an idea.

			I'm aware that you're stating exactly what I am. I'm just trying to be more specific about it. That's all. 
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">[EDIT: I'm also citing my source. Where are you getting your information?]</span>
<br />

<br />
I don't think you realize that I agree with you in that the Pineal Gland probably doesn't have any paranormal function. However, I choose to admit the miniscule possibility. This provides the opportunity for all the evidence to be brought forward. 
<br />

<br />
You come off as very denialist. I'm not saying you are, it's just how you appear. You're entitled to believe what you like, but when you post, I think it would be a good idea for you to refrain from flat denial in your posts. Make it sound like you think it could be possible, maybe play some Devil's Advocate? of course, you don't have to take my suggestion, but you can if you want to.

			Wait a min...if you CAN get energy from the sun....that would still pretty lame....You won't get all the minerals and fiber and such in your body for it to run, sure you have the energy. But you need to exchange chemcials from food for Vitamins and such. I guess mineral water would help you....but it donest sound like much.
<br />

<br />
I think the gland gets bigger for other reasons from watching the sun...so I'm not buying it. There is still no direct evidence to it.
