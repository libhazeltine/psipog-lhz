			Hello pyroman098,
<br />

<br />
I've read that article in the past as well. I've discussed with numerous members concerning my techniques and others. Some believe that asking the object to move works better for them that trying to force the object to move. This depends on the person. There is no technique that is guaranteed to work for everyone.
<br />

<br />
 If my techniques are working for you then use them. I don't see any reason for searching the internet for more techniques if the techniques your using is currently working. Please note that there is no right technique and wrong technique. My techniques may work for you however someone else may not receive the results they are looking for using them. Having several techniques are very benefiting due to the variety of choices (technique wise). 
<br />

<br />
Like I said, if the techniques that you are currently working with are working good, then use them. A lot of members start looking for more techniques thinking that some techniques will bring results is a quicker rate. That is far from the truth. Practice is the key to results. There are no techniques (known) that will bring results is a quicker pace than others.  
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />
- JoeT

okay i read that link and i did some experiment with that stuff about 6 months ago. a &quot;PK&quot; burst, seemed to work but wasnt really that beneficial.
<br />

<br />
heres a way to gather &quot;it&quot;, from what i found
<br />

<br />
dont have anything near you, just visualize the pin wheel next to you, even though it isnt there. then realistically, visualize you moving it, you should feel the same forces as when you do moving it in real life. this is how i used to get a build up.
<br />

<br />
trust me here, i second what joeT said: stick to what works for you!
