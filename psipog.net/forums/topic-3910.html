			Last night I had a nightmare. Before that night, I had empathically read someone close to me and she was going through a tough time. 
<br />

<br />
Guess who I dreamt about; that someone. I don't know why but I was in <span style="font-style: italic">Hell</span>. And you know what else, I thought it was real, too. The dream must have been during my entire sleep. 
<br />

<br />
Usually I only dream for about 10 minutes before I just wake up. I hate it when your alarm clock/parents wake you up when you have the best dream ever. Like once I was dreaming I finally got my Gibson Les Paul, I woke up. Realizing it was just a dream, I punched my pillow. But back to the subject:
<br />

<br />
To be honest, it was the most depressing dream, ever. I was crying in the dream alot, well actually, I cried pretty much through the entire dream. Imagine crying for 9 hours straight.
<br />

<br />
I think this will take me a while to get over. The dream felt so real, the scene was dark.
<br />

<br />
Best regards, 
<br />

<br />
Serge

			Wow that must have been scary, i hate it how the worst dreams feel the most real. The worst dream i ever head was where my mom died....twice in one dream. One was where she fell down the stairs at my high school and the other was when me her and my sister ran away from this guy on a motorcycle with a gun and i tried to block them but she got shot. And when i woke up i didnt remember at first but after about 10 seconds i actually thought my mom was dead and it was such an intense horrible feeling, but then i realised it was just a nightmare. I'm still haunted by that feeling.

			I hate that to, i recently had a dream where i was told by some doctors that my whole body was covered in cancer and i didn'y have long to live, it felt so real.In my dream i was crying loads and when i first woke up i thought that it was real for like 5 minutes it was the worst feeling in the world, now i feel so much more for those who are diagnosed with the disease it must be so hard, it was the greatest relief when i realised it was only a dream. I wonder why the most dark and sad dreams are the ones which always feel so real?

			I recommend you get in contact with that &quot;somone&quot; you feel sad about.  Make sure that &quot;somone&quot; is fine and that everything's alright.  Also try not to think about it before bed again so you won't have to deal with that dream.

Thank you for being so supportive, guys. And yes moonrave, it is the best relief to wake up from a bad dream. Once I was suffering from lung cancer in my dream, woke up, and was relieved.

<br />
Thank you.

Actually for me, it's vice versa. For example I dreamt for the whole night and it felt like an hour. Well this time, my nightmare was 9 hours long. It actually seemed 9 hours long.
