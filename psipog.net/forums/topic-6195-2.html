No, it sounds like he's saying exactly what it reads. He thinks, (&quot;knows 100%!), the &quot;end of the world&quot; war is starting soon and the anti-christ is coming and the war's going to involve &quot;demons&quot; that need to be killed and to be saved you must practice psionics and fight back. What a goof.
<br />

<br />
And to you Vossk, if you've read the Bible so much, you must also be aware of the abundant amount of holes in it. I can't wait until after the year 2010 so these religious goofs see how wrong they are. What are you going to do when the world is the exact same in 20 years and all your beliefs are destroyed?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />....(Most likely invent another end-of-the-world story)

			I do not believe in religious ideas, however, I somewhat believe in other relms, astral being one of them. You must understand that people claim the astral world to be...harmful, not friendly and can come from there to here. 
<br />

<br />
I ask, do you practice Astral Projection? I don't, so I'm going by with other people's thoughts and knowledge of the subject.

I'm still skeptical on what I said too

yes im very aware of the holes <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> i havent read the whole bible, mostly just the end, im very into the end-world theories. they just spark my interest. Not sure How anything in 20 years is going to make us see how Christians are wrong...unless your talking about all the nuclear crap with iran and israel. everyones saying thisll be the end of the world cause theyre some nukes being developed over there. theyve been saying the end is coming for hundreds of years, but its not. 
<br />
alot of people believe the war now is the war from Ezekial 38, but it doesnt mention anything of nuclear bombs, just how Gog (religous countries against Christians/Israel) is going to go to war with israel, god gets angry and destroys everything in that country, if they would read closer, they would see the ground shaking and buildings falling is from the presence of god, <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span></span> nukes.
<br />

<br />
so basiclly what im saying is we could be confused. the end of the world could have absolutely nothing to do with any war. the bible never acually says (from what ive read and heard) that the world will end during a war.
<br />

<br />
right now, im just happy to be a intelligent organism <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Wow. This is quite possibly THE fluffiest thread I've actually bothered to read. 
<br />

<br />
Honestly, I don't think the &quot;end of the world&quot; will be predictable at all. It's said that it'll come &quot;like a thief in the night.&quot; That means that we'll be living out  our day-to-day lives, and then POW! Armageddon's upon us, the Elect have been rescued, and the Wicked are getting owned.
<br />

<br />
I think that whenever we predict the exact time/means of the end of the world, we'll invariably be wrong. And the event that owns all our pitiful human asses is going to be something we never expected! So who cares?
<br />

<br />
But this is still a fluffy, and pointless, thread. 
<br />

			Not sure why im bothering posting, tbh. The books include explanations of all the 'demons' as far as how powerful they are, names, and abilities. Also, they include a large list of (79) families, divided into 7 tiers and 7 families above that, that were involved in a psionic brotherhood about 4 generations back. 2 friends of mine that sucked at psi anyway werent in them (go figure) and Will, the guy with the books (as i said, he no longer has them! he passed them on to a kid in the 4th tier) is an indirect descendant of the number 1 badass family, the Atticks. Next to that is Addington, and go figure my great-grandma is an Addington... I only know a few, such as Smither (1st tier) Sanderson (4th) Edwards(4th) Ganon (6th) and Woods (Mentioned, but not actually in the tiers. A psion family worth mentioning outside their brotherhood.) This old man had been attempting to re-construct this brotherhood, before he died. Fortunately he met will, who has inducted about 8 members so far. And looking for more. A single psion isn't much, but when pooled we have no match.
