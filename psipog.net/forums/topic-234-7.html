I've yet to come across anything that had any inherent power aside from the  mind.  On some level, perception determines reality.
<br />

You want to discuss fundamental quantum reality?  Go ahead and IM me.  Brief blurbs from your &quot;studies&quot; of the &quot;occult&quot; scrambled around with New Age internet meme isn't what we're about here.

(And yes, I'm talking to MetaAlchemy.  I love all of you, but I'm going to try and help keep the conversation on track.)
<br />

Anyways... has anyone else tried making a construct that just buzzes in someone's ear?  I've had some funny reactions with the visualization of a gnat that keeps landing on the person's nose or crawling on their ear.

			not quite sure if it is considered war i dont think so. I personally create mini aliens and predators and have them battle it out. Also i have had large amounts of success with the whole consructs talking telepathically. I love to give my constructs free will just not enough to move only with there mind. Is very annoying at night though.

2.One that amplify's the ability to see aura.

3. A psi ball that helps pull your astral body out when u are trying to project

5.Making a shield that blocks out a lot of UV rays for free sunblock

Most of these are to complex for me but if u get one to work post her

Difficult, but it's possible. It'd help to actually be able to use PK yourself. I've been working on something similar for a while, and I've made a few psychokinetic amplfiers.

Might just work. Perhaps put some telepathy in there to get you into the right frame of mind for OBEs.

Tachyons are theoretical particles that travel faster than light. And what is &quot;zero point energy&quot;?

Probably easier to use sunblock, but it might work.

			zero-point is like a foam that the universe supposedly sits on. It is not energy but what you would call pre energy. 
<br />
Tachyon attenaes capture this energy and allows anything the attenae allows things like humans to get all the energy they need but not to much energy.
<br />
It does this with the attenae by the zero-point being changed to tachyon and tachyon can change to any frequency to provide the energy something needs

			What about a shield that absorbs and saves psi to convert into energy for your use?
<br />

<br />
The shield would work like this.
<br />

<br />
1. Build shield
<br />

<br />
2. Program shield to remain &quot;alive&quot; and stable and still be independent so you don't have to supervise it
<br />

<br />
3. Program the shield to constantly absorb psi
<br />

<br />
4. Program the shield to use 40% of the absorbed psi to sustain itself, 20% for storage, and 40% to absorb another load of psi and repeat the process

			This construct will create more and more psi without consuming much, therefore creating a constant surplus of psi.  The construct should just be a regular psi-ball, but with advanced proggramming.  Program the psi_ball to make a respiration system designed to make more psi exponentially.  Have a large amount of psi particles/units &quot;multiply&quot; by 2.  Then each of those 2 should multiply by 2, then again by 2, etc.  the psi generator should run on outside energy in order to survive.

			If you find yourself at a lack of energy for certain constructs, and you use plenty of visualizations, practice gathering a stream of energy that you've pre-programmed with a specific color/intent and tying it into a little knot or some kind of pattern you can visualize clearly and easily.  You can make them into something simple like psi-balls with a bit of that &quot;colored&quot; energy, or with more focus, into a more intricate construct like a necklace.  I find it much easier to gather and pattern energy into my constructs if I've attuned myself to several different levels of focused energy.  I like to keep a toolkit of sorts of very simple constructs that I can string together quickly and easily.
<br />

<br />
My RVing construct, for example, is built from a blue and purple &quot;receptive&quot; core that is shielded by an orange and green layered bubble that can be tuned to filter out certain impulses.  An attached, brilliant blue segment of the construct broadcasts telepathically the impulses the construct is receiving... a setup I prefer for safety reasons when scanning unknown targets, as it prevent getting unpleasant jolts through the more typical link mechanism.
<br />

<br />
You can weave other constructs into your clothing/accessories, as well.  I've added a pinging construct to my cell phone that lets me know when I'm receiving a call if I've set it down and am out of hearing of the phone.  My yoga outfit has all kinds of soothing blues woven into it to help sooth strains of certain exertions.
<br />

<br />
--
<br />

<br />
While the methods psi_jacksis has mentioned are certainly interesting for exercise, I would like to point out that methods for gathering energy may be a waste of <span style="font-style: italic">focus</span> for those who don't have trouble directly accessing the infinite supplies of it around us.  It would certainly be helpful for gathering energy into the performing of a specific goal, but really I've found that with most psions, it's a matter of maintaining a clear focus on your objective rather than gathering massive amounts of energy.
<br />

<br />
As we've mentioned before, finesse, creativity, and intelligence may often be more effective then a powerful, emotionally-driven wave of energy.
<br />

<br />
I'm just afraid of individuals' suggestions becoming theoretical to the point of irrelevance.  The title, I believe, is &quot;Useful and cool constructs&quot;... not &quot;fun ideas I haven't really tried&quot;.  Just a reminder to keep in line with that.
