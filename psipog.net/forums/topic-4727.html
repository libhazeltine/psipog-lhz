			I was wondering how many people on psipog can see energy or at least think they can. I myself am not 100% sure if I can see energy. I asked a friend of mine on here if he thinks I can after describing it to him and he gave me some possible explainations (energy being one of them of course). I concluded from his explainations that my supposed ability to see energy may be a result of an active third eye. My third eye is definitely active enough to meet the condition <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. The supposed energy I see is like white flashing dim light that is scattered and and almost electric looking. I can see it with or without my eyes closed. The darker it is the easier it is to see it though. The wierdest part is that I can move it and shape it at will somehow. I once did an experiment with this. I moved some into my arm and almost instantly I felt psi coursing through my arm in the same direction. I've also tried to make a psi ball with it and I felt quite a bit of heat between my hands. I also tried using it in psi visualization and that worked well too. Feel free to describe the nature of the energy and how it has helped you with psionics.

			I KNOW I see it. I just know. Throughout any sort of energy focusing(or PK, TK, TP, etc.), my third eye &quot;looks&quot; or &quot;focuses&quot; at the spot i'm making, oh say, a psiball. Now I move the psiball with my eye thingy to the left and right, but not move my actual eyes, and I start seeing a blob of glass-white like haze moving where I move it. I don't think the actual eyes can play a trick that devious on me. I've said in a recent post, we have the tune into it, like a radio station. Don't try to look for it directly, just relax and have your eyes just look around the area of where you're focusing. Moving energy might be the most convicing to see.

how it's helped me neh? It gave me something to do in my free time XD it's fun, and fits like a glove around my interests.

The energy you see seems different from the stuff I see (assuming it is energy and not just some wierd side effect from light sensitivity or something). But like you, I can move it as well. Believe it or not I made a picture (with the energy) of an anime character on a show before! I forgot who it was though. And as for seeing it, I don't have to try what so ever. It will be with me forever... <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> I'm glad that at least some people can see energy too. And thanks for responding Lucidess <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
