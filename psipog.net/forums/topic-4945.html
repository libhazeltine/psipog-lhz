			I've been exermementing with OBEs lately, with no huge success.  For the past couple of nights, I've tried it, but I have been pretty weary when I do.  Finally when nothing happens except a few vibrations, I move my body to a sleeping position (I can't get the vibrations whilst on my side, the way I usually sleep.)  And after oh say, maybe 5-10 minutes, I feel what I now think to be the real &quot;boat&quot; vibration...where you rock back and forth (almost viciously) I might add....but soon after this I fall asleep and wake up in my bed, I do however have some strange dreams, some of which I don't remember really well--most not being lucid.

			I have the same problem(even the same sleeping position) but I think it's just that once you relax to go to sleep is when you're to that point where you get the vibrations or that's my current opinion.

			Yeah I'm thinking thats the case...my mind is just then shutting down, as is my body, but my mind is more awake, so its preparing to OBE, as tried before, but its kind of like a race ^_^

Like hitting shutdown on your computer on accident and trying to cancel it <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Same problem here ... though I usually fall asleep even while lying on the back (I usually sleep on the side). I found out one important trick while practicing for couple of years: I rise my head a little by putting another pillow underneath it so my head is a little higher than the rest of my body. There are two reasons I do this, the first one is I'm in a slightly uncomfortable position with my head and I won't fall asleep so easily, and second, I tend to clear my mind easier while in this pose and I can mantain consciousness for much more time.
<br />

<br />
The only thing I'm really not good at is putting a lot of will power into it. After about an hour of steady meditation and afterwards trying to get out of body, I usually give up, turn myself a couple times in bed and fall asleep almost instanteneously. There are times when remarkable things happen and sometimes I even make it out, though rarely.
<br />

<br />
I think the only hards part is getting from awakened body to body asleep, mind awake (thats a good mantra actually, try repeating it for an hour one time, I'm sure you'll experience something interesting). And also people usually rush into it and try to force it. NEVER try to force an OBE, it has to come by itself. When it's time you will know, no doubt about that.
<br />

<br />
Anyways good luck people! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Check out Astral Dimensions by Robert Bruce. This gives a great method and I suggest you read the whole thing. I promise this will really help with your OBE's

Hope this helps!
