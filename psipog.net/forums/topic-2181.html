			I know this is kinda random and don't ask me how I even began to think of this, but could one build a shield to protect one from oneself? (ok lets get rid of the whole one deal.) What I mean is, can you make a shield to protect yourself from your own laziness or annoyiness or undiscipliness.

			Maybe not a shield, try programming a ball of psi programmed to keep your head in some sort of concentration.  A shield doesn't protect yourself from yourself XD a shield could also be called a &quot;filter&quot;.

well do you think it might be a bad idea? well i mean when you talk about neuros not reaching their destinies, wouldn't that happen when you try to discipline yourself? That's just an example, but I mean, when you try to change your &quot;personality&quot; (used cause lack of a better term) isn't that what happens anyway?

			Or you could end up messing up your brain completely and ending up with an IQ of 20. There's a reason why it's not reccomended to send psi to your head and major neural pathways.

hmmm. well i always thought that there was a natural build up of psi in the brain already. I mean...the brain is what wealds the psi in the first place. 
<br />

<br />
Causing harm to the brain like this also confuses me because of &quot;pretending&quot;. You guys are probably familiar w/ the concept but not the term. A friend and I coined the term for someone who repeats something in their head so many times that they begin to believe the lie. (To explain the term quickly: So let's say you want to be able to jump higher. You repeat in your head &quot;I can jump five feet&quot; and your body and mind condition themselves to achieve the task and then after some time (depending on the thing you're pretending) it becomes reality. )
<br />

<br />
Going along with pretending there are probably times where you could totally screw up your mind, but if you're pretending something like &quot;I can levitate the toothpick&quot; its just like practicing normal psi techniques. 
<br />
Do you see what I'm getting at? I'm not saying that that's the answer, but I'm just trying to play devil's advocate.

Steps:
<br />

<br />
Take a bath in epsum salt or sea sult,
<br />
Meditate whilst in the warm waters,
<br />
Burn insence, [meant to help with the goal]
<br />
Drink a hearbal potion, [meant to help with the goal]
<br />
Sit or lay
<br />
Close your eyes
<br />
Enter the mind.
<br />

<br />
Purification, progress, power, advancement, depth, understanding, nature, truth, etc.
<br />

<br />
Things can be deeply reprogrammed,
<br />
but the idea of shielding a part of yourself from yourself,
<br />
is repression.
<br />

<br />
Force and repression fail and weaken
<br />
When applied to the self or the nation.
<br />

<br />
What do you want for your destiny to be?

			I agree with MetaAlchemy, repression is temporary. It pops back up eventually. It can be useful for short term things though.
