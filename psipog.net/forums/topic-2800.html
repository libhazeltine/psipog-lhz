			Well, when I first started, I relaxed, and cleared my mind, like most people recommend. I then focused on the most direct part of the psi-wheel to my eyes, which was the corner. After I focused on the corner for a bit, I then tryed to move it with my hands. Sure, it took me more than 4 days, but it was worth it.

Besides that, it took me one week to move the pinwheel. My advice is that you don't worry too much how long it's gonna take, just keep at it and forget about it. The more you worry the harder it gets, in my experience.  Just clear your mind completely, forget where you are, forget who you are, forget what you are doing, forget what you have to do tomorrow or any other day, forget everything and feel good.

			I never passed the pin-wheel, I just skipped it and started to slide objects, didn't take me long since I never tried to slide anything until I was at the end of my hopes for success.

Well, I felt the same way, when I couldn't move it after a certain amount of time. But when it did move, boy, was I happy. But anyways, heres what I did: I relaxed, cleared my mind, and focused on a folded part of the psiwheel. When all that is done, I act like that I have seen it happen before, and I expect it to move. Sometimes, you have to trick yourself and say that it moves, in order to trick your subconscious. It took me like 2 and a half weeks to move it. I have more techniques that I use in my journal in the link in my signature that says My Journal. (You may have to press the link that says March 2006 to the left when you get there, and click on new techniques)If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

I remember it so clearly. I thought i just give it a try for a couple of days. I had some (actually quite alot) experience in energymanipulation so i pushed the wheel with my energy. First day no result (tried it for 2 minutes), second day after i performed my daily ritual in recharging my energy i tried again. A soon as my finger was half an inch away, and i pushed it with energy, the wheel allmost jumped of the pin.

Hearth pounding, adrenaline rushing, fear and excitement. :Victory dance

Btw it is not your surroundings that makes the differance, it is the way you feel in your surrounding. You just have to feel comfortable and at ease.

Yeah they are very unoriginal. I got pass the stage by just slowly moving onto different objects. No great trick about it.
