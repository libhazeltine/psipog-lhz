			It's been a very long time since I posted here since I had to take a Psi-break.
<br />
Anyway, I decided to start over, beginning with subconcious communication.  I haven't eally gotten too far since I have trouble with meditation, but sometimes, when 'm very relaxed-usually when i'm about to go to sleep, I will here random sentences and someties pictures.  For example, recently I heard &quot;In spanish&quot; as a command.  Is this a sign of my subconcious communicating with me?

It's more the random output of your brain, similar to dreaming; especially as you said it often happens just as you're going to sleep. I think most people experience this and though it could be interpreted as information from your subconscious in the way as dreaming is, it's nothing out of the ordinary. 
<br />

<br />
I suggest you carry on with meditation.

Ok thanks, Anyway, I didn't want to start a new topic for this so 'll post it here.  I have been practicing the Chapter 10 method and I think I have been getting somewhere.  Only problem is, I ran out of questions.  Can anybody give a few good questions to ask myself <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" /> ?
