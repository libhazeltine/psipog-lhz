I wouldn't dare to say that, even tough there are things like psi who would break some laws it wouldn't make the whole physic science useless.

I mean we've achieved so much over those years the majority HAS to be correct just think about nuclear reactors or computers.

Well I didn?t say this either.
<br />

<br />
Besides, who knows, maybe <span style="text-decoration: underline">all the laws we know now</span> are 100% right but the problem is that MAYBE <span style="text-decoration: underline">we don?t know all of them</span> <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
And when I say rethinking I mean looking again on the assumptions that were made when the physics theories were build. Yes I know that those were proven right by experiments, but maybe there are other forces that in normal conditions are neutral or constant (lets say the forces that are &quot;psi&quot; and not only), that way all the experiments will show the same unless you find a way to change those other forces when you want (by will).
<br />

<br />
For example there is Albert Veynik about whom I wrote in the scepticism ? My Pyramid Experiment post by peebrain, in his book &quot;Thermodynamics of real processes &quot; he assumes that some laws/assumptions of thermodynamics are not correct and if that is so many phenomenon that by those couldn?t be true now could be explained.
<br />

<br />
P.S: I didn?t read the book just the prologue so don?t ask me to say how he proves anything. And I doubt that I have enough knowledge in physics to understand what he says. Maybe in 2 or 3 years I will if I decide to take relevant courses in my university

			You know... even Albert Einstein, whos theories are beyond normal human comprehension, are wrong in some way. Physicists are those kind of scienctist that gleefully knock down a theory, however long it's history, in favour of a better one that could better explain the workings of nature and the mysteries of the universe. Just look at Newton, most of his laws are crap on the atomic level...
<br />

<br />
Physicist have no other common goal other than the Theory of Everything, which is supposedly able to define, explain and predict all things in the universe... So when they found that Newton's law is inconsistent with the space-time theory, they scrapped it and replace it with Einstein's Curved Space-Time Gravity. And now that they discovered Quantum Gravity, they dismissed Eintein's Theory as well, because the Quantum Theory better explains some phenomena they don't understand.
<br />

<br />
So, eventually, they will come to a point where they realise something deeper, that is capable of explaining the psi phenomena with flawless logic, and they will say: hey, isn't this the stuff those absent-minded psedo-scientists are trying to do all along? And voila, psionics become a branch of applied physics...lol
<br />

<br />
As they say, Physics is the King of Science, and it attempts to explain all that happens in the universe. But ironically, the scienctist that have done research on psi are mostly medical people, which are truly adept in terms of bodily functions and human physiology, but they often lack the understanding of physics to make a connection somehow... since it would be rediculous to suggest that homo-sapiens are the only organism in the wole universe with special access to this kind of power. 
<br />

<br />
Maybe if Einstein is born in the 21st century, he would be a psion himself,
<br />
&quot;My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind.&quot;- Einstein.

So like Rainsong said, I think this stuff is a threat to the ruling powers. Imagine if everyday citizens were using telepathy to access a rival company's trade secrets, or to find out who is a spy, etc. It would wreak small havoc if it was considered legitimate.

then we would need to start using occlumency  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> , and problem is solved. or shields, and stuff.
<br />

<br />
anyway, i wonder how would it be on schools.... and universities too...
<br />
how would you prevent one of your students of telling the other one the tests results, and stuff? or for someone to &quot;copy/paste&quot; the other guy answers on the university admition tests?
<br />
maybe some mind/cerebral wave-blocking devices on the rooms, like that ones they use to block cel phones frequencies? it would pull out a big set of stuff!!
<br />

<br />
&quot;protect your thoughts, use wave blocker 3000&quot;. think about!
<br />

<br />
or it could just end up in a big mess and there would be no tests on schools anymore  <img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" />

<br />
It is in the governments interest to continue to deny its existance. They know what it is, and its power. Enough research has been done to prove  elementary concepts which easily justify more advanced research, but none is made.  
<br />

<br />
The high level research is not done because it is not in the financial interests of the government to back it; and many private organizations with the funding are either influenced by the govt, or are not interested in such fluff. 
<br />

<br />
Knowledge of Energy/PSI= Power, Knowledge, Individuality, Reasoning
<br />

<br />
You cannot control a intelligent, powerful group of citizens. They will rebel and have you repealed from your position. Unless, of course, you are acting within the best interests of the people; which in this case, they are obviously not.
<br />

<br />
I will step into speculation here and say that is exactly why the WTC came down. To control the will of the American people.  A country instilled with fear is easily swayed and influenced. Wars, unreasonable bills and acts, all justified and accepted under false pretenses. 
<br />

<br />
A country overwhelmed by fear and insecurity is also not going to spend their time postulating new outlandish ideas (psi). They are going to be worrying if their next door neighbour is going to come over and murder them in their sleep. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;America is safe once again, because we destroyed the threat.&quot; 
<br />
They fail to mention, they created the threat.
<br />

<br />

<br />
THE BOTTOM LINE.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
The media controls the world. If the media will accept it; the world will. </span>The media is influenced, and in many cases, directly controlled by the government.
<br />

<br />
If all the scientists in the world come a new concensus, and that is: PSI is real; without the support of the media it will never become a global concept. If the media says this idea is crazy, or even 'blashpemous', then the new energy paradigm is doomed. This is the sad reality we live in. 
<br />

<br />
The more individuals who experience, practice, and share their experience the greater the force of the masses will prevail; but only once we are free enough from fear and falshood can we hold our own opinions against the media.
<br />

<br />
You cannot prove anything to someone who has already accepted it doesn't exist. They can only prove it to themselves.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Love how you knew that so well,  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> 
<br />
I read in a book before (Three roads to quatumn gravity, by Lee Smolin), that i believe a example in is that book that speaks of Einstein that i agree with. Imagine that the world is a car, now what Einstein given us is the mannel to work the car. But not how the car works in gernal. We can use Einsteins work to explain things on our scale of the universe. Even string, loop, and expansion theory have there flaws. Even Einstein died trieing to find a GUT. Newton was indeed flawed but his works are still useful. Physics is indeed king <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> it works on the really foundation of realitory which is why I love it. 
<br />

<br />
However I must add is that its impossible to know everything in the universe. Seeing we are the pawn on the chessboard. Hehehe for example light shinning off metal is still a phemoena
