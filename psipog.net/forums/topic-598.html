<br />
By JoeT </span>
<br />

<br />
Over my years of studying and practicing psionics I have always been interested in performing and hosting experiments. As you all know, I practice and teach telekinesis on a daily basis. During that time I have heard the same question and complain ?I cant spin the psi-wheel under a glass. Joe, any suggestions?? and I've always pondered ?does the glass effect the motion of the psi-wheel?, or is it just a distraction in which we prejudge it will be harder to move?&quot;. So I decided to host an experiment to figure this mystery out. 
<br />

<br />
The main problem of this experiment was figuring out how I was going to find a good candidate to help me with this experiment. I?ll admit I was hopeless even with the people I teach, simply because they have already grown skill wise and have moved on to bigger objects. I needed a candidate who had no prior knowledge or experience with telekinesis  to help me with this experiment. Luckily, I meet the absolutely best person for this experiment. Her name was Amanda, I see her around school a lot and happened to be in one of my classes. We have always talked about the paranormal and other topics that we like to discuss about. One day, she mentioned that she was interested in telekinesis and how she was thinking about practicing it. I jumped with excitement and said ?I?ll gladly teach you?. Now you may be asking yourself ?Why is she the best person for this experiment?? Well my curious friend, she is blind. This makes it perfect because not only will she not know if she is moving the psi-wheel, she won?t be able to tell if there was a glass over it. 
<br />

<br />
Now, I did not tell her about the experiment simply because I didn?t want her to make the same analogy that most do when they hear ?There will be a glass over the psi-wheel? and believe it will be harder to move. So I started to teach her from the beginning. I went over the basics and she got results surprisingly fast. After around a week of spinning the wheel, I taught her how to control the psi-wheel. This was a little difficult because she could not see the wheel and all my techniques I have on control are made for visualization and seeing the object. So I decided the best way to help her know if she was moving the wheel was to teach her how to connect with the paper and feel the paper. This is widely known as ?becoming one with the object?. Within a week or so, she learned to connect with the paper correctly and was starting to know if and when she was moving the object. 
<br />

<br />
After around three weeks she was beginning to ask ?what can I move next??, so I knew that I should perform the test soon. The next day I brought in a small drinking glass that would cover the psi-wheel while still giving it space to spin. So we sat down and started to practice. I said ?Okay, tomorrow will work on moving a marble so lets make this last day of practice on the psi-wheel good?. She agreed and was excited about the next day. While she was spinning the psi-wheel she stopped and went to the bathroom. I knew this was the perfect opportunity to place the glass over the wheel, so I did. When she came back she was oblivious to the fact that there was a glass over the wheel and sat down. She talked for about a minute or two then went into spinning the psi-wheel. Just as I expected, the wheel moved the same way it was without the glass. There was no time difference either. It was exactly what I thought would happen. She continued to spin and control the wheel threw out the session until she put her hand by the glass and went &quot;Hey there's a cup over it&quot;. I then explained the experiment and how she helped me with it. 
<br />

<br />
This small experiment helps show that the only thing stopping the psi-wheel to move under the glass is yourself and how you prejudice this new obstacle. It?s all in your head. Think of it like this; your playing basketball with a few of your friends, you and your friends are winning easily and having fun. Then a couple of bigger guys come up to you and your friends asking ?want to play with us??. What?s going through your head? Your thinking these guys are bigger and taller than us, you?ll be sure to lose. You see, your doubting yourself straight off the bat and that is what makes you lose. 
<br />

<br />
The glass is just a distraction, come into practice with your head held high and know that it does nothing except place the wheel in a secure location. So keep that in mind the next time your practicing. I would like to thank Amanda for helping me with this experiment. Thank you for reading and I hoped this helped.

			Very cool Joe, great confirmation that the glass is a mere distraction.
<br />

<br />
And what's really cool is that we may be able to apply the reason we CAN'T move things to the fact that a distraction such as glass, even when we're able to move the psi wheel without it, can hinder us so greatly.
<br />

<br />
Again, Awesome!

I?ve always had trouble with the wheel under glass; I hope this will convince my subconscious that it's just a distraction.

That was a really cool experiment - why are disabled people so awesome? I mean, you've got a blind girl who wants to do psionics, and I have a deaf guy who wants to also.
<br />

<br />
O_o, but we first need to be able to move the wheel before we can face the mental challenge of overcoming the fear of the glass, right? Or should we START with the glass overtop and give ourselves a head-start?

			What a great post. Thanks JoeT.

I have noticed that when I try and fail to move something bigger I am in that same mindset as when I try and fail to move the wheel under the glass. I guess, from that point of view, your post can also be applied to the difficulty people have with moving bigger objects as well. Nice.
<br />

<br />
I have noticed for some time that there <span style="font-style: italic">seemed</span> to be a conflict with the object moving at times...like there was another control keeping it still or something. I keep encountering this sensation and kept concluding that it was my &quot;eyes&quot; that was stopping it. Your post has helped to clarify that for me. Thanks. 
<br />

<br />
I also found it fantastic that she could <span style="font-weight: bold">really</span> feel it. I often wondered if it was just my brain that &quot;invented&quot; the feeling and that it wasn't reliable. After your post, I can work on trusting that feeling more and letting go of what I see. Again, thanks.

I find it quite interesting that she got to this point in 4 weeks, and could feel the wheel. Very nice.

You've even motivated me to get back into things again - I've been idle for about a year now

			Wow that is completely amazing. It all goes to prove that the mind is your greatest barrier. What you see definitely affects your perception of the world around you and in order to do PK stronger or on bigger objects you just have to get past the doubt that you can't do it or that it is physically impossible. This wonderful experiment may help many people with doing PK through a glass or on bigger objects and it will definitely help me. These posts are the kind we need on the Psipog forums. Thanks Roy.

			Great expirement JoeT... Nicely done...
<br />

That's why I tell to people not to try to spin a psiwheel covered, you should just move on with things uncovered (Spin, roll, slide), and as you start to gain more power and such, your confidence will increase, and you'll be also moving things covered in no time.

			That was a pretty cool experiment, I think a lot of the barriers people encounter when working with this kind of thing are psychological almost as much as they have anything to do with a persons ability, and experiments like this prove it.

			Great. Another genius post by you, joe.
<br />

<br />
i?ve always seen the theorie of the &quot;mind barrier&quot; as the most likely. and now it?s kinda proofed.
<br />

<br />
This leads to the quesion: Is it harder to move a car than a pen?
<br />

<br />
But this needs a completely clear mind. every person has this mind barrier...

			Very interesting experiment Joet, yet I have one lingering question on my mind.  How can you be so sure that she was the one moving the covered psi-wheel?  Not only were you in the room with her, but some portion of your attention had to be focused on the covered psi-wheel, due to the fact that you saw it move with your own eyes.  The simple fact that you saw it move means that some portion of your attention, whether small or large, was directed towards the psi-wheel.  Also, with your years of psionic experimentation and your alleged (sp?) psychokinetic abilities (&quot;alleged&quot; hinging upon the validity of your videos) would it be safe to assume that at your &quot;level&quot; you could spin a simple covered psi-wheel?  This is not meant to call your abilities, videos, theories, or character into question, and is in no way an attack/insult to them.  I simply would like to know upon what you base your theory that covering a psi-wheel is a simple mental block, and should not create a problem for someone who could already spin it.

			Well, I'm pretty sure with that much experience, he could control whether he's using PK or not.
<br />

<br />
My interpretation of what you said, was, &quot;How do you know the wheel was moving at the same speed? Could you have possibly helped her, unconsciously?&quot;
<br />

<br />
(I'll voice the same opinion - I'm not calling you into question or anything, just pointing out my side)
<br />

<br />
All I have to say, past the fact that he should be able to control whether he's using his abilities or not, is to get her to do it again, except with him not thinking about it, and with a videocam.
