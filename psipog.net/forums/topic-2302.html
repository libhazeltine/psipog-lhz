			k, i'll start with a summary for those who dont want to read all the stuff. basically, i started a while back getting pulled to this place on the astral plain, mostly againced my will though if i tried really hard i could stop it from happening. there was a bunch of monsters and the tower contains one monster on each floor and the only way up was killing the monster. i've been working on climbing it for a long time.
<br />

<br />
long story for detail:
<br />

<br />
it began for me, roughly 3 years ago or so, something like that, it just began with daydreams, they seemed normal enough for someone who is bored with normal life, monsters showed up and i killed them. no big deal right? well, they just kept comming. one dream after the next i saw monsters attacking people i knew, and i always tried my best to protect them. 
<br />

<br />
i didnt think they were more than daydreams for the longest time, until i tried to stay out of them, each time i did, it became harder, until one day outside of walmart i was sitting in the car waiting for my parents to come back, when a daydream started, the monsters were back, exept i was no longer in a place i knew. 
<br />

<br />
it was a cliff, it twisted once around to reach the floor, and the red and black monsters, that reminded me of molten rock, and appeared to be it from the hight of the cliff as they were so packed together. and i realized, i could not wake up. i had to fight until i mannaged to awaken at some point when three white phantom skulls started running through the crowds of monsters and one touched me. 
<br />

<br />
since that point, i kept appearing in that place, until i found there was a tower. i figured, that was as good a place to go as any. i found out by then, that the basic rule here was that the more i resisted going to the daydream, the harder it would be the next time, and when i go, it becomes easier to resist. so i just went whenever it would not be a problem so i could stop when it would be. 
<br />

<br />
inside the tower, each floor consisted of a single monster. the ones inside the tower were much stronger than the ones outside. i believe it was around the 9th floor that i met the demon. when i discribed him to anatares, she recognised him as the same one that keeps showing up in her dreams. 
<br />

<br />
anyways, he showed up as an outsider, the actual monster was a giant. mannaging finnally to beat the giant he locked the path to the stairs, so i'd have to fight him. took several tries to get to beat him, the way i got past was when i switched to having G out, oh that was another thing, since i'm using visualization instead of OBE i cant consentrate enough to handle having me and g and viet with me out at the same time. 
<br />

<br />
anyway, g came out, and used some darkness attack where he basically turned himself into a practical missle. which stunned the demon enough to get by. 
<br />

<br />
later on, on about floor 11 he showed up again, this time he replaced the tower monster by killing it before we got here. again he kept beating us, he even sliced G's neck open to where it took days of almost constant psi healing and forcing him not to do anything to get him fixed up. thankfully spirits heal faster than physical people. -_-' 
<br />

<br />
when we finnally got back, G wanted me to 'trust him' and let him handle the fight. so i did, and he did something, his eyes changed, and he attacked with a tidal wave of black energy, knocking the demon to the ground, then before the demon could get up, G grabbed it's neck and slammed his sword into the ground next to his head. and demanded that he let them pass. 
<br />

<br />
i asked G why he didnt just kill the guy, and he said that the demon might have answers. but didnt say to what questions. Anatares told me that she had her own questions that she wanted answered herself. 
<br />

<br />
after that, G dissapeared, and anatares suggested i check the tower, and he was there, he had rampaged up several floors, and i ended up having to hold him down with viet, so that i could get in, we fought some demon that used lightning shurikens, that connected into a whip. it was a tiresome fight, and eventually i was hit, and paralized, and as the guy picked my limp body up, G switched in, kicked the guy in the sencitive spot, beat him a bit, then picked the guy up and said 
<br />

<br />
&quot;why did you bring us here?&quot; 
<br />

<br />
the other demon replied &quot;because i thought you'd have died sooner&quot; 
<br />

<br />
g then said &quot;bad answer&quot; and threw him off the tower. we thought that was the roof, but later on i found out there was a hidden elevator pad that goes up to higher floors. 
<br />

<br />
about since then he'd been causing trouble outside the tower. such as attempting to possess me twice, the first time i got help from anatares with breaking the viel and getting enough energy to make my own shield againced him. the second time, G put himself inside the viel to make a 'hole' for me to get to the astral plain through and get a litle energy from. 
<br />

<br />
during that second attempt, the demon had been drawing my personality away from me, and G had to intersept the drain and take the personality, and give me his. when i fought the guy with g's personality, i was able to do a 'light' version of g's dark attack and beat him. 
<br />

<br />
just a bit ago, on the 26th floor i think, its the 26th anyway, since g's rampage i dont know for sure, the demon that had shown up on floors 9 and 11 and anatares's dreams showed back up, and fought us again. we fought again until he said 'well its been fun' and turned around and vanished. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
yah, lots has been happening. XD anyway, if you mannaged to read all that, i'd like to shake your hand <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> i copied and pasted that from a different forum i had posted it on cause i dont have much time left. more has happened since posting it though. i'll finish posting the rest when i have more time.

			Possible explanation #6, consult a psychologist.
<br />

<br />
Seriously. Not everything having to do with your psyche is psychic. Psionics and psychology are not mutually exclusive. I'll restrain myself from going off into a rant and simply state that too many people assume psionic causes for things that do not necessarily have psionic causes, and more probably have conventional psychological causes.
<br />

<br />
Scratch that. I just read the second half of your post. Please visit a psychologist at your earliest possible convenience; without crossing into medical discussion I will simply state that this quite possibly could be an early stage of schizophrenia, a treatable condition. (Mods, if that crosses a line into medical advice, truncate the sentence at the semicolon.)

			im just going with elaborate daydream. I mean it has to be.

As for the everyone thinking a psionic explanation for not so psionic happenings... I think people that dont beleive in psi have the same thing happening. Everything is a rational explanation for some psionic happenings, but this from what it sounds like, is pure imagination.

			well, the problem with the skitzophrenia and daydream theories (and i had considered those possibilities before) was the involvement between me and another person. the demon that kept showing up was the same one that keeps showing up in anatares's dreams, i cant just have immagined it, due to the odds of me immagining a person identical to the one attacking her is slim.
<br />

<br />
i can rule skitzophrenia out due to asking Viet to find anatares and help her,the demon had threatened her and she was offline so i couldnt warn her XD i dont know how to do telepathy, and when he left, i no longer heard him, and anatares could, though she has a problem with her mind being a loud one, and him being a very quiet 'person', so she could really only tell when he was talking, but not really able to able to understand what he says. plus i've been told that with multiple personalities the different personalities are normally unaware of eachother.
<br />

<br />
almost outa time again XD i should have a bunch more time in a couple hours, during computer science class.

			Maybe it is some sort of wierd shared schizophrenia (spelling?) because you guys are good friends and are psychically linked.  Or you are just all projecting into each others minds, or you guys have something to complete in wherever you are (which would be  the obvious one if it isn't your imagination <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />).

			well, this thing started a while before we ended up becoming linked. 
<br />

<br />
oh yah, the other things that have happened still need to be posted XD
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
ok, on one of those floors(i have trouble remmembering at times which floors things happened), i came across this glowing blue orb just floating in the middle, not sure what it was, i aproached it, with my 'sword' ready in case it was hostile (which everything up to then was, so i had a good reason) when i got closer to it, a female apeared from it, dressed in blue, her outfit was more floating around her rather than her actually wearing anything. she saw my sword out, and i suppose she thought i was the hostile one, and she flew at me, and i ducked and cut her side. she fell to the floor and appeared to be crying. 
<br />

<br />
i said 'its not my fault, you are the one who attacked first' then she looked up, toward me, then flew off, just as the walls started to change dark, and i turned around in time to see some sort of black dragon headed shadow thing, i suppose the 'dragon of the darkest flame' from yuyu hakusho is the closest discription, for simplicity, i dodged it, and the residu stayed put, and the head came out of the opposite wall at me again.
<br />

<br />
i switched out with Viet, cause he is rather athletic, dispite the fact he takes hits rather poorly. and he doged it until the entire floor was covered in it, and i had to go back in, and jump onto my sword and use it as though it were a pogostick in order to stay out of the shadow stuff. just as there seemed to be noplace left, the thing shattered into small black orbs, that rolled into one spot and it turned into that same demon that has been showing up.
<br />

<br />
after talking with anatares, she said the one i met there was called Sadira, and she was another person who was in her dreams for a while exept, not evil like that demon was. after i tried calling her, and talking to her twice (i cant tell most of it, she kind of left the impression that she wouldnt want me telling everybody) i found out he name of the demon that keeps showing up was Delmr, so now we have a name for the face. XD

<br />
Perhaps I missed something, but we still have no idea who these &quot;Anatares&quot;, &quot;Viet&quot;, and &quot;G&quot; characters are in your wonderful saga.
<br />

<br />
You also sort of need to clarify as to what form, exactly, these experiences take on. Do they happen while you are sleeping, while trying to get to sleep, or while fully awake? Does anything that you do seem to trigger them? How often do you get them? What are your senses like in them - do you see, hear, smell, feel, and taste just as if you were in the real world? How much control do you have over the surroundings?
<br />

<br />
If you want anyone to do anything more than say &quot;umm&quot; in many more words than necessary and/or to make completely random guesses, you're going to have to provide some pretty necessary information.

			sorry, i'm used to them, i'll explain.
<br />

<br />
anatares, is a friend of mine, she is human. and she goes to this site, though she hasnt used the forums, she also uses the name anatares on gaiaonline. she lives in canada, though where i'll leave at her disgression to or not to reviel.
<br />

<br />
G is a spirit who showed up quite a few years ago, his interests involve, fighting, fighting, and making people angry. he clames his 'job' is to keep me safe, though i think his advice gets me into more trouble than anything. so i normally listen to him, then do the exact opposite of what he says. (he is also the king of lame phrases.) the image he appears to me in, looks muscular, tall, he has black short hair that is slightly spiked, his sword is sort of like a katana exept pitch black.
<br />

<br />
Viet is also a spirit, he showed up more recently, he said G wasnt doing a good job, well, thats a big DUH, and you could probrably tell, it was like having a dog and cat in my head, every time on would say something, the other had to contradict it. Viet is more logical though, and in the tower, he uses i guess for a lack of a better word magic for fighting, he takes hits like a girl. no offence to the girls out there. but yah, if he gets hit by anything, he has to retreat. he is sort of tall, but not as tall as me or g, has white hair, and what looks a lot like Aladin's prince outfit, exept absolutelly nothing on it was any color but white. and no, he does not have a scymitar or anything, though i think that would match his look XD
<br />

<br />
at the beggining it litterally was being pulled in, i would be sitting somewhere or something fully consious, and suddenly i'd be at the tower. in the very beggining i couldnt leave on my own, i'd just return whenever i would end up returning. after a bit i was able to stop myself from going and come back at will.
<br />

<br />
in order to get there, i focus on the tower, close my eyes, and use the visualization method of astral projection. i'm working on learning the obe method so i can experience it better and not have to focus so hard constantly. 
<br />

<br />
my surroundings mostly have a realistic phsysics to them, i cant melt walls or anything with my mind or change things around like i can when i'm elsewhere on the astral plain. 
<br />

<br />
depending on how well i can consentrate at the time i have slightly different sences, obviously i can always see. i dont think i smelt or tasted anything yet, but i have on occasion had my feeling of touch, which isnt very pleasent. considering that the whole time i'm in the tower i'm in a fight basically, feeling things isnt good XD
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
G and Viet talk to me through some form of spirit to person telekenisis or something like that. when Viet was over at anatares's place, she couldnt hardly hear him because her mind is cluttered and him being quiet and overly polite, he never 'spoke' loud enough for her to understand him.
