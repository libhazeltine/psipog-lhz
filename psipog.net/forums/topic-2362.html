			So i've come to the conclusion that one of the first skills you should learn before even attempting to do any psionic skill is focus. yes i know you can learn focus and practice whatever skill you're working on, but it just seems its better as a prequisite rather than a let's try some stuff and figure it out later. 
<br />
i mean, its just easier. learning to focus will help w/ so much more than psionic practice. it works for school, work, life in general. and when you learn to focus, you also learn your limitations and how slow you should progress in order to keep yourself healthly. 
<br />
like i said you can learn it while practicing but i really think its worth learning before thats all. it's taken me five years to come to this conclusion and i bet that if thats what i have started with in the beginning, i wouldn't have such a tough time with it now. granted i think i have some sort of ADD thing, but still. i wouldnt have to worry about staying focus now if i had only learned it before. 
<br />
different things work for different people, so im not trying to force or generalize this on anyone but if i had students i would definitely teach them this first. 
<br />
but hey any takers on this?

			I would suggest meditating. Since I started that, I have been able to focus better.Great way to practice at the same time too. Just sit there, relax and gather energy until you can't feel your nerves. lol
