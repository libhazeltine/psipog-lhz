Thanks in advance!

EDIT: .....Please? I realize there's a likely chance it's  been stolen, but intsinct's telling me otherwise. So if you'd be willing to give it a whirl, I'd really appreciate it.

			I find it rather interesting how the assistance interests of this populace lie.

I don't know what it is that turns everyone off of helping me, but if I've done something incorrectly in the first post when I asked help, I'd appreciate it if you could alert me.
<br />
It's not the most comforting feeling to be passed over.
<br />
Don't think I'm bitching, though, or throwing a fit, or... any of those types of negative responses. I'm just curious why some people have multiple responses and others are passed over, and if it has anything to do with the nature of the object or with the way the favor was asked.

Whether it be for advice or assistance, thanks in advance!

i've found that its the catchyness of the tittle and then the length of the stuff on the page.
<br />

<br />
if you have a nice catchy tittle alot of people tend to be atracted to it.
<br />

<br />
if you have something stupid written down you get very newby responces from very newby people. If you have alot of well written and interesting things in your post then you get a more educated responces and people posting.
<br />

<br />
Tards tend to not like reading much and attracted to shiny objects (tittles in this case) so yah....

...Nope. I've checked all the wooden furniture in my room, and it isn't there.
