The link above should explain what the hell I'm on about  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
An idea that I find quite interesting. I'd be interested to know if anyone here has ever generated a construct with someone they trust? (or maybe not trust and have regretted it) 
<br />

<br />
Much of what is said in the link makes a great deal of sense to me. Certain groups do influence peoples behaviour but do you think this is due to a construct of a egregores magnitude? Do you think normal people have the energy to create something like this unconsciously? I'd be interested to read others opinions. 
<br />

<br />
I'd like to make it clear that I refer to an egregore as an energetic construct and dismiss any religous meanings that people would put to this term. The last paragraph on the page is particularly interesting.

			From my understanding of links (which I'm not all that confident about now) They're more of a telepathic thing aren't they? And empathic. Links seem to be more of a communication thing where egregores are working towards whatever they've been programmed to work towards. 
<br />

 An egregore has the characteristic of having an effectiveness greater than the mere sum of its individual members. It continuously interacts with its members, influencing them and being influenced by them. The interaction works positively by stimulating and assisting its members but only as long as they behave and act in line with its original aim. It will stimulate both individually and collectively all those faculties in the group which will permit the realization of the objectives of its original program. If this process is continued a long time the egregore will take on a kind of life of its own, and can become so strong that even if all its members should die, it would continue to exist on the inner dimensions and can be contacted even centuries later by a group of people prepared to live the lives of the original founders, particularly if they are willing to provide the initial input of energy to get it going again. (Thats not me babbling its just a cut and paste job from the link above) 
<br />

<br />
To sum up an egregore is a construct that can take on a life of its own as long as theres enough energy put into it. Its always restricted to its original programming however. And its always made with more than one person. 
<br />

<br />
 A second significant reason for insisting on this point is the subject of the egregores. What is an egregore? It is the psychic and astral entity of a group. All members of a group, a family, a club, a political party, a religion or even a country, are psychically included in the egregore of the organization to which they belong. Of course, each of us belongs to several egregores at once. Therefore, each individual who is involved in a group receives the influences of the egregores, that is the astral counterpart of the group, in his psyche. This process is unconscious. The resulting drawbacks are, first, some perturbating psychic influences in the majority of cases, and second, a restriction of inner freedom. It is impossible to free oneself from certain egregores, for example the egregores of the country you live in. However, we should free ourselves from all egregores which are not essential. An egregore actually grows by drawing support from the members which constitute it who, in turn, through their repeated actions vivify it, somehow helping it to maintain its power. For a beginner, this is where the danger lies, all the more because of the tendency of man to seek protection, the price of which is often a loss of freedom. We should emphasize here that the association the Philosophers of Nature does not perform any group ritual in order to reduce the influence of its egregore to a minimum. (Another cut and paste job) 
<br />

<br />
This is the paragraph I find most interesting because it suggests that many large groups create egregores unconsciously. And that they can influence us if we're a part of the group. I thought it was interesting anyway  <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" />

			Links are still a construct, though their purpose is usually telepathic or empathic.  It still serves to demonstrate that it does happen.

			I know about egregores I've come across them in magick. Basically it's like creating a powerful thoughtform kinda like making a &quot;deity&quot; in a sense as they are supiouir to all other thoughtforms and can in fact be intelligent the extent of thier intelligence I would assume depends on how much energy and how many ppl their are contribing to it. I am unsure about drawing energy from it but I am sure it is possible in magick they use it as thoughform to accomplish tasks, and such.
