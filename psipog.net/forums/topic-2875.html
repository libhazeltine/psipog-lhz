			i need help with a simple idea. would a person beable to &quot;overload&quot; a target in to saying things?  I was thinking that one could somehow get the sub-c in to making the target say things.  It would be hard, but could it be done?

			Yes. I've done it many times, but im still unable to understand exactly how I do it. All i know is that it creates a slight &quot;ghost pressure&quot; around a certain part of the top right of my head.
<br />

<br />
Edit: and sometimes it's hard to discern whether i've tricked their mind into saying it first, or if im just either sending my thought to them or it's being sent to me by them just before they say it and I have to question whether to interpret it as one or the other. It's really quite confusing sometimes. But most times I know what's going on.

			Well, many things are possible even if not included on articles  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

My advice is to check by yourself is it possible instead of asking here, much more fun from learning new thing ...

Correct. Getting someone to say something is very possible and a form of telepathic suggestion. I can do it on occassion. First I establish the connection and imagine the message traveling from my mind to theirs and processing. I also send a signal when doing suggestion, that makes them feel like they have no choice but to say something or do something. I try that all the time and I've only gotten it to work a few times. The most memorable time was when I wanted to go get ice cream at McDonalds when I was traveling with my Mom. She wasn't going to stop there but I focused on the message and the connection and such and I hear her say &quot;I'm going to stop at McDonalds and get a coke.&quot; The next message I tried to send was &quot;Do you want anything?&quot; about 2 seconds later, that was the next thing I heard. The ice cream was yummy too.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
