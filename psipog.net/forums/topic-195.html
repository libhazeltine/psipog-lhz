			The Integration of Psi into one?s body.
<br />

<br />
At Psipog we are reaching to find out more about this mysterious power which to be intertwined with everything we do. In truth and I?m sure we all agree, we barely know anything about this sort of energy. Hell, it seems like people 400 years ago knew more about this then we do now. So I would like to try and bring in another discipline to Psipog, the ability to use Psi to manipulate one?s body. 
<br />

<br />
	It seems as thought people are getting all worked up about this ?new? form of Psi manipulation where you can alter your body. Infact it isn?t new, at all. Its very old but its just not taught anywhere.
<br />

<br />
	I?ve worked with this skill for 6 years and have gotten it into a way where I can somewhat tame it. I?ve observed it and researched it. I cannot tell you if what everyone says is true. I do not know if the energy you use is completely different then Psi. I believe it is manipulated Psi. Just like how your body takes amino acids and turns it into protein I believe that our bodies take Psi can turn it into a more solid form of energy. It is essential to understand that the energy that you are using while learning this, is the energy your body keeps to live. From my observations your body is somewhat like a cup inside of a cup with a valve between them that can open and close. If you use none of your ?stored? energy then both part of the larger cup are filled with much heavier better quality energy. While if you use a lot of it the upper part of the cup gets drained of the quality energy and you can meditate to fill it back up, but only with regular psi. The problem is that your body can?t use normal Psi to function, it can?t keep your heart beating. So that?s why there is the section part of your cup. It stores the energy that keeps you alive. If you needed all your larger cup?s worth of energy, you would die. I believe that the lower portion of your cup contains the same kind of energy in the upper part but it?s used to run your brain, your heart. While the energy in your upper part of your cup is used to run your immune system and your muscles and such. So overall You just have to make sure that you don?t push yourself too hard beause you can hurt yourself.
<br />

<br />
The uses for this technique are as follows (as far as I know):
<br />
 1. Healing ? you can pull this kind of energy to wounds to make them heal faster.
<br />
 2. Body strengthening ? you can use this energy and pull it into your muscles to make
<br />
    them stronger and more efficient.
<br />
 3. Charging your body ? Not only do you make your muscles more efficient but you 
<br />
			     Bring your whole body to a more efficient state.
<br />
 4. Dulling pain ? self explanatory
<br />

<br />
Downfalls ? the problem with using this energy is that you don?t have it afterward. Its pretty easy to understand. You are basically using your psi to make yourself stronger for a shorter period of time. So while your strength goes up, your energy goes down. That is the downfall. Unless you train yourself very hard, you can?t sustain this state of efficiency for very long and afterward you will be tired.
<br />

<br />
Warnings ? DO NOT push yourself too far. I?ve gotten very sick for pushing myself too far. But it?s the same with anything, if you run too much in the sun and keep running while you?re tired, you can get heat stroke. Because some of your immune system is based off of the original cup if you use too much up, you can get sick easy.
<br />

<br />
Make sure you read the beginning first.
<br />

<br />
The technique ?
<br />
	As I said before the idea is that you are pulling the energy that your body stored into your muscles. 
<br />

<br />
Step 1. The basic thing to do is to meditate until you can feel ever muscle in your body (not the heart but like your arm muscles and neck muscles etc.) Don?t feel them with your hand, or flex them. You need to have your mind go along each muscle and feel with your psi. You have to feel the flow of psi move throughout your body and touch each muscle. Once you?ve done this you have to try and feel all of your muscles at once. Understand the flow of psi in and out of your body. Understand how your body works. After this is completed you can go onto step two.
<br />

<br />
Step 2. The next simple thing is being able to feel where the energy comes from. The best way and most efficient way is to feel the energy coming out of the base of your back/spine. Feel the energy relax and flow out through your body. Feel the energy fill you.
<br />

<br />
Step 3. Try to control this energy. Try and direct the energy to your arm. Feel it build up in your arm. Put it into your finger and feel how it feels as though your finger has a better feeling. This is how you heal your body. You let the energy sooth over a wound or a tired body. 
<br />

<br />
Step 4. Now try and Flex your arm and try to pull that energy into the flexed arm. It?s hard but imagine it entwining with your muscles, making them stronger. Feel you arm getting stronger. Push as much energy as you can into your arm. Then stop pushing the energy and feel how much stronger it is. It should feel less pain in the arm and it should be able to do more than you could before. This feeling will wear away if you do not maintain it.
<br />

<br />
Step 5. You could try and do this technique and push the energy throughout all your muscles while you flex to make your whole body faster and stronger. This is hard and dangerous.
<br />

<br />
Step 6. If you did the prior step. Take the time to let the energy sooth back over your as if it was a warm blanket comforting your tensed muscles. You need to relax your body.
<br />

<br />
Step 7. Is bringing your body to a higher state. You need to relax and then feel the energy surge throughout your body. Do not flex your body as you did in step 5 but surge through and awaken you. This is hard to imagine but its almost as if you are entwining your psi with your muscles but without the flexing and ?all over your body-. 
<br />

<br />
Step 8. If you combine step 5 and 7 you will have fully charged your body. Its easier to do step 7 before 5 if you are going to do them together.
<br />

<br />
Step 9. Meditate and feel the energy sooth you again. Relax.
<br />

<br />
Step 10. Eat and don?t try and do something too strenuous today if it was your first time.
<br />

<br />
Thats all I have. I?ll probably be editing this sometime because I?m just like that. Thank you for your time, and keep safe. 
<br />

			i like i like. The muscle thing def works, ive done it before. I use it when im sparring w/my friend and he begins to win. I kind of avoid him while charging myself. Both of us being psions as well, he verified this profound and signifigant increase in speed and psi.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			there is a theory shooting around in the scientific community (i believe it cause it makes perfect sense) that an average organism that relies on muscle movement uses at the most, 20-25 % of their muscle strength. this limit is implemented for a very good reason. if we used 50% or even 75 %, our muscles will tear themselves apart. this theory is proven in two ways.
<br />

<br />
1: drug addicts who use pcps or amphetamines are able to somehow overcome this limit through use of the drugs and are able to temporarily gain superhuman strength. i am not talking about lifting cars and whatnot but there have been police reports that men on an OD of pcp have been able to flip cars and punch holes in wood floors. (try it sometime. it hurts like hell.) one such occurence happened where i live. one man was near death on PCP and had been pushed down and subdued by police. once the drug reached it's climax, the man broke out of his handcuffs and snapped the leg bone of a police officer using his arms. the man was again subdued, but died later. the medical report, (which i had the pleasure of overhearing) indicated that his bicep and tricep muscles were completely torn up and he had bone fractures running up his forearm.
<br />

<br />
2: monks who are able to sucede into a deep enough trance can gain temporary strength unlikely for their muscle build. one particular incident was in a shiatsu book i had explaining a master carrying 4 monks on his shoulders while crawling on his arms and legs. 
<br />

<br />
my point is that i am wondering if this tecnique for the muscle boost raises the limit for muscle usage by a couple percent while healing any injuries-hense the psi in the muscles- at the same time. 
<br />

<br />
this is just a speculation but it would explain how it works.
<br />

<br />
and no, i am not a sceptic.
<br />

<br />
this, if true, poses some obious risks to it. if we push ourselves too much, then we risk hurting ourselves.
<br />

<br />
but that shouldn't stop you from trying it out yourself!!!

			I think I may have done this by accident, as my friend and I were talking about this the other day in detail, right before I made a psiball. Afterwards my arms hurt like hell, I couldn't do push-ups or anything later on, and I hadn't been doing anything strenuous that day...

			I've experimented with this kind of charging and it helped but it left me tired and exhausted. Love it though.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  Another thing is that using this in combination with exhaling on your <span style="font-weight: bold">left</span> foot allows me to sprint/run faster and longer.

I know this because of what I was taught, and what I've seen &amp; heard... I haven't attempted Kundalini yet, because of that reason. also; Kundalini is refered to as a serpent existing at the base of your spine, improper useage usually results in nerve damage or other injury. A friend of mine attempting to use Kundalini(with no training, mind you, just what they found on the net) and told me it felt like his head was about to get blown off- it's still attached, he said that was the feeling of it though, which corresponds to what I was taught on improperly using Kundalini. I haven't attempted it yet because of that mostly... I KNOW I'm not ready.

Don't shove philosophy down my throat. I know what Kundilini is, I know what its tied to, I know where its located, I know how its taught, I know about the chakras. believe me I know. What you don't know, is anything it feels like, or anyway to control it. You haven't tried it, basically, you just don't know. So stop acting like you do.

			Wow, that is pretty cool. I wonder if all living things have this life energy. If so you could (don't laugh) bring back the dead through the use of this life energy. I know this sounds far out, so don't jump my ass please, but it is a cool thought. Thanks for this post I'm going to try it out soon. Maybe next hour... Gym.

I wonder if all living things have this life energy. If so you could (don't laugh) bring back the dead through the use of this life energy. I know this sounds far out, so don't jump my ass please, but it is a cool thought. Thanks for this post I'm going to try it out soon. Maybe next hour... Gym.

Under my beliefs, the soul leaves the body once you die, so if you were to die, you would be unable to bring  a person back to life unless, you had their soul, and you could make all their rotted body parts come back to normal and fix the reason why they died.

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic"> To leave it or take it is your choice, i m not boasting anything, what is being written here is truth, I dont want to scare anyone but the truth remains the truth.</span>
<br />

<br />
Kundalini is an ancient Advance Yoga Art from India, it is believed that the human body is extention of universe, and the seeds of the omnipotent powers are hidden in the human body in the form of kundalini. There is a whole science and subject about kundalini itself, most of the articles on the net just talk about the chakra awakening and balancing, but the truth is that it is much more than that.
<br />

<br />
The roots are deeply realted to Hindu Religion, and their believes.
<br />
There are years of practices required and your karma plays a very important role, The awakening of the Kundalini is a very rigid and stringent process and the success rate is not even .01% because of the complexities. People only raise some parts of it and calim the complete kundalini , althought that is not the truth.
<br />

<br />
The art is powerful enough to turn Human into God , and as one of you mentioned in the above post that (can you wake a dead body) yes you can bring the soul back and wake them to life, although it is prohibited because the 1st rule is never alter any thing that is happening, bcoz everything is happening for a reason. It has a cause and its effect.
<br />

<br />
It starts with conditioning of the body, then mind and then soul, through great yoga exercises, then deep meditation practices for years are carried out with rituals, and various offerings to God ( Gayatri Saadhna), poorna ahuti yagya etc.
<br />

<br />
Since it is very dangerous and mother of all powers, it was not displayed or taught to public,It was passed as heritage by masters to few desciplies since in the wrong hands it will only lead to sheer disaster, just like some of the martial arts techniques.  Beyond  certain level even the chinese martial art techniques turn towards awakening of kundalini, and such techniques and masters are really hard to find in todays time.
<br />

<br />
Hence my request to all is , play with psi, chi , qi, telepathy, tk , pk , reiki and anything you like, but dont mess with kundalini awakening, just awakening 1 or 2 chakras or some small powers is not kundalini.
<br />

<br />
This should only be done under the guidance of a great master away from the normal world. Usually if the kundalini is raised and goes uncontrolled it will have the following consequences.
<br />

<br />
- it can make you mad.
<br />
- make you impotent.
<br />
- make you an animal (barking , loosing senses , act like real animal etc)
<br />
- Damage nervous system and paralyse the body.
<br />
- kill you. 
<br />
- make you suffer deep depression.
<br />
- You become excessively knowledgeable and may not relate to the common world.
<br />
- come in contact with worlds you dont even know.
<br />
- see ghosts, dead people, talk to them.
<br />
and anything bad you can think of.
<br />

<br />
On the positive side -
<br />

<br />
- you become God, a Human God.
