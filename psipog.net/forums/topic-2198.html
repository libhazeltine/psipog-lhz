			I have made this topic with the sole intention of getting you people something to practice RV'ing. Some of these targets are real-life objects, on which I have written the coordinates physically (in green, with a pen.. if that helps), some are pictures stored on my school's local server.
<br />

<br />
I also have some targets for you which I will give you NO information on at all! I will be very impressed if someone gets one of those targets. Yes, I believe it's possible. If you personally don't, simply skip those targets. I won't highlight them psionically or anything, but I will write in a text document what the targets are, and then delete the document. (Just to settle which objects I want as targets.)
<br />

<br />
Some of these objects will get their coordinates in about half an hour after I make this topic. So, don't start RV'ing until half an hour after this topic was created.
<br />

			Hello Bob_Stew,
<br />

<br />
We already have a practice program. Please visit the following thread. Although I support practice programs, I would like the members to have a practice program that is stationed and operated by a remote viewer that has the experience necessary to give helpful points and information. Although I'm sure you have some knowledge based on remote viewing, I don't think having two different practice programs would benefit the members. I will be hosting the practice program weekly however, if you would like to add a target to the practice pool, I will be glad to host it. The practice program can be visited at the following link:
<br />

Take care.

			With all respect;
<br />

<br />
this isn't supposed to be an organized practice program, the poll is just about whether or not people want me to do this once in a while. Why shouldn't people be able to post more practice topics? I, for one, may want to practice RV'ing a few targets every day or so.. Will your weekly practice program have a lot of targets? Some of these targets are a little special, too, and therefore interesting in their own way..
<br />

<br />
I can't really see how this topic is a bad thing. To me, several small target hosting topics from people like me in addition to the weekly practice program sounds like a good idea, but if you don't want me to host targets once in a while, I will respect that, although I don't really understand why.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Hello Bob_Stew,

I can certainly understand your standpoint in this conversation. Like I said, I encourage practice programs. I'll stop beating around the bush, excuse me if I sound rude.

If your going to host practice targets then please give the targets in it's correct formation. You decided &quot;Hey, I want to give out targets&quot; yet you give out &quot;No info. available&quot; for half of your target coordinates. 
<br />

<br />
I think you have the saying &quot;blind targets&quot; wrong. When a viewer does a session on a blind target, he is given the coordinates only. You do not give &quot;blind coordinates&quot;. My main reason for running a practice program is so members can practice correctly. I think you should do some research on remote viewing more before you decided to host anything remote viewing related.
<br />

<br />
Again, I'm sorry if that came off as rude. I'm in a time rush and I didn't want to beat around the bush.  
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />

			I know what blind targets are, I wasn't trying to do that. I was just testing an interesting idea. I'm not saying I know it's possible. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> Is this kind of topic ok if I cut out those experimental things?
<br />

<br />
Will your weekly target thing provide so many targets that this kind of topics won't be necessary to get people enough to practice wieving?
<br />

<br />
In that case, no problem anyways. -.- Thanks for your answering me politely. If you think it's best if I don't provide targets at all, I won't. And if you think I should just lay off the experimental stuff (testing my view on the matrix theory and stuff), I will. Just be blunt.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			what people can do is go onto the psipog chat, AIM, MSNIM, YIM, etc and ask someone who is a psion to assign coordinance to something.  Thats it.  You can practice with people via chat.
