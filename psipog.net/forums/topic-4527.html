			I have absolutely no idea where this thread is supposed to go, so i'll just stick it in psychokinesis. Anyway, i was practicing rolling a straw the earlier, holding it in the palm of my hand and making it roll up and over each side of my cupped hand, i got it to move quite a few times, then i just stared at it for 1 or 2 minutes, and the right side of it seemed to disappear, as i was doing this, i went to touch it with my other hand to see if my eyes were tricking me, but i couldnt feel it, at all, my finger on my other hand went straight through it and touched my palm, there was also an incredibly strong push on my hand, like a magnetic force, i dont know if i just fooled my senses into making me think it wasnt there, even though i could still see half of it, or maybe it was some sort of teleportation, like semi teleportation or something like that, any views are appreciated.

			Phasing/teleportation. Don't know which... I've done this myself many times, but I don't talk about it onpsipog because there is no section for teleportation and phasing, and because I don't wish to hear the flames of people.
<br />

<br />
But, I believe you man, I've done it myself.

			Wait, did it disappear? or did you move your finger through the object? 
<br />

<br />
If you moved it, then it's phasing. If it slightly disappeard..then I wouldn't really know what to say.
