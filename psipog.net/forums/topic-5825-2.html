			This is crap... Psiballs being used as a weapon again... OMG. It's supposed to be used for good purposes. If I ever plan to hurt someone, I'd rather use my fists or probably hit them with a bat or even just shoot them with a gun. It's going to be a lot more painful than any psiball shoved up the head.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  Just kidding, I might not ever do such a thing. 
<br />

<br />
BTW, just passing by. I wanted to see if this place is still alive. I'm kinda skeptical about these things... again, even if I had a good share of &quot;odd&quot; things before and psiballs when I started practicing before. I'm still looking for productive things to do.

			Here's the thing that makes shoving psi balls into your face dangerous, people... Your brain is electrochemical impulses... Some psi balls are manifested as electric current... Shoving a foreign current into your brain is like throwing a magnet into your computer... You'll be lucky if you ever wake up at all. Now obviously, most people aren't capable of generating enough of a current to do any real damage... but I'm sure some are, and we don't know enough about the human brain to be able to accurately predict what will happen if X kind of energy is shoved into Y's brain. Anything could happen, and death/permanent injury is included in that. Is it worth the risk?

			Gah... this is idiotic. If you really want to kill so badly, go get some guns and start shooting each other or just duke it out in hand to hand combat... unless you're too weak to do so. Bleh... You can't do everything with just psi and it's not meant for evil.

Thank you for that kind and mature introduction.
<br />

<br />
I must state the obvious here... If my own energy doesn't hurt me, does that mean that my own fist wouldn't hurt my face if I shoved <span style="font-weight: bold">it</span> up my nose?
<br />

<br />
 Additionally, your own body is quite capable of hurting itself. Think of shock. Think of psychosomatic illnesses. The truth is, if a psion knew what he was doing, yeah, he could shove a thousand psi balls into his face and only benefit from it. But there are a lot of psions who do not, in fact, know what they are doing, and it is not only possible, but quite plausible that some psionoob could shove a ball of chaotic energy over which he has no real control into his brain and cause a massive failure thereof.
<br />

<br />
Thank you for your time, and next time you want to insult my intellgence, try to prove yours by backing up your claim with some kind of proof, or at least a little logic.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
