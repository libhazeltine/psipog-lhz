			I just have a theory to suggest from my experiences. I do Tai Chi while practising psi, and the way I encorporate psi into my forms is making psi balls around my hands when moving, and on the end of a chain I push them forward (something to the effect of a very weak force push from star wars). It works very well if you can attain the focus to do both simultaneously.

			I use my psi in taichi and its cool but kung fu is what i use it.  with each KI i kickl and focus the psi on myn feet.  With each punch i switch it to my fist it allows the circulation and focus of my psi to be more fluent and conrolled.. also it allows me to make the psi balls much quicker and stornger.

			Hey i do muay thai boxing and brazilian jujitsu we had a taichi guy come in thinking his martial at form was superior and he was a so called master and my instructor beat him down and the guy was squeeling when he had him in a arm bar!!!!

			I practice Shotokan Karate, and have found, that with some focus, Both energy manipulation, and physically moving feels easier. When practicing kumite (fighting), I've found that a few moments to focus and gather energy (don't like the term 'gather energy', but it describes the process I mentally go through), helps me fight better - I feel faster, and more able to anticipate moves. Unless it's just the placebo effect (which I refuse to believe - belief in what we're capable of helps us grow and learn).
<br />

<br />
In short, I believe that psi and any form of martial art (especially ones with a focus on energy [tai chi, akido etc.]) go well together. It all comes down to what you believe in.

Dan, I've read one of Bruce Lee's books and the book stated that  using a form of energy to help with a impact of an attacks. But I don't think that'll be the prize winner.
<br />

<br />
But psi + physical Combat, shouldn't be relyed on as it's hopeless if you don't have strength or skill to back it up with...
<br />

<br />
&quot;the fact that your mind can do wonders to your physical strength. This extra power or strength is what Lee called the 'flowing energy'....&quot;
