You said that psipog quote &quot;bend spoons and cast spells&quot; unquote
<br />

<br />
We couldnt be farther from that. All psipog teaches is the ability to use your mind to a greater extent than its presence use. We dont &quot;cast spells&quot; its not as we just say of few words and magic happens. We practice many hours to simply move a piece of paper. To be honest I thought it was a little wacky at first but after I tried it I was convinced its true. So could you modify your article a little? We dont want to get laywers involed in this do we?
<br />

lol i know we cant do anthing with laywers but I just wanted to say that :p

			I like to see that all things truely great are often thought of crazy and insane like some scientists in history. Then again......some things crazy are just that ...crazy. I found it funny how they think of us...definely at the beginning when the aruther says that

Well of cource I trust there judgement, at lest now. There only trieing to reveal what is true. But to know if your wrong or not is a different story. To know that you know is wrong you first have to know what is right, but to know something that is right you have to know what is first wrong. I picture us just exploreing but yet this critic just mocks it.
<br />

<br />
Truely amazing how the aruther was able to freely talk like this. In my heart I can't blame the critic one bit. But to talk like this is just wrong on many scales..As I found myself smiling I still have the thoughts in my heart say.
<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Its as if we were yelled at us for trieing to discover if the world is round!</span>
<br />

<br />
I guess some of best discoveries are often thought of insane. That what makes them great...because then the world is on there shoulders....but still overcome them. But does that mean we are wrong for trieing? It donest one bit.

			Stop worrying about SomethingAwful.  They're trying to eek out anything they can on their website to compete with the other hundreds of &quot;shocking and funny content&quot; sites on the internet.  If they want to use this forum as cannon fodder for their barely inspired comedy, then let them.  All they're doing is giving us publicity and a wider fan base.
<br />

<br />
Thank you SomethingAwful.
