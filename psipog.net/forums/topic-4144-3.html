			JoeT, what about edits? This is the only thing I'm bitching about, is the edits. 
<br />

I edit quite a few times because I'm in a rush to beat everyone else, I hate wasting posts when someone else beats me to it because I sitting on my ass trying to think of what the fuck I'm going to say.

			My goal is to get you to think a little differently.
<br />

<br />
With no limitation, I am sending a message to members that a post isn't a big deal.  That an edit isn't a big deal.  It promotes the mentallity of &quot;who cares if this post sucks&quot;.  Hence, we get a lot of crappy posts.
<br />

<br />
With a limitation, now a post is a limited resource.  Now posters are forced to ask the question, &quot;is this really worth my time?  is this post good enough so I won't have to edit it?&quot;  These are the questions I ask myself all the time before hitting &quot;Submit&quot;, but a lot of members don't think that.  With a limited supply of posts/edits, it gets people to be more aware of what they're doing, and makes them stop and think for a second.
<br />

<br />
If you don't like the limitation, then change your habits.  Don't post something crappy then come back to it to edit it.  Post something good the first time.  Don't post one word replies - or if all you can think of is a one word reply, then maybe you can better spend your time helping somebody else.
<br />

			i know the point of this is to cut down on spammers and stupid posts, but i also see what apollo is saying.

how about if we resolve this by getting best of both worlds. make the max 7 or 8 posts instead of just 5.

			I just felt like I would like to chime in here and say that I rather enjoy this new rule. Frankly, I type at about 130-140 words per minute (120 at 95% accuracy a few years ago - thanks Mavis Beacon), and I have never had a problem typing this quickly - but I take time to post because I like to think out my answer.
<br />

<br />
While I am nowhere near as good at making deeply informed posts with supportive material as my friends Jael and Aphanas and Rainsong, I do feel as if my posts are informative and potent. I don't feel that five posts in an hour is overly restrictive, I've not yet made more than three posts within an hour. Frankly, there aren't enough topics in an hour worth my time for me to post that much.
<br />

<br />
Edit: In the interest of full disclosure, I hit my limit in the last hour. It also prevented me from making an edit to a post until this hour. I'm not overly concerned. This remains a fundamentally good idea.

			Uhh. wow. Well maybe we should do something like 10 posts every two hours? because personally, i like that a lot more, so that i can go to each and every thread i want to, instead of selectively helping people that i can. I &lt;i&gt; want &lt;/i&gt; to help people, and i think that if i try, people will get something out of it, but with 5 posts an hour, thats frankly not going to work. My family doesnt know about psionics. I get 15-20 minutes on psipog at average. Sometimes it can go up to 30 minutes or even a full hour when they arent at home.
<br />

<br />
Or at least put a random crap section and move some of the funny stuff there, and turn off the post count. That should help somewhat.

			I think the 8 rule was MUCH better!!!!  But i never thought it was a problem, most spammers were chastised by other forum users.  I think a READ ARTICLES rule of some sort would be much better. I'd say uninformed people are taking up more space.
<br />

<br />
5 is pretty steep!  I'm a moderate poster and I end up having to wait 10 mins or so, which doesn't <span style="font-style: italic">seem</span> bad,  but i have dial up.  And every min is a long time considering it is blocking all calls from coming to my house.
<br />

I dont have to edit often because I always check my posts, but I understand where you are coming from neveza.

			You guys want to be able to post more?  You want more privileges?  Then show us you deserve them.  Five posts in an hour is more than adequate.  We want you people to think about what you're posting before you actually post.  You really can't bicker about post edits counting as an actual post because there is a simple solution: take the 12 minutes to compose your post and ensure that you've included all the information necessary with proper spelling and grammar.
<br />

<br />
We've had a lot of people who post without any mindful preparation, and they end up being shitty posts.  If you keep posting shitty posts, then we limit them.  As Peebs said, he wants to instill a sense of value in your posts.  You want a smoothly run and informative forum?  You want people to take you seriously when you post?  Do you have a sense of pride in what you say, knowing that possibly hundreds or thousands of people will be reading it for something useful?  Then don't shit where you eat, and show us that you can.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps with the passage of time and a convincing show of compassion and intelligence, Peebs may increase the post limit.  But not until people stop bitching and start showing their respect to each other and to this forum.

With that said, could there be a ranking system, that'll show that one could handle a bit more posts? I don't really mind the limit, I just mind the edit counts.

			&quot;Sorry that i'm making this a PM, but i'm out of posts for the hour, and i'd like to get something done. 
<br />

<br />
5 Posts an hour is indeed unreasonable for many people. I only have enough posts per hour to go to one topic of threads and try to help answer questions. I can't apply for Junior Staff because its closed, and i probably wouldnt get accepted anyway (knowing forums -_-). I believe that maybe you should have some sort of system that can allow certain people to have more posts than others, based on the PEOPLE's opinion. If people think that person A is exceptionally helpful, person A should get something showing that. Whether it be extra posts per hour or SOMETHING, it should be shown. If person B is being a complete craphead, then maybe they should get a temporary penalty for that. Maybe they should get less posts per hour. This is my opinion, and if i had more time, then i would wait and post this, but I dont. 
<br />

<br />
Good day.&quot;
<br />

<br />
PM to peebrain i had to send. Note that i'm posting this at 1 minute after the hour.

			well....i dont know. that's when it becomes suggestive and picky. whether or not people are more helpful than others, it seems like at that point it becomes some kind of popularity contest and the mods pick and choose.
<br />

<br />
in the end it seems the only way to get more postage using your method it would come down to the people who have the same opinions. i dont think we need to pick and choose that way.
