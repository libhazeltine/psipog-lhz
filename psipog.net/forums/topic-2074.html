			I just want to know what everyone here who believes in psionics thinks about skeptics? Are you angry at them for their harassment? Or are you sorry that they are so shut in about learning about psionics? So far almost all the comments that psions have made to the skeptics have been respectful, but the skeptics have been crude and hurtful. What do you think?

			I usually agree with a lot of skeptics.  However, there is one type of skeptic that really bugs me - it's the kind that will hear I believe in psychic abilities, and then instantly treat me like a 5 year old idiot.  Skepticism is healthy, but I just don't like people blocking me out completely.  I don't mind disagreement, or even a skeptic who argues with me, then throws his hands up in frustration.  Hey, at least he tried, right?
<br />

<br />
Completely blocking me out from the start makes me angry.  That goes for any subject, not just psionics.  We all want to be heard and taken seriously, even if for only a short time.

I respect skeptics.  With out people doubting things, where would the human race be?  Like Peebs, that one type of skeptic that treats me like i am stupid is annoying.  I like argueing because it helps me learn and allows me to express myself fully.  I like to argue so much that in school, i argue opposite points from my real beliefs (whatever is against the majority of the people) and eventually i win (against my own beliefs).

			Depends how stupid the skeptic is, if he's arguing with horrible facts that are not actually fact but treated as one, not even showing proof of it when you ask, yet consider himself right, those irritate me. Then those with really pointless arguements, the types that you don't understand how you became involved since it doesn't matter at all, yet, they take it offensively.
<br />

<br />
as for the rest, I don't really pay any attention to them, I don't really mind what they say, as long they are not in my way, they'll be okay.

Are you on the same forum as me?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> The sceptics seem to get some really puerile insults thrown their way on here. In fact, a couple of threads (since locked I think) were making me question the value of this site. But luckily they got locked and I can see that there are some sensible people here. People who won't listen to others irritate me whether they are sceptic or believer.

Amen, impqueen. The believer side doesn't only consist of angels. (For ya otherkins out there, don't take it literally.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> ) Those who think so are those who would have been the most close-minded ones among the sceptics if they weren't at the believer side. The more hostile a believer is towards a sceptic, the more hostile would he be against believers if he were on the sceptic side. It's a matter of personality. Therefore I think it is relevant to think of the separation between the sceptics and the believers as a mirror.

Yes, goddamnit, I know that illustration sucks hairy donkey balls. Good thing is, you can interpret it in which way you want.
<br />

<br />
So, if everyone could just keep in mind that this is not a one-way mirror, and that no matter which degree of hate you have towards the opposite side, your own personality is what you hate. Which side you are on is a matter of personal experiences, for the most part.

			I like bob_stew's illustration <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> And he's got a point. But still the way you acccuse or attack either the skeptic or the believer is relevant. I'm sort of in the middle about the whole subject of psionics however. But I like to argue reasonably, I just hate it when I have to argue something that I like, but, is in-fact, wrong. Like for example, liking the Human wave doctrine better than blitzkrieg, even though blitzkrieg is by far more effective in terms of manpower and killing ability. &gt;_&gt; Sorry, <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> I'm a WW2 freak &gt;_&lt; All I know is that the Trench Warfare doctrine was crap, though good at the time.

			Being angry at skeptics is just a waste of your own energy on something you can't control.  Pity/sadness for someone who simply does not share your point of view (because they have differing knowledge and experience) is condescending towards them.  Thus, I feel neither.  If they want to be educated while still being skeptical, I'll discuss the subject of metaphysics with them.  If they refuse to hear any alternative views on the subject besides their own, then I have no reason to waste my time on them.

			The thing I find ironic about skeptics is that some have a negative leaning. By this I mean they're attitude is everything is tripe until proven with hard facts. I think if you limit your beliefs, you limit your reality. So by having this negative leaning your mind won't allow you to experiance anything &quot;paranormal&quot;. Something to do with not being ready to deal with it I suppose. An example of this was mentioned on another thread where a girl couldn't handle the possibility of psionics being real because it would make her question what else was real too (like religion) Even if you were to show such a person a great feat of PK it would be a waste of energy because in they're minds they'd be telling themselves its all a trick (as a defense mechanism) 
<br />

<br />
Of course I'm not lumping all skeptics under this definition but alot of skeptics and athiests seem to do this.
<br />

<br />
My personal feelings towards skeptics is the same as it is towards anyone. They can believe what they wish as long as they don't attempt to cram it down my throat.
