			I had a dream that i was really good. I was sitting in a room with my mum and i suddenly managed to get it to work. I was going mad but for some reason my mum didnt seem to be that impressed.
<br />
Then i tried levetating something light and i got it an inch in the air and grabbed it.
<br />
Then i woke up and realised it was a dream.
<br />
So annoyed. I really want to be able to roll pens etc so i can prove to my physics friend that its real!!!!
<br />
Still trying hard to get it to work but i still have had no success <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			I have had a dream recently about that.  I tried to recreate it- same room, same object... but it didn't work.  I mean, I don't do psychokinesis as much as I used to, and trying to move an eraser is definitely harder that tin foil.  Oh, well.
<br />

Hey, up there: are your I and K keys sticky or something?

Why couldn't you levitate a boat?  What could possibly be stopping that?
<br />

<br />
I think if you actually try to lift a boat, and can get out the notion that it's impossible, you might just be able to do that too.
<br />

<br />
Well, maybe not a BOAT, but... certainly other things.  If you're good enough, you should be able to lift something heavy.
<br />

<br />
Hopefully we'll get to the point that we can push back other people.

			well... I meant not YET  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  , even the thought of it brings me a bad headache  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> , that doesnt mean I dont want to, or I don't beleive it could happen , but my own experience tells me whatever the technique you are using here (without being a natural), wont get you any close to what you are saying, but maybe after about 30-40 years  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  you'll be able to do it .

			I had a few dreams where I learned to use it. In one, I could manipulate any object so easily. I moved my awareness into the object and manipulated it. Another dealt with a kid who invented this type of pop (soda) that would give you telekinetic powers. However they were only temporary, so you'd need to constantly drink the pop to have it on a regular basis. At least I managed to snag a few cans.

			Mh. Weird, I seem to perform TK in almost all of my dreams (non-lucid) and that for as long as I can remember, which is like...when I was 6 years old or something.

A sign perhaps? ^^;
