			Hi, I have just learned about psi-energy and I'm very interested. So far i have made a bit of progress with psiballs, well i have felt the heat sensation and see the heat waves a bit(its so cool XD) but i cant get beyond that, as soon as i try shelling the energy it dissapates and the techniques listed in the articles aren't working for me so far. I know that I may be rushing into this but can any of you more seasoned psions tell me the way you progressed? Such as how long after you started practicing psi did you make your first psiball, and how long after that did you shell it. For me its been 3 days since I started practicing, i know i must be rushing but I just want an idea on my progress. Thanks alot in advanced

			If it doesn't work at first, try, try, try again...if that doesn't work then, disect the technique and just take what you think works for you and leave the rest out or possibly add more.

My first psiball? Well..that was too long ago, I didn't even know the term &quot;psi&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
Shelling, I started it when I heard about it, but I expect my psiballs to be shelled so I dont' bother with the shell step, I just create my construct with the shell with one command.

			Hello there,
<br />

<br />
I do not doubt that you are having a hard time shelling the construct... You've been practicing for 3 days!
<br />

<br />
Learning to program may take you quite some time. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Enjoy practice, look at the psiball articles, read the &quot;So you think you've mastered the psiball&quot; article, and some other stuff. Read the programing articles too.
<br />

<br />
Good luck to you.

			Erm, this is the wrong forum.
<br />

<br />
But welcome to Psipog anyway.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
When I created my first Psiball, I didn't feel any heat, just tingling and stuff. Anyway, the visualization is different for everyone, just try a whole bunch and see what works best, some examples are: seeing a black liquid come out of your sternum, run down your arm, and swirl into a ball in your hand, or replace that black liquid with fire, or electricity.
<br />

<br />
Shelling is the same, just picture something that prevents psi from escaping from ball form, I just picture a candle pouring wax on it, and the psi inside is thinking &quot;Oh noo I can't escape!&quot;.

			Understand that shelling is just a longevity technique. The energy is still going to move around unless you program it not to. Just think about how long you want it to stay there.
