			Yep it happens to me all the time. litlle things like knowing what the next song will be on the radio, tv etc.. not always ofcourse.. one time we were playing table-fussball with friends and in midst the game i had a sequence play out in my head, and a second later that sequence really played exactly like in my &quot;vision&quot; out and i scored.. other things would include finding a fre parking space in a very crowdy parking lot, coming to a bus stop and the bust comes exactly at the same time as i and many things like that.. at this kind of situations i just say thanx to my soub consciousness, because i think it provided the information or made a vision i had come true. In a way it is clairvoyance, but more like recieving information froma a greater source (like the achashic well or whatewer..)..

			sayspo - yes, telepathic lol, something about sharing the same brain electrode pulses at the precise moment lol, people tell me i annoy them by finishing their sentences, or saying what they were going to say right as they go to say it. (like if they were telling me something)
<br />

<br />
so yes, telepathic lol
<br />

<br />
as for this topics subject... pleeeeeeeeease no more names lol its all the same thing, people just added diff names as ego boosters i think... lol
<br />

<br />
look at it this way... Everyone can do what EVERYONE else can do... no one is more special than another  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  its just a matter of who has &quot;remembered&quot; how to do them... (not learned, as we dont learn things, we remember them). so i think its just as easy to call them psionics... or if its not more of a psychic type thing, then Manipulate Energy would work... lol...
<br />

<br />
but i think it would be considered just psychic
<br />

<br />
although, with the radio thing, the radio usually plays the same 10 songs over and over lol, so  it wouldnt be that hard to do... just more of a mental calculation and probability according to what they have played beforehand (same songs usually last 2-4weeks) lol...
<br />

<br />
not meaning to knock down anyone or anything, and dont mean to sound like a nonbeliever, but... just stating the obvious <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
that , for one, is why the radio is easier than the tv  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

You DO realise that if we didnt learn anything then we would not be able to remember things, not to mention the whole not being able to learn thing...
