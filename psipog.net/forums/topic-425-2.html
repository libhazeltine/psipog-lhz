			Technicaly Deja vu is when your brain miscalculates time, the event that is happening right now does not go through short term memory, but goes into long term memory, your brain being the amazing device it is has error checkers going. along with filters to see if anythings going on.
<br />

<br />

<br />
your brain, even while at a birthday party, is looking for danger. its job is to keep you alive. so when you are anywhere doing anything, its assuming that whats going on could hurt you and scanning your memory for similar things in the past, that way it knows how to deal with it and what instict and first reaction to give you should danger show up.
<br />

<br />

<br />
when it sees the EXACT event in long term memory, nothing in short term, but the eyes are telling it the long term memory is going on, it blanks out and doesnt know what to do.
<br />

<br />

<br />
THAT is deja vu, your brain putting the present into the past then looking at it, and blanking out.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
What i am talking about with the dreams aint deja vu, because i KNOW what is going to happen before it does, but not until im 3-10 seconds from it happening. If i dreamt that WTC would fall, i wouldnt know when, but if i was in NYC at the time, id know about 5 seconds before the planes hit. because id regonise the dream and recall what happned soon after.

Yes, i considered that.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  But I also exlpained how that would defeat the purpose of the precognitive experience. Not that you always have to have a purpose, but not even remembering a spontaneous one would defeat even that purpose.

... But I think that a deja vu is just what you think it is. It's just another thing that we gave a name. It might not be the same for everyone... I even think that maybe if I say red, you think of the exact same color but see it in another color... I mean that I say red and you see blue and everything that I see red, is blue to you. Blue firetruck thingies and stuff. So what we might see as colors can be other colors to other people. (I wonder if anyone can still folow me)

			I have them all the time as well, but for increasing lengths of time, to the point where it seems im repeating the last 5 mins of my life like when you play an rpg video game all over again. The scientific explanation sounds extremely plausible, but there is a blurred line between whether you saw it happen just before or whether you are having a &quot;brain malfunction&quot;. I saw a psychic once, and she told me that deja vu's are what happens when you pick up messages or &quot;information&quot; from spirits on a different plane. For a split second you tune into that frequency and whether or not you realize your brain computes the information you are told, it is stored in your brain as important and then obviously realized later as it is happening. What she told me seems to coincide with the &quot;brain malfunction&quot; theory, in how the brain draws a blank due to the recognition of the certain event as long-term memory. If she is right, the event IS actually long-term memory, where the blank occurs is when your brain tries to figure out how it happened. Whenever I have a deja vu I'm always in a state of &quot;dumbfounded&quot;, in how I'm simultaneously trying to figure out how this is occurring/the possible significance of the event occurring/why it is occurring.

Not stating anything as fact of course, just relating other views to my own.

Well, I've never had real deja vu, I believe, then. I'm always changing, and my 'deja vu attacks' aren't that frequent. So, if something happened in the past happened EXACTLY, again, it wouldn't be. I'd notice that I was taller, or my hands were different.
<br />
It was always during dreams, and I would forget about it too shortly after waking up. 
<br />
That's why, when I had the experience that I had already dreamed, I would stop moving after it happened, with this WTF look on my face.

Yeah. In most cases of a reversed pallete set in your brain (I can't remember the exact name, so I'll use the geek one <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />), it's your body's definition of the colour. In essence, it really doesn't make any difference, but it's extremely cool and mindfucking to think about.

			I have infrequent deja vu. Every once in a while I'll have the feeling sweep over me but it is strange because it feels almost like I can't control what my actions are and I have to do what I am remembering as already happened. For example a few months ago I was having a conversation with a few of my buddies and we were arguing over something and then my mind almost switched to this third person view where I was thinking &quot;ok... then Friend A says that and I say this and then friend B does this&quot; about 2 or 3 seconds before it woud happen. Kinda weird because I wasn't really in control of myself, more like examining it from an outside prespective.

			I quess the idea of deja vu doesn't transmit well over words (and I don't kno is this one) but I have linked it to happenings of mine.
<br />

<br />
Out of blue I could get a feeling that I remember the current situation, when I should not (I mean can not do it by traditional means as the happening would have to be in my past witch it is not) I can't predict what happens next but as things happen they seem strangly familiar (althought they are as fresh as experiences get). usually there also pops a strange very unrelated idea, different every time, that somehow seems to be connected with the situation at hand.
<br />

<br />
As these events have happened many times I have found situations that are/raise feelings amazingly similiar to the ones experienced during a deja vu. During these &quot;real&quot; events the thoughts and ideas seem very natural and make sense as they are connected to what has previously happened, they have the proper context at hand.
<br />

<br />
Something strange happening other than me thinking strangely? I don't know.
<br />

<br />
I know it feels very much as if I remembered a future event (that would also explain why the brain would progress it as a memory, it has not yet realised it is not a happening of the past (a thing that brains do not expect) )

			WELL even though they might mean something, there is a SCIENTIFIC explanation (as there is for everything good in our lives LOL jk) They say you get it when you are young because there are not enough memories to fill in the blanks, so sometimes you look back on things that have never happened...

			i think deja vu is when u have a deep memory from long ago and the experience unroots it, happens for me all the time, most of the time i delusion myself and create it though. A lot of the time it happens when i'm bored in class, or maybe i'm just thinking too much.

			Deja vu has been studied and it is a temporary slowing down of the nervous system.  You actually percieve a few seconds to a few milliseconds into the past for a brief time.  It would more likely be precognition if you knew what would happen more than around 5 seconds from what you are consciously aware of as &quot;now&quot;.  It could also quite possibly be precognitionrather than deja vu, but it's just a thought.
