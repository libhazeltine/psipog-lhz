			Certain circumstances have made it imperitive that I leave psipog. But at least the forums will be gone soon anyway. I may not have been an ideal member of the forums who practices all the time (I haven't done so in months!) but I have done my best to help others with what little knowlege and experience I have acquired over my many months here. What do you all think? Did I help anyone in my (relatively) short time here? I really don't care what the answer is. I enjoyed my time here none the less. I would like to thank PeeBrain, his moderators, and other distinguished members of psipog for making my experience here such a pleasant one. I will take the things I have learned here with me everywhere I go and perhaps one day acually put them to good use! 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Now, I offer my final personal advice to members of psipog: Some time ago, Apollo, one of my favorite moderators, made a post about unconditional love in the forums. I'd like to restress the importance of that. In these troubled times, psipog could use a little more love and understanding to ease the pressure on everyone created from hostile arguments on controversial subjects and such. I haven't seen enough compassion lately (Okay, I'll admit I'm no saint but I try to be as kind as I can within the limits of my temper and ego <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />.) and wish I could stop all of the pointless fighting. I think that those who are in/about to be in/were in an argument should just take a deep breath and approach the situation from a different angle and try to find some kind of compromise. Just give them a little room and be a little more understanding (of their circumstances/views). Most of us need to be little more understanding of the fact that most people's views can't be changed and should just be accepted. Some need solid proof, others don't. I've also noticed that some people just force their views down other's throats like it's really the truth. Bad idea. 
<br />

<br />
1. it's offensive
<br />
2. it causes more arguments
<br />
3. it can get a good thread locked
<br />
4. it establishes bad relationships with members who could have been friends/friendly acquaintences 
<br />
5. it can make you looked down upon by others (even moderators)
<br />

<br />
When presenting a view it should be done in an unbiased manner and in a way that states that it is an opinion or just based off of certain experiences/findings/research, etc. That would make psipog a much friendlier place for all to learn. I could go on and on but this will do. I'm sure everyone gets the picture.
<br />

<br />
One last thing, if anyone would like to contact me for some important reason (whether it be for giving/recieving advice/answers, etc.) you may do so with my e-mail: <a href="#">greatwhiteninja24@yahoo.com</a>
<br />

<br />
What a surprise <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />!
<br />

<br />
This will be like my funeral...I wonder how many will come by to pay their respects <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />. (BTW, I will wait a few days and respond to a few posts here to wrap things up with the mourners of my &quot;funeral&quot;.) 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
P.S.   Proper grammar and mechanics really need to be improved in some people's posts. It's not an insult, just an observation. I just helps when you can understand what a person is trying to say. I'm not saying anyone is stupid but those people just need to be a little less lazy and start thinking about others by making their work legible. Good luck everyone, I love you all equally.
<br />

&quot;Ahem... GreatWhiteNinja wasn't someone I knew extremely well, but he was still someone I liked. He made good posts, and although some were fluffy, who <span style="font-style: italic">hasn't</span> made at least one fluffy post in their life? GWN was an awesome guy, and although he's leaving us here at PsiPog, he's still going to be a member of our underground of fabulous freaks. You never really leave once you're in. Good luck, GWN! My prayers and best wishes go with you!&quot;

			Thank you all so much. I have enjoyed my time here and shall always be a member even after leaving like you said SGT Psion. Thank you all for posting here. It means a lot to me. Like I said earlier, I'll just stick around here for a while. BTW, somefatguy (my brother) says he will remain here to the very end. I would have like to do the same but psipog is too time consuming for me (forum addiction and all). I may even come visit right before the forums shut down. I just remembered one thing I must do before I leave. <span style="font-weight: bold">I need to post some of the books I have read and am still reading that relate to psionics and other psychic abilities on here and on the book thread. So hang around guys and by tomorrow I may be able to get the books and authors on here along with my decriptions and satisfaction score (1 to 10; 10 being best).</span>
