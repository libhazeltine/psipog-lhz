			This is something I've been able to do for a while now. It's not seeing with my eyes or minds eye. I can see in color. It's like half of me is there and half is here. when I do this my visual switches from first person viewing and third person viewing. What I see is my otherkin side as a walk around and see things. In this mode I can see auras and energy etc. one time I could swear that a kid turned to look straight at me when I randomly visited a classroom (I was standing upside down on the ceiling) I always do random viewing so I dont know if it's RV or not. Another thing is I seem to almost always know where things are like when my mom loses her keys I just think of an area and tell her to go look in the area. Most of the tie I am right but sometimes not. So what are you guys thoughs on this?

			This sounds more like a fast obe to me. When i've obes i can see auras too and if i'm only at the first phases of an obe (imagining things that seems very real but knowing that youre at the bed, this &quot;imaginations&quot; doesn't last too long) i've also the problem with the first and third person perspective view i suppose that its a thing that happens cause we are accostumed too much to control a player in videogames in this perspective.
<br />
About the kid, it is said that boys born with the ability to view auras but they lose it cause society oblies them to concentrate in physical things. So it can be true that the kid noticed you <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
