			Salutations Psions,
<br />

<br />
It is becoming an ever enjoyable thing for me to do remote viewing as a way to relax myself. I shall lay on my bed and get comfortable, closing my eyes and go 'sight seeing' in a sense, it is also a great way of practice.
<br />

<br />
At any rate during yesterdays relaxation period (which was followed by napping for 4 hours given I got TOO relaxed) I got into a 'deep' Remote Viewing session. I saw things in better detail then my normal view in it, as for those who read my post &quot;Is this Remote Viewing or Something Else&quot; then you'd know the clarify, to some extent, of my Remote Viewing. I saw many a thing letting my mind wander wherever it wanted to, though for a brief and flash moment I could swear I saw a whole scene in color, as if I was looking with my eyes, except nowhere near as far seeing as our eyes give. May have been my imagination, i'm open to that option, though is it possible to remote view in full color? Instead of getting the jist of colors as I have I saw it under my eyelids along with the normal images I see.
<br />

<br />
Sufice to say it was awe inspiring and one hell of a session, thats for sure. Though has anyone else had this happen to them? Also this was long before I fell asleep during the period, so it wasnt a dream.
<br />

			It's normal when you relax to enter in a &quot;brain mode&quot; different from normal. One time i was in a really boring class so i decided to relax and i wanted to try to get in a predream phase that let's you to create your own dreams with your mind (something like an scenario editor of dreams). But then I had a thing similar to a remote view but too much precise, one man wearing white robes sitting under a high oak, it was in the afternoon and the floor was covered with brown leaves. It was like if I was there but only watching the scene.
<br />
a really precise remote view can be posible, but i think you need to get into a special trance that was that happens to you cause you were too relaxed  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

(well thas my personal opinion)   <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I can get color if I'm lucky but not like sharp colors....I only get color if I try to get color(if the RV needs it to find the item) but I usually just do black and white since my view is clearer than in color....but I'm quite sure it's possible for full color <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Lately I have been enjoying deep meditation practice more and more, though for the record i'd like to say im self-taught, never looked up a lesson nor book so I dont know how valid the title would be, but its what I consider it to be. When I get into this deep meditation I let go of all my thoughts, I usually have music playing and I will only concentrate on the music, not the vocals. My mind stays clear throughout, I seem to have a knack for clearing my mind and keeping it thus, though I'm not perfect, I still befall to some distractions. Anyways I get into a deep meditation, I loose any feeling of physical discomfort and most of the time will get a lot of the OoBE presigns.
<br />

<br />
More and more I am believing it is like my Remote Vision has been increased by a lot when im meditation (Possibly only for WHEN I am not all the time after), though possibly this could be the answer given that meditation does seem to catalyst and boost psionic powers. Though it requires focus, but its not focus that we think of when we look at something, in a sense it requires the lack of focus, I have to observe the pictures, but I can't just stare at them and begin to think on them or focus heavily on one spot of it, I have to view it all and watch it, if I begin to think on it in the ways above it will just dissapear, the darkness of under my eyes returning.
<br />

<br />
Sometimes though I shall notice something wierd, so far I've only taken notice of it once, but in my next sessions I shall pay attention to this and see if it reoccurs. In that event though I felt a pressure around my eyes and the side of my eyes, it spanned across my face and went over my ears, it felt like the outline of googles and the ear part, well have you ever seen really old headphones, the large ones? Sort of like those, but it was only over one ear. I only observed this fact, it grew a bit stronger as I got deeper in meditation (past the point it had started, which was in deep meditation). After a while it went away, but I was still perplexed on it, it didn't feel like my imagination, but I couldn't explain what it was.
<br />

<br />
Deep meditation seems to be offering me more then just a feeling of peacefulness, a serene emptiness, just overall grand relaxation, but it whatever this is it seems psionic, if not my Remote Viewing in a &quot;boosted&quot; form. Though as of right now I am unsure, I wish to find out for sure though. Also, have any of you others felt the pressure like described above?

			The odd feeling about your body? I tend to get physical feelings when I RV. If the person I am RVing is throwing up, I will feel very sick, if they are in pain, I will feel pain in that area of the body, I usually feel their body as though it was mine and sense the clothing they are wearing.

You probably had the same effect.
