			It's time for another one of my famous threads! Ahh, it brings me back. 
<br />

<br />
Anyways, I was wondering some of your theories for why women generally live longer than men.
<br />
As well as voting, please explain.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Oops, I am sorry, I forgot to make a &quot;/&quot; after &quot;they&quot; for &quot;we&quot; because some members are female. Lol, sorry. 
<br />
For example it should be: &quot;Because they/we do less strenous work than men?&quot; 
<br />
Sorry ladies, just ignore that.

Could be the chakra-color thing I told you about. (The colorful clothes they wear producing frequencies that harmonize with their internal organs and feeding their chakras energy making them healthier and more energetic; of course this &quot;info.&quot; coming from where it came from could be false or copied (I'm sure you all know where it's from now, don't speak it's name <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />! )) Or it could just be the thing sparkz said (or maybe both <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />).

			Oh, what, I get scolded for stating my opinion but existanceisnothing gets to be a jackass? Gender profiling...
<br />

<br />
As for actual reasons, though, because society, however I dislike it, is still mainly run by men. Men are still profiled as the main providers, a position which puts more stress on them than women. There are exceptions, of course, but in general, I think that's probably the reason. High stress levels leads to heart problems and so on, so I would assume that's the basis.

			What I've heard is that while men do what they biologically need to do and are more of a burden than anything else in old age, older women attend to young mothers and help ensure the survival of their offsrping, and are thus better suited to living longer (assuming they survived childbirth).
<br />

<br />
This is of course assuming we didn't have the modern comforts and medicines that we do nowadays.

My apologies, I am just pissed off because I just made 2 new threads and I haven't gotten that great of responses. (no offense anyone) 
<br />
And I don't like people that say this is better than that. In this case &quot;Women are just better than men.&quot; I just don't like that, it's gender profiling in itself. 
<br />
Sirius: Okay, I see what you mean, but that's what I was aiming for really. 
<br />
No one likes the: &quot;They use less sexual energy than men.&quot; ? 
<br />
It's intended for mature audiences if you catch my small but big drift.

			I hear that stress plays a big part in it - (AS A GENERAL RULE), guys tend to stop up emotions and not let them out...this can't be good in the long run! Apparently the more 'feminine' idea of letting out emotions and whatnot is healthier. (I mean, this does sound fairly plausible...last I checked, if you have high blood pressure, you try to avoid emotional stress, yes?)
<br />

<br />
Another thing to add to that theory: Some of the oldest living guys, 100+ have admitted to crying a lot <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
