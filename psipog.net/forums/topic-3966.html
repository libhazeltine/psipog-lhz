			Yes, absolutely its real!  A good guide, yes, here is the link:  <a href="http://www.hermetics.org/pdf/Robert_Peterson_-_Out_of_Body_Experiences.pdf" target="_blank" class="postlink">OBE RESOURCE</a>
<br />

<br />
That book is long, i know, but it is definitely worth the read.
<br />

<br />
OK, so, now questions...
<br />

<br />
How long have you been practicing?
<br />

<br />
Can you put your body asleep while leaving your mind awake yet?
<br />

<br />
How long do you try each day and each 'session'?
<br />

<br />
Answer these and i can help!

			forget about it.. as for you there is no astral plane.
<br />
maybe try some meditations, forget about all stupid astral travels, you are not HERO.
<br />

<br />
P.S. you can play HEROES3 <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> then you will be a hero in a game.
<br />
now you want to feel that you are hero, in you imagination... 
<br />
 <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  no offense

			thats exactly what i know what im talking, its my talks, nothing borrowed.
<br />
Its good advice in not serious box of fun.
<br />

<br />
because you try soo hard into obe, sooo hard, that it makes it so much precious.But in my experience its nothing worth that obe. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Just to be in nature, in park is far more better than to go into astral plane. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ye ye i know thats not true, but its true now. Now its true <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> only for me <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Fov_ness: can i ask, why is that you try to discourage people off having an OBE? Whats so bad about going out of your body? Have you ever had an OBE?
<br />

<br />
aaront: Kai has pretty much summed up most of what i was going to say, but yes, yes, yes, it is possible to go out of body i have many times.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> read Robert Petersons book, it is very inspirational...

			Well to answer Kaiandy's questions Ive been practicing for a week trying at night while im sleepy, 
<br />

<br />
I havent tried putting my body asleep and my mind awake i just tryed to enter the hypnogagic state and do it like going in a trance and doing it, I didnt know you had to put your body to sleep and leave your mind awake (sounds difficult) 
<br />

<br />
I try for about 30 minutes to an hour have for about 9 days tonight will be 10.
<br />

<br />
Heres what i do i read articles ont he net and heres how i follow through trying to obe.
<br />

<br />
I get real relaxed i do relaxation techniques, and  i meditate with the breathing method, just inhalign and exhaling and concentrating on my breath and letting thoughts float by not worrying about them. 
<br />

<br />
Then once im really in a deep state of relaxation and sleepy, ill imagine or try to feel my spirit floating out of my body and i do this trying to make it real as possible And ill try to come out of my body liek that trying to free from it, but i have no success... ever... What about the vibrations ill read the ebook you gave me hopefulyl itll help me understand more, Because a couple times i tried looking at little lights in ym vision (but i think its just light relay from lookign around all day) But i have no clue on how to captue a vibration or what ever im to mucxh a newb i guess.
<br />

<br />
Well hope you guys can help 
<br />
Peace-

			OK.  Where to begin?
<br />

<br />
First off, my first word of advice is: dont expect an OBE right off the bat (i.e. even possibly a year) yet 'expect an OBE'.  Know what I'm saying?  Keep your expectations low for experiencing it, but high for knowing you will do it...I know it doesn't make any sense, but honestly 10 nights is a short amount of time for one of the hardest skills to master in 'psionics'.
<br />

<br />
Second, there are techniques in the e-book for mastering mind awake/body asleep.  It is not nearly as hard as it sounds.  Just deep breathing, slowly relaxing each muscle group and telling that muscle group, one at a time, to &quot;go to sleep&quot; and forgetting about it!  
<br />

<br />
The best time to practice is in the morning, after you wake up naturally (not to an alarm).  Try that out!  No guarantees either.
<br />

<br />
Affirmations are a big help.  Go throughout your day saying/thinking &quot;I am going to have an OBE&quot;.  It helps.  I had my first OBE after doing affirmations all day long, and that was the first time i had done affirmations all day long <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  
<br />

<br />
It sounds like you are on the right track though.  Keep practicing, don't lose hope!  Keep telling yourself you can do it and expect to have one everytime.  You don't have to necessarily float yourself out every practice session.  When it is time and your subc is comfortable with it, you will float out on your own, with most likely no visualization of such.  
<br />

<br />
Good Luck!
