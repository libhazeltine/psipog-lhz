			This is a long story but just read it becuase it is pretty interesting.
<br />

<br />
My best friend, Zach told me this very weird story. It was when he was in 3rd grade. He was very very sick with a 104 degree fever. 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, he told me that he was falling asleep and he pulled the covers over his head, and he said about 5 seconds later he saw his self under the covers gasping for breath. And he wen into his living room and he saw his dad reading a book. (you will see why this is interesting in a second) and he saw the page number (Lets say it was like 408), then he heard his mom yell and he was back in his body. 
<br />

<br />
His mom was feeling his head and his dad came in there shortly after. And his dad asked what happened. And His mom said &quot;Zach was Sufficating&quot; and his dad said ok well i will stay in here and watch him. And when his dad opened his book he was on the same page that he was on when zach saw him reading in the living room. Which means it couldnt have been a dream.
<br />

<br />
Ok so what I wanted to ask was, is it possible to have OBE's in near death expierences. Becuase I trust zach and everything but he could of just been trying to impress me.
<br />

<br />
So thats it. If you didnt like the story than sorry I wasted your time.
<br />

<br />

			I heard a similar incident like this from a friend of mine too. He had been caught underwater and nearly died. Luckily, someone noticed him and preformed CPR on him.
<br />
But, while he was dead..ish he said he saw a time on the clock in the building by him. When he was being carried away in an ambulence, the clock in the ambulance read that exact same time.
<br />
Creepy...

			Ok I have a problem with these stories. People aren't observant enough to look at page numbers and the time for the heck of it when they're in their body. Why would they look for these things while have a crazy and frightening experience like an NDE?

Good point pepsiboy. The mind plays so many tricks on people. If a person is close to death, portions of the brain will randomnly fire off. Scientists have already proven that stimulating certain areas of the brain can cause people to lose sense of their body's position, thus causing an obe. When a person is close to death this portion of the brain will misfire, causing the experience of an NDE. I'm sure you can easily find this research on the web.

I don't think that &quot;extremely terrifying&quot; part really applies to NDE's. Well at least most of them. From what I heard from stories and my friend (hit by a car) you are actually very relaxed, and accept the fact that you are dieing. So you really aren't that frantic about anything.

			a NDE IS an OBE. It's a less common form of OBE, that comes only under extreme physical stress.
