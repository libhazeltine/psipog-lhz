			Hey Guys, 
<br />

<br />
I'm a new Member of psipog and how could it be, here is my first question. I tried to spin the wheel for several times now, but it's only whipping from up an down. I don't know how to go on... 
<br />
It would be great if you can tell me, how to spin it...

			Well, Heres the first question.  
<br />

<br />
How long have you been practicing? If its under a monty, keep trying.  If it's not under a month then you should try to reevealuate (sp?) your method.  What method are you currently usign?
<br />

<br />
Good luck,
<br />
Brandon

			bobbing is a good thing. It means you can actually move it. Lol your going to hate for saying this but &quot;just do it&quot; I remember when I was like you. You just need to practice. I cup my hands around it and make sure Im hovering over it (makes me feel like I have complete power over it) Then I just concentrate and BOOM it moves. A little advice from magicdood, &quot;Just let it happen dont expect it&quot; and that is true, when I first moved it I wasnt expecting it, it just happned.

			Heh, Did I say that Monkey? COOL.  Although, I do believe I said &quot;Let it happen, dont FORCE it to spin.&quot;  There is a method called Gnomes Method where you do expect it to spin while staring at one of the corners.  O and yeah, bobbing is good because it means that you are affecting the wheel.

			Thanks Guys,
<br />

<br />
I'm practicing for a couple of weeks now. There was a little break after a few days, cause I got no results, but I managed to practice again and then it started to bob <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />
I will go on an see what will happen.
<br />

<br />
thanks
<br />

<br />
But is there a way to move bigger objects, like balls or something else?!
<br />
I mean, If you say &quot;just do it&quot; , it will be possible to move any object.And the weight and size doesn't matter,or?!

			Keep up the practice.  Yes, with Telekinesis you can move very large objects (eventually). Alot of people believe that the only reason it is harder to move larger objects is becuase you have a mental barrior because you think that bigger=harder to move. I am one of the few  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> who believe that it is harder to move larger objects beacuse they have more mass and you need to train or &quot;build up&quot; your psi muscles just as you real muscles before you can move the bigger and heavier objects.

Good luck,
