About the healing/PK thing, that's just what I've read from people's responses here. I suppose it would be a form of DMILS (Bio-PK, for those who don't know), which is a form of PK.

Here is the answer , &quot;healing&quot; is a very a topic ..

It is like receiving energy from the source to heal our body, mind and even others.

			I would consider healing to be a form of DMILS, and therefore fall under PK. Although it's probably not important enough to merit its own forum, it certainly deserves a few threads. 
<br />

<br />
To add a testimonial, my dad has RSD (meaning he's in agony almost 24/7). If I could learn some serious healing techniques, he'd be my final exam. So if anyone finds anything really credible/useful/easy, don't hesitate to let me know!

			If healing is PK, then you could have a sub-forum on Bio-PK withing the PK forum... Sounds like a good idea, I'll be one of the first knocking on the door of the new forum...

			I'd really like to see a healing forum.  I dont think it just goes under Pk at all.  I can see how you can heal with PK, but the more common healing tech. such as, what i do, Reiki, has to do with transfering healing energy(psi it could be called, same diff).  It's kinda like energy minipulation and psi ball things and that can be placed in that forum.  But i see alot of ppl saying when they try a healing or pain releaving psiball they get the opposite and that is dangerous.  It would be great if ppl who are interested could get some direction and have thier own place.
<br />

<br />
After thinking about the way i do healing could fall almost every forum here.  It would be cool if there was a designated place.
<br />

<br />
If this doesn't go through, where should ppl ask about healing?

			Healing opens a small can of worms.
<br />

<br />
In some states, you need a license to perform healing/Reiki.  I'm not sure on the specifics of the law.  I also agree with this law - I don't think random people should be going around &quot;healing&quot; people.  Healing doesn't follow the same pattern of other skills on PsiPog... for other skills, we encourage people to try things out, experiment, and come up with cool ideas.  I most certainly don't want people to take this attitude towards healing.  I don't want kids to get hurt, and not go to the doctor, so they can experiment on themselves with healing.  I don't want to attract people who are hurt, and are seeking alternative forms of medicine.  I don't want people coming into the chat room, and ask for someone to heal them like it's no big deal.  Having someone mess around with your bodies healing process is a big deal.  Having someone send out vibes to alter your body is a big deal.
<br />

<br />
If someone is actually certified in Reiki, then I have no problems with them talking about what they're allowed to talk about (according to their certification).  Annie, the author on PsiPog who wrote about Reiki and healing, was certified and a licensed massage therapist.  Which is why it wasn't a problem for her to write about the topic of healing/Reiki.  How many people here are really certified?  Do I really want to spend time and energy on figuring out if someone is really certified, or lieing? (No).  Annie was a special case because I knew her for a long time before she started writing about Reiki, and I knew about her massage business.
