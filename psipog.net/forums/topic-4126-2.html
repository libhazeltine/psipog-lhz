			This is going to sound insane but you can actually try using a hexagonal shaped pencil as it might actually work better. 
<br />

<br />
Why i came up with this is because i thought about something i learnt once. Take for instance the wheels on a car. Imagine that the car is at rest and that  the wheels are completely round. To overcome the frictional force while at rest the wheels that are completely round actually have to have more force applied in order to get it moving as opposed to the wheels that are slightly deflated and slightly flatter at the area where it makes contact with the ground.
<br />

<br />
i think the thing was called 'rolling friction' or something can't quite remember. so yeah hope that helps <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			But pencils don't deflate, and since when did cars with hexagonal wheels take less force to move?

			Firstly, do you recall me saying pencils deflate? No shit pencils can't deflate.
<br />

<br />
Secondly, I never said hexagonal wheels. I said slightly deflated wheels. Get your junior school geometry right.
<br />

<br />
If you're going to quote someone and have a stab at it then you might as well quote it correctly.

			well nusil I have to say I never looked at it that way. Seems interesting, but most people seem to have to over come the push to get it fall on to the next flat surface which to them seems harder and which may or may not be harder. 
<br />
Eh I wanna share my dream. I've been having weird dreams lately probably because of the heat. But, in my dream it was a weird psi convention in a dirty manhattan hotel. It was me sheepking and a few others since I've only seen his picture. For some reason he was wrestling with people, teaching them and what not. And I couldn't roll the pen so he showed me, but he pushed it and made me think he used tk. I observed and noticed he didn't do tk but I didn't doubt him so I tried and rolled it and everyone from like psipog was there.
<br />
I don't get my dream, but it was fun lol. I've been trying to roll lately, but I still need a push =\.
<br />
Anyway sorry for that, I like your idea but most people wont accept that and will just try the normal rolling.

			i think some people have already suggested, but you can always try to focus your psi on the top part of the pencil, because i mean if you use your finger and push the top part, rather than the bottom, it moves more easily.

good luck <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
