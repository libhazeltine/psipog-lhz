			Would it be possible to gather a bunch of people for a shared dreaming session, and it be like a really cool fighting game? Imagine. You enter the game, nobody's there. You pull somebody else into the dream and start using Pyrokinesis to burn them to death. When they die, they respawn. Think Halo, with Psychic Powers! What do you think? Possible?

			Im not sure if this falls under combat or not, but what if it turned out to be 'Matrix Style', if you killed them in your 'dreaming game', their bodies might die.

			I highly doubt that is possible, but being your dream would you not be able to control it? Also, don't get me wrong. This is all meant to be in the name of fun.

Hey man, scientists didnt think blackholes existed until a picture was taken of one, afterall, were talking on a forum about using your mind to move inanimate objects, some people would say thats impossible, but we know its not, the impossible is not as impossible as it may seem, but yes, that was a rather silly idea  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />.

well, it could be. the host of the game(the guy whos dreaming) could imagine the map and think of a person in their mind, concentrate(extremly hard in a dream), and invite them. theyd probably be mad if they were dreaming of a chick <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> but otherwised confused.

			*Sigh* If I had a shared dream of that many people (And yes, It's quite possible, I even think that there is an article about it) I'd do something a LITTLE more imaginitive then something you can already do in real life. You can do <span style="font-style: italic">anything</span> you want, can't you think of anything more fun to do with 10 people when you can control everything?
<br />

<br />
Just a thought, but as to your original idea, it <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> possible, just difficult.
<br />
It'd be much easier just to set up a Halo Lan, if that was your original purpose.

			well if dreamwalking is possible then sure it is possible , but i guess all the people are supposed to be very experienced in the dream phenomenon.
<br />
think what if we will gather ALOT of people and do this every night!
<br />
itll be like living in 2 multiplayer worlds.. one while your awake and one while asleep. that would be fu*king cool! but well there is a big diffrennce between just willing it to happen to making it happen..

			Yeah, we could gather a group of about 10 people and get them in the one dream, and play heaps of lucid games! Weather it be flight racing, psychic deathmatches or joining up and becoming a gang of X-Men, slaughtering legions of Agent Smiths! The possibilities are endless!
