			Hey.
<br />

<br />
Fire PK, Ice PK, and PK PK, are driving me crazy. I try them and try them and i feel like the harder i try, the farther away i get from accomplishing my goal.....
<br />

<br />
I practice a little every day.
<br />

<br />
So people i need some inspiration. Maybe video, picture, or even just some comment to convince me. Becuase it is really sucking right now.

			lol sounds like you're trying to hard.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
You'll find if you let it happen, don't care if it does and just watch it move you'll have an easier time doing it.  
<br />

<br />
From what I experienced, the JDI method only worked for me and once I improved and my sub-c kept improving I could use different methods and get it to work faster, and what not.  Make sure you're also not anxious, excited, or are gasping for air.
<br />

<br />
Yes, and make sure you do practice everyday.  You'll notice after a while your sub-c will start to listen to you and move where you want it , or you'll be able to influence it better.
<br />

<br />
Just keep at it.
<br />

<br />
Inspiration- just think of things you'll be able to move if you got good at it.  If you could spin you could affect, blinds, curtains, paper, well just about anything... flags, hanging potted plants. Just make lists and lists of what you'll try to move once you get good.!

			Damn dude, Shut the fuck up and calm down.
<br />

<br />
It's not going to happen in one go. 
<br />

<br />
Keep a daily practice of energy manipulation and psychokinesis.
<br />

<br />
Think of it this way, if you were to run a race, without training, you'll fucking lose or get injured from terrible conditions of your body, so treat your mind that way too.
<br />

<br />
Inspirations...I can't really help you with that as I can't get myself motivated.

I wasn't yelling at him. You don't see a fucking exclamation point do you? You're obviously an idiot since I didn't just post to tell him to shut up, I gave him pointers too.

			you want inspiration?
<br />
well, why don't you watch X-Men 3?
<br />
i didn't yet (but want to), but i heard that jean grey gets some more spotlights on her, so you will see more tk in there than in the previous X-Men.
<br />
i've watched a tv series called supernatural (i don't know the name in english, it's the plain traduction from portuguese name), it's about two brothers that are hunting a ghost, and until they catch this ghost, who killed their mother and one of the guys girfriend, they face a lot of ghosts, demons, and stuff
<br />
this week they met a guy who used tk to kill his dad, uncle and step mother, cause they would hit him when he was a boy
<br />
was very nice to see when he started getting nervous and made a knife float.

I am so glad you didnt say PYROkinesis or CRYOkinesis. 
<br />
First you have to master basic PK before you move on to different style.
<br />
Your subconscious is telling you ITS TOO HARD or YOU CANT DO IT. Tell your subconscious to shut up sometimes.
