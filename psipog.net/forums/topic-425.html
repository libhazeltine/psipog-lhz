			I used to get this alot when I was younger, now it seems to be occuring a bit less than it used to. I'd be doing something and then all of a sudden a weird feeling would pass through me and I would feel as if I had already experienced the situation at hand and I knew what was going to happen next. Like a movie I had already seen. Is that related to Psionics in anyway, or does that have to do with personality disorders? I have narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, and schizotypal disorders. I'm really confused about this.

			From what I've been told, deja vu and precognition are not the same. Deja vu is simply a feeling of something happening before, of you being in a place before. It's a feeling. Precognition is the knowledge of future events without the use of any of your normal five senses. They're not the same.
<br />

<br />
From discussions I've had, it seems that many psychologists consider deja vu to be a malfunction in the brain, where an event in the present is &quot;misfiled&quot; as a memory, hence the sensation.

			Deja vu is a mainstream phenomen, many scientist try to analyse it but they couldn't gather much information about it.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Maybe it's just another riddle that humanity has to solve?

			a friend of mine said deja vu is a sign of brain cancer and your memory tricks you into thinking it already happed (but then again my friend is a idiot) ive never had something happen to me and think this happend to me before, unless its really obvious (such as logging on to my computer, i think ive done that at least a trillion times <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> ) but there are times when i just know something is going to happen, such as some days i know witch teacher is going to be really angry.

			I think that if that were true, most people of earth would have brain cancer. I seem to be getting d?j? vu's more often than before. Sometimes I even know what the person's gonna say next but nothing more.
<br />
Also the name is french(I'm sure most people knew that but anyway): d?j? vu means already(d?j?) seen(vu)

			I always get d?j? vu's.  I remember when I was young, I would almost always get the feeling and I used to wonder what a d?j? vu felt like because, being completely used to the feeling, I thought it was perfectly normal.  Recently, I've gotten completely used to it, so I almost never notice it, except for when I'm thinking about it.  Like now.

			Yeah I have these feelings too. One second you are perfectly normal and the next second it clicks that you had seen yourself doing whatever you are doing at that time. Its not big like Neo sees the cat twice in the matrix. Just a gut feeling like been there, done that for a microsecond. And its quite frequent. Atleast once a month. This normally happens to me in areas where I don't commonly go or things I dont commonly do, so it doesn't happen at home. But the feeling is not like as seen in a dream, its just totally different, undescribable.

			WHat if you go to sleep, have a dream, wake up, rememebr the dream, and three months later the dream is real and you REMEMEBR remembering the dream 3 months beforehand. Happens to me all the time.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I dreamt that a hamster died on my book shelf, but i didnt own a hamster. My mom got me a hamster few weeks later, just like the one in my dream, and then a month or os later, it died, just like in the dream. To my cat. In the exact same way, when the cat pounced on it in life, it was the SAME pounce as in the dream.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Happens to me every few months, and its usualy something bad in the dream. Ive yet to see any good things.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Any idea what that is?

			And its not just events like that, it can be VERY specific.
<br />

<br />

<br />
One dream we were riding in the car, mom driving brother riding shotgun, in her jeep. we were talking about hotdogs and were on the way home from the dentist. the light turns red and 3 people walk across the street, man woman and a baby in a stroller, the stroller was blue, the man had brown hair and a james bond haircut.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Those exact same things happened about 4 months later, and i KNEW the light was turning red and the people would cross the street about a mile beforehand because i regonised the dream, the topic of hotdogs, who was sitting where and what they were wearing, the street we were on.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Every dream that this happens is ALWAYS 100% accurate. There is never any error. Ever. IVe been through maybe 30 of these dreams since the age of 10, i am 19 now. I do not remember them from any age younger than 10.

			Just a thought. Even if deja vu <span style="font-weight: bold">were</span> precognition, then it wouldn't do you any good. Deja vu occurs when you do something that reminds you of something that already occurred, as if you have done it again. So if it were, then that form of precognition would do you no good because it would be precognition after the event already occurred.
<br />

<br />
Which is also an argument against why deja vu may not be associated with precognition. If you do an event that you think you did before, then it would in fact not be looking into the future for two reasons:
<br />

<br />
1) You have just done the event as you experience the deja vu
<br />
2) If you have that deja vu feeling, it could potentially mean that it happened in the past, not the future. If it didn't then it's just you imagining you did something twice.

It sucks, because they're so cool to have.

The feeling's ALWAYS just like &quot;WTF! I remember this, EXACTLY!&quot;

Whether it was real deja vu, or just in a dream, it still holds the same amount of awesome.

			I've had a dream of an event and then a few days latter it occured. It was da javu and it was only after it happened and got the feeling that I new I had dreamed it. I think da javu is precog and if you could somehow focus it and control it I think it would become a substantial form of psionics
