			Maybe....  what do you think is going to happen if you start messing with your eyes?  You could possibly cause something unrepairable, or you could end up permanently changing your eye color without any side effects.

			the only negative side affect that i had is my eyes seem to be stuck in this light yellowish brown color. i had a few headaches while changing color but other than that nothing seriously bad really happens. more of this is covered in my changing eye color thread in the personal techniques section.

			so many peoples eye color changes naturaly or they do it subconciously. I dont think anything seriously bad would happen but dont take my word for it, im very inexperienced.

there is a boy in school named jorge who has very pale skin and because of this has been nicknamed albino (by me and others as well <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ) when you stare at his eyes you notice a very subtle redish spots going around the inner circly core of his eye. The rest of his eyes shift from a blue/green to a green/blue color.

			Depends on method, your body is geneticly programed to only color the iris muscles with the color you are supost to have, with enough enfluence I was able to make my eyes more green, but after a few days they went back.  This is probably the same result.  Then agian, this was a very logn tiem ago when i first began, I often wonder if it really changed, or if i wanted to &quot;think&quot; it changed. chances are, if it changes, it will just go back.

			By default, I have grayish-blue eyes, but lots of people told me that if I get angry, my eyes change to a greenish color, and once, a guy positively <span style="font-style: italic">fled</span> from me, and later told me my eyes turned <span style="font-style: italic">red</span>. And he said they changed color fast, like in some 15 seconds.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I have never done it on purpose, though, so if anyone could give me some tips on how to do this, I'd be very grateful.
