			Ok well this was my third lucid dream.  And I found them to be rather fun.  This one started in a parking lot in the middle of no where.  It was just a giant parking lot and nothing around.  So I decided to fly around and I finally came to a gate.  There was a guard there.  I attempted to fly over the gate and he stopped me, he said, &quot;I can't let you leave.&quot;  
<br />

<br />
What was really weird is that I knew I was dreaming.  I even did a reality check with the watch I was wearing and I said allowed &quot;I am dreaming&quot;.  
<br />

<br />
He would not let me past.  Then I just tried closing my eyes and opening them to go somewhere else and he said, &quot;I can't let you do that either, I'm sorry.&quot;  and when I opened my eyes I was still there.  No matter what I tried I couldn't leave.
<br />

<br />
What is this about?  I don't even know why I started in a parking lot, but it was just weird.
<br />

<br />
Why would he not let me leave, even though I proved I was dreaming, and knew I was.

			If you're lucid dreaming, then it's all in your head, so to speak.  If it's all in your head, then the guy is something you constructed for reasons unknown.  Maybe some manifestation of a fear?  Not sure, it's something that you'd have to work out.

			Sometimes dreams are just like that. As Roy said, it could be a subconscious thing. If I was in your place I would have asked him why not. You might have found out what he represented. Or how to get away.

			lol, its just like when you go to shoot a bad guy in your dreams the barrel droops to the ground or the bullits are completly ineffective. What you should realize is that you are in complete controle, not some imaginary guy.

			Ah ok, now here's what you would do. Return to the same place where the guard was and ask him &quot;why?&quot;. It is best to learn about your own dream phenomenon by exploring and learning. You could learn a lot about in reality why he would not let you pass, because after all you are creating him. There was once this Indian physician that liked to lucid dream however he had a different kind of fun in his dreams. He realized it was a dream and said to a crowd of people which I assume he gathered and said &quot;you are not real, you are fake, I created you, this is only a dream etc etc. In the end he was exceedingly dissed by the crowd. So he said unto the crowd next time I dream I will prove to you that this is really a dream. What I'm trying to say is that instead of showing superpowers or something he was dealing with himself, he's gotta convince himself. So the next night he was with some dream sages (in his dream), he said that they are not real. Then they said: &quot; how can you say we are not real in this dream? If you have created us in this dream then this dream has surely created you&quot; Or something along the lines of that.
