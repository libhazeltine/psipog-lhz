			Seriously, if it's not time for the light to turn green - even if you can make it do so - don't mess with it. Traffic lights are there for a reason - so cars don't come from two conflicting directions and hit each other.

			i think it's too much effort for nothing. the time you would need to do it would  pass the 10, 20, 30 secs of red light. but ok, if you can do it in 3 secs, lucky you ^^

			I've done it often, actually i try all the time! lol about half the time I get it with in a few seconds.  Search(top of the screen) retro PK(it's actually called micro PK) and you'll get a site where there are a few games.  Play them, get good and apply it to traffic lights.  And It wouldn't mess with traffic at all unless your trying to electronically make the light green.  Otherwise your just  doing what the people in that game sight have explained.  It's possible to change the out come of an already decided event, like a traffic light.

I explain this badly i think

			ok. here's the DL on traffic lights...
<br />

<br />
if you take the time to note the time of day that you arrive at the traffic light; lets say its 9.45pm. and you note that its red. tomorrow night at 9.45pm. its gonna be red. and so on. and so on.. i dont know who belives that there are motion detectors or sensors or scales under the ground, but the truth is.. there aren't. so the only way to make the light green, is to KNOW when its coming. you can easily do this by looking at the OTHER lights that should be green (if yours is red/vise versa) when those turn yellow, yours is close to being green.
<br />

<br />
i DO NOT suggest that you start trying out your PSIbilities on traffic lights, cause i damn near guarantee it that you'll lose focus of &quot;REAL LIFE/TIME&quot; and  make yourself belive that the RED LIGHT is actually GREEN, and you can seriously hurt yourself and others by this practice. Pay attention in drivers ed kids, and stay safe on the road.

			Thats untrue.  If a light only stays green say nine seconds.  It wont be the same color every time of the day.  And there are sensors.  But they always say were they are with those signs &quot;stop here to activate light&quot; They dont say activate though, it's and obscure a word that means the same thing but longer, and I always wondered why they'd waste the money to put so many more letters on all those signs.

<br />
There really is no danger, I'm confused as to  what you were saying in that last part.  Are you saying you might make your self halucinate that it is green???

yes, if you're driving. i can see its quite possible someone coming to a red light thinking ' turn green turn green turn green' and forgetting to hit the brakes. accidents happen ya know. 
<br />

<br />
i dunno man, where i live every day at the same time i can put money on what color the light is going to be. im not sure where theres a city with 9 second lights but i would LOVE to live there.

			on the other site i belong to, they &quot;said&quot; how to do it.  they said something like using PK to affect the switch on the inside of the traffic control box; not actually &quot;will&quot; the light to change while visualizing it happening.  i do this with about 70% accuracy (within a second or two, if it doesn't happen THEN, then i don't count it).  i use a different method though.  i use energy manipulation to project psionic energy into the box and act as if the current leading to the now red light is closing, and the current heading to the now green light is opening.  i don't fully understand how the box works, but this method works for me.  after a few hundred times doing this, my sub-c is conditioned to go through these steps whenever i project energy at a TCB, even if i don't want it to.
