			Is a fraud. Psychics have been telling me that it is &quot;likely&quot; my ex girlfriend and I would get back together. Dale Power agreed, but said &quot;it's likely your paths will come together mid to late may. You will purposefully be in the same place at the same time with the potential of coming together for a longer period of time. This does not mean you will have a loving relationship, get married, etc.! Things become more precise as the window of time closes in, and I see May 20-25th.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Well, she has a new boyfriend, hasn't spoken to me in months. Her friends say she hates me, she told me never to speak to her or e-mail her again, and I've heard she's much happier without me. She doesn't hurt or feel bad at all.
<br />

<br />
This, to me, already proves that Power is talking a bunch of nonsense. I have saved my e-mails with him, and would be happy to show these to you to prove he is a fraud.
<br />

<br />
I don't know if you guys can really do what you say, but after speaking with this guy, I highly doubt this stuff now. Some reassurance right now would be great. 
<br />

<br />
Sorry if I offended anyone, I didn't mean to. Just confused and hurt right now. Going through an extremely tough time (I'm sure you've all heard this stuff before, but I am not like those other losers).
<br />

<br />
Thanks for reading, commenting, etc.

			Precognition isn't infallible. Nothing is. So he was wrong. Okay, so he was wrong about something REALLY BIG. He might be a fraud, but that doesn't mean we all are. 
<br />

<br />
Relax, just trust in whatever force guides you, whether it be some god or just your conscience, chill out, and keep practicing. Somewhere, things are going to fail you. But that doesn't mean they're not there. If your car craps out, it doesn't make you doubt the legitimacy of the Internal Combustion Engine, does it? Of course not. Why should Psi be any different?

			Hi guys -
<br />

<br />
First, I said &quot;pyschics&quot; and posted about him here, because much of what he supposedly does is based on Telepathy and Empathy. I found this to be relevant to this website.
<br />

<br />
Second, I find that precognition has never been even remotely accurate in regards to my life. I have heard these excuses before...here is one from one of his e-mails: &quot;It is a mistake to think of the future as fixed.  Or
<br />
of psychics as perfect in the view of the future...&quot; This is fine and dandy, but the problem lies in that the reasoning that &quot;precognition isn't infallible,&quot; &quot;the future isn't fixed,&quot; etc., makes it so that these psychics are never wrong! I could easily do readings (charging tons of money!) for each of you, and totally cold read you, or make some future event up, and when I am proven wrong, say to you, &quot;well, I told you precognition wasn't infallible.&quot; See where I'm going with this?
<br />

<br />
So yeah, maybe some of you are not frauds. I would LOVE to come across someone who isn't a fraud in this area. Perhaps some PSI abilities are real, but I definitely no longer believe in Telepathy and Empathy, at least not in the sense that people can PURPOSEFULLY perform these.
<br />

<br />
Why aren't any gorgeous women or men psychics? Why is it always some fat, ugly, old, (or all three) loser? 
<br />

<br />
Finally, I'm not foolish enough to call up some 800 number anymore, or talk to someone like Sylvia Brown. The &quot;psychics&quot; I have talked to have been Dale Power, this woman at an occult shop in downtown seattle, my mother (who claims in and out that this stuff is real), and a few others actually. All of them said May. All of them. I've tried being really selective about my words when asking about this to them so that they aren't able to cold read me. I've tried questioning things to the point where, like Dale Power, these &quot;psychics&quot; give up answering my questions and just ignore me.

I think you are wrong...people can be frauds, but PSI ain't
<br />

<br />
I always thought that we can do things with our brain that are so-called paranormal and super natural
<br />
When I first time found articles about that on interntet, I thought it is fraud
<br />
Then I tried some things, and realised that they are not fraud
<br />

<br />
And it is imposible that sp many people on this and many other forums are talking about this just to fraud you.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			You're right about one thing...there are a lot of people who claim to be able to do this. And I know that a lot of these people do so without any sort of chance at profiting from it. The question to me is, are these people crazy? I think that many people *think* that they can do these things, but really can't. Dale Power is one of them for sure. 
<br />

<br />
I told Power that I would not let him get away with what he did, and so I will not. I've hit a couple of message boards posting about this, and everything I expected to have happen happened; the people at the boards either never heard of him, or argued that PSI is real. This is to be expected posting at PSI boards. If there were a skeptic page, I'd be a hero. Regardless, I respect that you have all been so civil, despite my rudeness, and I think that says a lot. I still don't believe in precog, telepathy, and empathy, but you guys are respectable people. Thank you.
<br />

<br />
In case anyone wants, here is Dale's website: <a href="http://healing.worldispnetwork.com/" target="_blank">http://healing.worldispnetwork.com/</a>
<br />

<br />
As an experiment, I'd like someone to go to his site and try his free reading. It really is free. However, I'd like to see if in the reading he mentions mental problems, or anything biological. For example, I had him do a free reading, and I asked if my ex would take me back, or if I would meet someone else that would make me just as happy. He replied saying this (just so you are aware, the first psychic I spoke to said early May, and I did not tell Power this: I only told him May, and btw, my birthday is May 20th): 
<br />

<br />
&quot;This is a little strange, because, while I would
<br />
concur with the other psychic and May seems a likely
<br />
time, a little past mid May, for the two of you to
<br />
get back together...
<br />

<br />
Something feels very &quot;off&quot; about this situation. As
<br />
odd as this may sound to you right now, it seems
<br />
almost like your ex has been having some mental
<br />
problems...
<br />

<br />
Severe confusion and perhaps even delusional behavior,
<br />
in her INTERNAL world.
<br />

<br />
So getting back together with her, even though it
<br />
seems fine at the time, may not be a wonderful idea
<br />
for your long term happiness.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Now my next e-mail basically said, &quot;hey, if in mid may we get back together, what can I do to help her mental problems?&quot; This is when he told me that, telepathically, he could fix her mental problems, for $150.00. Before anyone calls me stupid, you should know that I checked online for anyone who mentioned being scammed by him. I found two articles with replies from people who claimed he was &quot;the shit,&quot; so to speak (haha), and nobody had complained about him. I checked PayPal as well, and everyone who had paid for his services loved him.
<br />

<br />
You should all know that Mr. Power is in fact very nice, and that after I had paid for his services, he still answered my e-mails. It just got to a point where, myself being very paranoid and scared of being scammed, asked very many questions and probed so much, that he eventually dropped contact. 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, my theory is that anyone who takes him up on his free reading offer, is told that there is some sort of biological problem involved. When they ask what they can do, he says (like he did to me) that only he can fix it, for a price. I'd like someone to test this theory. Perhaps I'll ask a friend. 
<br />

<br />
You have to hand it to Mr. Power, though...at least he gives his initial psychic readings for free. Every other site I've seen charges your nuts for a reading!
<br />

<br />
Anyone up for testing this out for me? If not it's cool, I'll talk to my friends and get them to do it...

Don't get all irritated over your problems and saying psychic powers are fake. Not saying that every psychic is real, personally, I'm biased and well say that any psychic earning money on what they do I would instantly claim to be fake.

			I'm sorry to hear that you have been messed around by people calling themselves 'psychic'.  Do remember that nobody is always right.  There is a guy on Oxford Street in London who just plays one note (really high and really loud) on a tin whistle.  There is also a blind man who plays his violin VERY badly, and I so want to give both of them asbo's.  However I'm doing a music degree, and one of my friends is a truly excellent violinist, and another is a very good flautist (and even they sometimes play badly).  Just because there are people who aren't good doesn't mean everybody is bad.
<br />

<br />
In some ways you are very lucky.  I'm 22 and haven't had a relationship yet.  True, I haven't had the pain of a break-up but I have not had the joy that comes with a relationship either.  Finally, if it's any consolation, I've made just 2 Psi balls and I'm still wondering whether this whole thing isn't just a load of nonsense.  Don't lose faith just because one person has messed you around.  If I believed that those people on Oxford Street were the best examples of musicians, I would not still be enjoying playing the Violin after 16 years of hard work.
<br />
