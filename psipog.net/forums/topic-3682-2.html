			this reminds me of the movie clock stoppers.
<br />
any way you know those instances when you drop something and think oh krap or if something is coming at you and is going to hit you. i have noticed that as soon as that happens it is as if time slows down because to me everything is moving slower. anothwer example might be when you think you do not have time to get of of the way of something

			Yup!  I am actually super perceptive to things being hurled my way (even if not facing that direction), and at one point I had a basketball thrown at the back of my head, I remember turning around, seeing it about 6 in. from my face, and then dodging it, ever so gracefully.  Basically, it seemed to me to be 5 secs but in reality it was more like 1/2 sec.

			i don't know for sure but if you move fast enough then you should age slower that you would have origanally, but i don'e know that as a fact.

			Sounds possible, but I wouldn't go too far. After all, moving your atoms too fast would heat you up, and you would eventually turn into a liquid.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> You would also use up enormous amounts of energy.

			For those who are open-minded, I like to quote some part of the Yoga science.
<br />

<br />
There are alot of Yoga Sutra's. These Sutra's define the entire meaning of yoga. I am not talking about the physical Hatha yoga, but about Raja Yoga. Which is about mastering the mind and consciousness.
<br />

<br />
In the 3rd of the four chapters of the Yoga sutras, there are two sutra's following each other in correct order, talking about the mastery over the body and attaining the speed you all refer to. The third chapter of the yoga sutra's is about the Accomplishments one can attain if one Has practiced the right form of focus and contemplation.
<br />

<br />
Here are the two Sutra's:
<br />

<br />
The first one, which is defining what needs to be done:
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Sutra 3.48:</span></span>
<br />
[Original Sanskrit Text:]
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Grahana svarupa asmita anvaya arthavattva samyamat indriya jayah</span>
<br />

<br />
[Translation into English:]
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">By Samyama* on the power of perception and on the essential nature, correlation with the ego sense and purpose of the sense organs, mastery over them is gained.</span>
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">In Sutra 3.49 Patanjali continues:</span></span>
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Tato mano javitvam vikaranabhavah pradhana jayah cha</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">From that [referring to the accomplishment described in sutra 48], the body gains the power to move as fast as the mind, the ability to function without the aid of the sense organs, and the complete mastery over the primairy cause (Prakriti, or: Nature).</span>
<br />

<br />
This is a small part from an ancient science. Do with it what you will.
<br />

<br />
MA
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">Note*: Samyama means the practice of Concentration&gt;&gt;Meditation&gt;&gt;and Samadhi (enlightened state of oneness with the object focussed upon.)</span>

			How would you age slower if your molecules are sped up? Not to get in a rant here but it's like doing better work and getting the answer wrong on a math test.

			There is no such thing as &quot;time&quot;, as far as I know. A clock is a vibrating quartz crystal. Dates are numbers.
<br />

<br />
Just because we made numbers doesn't mean we &quot;pass&quot; through anything besides those numbers.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I like what they said in &quot;what the bleep do we know&quot;, 
<br />

<br />
&quot;It doesn't make sense from the perspective of a physicist, why we should be able to remember the past, but not also remember the future... Why do we think we can act now and change the future, but not the past?&quot;.
<br />

<br />
After all, the only thing that exists right &quot;now&quot; is NOW! There is no past and future. It's all in your head!
<br />

<br />
So, if it originates in your head in the first place, all it takes to change that is practice.
<br />

<br />
However, also consider this. How will you know if you're percieving something &quot;faster&quot;? You don't have anything to compare it to.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Time distortion is possible.  Actually, I'm positive you already DO it!  After all, when you go to sleep at night, does it really feel like you slept for 8 hours?  Have you ever had a 20 minute nap that felt like 2 hours?  Or a 6 hour night that felt like 20 minutes?  Altering your perception of time can be accomplishing using meditation, sleep, hypnosis, etc... Pretty much anything that alters your state of consciousness.
<br />

<br />
However... the idea of &quot;speeding up your molecules&quot; so that you perceive time at a different rate... just doesn't scientifically make sense.  Your molecules speed up and slow down on their own... it's called body temperature.  If you sped up your molecules, you would feel really hot.  If you slow them down, you feel cold.  This wouldn't affect your perception of time.
