			Actually, what you're doing is consider more science. Really, it's very edgy science, but it's there nonetheless. Don't worry. Psionics have more chances of being proven real than hell.

			I'm gonna agree with everyone else who's posted thus far, and say that it's not witchcraft. Witchcraft has some similarities, yes, but the two are FAR different. 
<br />

<br />
Personally, I got most of my abilities from prayer. So therefore, psi is a gift from God for me. And if it comes from God Himself, then by definition, you can't go to Hell for it!

But I'm gonna cut the religious talk. If you want to continue this, PM me.

			hell is translated from hades, a greek word meaning &quot;without perception&quot;. it is not what most people think it is. I suggest you look around <a href="http://bible-truths.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">this site</a> a bit. He can be a bit stupid, but he can also be fairly smart, and he knows the real translations pretty well.
<br />

<br />
now, you need to think for yourself, ask yourself questions about your beliefs, test them against each other, your ideas, your feelings. your mind should contain more than a single ancient book supposedly written by god. If it doesn't you might turn into a fundy. open your mind. your parents aren't the holders of infinite knowledge, and no offense, but they sound pretty stupid to me. If we were afraid we'd never learn anything.

			I'm also christian, and if you don't ask satan to move that psiwheel for ya, you won't go to hell. The bible talks about OBE's- tell that to your parents. Also, challenge them. Say, &quot;what is witchcraft?&quot; and then ask them, &quot;how does psionics go against christianity&quot;.

I think that christians who think harry potter, psi, and beer are bad are very retarded. they're bad christians.   my dad believes that there might be psychic people and knows that it doesn't go against our religion, but I still haven't told him about psionics... haha, my parents are always telling me to go get a hobby and they don't know what I've been doing all the time for the last 1.5 years- saving humanity and mingling with unseen mysterious powers. lol.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

To be perfectly honest, the abilities sought after and used in psionics are also sought after and used in other forms of magick (which I guess would encompass witchcraft).  I'll go against the advice that everyone else is telling you and recommend that perhaps you talk with your priest/reverend/congregation leader about this.
<br />

<br />
If you do, and he is accepting of this, understands that it's not witchcraft or evil or sinful, then you can probably convince him to speak with your parents about it.  If your parents hear from him that it's not evil, then they will, in all likelihood, allow you to practice.
<br />

<br />
I feel that this would be a lot better than confrontation and blatantly challenging your parents beliefs.  If they're to accept what you do, then they need to alter the beliefs they currently hold, and I feel that the persuasion of a priest will have a much greater impact than yours would.
<br />

<br />
Good luck.

Roy, you always have a way of making me look really stupid. I read your post and thought, &quot;Man, why didn't I think of that?!&quot;
<br />

<br />
But yeah, asking a priest would make sense. He's able to tell you what the faith says about it. I talked to my priest about it, and he was accepting, so the Anglican/Episcopalian church doesn't have anything against it, as far as I can discern. 
<br />

<br />
But I say that if you pray about it, and ask God what HE says about it, then you'd be pretty well off as well.
<br />

<br />
But again, I'm gonna cut the religious talk. Saying too much is a really bad habit of mine here...

			Your parents sound like conservative christians. My parents are very liberal and one of them is actually interested in psi (she has had multiple OBEs, has done telepathy, and has frequent precognitions).

			Actually, to be perfectly honest, I believe psionics more or less falls under the same umbrella the majority of other forms of magic and occult practices do, and as such is shunned by the mainstream church.
<br />

<br />
Your best bet is to just not tell them I guess? Psionics has the advantage over those other forms of magic etc. that it requires few to no expensive books/componants, or long, large and detailed ritual work, so if you have free net access, access to a book store (optional, but probably preferable), and a room with a lock on the door, then you should be fine.
