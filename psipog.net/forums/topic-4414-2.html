			I'd say the best way to do that would be to... A. try out each 'element' and see which comes easiest. or B. Dont bother, and go straight to Earth or whatever you prefer. Even if it means you have to work harder at it, if you like it, and your willing to exert the effort, it's worth it in my book.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I'm going to respectfully disagree with palm reading being crap. I've done it before, and I own a book on it, and even when I read palms in a matter-of-fact way, there are some things that are fuckin' creepy. Maybe coincidences, but my &quot;Air Hand&quot; grew into a &quot;Water hand&quot; (Over a few years as I was growing up), and those are my two strongest elements. That, and I carry the signs on a palm that are said to indicate psychig ability and intuition. 
<br />
Sure, it could be bull, but it's still fun. 
<br />

<br />
As far as figuring out &quot;your&quot; element, I suggest playing with all of them. If they come naturally, or even more naturally than others, then you know!

			That too. It can be what you like alot (as i am with regular old TK, and my friend is with Fire) Or, it could be what comes most naturally to you, and you are best at... (Cooling for me, and heat for my friend [go figure its what he likes <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> ])

			ok pepsi ..... 
<br />

<br />
who said that psi is mystical? ya like Fin said, when i say mystical i mean a more cultish mysticism.
<br />

<br />
psi is mystical, but a different definition of mystical. if you look at the word mystical in a broad sense, something that is mystical is something that cannot be explained in terms that we are aware of (what i mean when i say this, its against the 'norm' even though we know now that we use psi in our everyday lives without even knowing). palm reading and psi fall under this category. 
<br />

<br />
To distinguish between the two is the fact that psi can be partially explained by science now, but never actually proven as fact, aka psi has been explained by scientific theories. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not aware of any scientific theories that explain palm reading. 
<br />

<br />
Palm reading falls under the category of things that can be affected by the placebo effect.

			Why do you care what your &quot;element&quot; is?  What does it mean to you?  If it's actually something half way legit, do you think an online quiz of 20 questions could determine it?  It sounds like another gimmick thats used to get people's attention, but ultimately has no real purpose.

			I think the ''element'' is just like sports, hobbies, and everything else... some people are naturally better at some while weaker at others. Same for psi, I'm good with telekinesis, lucid dreams, astrals projections but weak in psiballs,  constructs, telepathy.... Maybe it's just the Sub-C, but yeah, I don't see any purposes of knowing what is, just improve what you want to <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
