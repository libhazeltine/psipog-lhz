			Its a movie made in the late 80's or 90's highley based on witchcraft. The movie is about 3 girls needing a 4th to be able to summon some kind of all knowing all powerfull diety. When i new girl moves into town they quickly see she has alot of natural power.
<br />

<br />
In one scene the new girl is sitting at her desk bored as hell like many of us are most of the time. She takes a pencil and balances it on the tilted desktop on its point. She stares at it with a with very &quot;concentraty&quot; eyes. When another students looks up and sees this she gasps and as she does the new girl gets surprised (breaking her concentration) and the pencil loses balance.
<br />

<br />
The movie in general is one of my all time favorites but this scene specificly makes me excited. Have any of you tried to balance a pencil like this? Or have any of you ever seen the movie. I downloaded it off bittorrent =P
<br />

<br />
This movie later becomes the inspiration twards the pop-culture hit &quot;Charmed&quot; wich is now gone forever  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />

			It's a good movie, despite being fluffier than a teddy bear (from both the point of view of psi an dof witchcraft).

I particularly liked the part with her changing her eye and hair colour.  Pah, I'm such a girl.

How the hell was it fluffy? It wasn't meant to be real. It was meant to be entertaining fiction.
<br />
Just because something isn't realistic, it doesn't mean it is fluffy. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />
