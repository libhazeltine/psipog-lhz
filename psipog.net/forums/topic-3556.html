			I was thinking of this as a way to help blind people &quot;see&quot; around in an enviroment. This idea was stricken to me when making a psi ball and pushing it against a physical object, thinking that if I could make a huge psi ball and push against against things, I can sense objects with just feeling like that. Then, I thought of dolphins and bats and any other creature that sends off sound and bounces it back to determine the distance of the object.  Refer to my paper method on my blog to know what I mean..

			As useful as this may be, it would seem quite hard to develop a good enough sense that you can judge distance with. Why not a construct instead? It could transfer images to the blind persons mind using tp.

			Hmm.. if say someone was born blind they might not understand what an image is, I just thought of my idea as something primitive. Maybe Remote viewing would be an alternative?

 I knew a girl who was born blind. If I had known about this, I could have helped her, then again, I was like only 10.

			ok well.. what if for example, I was blindfolded and I decided to try that out. I have, but not too far out of my room because it's too embarassing to walk around slowly with hands reached out in the kitchen XD! Try blindfolding yourself and doing it? I never tried TPing images of the room.. that sounds like Remote viewing to me actually.

			actually, it's kinda hard to explain but I don't consider it so much as an echo effect, it's more along the line of clairavoyance, there are 4 segments to it, one is for far seeing, one is hearing voices, another having knowledge though no idea how you know it and I forget the 4th one. It sorta combines all aspects into one and teaches spatial awareness and also teaches sensitivity for touch, hearing, smell. 
<br />
However, it is a good idea to learn in case ever blindfolded and you needed to find your way around, might start off with a group of people being spun until dizzy with earplugs in as well, being outdoors and have 3-4 people hide behind stuff, in trees ect and then try to point out who is who and where.

			You could just feel the surroundings with your awareness. Or maybe make your field bigger, stretch it out, reinforce it, etc, then sense where it intersects with objects. That's useful too.

			I was talking about it on a lower scale.. not ESP, not clairvoyance, just a large bunch of energy inbetween you and a physical object.  The energy will push against you if there is something physical. Of course, with your ideas this would be on a larger scale.  Maybe instead of it just pushing against you, you can &quot;feel&quot; the object, textures, roughness, etc. Maybe to what you're saying and i'm saying is the same thing, it would be a translation problem XD
<br />

I hope we're on the same track here because I was going to post angry things earlier, I hope it doesn't look like i'm still in a weird mood  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			well actually ive thought of that before, never tested it though but i decided to take that one step further. 
<br />
yes you make a psi ball that is....lets say has a one yard radius and you are the center. the ball sends out signals and you can have those signals translated into an actual picture in your head. so you are seeing the world around you in your head through signals translated into images. 
<br />
kinda crafty and you'll probably need descent skill in programming. 
<br />

<br />
but........if you try and understand how your mind sends signals from your eyes and then translates them into images like that, just try and replicate it with the psi ball. 
<br />

<br />
it shouldnt be as hard as trying to be clairavoyant or esp or something.

			i aready have a construct that does something simaler it uses a very thin energy it emanates in order to give me like somewhat of a radar feeling i optionaly can command the construct to use very thin strands of energy to detect light refracting at certain angles to determine an objects color,depth and thickness be aware that this construct uses a LOT of energy and anybody that makes it (besides me) please pm me

(P.S. i used a small shortcut)

Well actually there is something pretty new that when they put this chip thingy behind your eye and then your eyesight slowly comes back... but it doesnt always work. I SAW IT ON THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL! or somethin like that...
