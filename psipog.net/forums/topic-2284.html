			Okay, so now I've been practicing every day for about an hour for more than a week. I practice <span style="font-weight: bold">ONLY</span> with my psi wheel under a glass, because I breathe hard and don't want to have phoney results. 
<br />

<br />
I'd also like to add that I <span style="font-weight: bold">never</span> use my hands. I only try to move it with my mind.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">My current results:</span> I have not seen OBVIOUS for sure movement that jumped out me and said, &quot;woah, I definately moved it there&quot;, but so far, I have seen what looks like very, very, VERY, subtle movements in the wheel that made me think, &quot;hmmm, I wonder if it's moving or if I'm just hallucinating.&quot;
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Question 1:</span>
<br />

<br />
Is this right to be getting hallucinations and or subtle movements in the wheel?
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Question 2:</span> 
<br />

<br />
A. Do people who use their hands while practicing get better / faster results?
<br />

<br />
B. What is a good technique for using my hands? I've heard I need to imagine force coming from my hands to the target, but could you please be more specific?
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Question 3:</span> How long did it take <span style="font-weight: bold">you</span> to start seeing results? What results did you see in this amount of time (how much movement in the wheel or whatever object it was)?
<br />

<br />
Thanks for all your time and effort,

I don't think it was hullucinations. That happened to me also when I started. If you see subtle movements, that means your on the right track.

<span style="font-weight: bold">A</span>: I've heard that if you use your hands, your mind thinks that it's easier because you use your hands in daily activities. It's more used to using your hands. There is no difference in using your hands or just your mind. It's the same thing. I personally don't use hands. I feel much comfortable with just using my mind.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">B</span>: There are many techniques such as: Imagine psi shooting out of your hands and hitting the object or imagine a hand that is going towards the psiwheel and moving it. Make one up your self or try what other people do.

Well, my story is that I use to practice PK like 5 to 6 months ago. After a month or 2 I started to see results. Then I stopped practicing for some odd reason, and now im back in to it. Right now I can make the wheel turn left and right at my will, but I just can't get it to do a full rotation because I lose concentration fast for some reason. I'm practicing on that right now.

just to clarify, i only ue my hands as a tool, to focus. like i am able to do it form about 5 feet away if i just point my hands towards the wheel. start off with baby steps. remove the glass, its like running before walking.

Should the glass be removed? I thought about that also but I don't think it is necessary to remove the glass because by saying that, you are telling your self that you can't move the wheel under the glass. You and I both know that the glass doesn't matter. But if it makes you feel better and more confident, feel free to remove it, and put the glass back on top when you feel comfortable.

			its only like running as apposed to walking, if you listen to what that guy just said. If your getting subtle movements under the glass, then you have gotten a tad further than most when they start off with no glass.

			Thank you very much, Kal_El, now it makes more sense. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> I was afraid that I was supposed to be able to drastically move it by now, because I keep hearing how everyone says they were able to move it in a couple of days. It had me scared for a day or two. I'll give it as much time as it needs, but I'm counting on being able to cause obviously apparent movement in it within the next 2 months.
<br />

<br />
I'll check it out, Rahmid.

Thanks again, everyone! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

I have been (faithfuly) practicing PK for about 2-3 days now and today i made the tin foil psi wheel move with my mind.  It was like moving by itself and was really cool.  After I got kinda good with that, I tried to move a paper version of the psi wheel.  After a couple of hours of seemingly just staring at it, it started to move.  I don't know if it's against the rules to give advice on the forums.  And if it is, will someone please tell me.  If you focus on the middle of the psi wheel and feel energy build up in your third eye, just tell your subconsious mentaly that it is moving and it will move.  Give it a couple of tries before you give up <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> !!!!!!!
