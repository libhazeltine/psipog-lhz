			Well this is my 3rd day of psionics and I think I'm getting it pretty good.  I want to try sheilding now.
<br />

<br />
1. As far as programing do I just kind of tell it what to do?
<br />
2. Do I have to picture what I want it to look/feel like?
<br />
3. How will I know if I successfully made one and it's not my imagination?

			1: if you want, just read the programming article.....................................
<br />
2: that would probably help, but intent is all that counts, same with above...........
<br />
3: scan for it, or have someone else scan for it, or see if it does what you wanted, and try to feel it with your hands....

			well lets say you want to design a shield (well it would be mroe like a simple construct) to gather energy for yourself and use it. so once you have the construct made and programmed to gather energy for yourself, you should feel like. you should feel some sort of spike in energy.
<br />

<br />
depending on what exactly kind of energy you've gathered, etc, etc you should feel either hyper, thingly, or just awake. there are other symptoms to but you really should be able to tell. 
<br />

<br />
some shields are a little more difficult to tell by way of testing, unless you have another psion with you to try it out. you could test it yourself, but because of certain circumstances (like tricking yourself and so fourth), it might not necessarily be conclusive.
<br />

<br />
or like pyro said you could scan. that could be difficult though. at least for me, the more perceptive skills tend to be more difficult since i have a terrible time focusing. (don't ask me how i manage to do anything else, its still a mystery to even myself)
