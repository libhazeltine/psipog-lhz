			The imperialists should stop looking at the world as a pot of gold and realize the huge problems that are being put into motion. A race war will destroy the US. We only deal with problems within us if they really effect the rich controlling class a lot but that's a problem. Soon a problem will start that we cannot stop. I believe the people will rebel and chaos will take the US. You have dim future imperialists, good thing I'm leaving.

I'm not a buddhist. Buddha fucked up. I believe that buddha became enlightened then tried to tell people about it but they didn't understand him. He took a little of his previous beliefs (hinduism) and made his own sect based around this enlightenment. Instead of having just a path to enlightenment he turned it into a religion so people would actually try harder to understand it. I do not believe he should have done this. 
<br />

<br />
Buddha had some good ideas but I do not agree with changing your life around the purpose of becoming enlightened. You can be enlightened and live a perfectly normal life. It is infact easier to follow buddha's rules, such as love the world and shit, but its not impossible without following them. There will be a change when I integrate nirvana into my personailty so I guess I am not &quot;enlightened&quot; yet. I can reach an enlightened point of mind and I have experienced it, but it is not a part of me. There's a subtle difference that only people who have experienced it can know. That is what enlightenment means to me. It is a state of mind where understanding neither exists nor matters. If you think of your mind as space then you see that many ideas exist on the same points or intersect. States of mind can be a number of geometric shapes and lines with perception, feelings, and thoughts on the axis. The enlightenment point in this metaphor is the point 0,0,0. It's a state of mind where all three kinds of thought connect and become nothing. Except it still does exist just like the point of origin exists. That's nirvana in a nut shell.

Reaching a new level for which none of us are familer with would be none of us would know what to expect. Perhaps enlighten people would jump around on the internet just for the flow of information that passes around it.
<br />

<br />
I agree with you that none of us are on it. But even some of us are none of us wouldnt even know about it. Maybe even the enlighten ones themselfs wouldnt even know?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

I'm not enlighten if you some of you mite think that....I see many sides of myself that I just hate and try to fix it.

			I agree with you there Derrick, these states that are temporary, are just higher states of consciousness. However, there are different degrees in enlightenment. Untill one reaches full illumination, or Self-Realization, which is what you are talking about&#058; Allknowingness etc. Like Buddha had. However, before one reaches that state, his intellect, can be 'enlightened' by his higher Self, or Higher states of consciousness. That way, he is constantly connected to higher levels and his mind and intellect become somewhat enlightened and one starts to see through the illusion more and more. However, this does not mean that one is fully free from Nature's bondage and illusion.

Ofcourse you can be &quot;enlightened&quot; about anything if you view it in that sense. Learning anything that you do not know about is becoming enlightened about that subject. However, I believe you were talking about enlightenment in a philosophical/spiritual way. Attaining the level of &quot;enlightenment&quot;. Do you know many Buhddists view enlightenment and Nirvana as the same thing? Almost all believe that once you reach true enlightenment, that is what breaks you free from the ongoing re-incarnation cycle and you then move into the bliss of nirvana.( Which is what Christians view as heaven.) This is why half (Not very exact number ), of the people in the world meditate. To try and reach this level. Monks spend their entire lives trying to do this, and VERY FEW have ever succeeded, if ANY. ( I doubt you'll find even one account of this being done ) This is what Buhdda supposedly did. You my friend are going into other states of consciousness and although when you return you may feel more knowledgable, or more &quot;one with the earth&quot;, and that very well may be true, that doesn't mean you have attained true enlightenment.

Nirv&#257;&#7751;a (Devanagari &#2344;&#2367;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2339;, Pali: Nibb&#257;na &#2344;&#2367;&#2348;&#2381;&#2348;&#2366;&#2344; -- Chinese: &#28037;&#27075;; Pinyin: niè pán), literally &quot;extinction&quot; and/or &quot;extinguishing&quot; (of passion or lust, hatred and delusion). It denotes being free from mind-contaminants (Kilesa) such as lust, anger or craving and is thus a state of great inner peace and contentment -- it is the end of suffering, or Dukkha. The Buddha in the Dhammapada says of Nirvana that it is &quot;the highest happiness&quot;. It is necessary to note that &quot;the highest happiness&quot; spoken of by Buddha is not the transitory, sense-based happiness of everyday life, but rather an enduring, transcendental happiness integral to the calmness attained through <span style="font-weight: bold">enlightenment</span>.~WIKIPEDIA
<br />

<br />
Bodhi in Buddhism specifically means the awakening experience attained by Gautama Buddha and his disciples. <span style="font-style: italic">It is sometimes described as complete and perfect sanity, or awareness of the true nature of the universe.</span> After attainment, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of Sams&#257;ra: birth, suffering, death and rebirth (see moksha). ~ WIKIPEDIA
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">I will say again, you my friend have not attained enlightenment, nor has anyone else here.</span> (Unless someone here does not have any lusts, cravings, and knows the true nature of the universe  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> )

			Didn't I just say there was no enlightenment. It's a quick way around to describe enlightenment as understanding. If you've been there you know it is not like understanding. It's more like understanding dosen't exist there nor matters. That's why it's so hard to talk about it. Also all those feelings that you described don't exist there either. So when you integrate the &quot;enlightenment&quot; into yourself you rid yourself of these feelings and need for understanding. You rid yourself of really all ideas you hold dear. Like good and evil, morals, and these feelings you described. Your thought process becomes like that of the universe. Enlightenment is the universal mindset and is a state of what can best be described as oneness/connectedness and peace. I did not draw these words from any world religion or any ideas that I have from anyone. I experienced it then thought about what it meant.
