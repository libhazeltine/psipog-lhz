			This can be recognized as my future goodbye. 
<br />

<br />
If it wasn't for my promise to stay here, I would be gone right now. I'm done with the internet. I haven't completely decided yet but, I may leave everything. Once Psipog is closed, I may no longer even be on AIM, MSN or any of that. I may not even go to Peebrain's new site. 
<br />

<br />
I have failed. Failed a friend, failed myself. I must leave to find myself.
<br />

<br />
This is all not definite, but it sure does seem the right way to go. 
<br />

<br />
Who cares anyways?
<br />

<br />
EDIT: But as I said in my &quot;Thank you&quot; thread: Thank you guys. It's been nice.

			Although I would be unjustified in asking you to stay, but my love for you as a Psi brother drives me to ask you why you've failed.
<br />

<br />
We all fail at some point, and some failures are greater than others. Yet forgiveness is availible for all failures and misdeeds. PM me if you want to know more about this forgiveness.
<br />

<br />
But if you do cement and solidify your decision to leave us, please, don't forget us, and continue your practice and training in Psi. You've been one of us for a while, and you're one of the best of us. To lose that bond would be to fail all of us, and yourself.
<br />

<br />
But above all, walk your path, and befriend as many of those who walk the same path as you can. Honour them as much as you can. Forgive and love freely, and sincerely and humbly ask forgiveness when you falter. 
<br />

<br />
Take care of yourself, my friend. I will remember you.

Thank you, very wise words indeed. I appreciate it. I am in no means offended by you asking me to stay. As I said, I am only in the process of deciding anyways..
<br />

<br />
My failure is complicated. I don't even understand it. I'm sorry though, the only way I can deal with this is to stay away from all others. There is a problem that has been pointed out to me...and I need to fix it. I want to fix it. But I don't know how and I lost a friend to give me advice. He doesn't call me a friend but I do, what he did makes him a friend enough. (you know who you are  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />) 
<br />

<br />
Of course I will not forget such a great experience. I would be a fool to do so. I don't see it even possible to forget of such wonderful people. 
<br />

<br />
I love you all. Thank you  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />

Yes, I tried to avoid that. But who says drama is bad?

I don't like talking to people like that. Nor do I have the money to do so. I will just meditate, it's the only thing I can do to help.

I am speaking from experience.
<br />

<br />
I don't want to see anyone else make the stupid decisions that marred my youth.
<br />

<br />
SFG, just remember: perspective is key. What seems like the end of the world today will be simply another minor trouble tomorrow, and what is a minor trouble tomorrow is forgotten in a year.
<br />

<br />
Who says drama is bad? Well, what good comes of it? It takes small mistakes, errors, or events, blows them out of proportion, and uses them to hurt people. It causes negative effects that far outweigh whatever benefit it might have to offer. The only people that drama is good for are those who stand on the sidelines and laugh at all the poor dramatic fools. Other than that, drama is a no-win situation. Really. It's silly. (Believe me, I'm a gay guy... I've had too much experience with drama. Thankfully I usually have the capacity for clear thinking and am usually one of the ones pointing and laughing, or helping to rescue people from whatever messes they have gotten themselves into. I'm trying to do the latter here.)
<br />

<br />
Remember the title of a famous book: don't sweat the small stuff - and it's all small stuff. 
<br />

<br />
Also, nobody gives a shit what happens on the Internet. Really. The Internet has the attention span of a 2 year old, and the memory of a goldfish.

Just this year, perspective has shown up at my door step. I understand it, and I understand what you are saying.

Am I hurting more people? Hmm, well that's why I'm leaving anyways...

The internet may not be serious, but I do not wish to hurt anymore people. Whether it be in life or on the internet.

Ah, I get what you were saying now. It seems if you want to make your honest, justified opinion known, you just need to explain yourself a little. I agree with you completely, now that you're being logical and decent about it. This is the kind of intelligent reasoning and calm, honest explanation I expect from all members of PsiPog, and indeed all members of society. Good on ya!

			This thread is funny. I'm not going to say things like &quot;I love you&quot;, seeing as I don't know who you really are. It was fun talking to you, good luck in life. Way too much philosopher wanna-bees (and drama queens) on this site. *cough sgtpsion *cough. I agree with felix on saving the drama for yo mama. Also sfg if your problem is what you mentioned to me on msn, you are the prime example of making a mountain out of a mole hill. Less than a molehill. I'm in doubt that you really do understand perspective, otherwise you would have <span style="font-style: italic">no</span> worries, and wouldn't be making this post. The &quot;problems&quot; you have should not even be considered problems.
<br />

<br />
You have my MSN and email if you want to chat. Buh bye  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .
