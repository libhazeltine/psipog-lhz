Even if you didnt &quot;go looking for psi&quot;, you practice psi therefore are a psion.  Not many of us knew what we were looking for.  Mainly it is all due to chance, openness, and browsing the internet.  Dont be stupid because earlier you just categorized yourself.  You said &quot;Every psion is just a conservative fool.&quot; and now you say &quot;I am not a psion that looked for psi.&quot;.  This means that you consiter yourself a psion.  Therefore, in your words, you are a conservative fool.  Consiter your arse served to you on a silver platter =P

			You really are all just fools. You spend so much time battling over wording. It was a lot different then being told. I was pulled in head first. I guess you could say I was forced by a number of factors. It's a long story that I don't feel like going into. My point is that most of the psions here(see I said most now) are conservative fools. The people who want to learn psi and actively look for it are the worst. You get less worse as you go down the ladder of how you found psi. I am the probably the lowest rung so I have almost no conservative foolishness. You all are getting off topic though. The point is there is no point to the topic anymore so you can stop arguing with me.

So, you put yourself on the end of the &quot;fool&quot; list?  Why?  What makes you different?  You were forced?  BS.  No one and/or nothing can force someone to do this.  What is your definition of fool?  Is it someone who wants to learn something that is actually real?  If so, then yes, we are all fools.  People who want to learn are not fools.  They are far from it.  People who attempt to prove others wrong and make many videos of fake psychokinesis are fools and are wasting their time (making reference to someone else in the forum).  Please answer these questions as i do not like to see someone come onto these forums and call every psion a fool, call themselves a psion, and then say they are not foolish.  There is something majorly wrong with that.

Not sure if you've heard of it, though.
