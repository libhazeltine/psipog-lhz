			I am sorry if the following theory had already been declared by someone else in history before me.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: orange">please prepare for bad grammer!</span>
<br />

<br />
The pseudo-particle theory.
<br />

<br />
The earth is made up of many layers, which extend deep below the earths surface.  In the centre of the earth is the core and in the centre of the core exists a pseudo-particle--a master particle.
<br />

<br />
The master particle is the primary peice  which began the construction of the planet earth.  All planets, stars, satelites, even the sun has a MP located in its absolute centre.
<br />

<br />
The MP is the most powerful element ever discovered, with the power to constuct a whole planet.  The MP is a naturally occuring electromagnet, which is much stronger than any electromagnet ever made by humans.
<br />

<br />
The MP draws everything around it into itself, and through this manner can build itself up into a spherical planet.  It would draw in material such as iron and other raw materials, which are found floating in space.  The closer the materials are to the MP itself the more liquified they become from the intense heat emited by the MP.  It is at a certian distance away from the MP that raw materials are able to obtain themselves at their solid integrity.
<br />

<br />
I would like everyone opinions of this theory.  Do you agree or disagree?

			Lol.  You spelled grammar wrong.  Interesting theory, though I personally find it hard to believe.

			In science it is not left to the public, scientists, profesionals to agree or disagree.  One has to gather evidence, and this evidence should disprove wrong theories.  As far as I know there is as much evidence for a pseudo-particle in the core of the earth as there is of a pink elephant  in its center gathering mass around him.   Do you have any evidence for this theory?
