			Well, just basing off of how the tutorials say that you are not seperated from any object, why doesn't someone completely use that Un-seperation, instead of just moving things.  Like instead of spinning paper, getting it to fold.  It should not be hard, becasue, based off of NI's articles, you are completely 'in-tune' with the object and it is within your power.  So, just become one with it, then make it fold in half or tear, or even do something like bending an object (not a spoon).  The possibilities are endless based off of how NI explain's that PK works.  Why hasn't anyone done videos of anything more interesting?
<br />

<br />
Someone should try these ideas.  Try folding a peice of paper using PK, or doing somethign no one has ever done.  I cannot personally do PK, but I think someone should do something different for once.  Make a quarter that is flat on the table bend without you touching it.
<br />

<br />
So, just try these please.  I don't think that any amount of practice would increase your ability to manipulate objects, because once you are one with it, you are one with it.  So you should be able to do this, in theory. 
<br />

<br />
Basically try these and put some vids out.

			not to be rude or anything...but why dont you try this? i mean, its sort of ignorant saying &quot;all you do is this, thats boring, try this instead&quot;.
<br />
the reason most of the videos are bland is because those are the most common exercises, i mean some did change it a bit, such as annie's vid of the psiwheel under the glass.
<br />
i have tried other things, such as bending a pen, but getting in tune with objects isnt that easy.

			You may be right, but the problem is not many people were raised in that theory, thus our minds are not atuned fully to such things...so no, in theory, for most, it should not be easy, and doing simpler things can lead up to doing big things.

			wow you talking about pk as it is easy thing to get improved fast , everything in the world need its time to be done and i know that pk is realy hard to get little improvements , for me at first time i spin psi wheel easly then after 1 month or somthing i could not move it at all then nowdays i can move it easly and i can make folded paper shakes on the table and i can move the psi wheel from long distance , all that happen in 5 monthes , hmm let me see to move to level which i can move pen need more 5 monthes <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> or maybe year <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> , or as i always say something is missed that i dont know it because of the accidant strong pk that happens .

			Very good remark &quot;Ch40s&quot;
<br />
Soon i will post a &quot;complete scientific theory on TK&quot; 
<br />

<br />
If the tutorial say that we are not separated from other objects, they are probably a bit wrong depending on the perspective. 
<br />

<br />
It would be better to say that we can be interacting with other objects without touching them.
<br />

<br />
Here is a preview of my theory. &quot; Thanks to Peebrain &quot;et al.&quot; for their work on radiation&quot;.
<br />

<br />
We emit electromagnetic waves. We can learn to direct them (probably by radiation presure in the brain). Electromagnetic waves travel at speed of light. when they strike the desired matter (where our attention is), they produce a tiny radiation pressure <span style="text-decoration: underline">and </span> , most important, they are partly absorbed by the matter expelling electrons from the surface. Those expelled electrons (beta radiations) travel a few feets depending on the initial push of photons ( electromagnetic waves). Those electrons interact with the repatition of magnetic charges (polarity) and mass causing object to move. (I think i will copyright those lines, history will tell)
<br />

<br />
Ok this is not an explanation of all PK phenomenons. Just a theory for typical TK movement. 
<br />

<br />
So, why is it difficult to fold paper ? Because TK is mainly a magnetic effect. Can you imagine a magnet to fold iron before attracting it ??? It would require so much energy and precision.
<br />

<br />
Now a tip for TKers, when you do TK try to notice variation in the reflection of surrounding objects. The idea is that beta radiation ( too much electrons) reflect light ! This is very tough to see and require practice, but it worth it trust me ! You will see smoke like patterns and wave like paterns that can be used to improve control and precision.
<br />

<br />

			Mordak , is that waves you talking about are dark waves or it is like the heat waves? if so then i see it <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Hi Ahmed1,
<br />

<br />
Waves are white at peek and &quot;clear color&quot; at low ebb. By clear color, i mean that they let pass more light and enhance the clarity of objects behind. 
<br />

<br />
Smoke patterns look a bit like heat waves. In fact, they move in the same way exept that they don't necessarily goes up. But they are not totaly the same colors. I think heat waves are more refracting light than reflecting it (not sure) and beta radiation (electrons) in smoke like patterns are reflecting light more that refracting it ( not sure).  
<br />

<br />
According to my theory the difference between smoke like paterns and waves are as follow :
<br />

<br />
Smoke radiation are eletrons that got an initial push and than are left to their kinetic energy and &quot;normal&quot; interactions. We produce tiny beta radiation on everything our attention goes in daily life making objects smoking lightly. 
<br />

<br />
Waves are beta radiation too but they are not left alone after their release from objects. They are pushed in a &quot;continuous way&quot;, probably by magnetic feeling of their movement.
<br />

<br />
Ciao
<br />

			hmm, well ive seen the wave type things, but thats mainly when i make psi balls. i tend to see it where im forming the psi ball.
<br />
i wonder if thats also the reason that geiger counter was affected in that experiment Peebrain did.
