			So it goes like this....
<br />

<br />
I go through my day like normal with all the drama going on in school and then at night i think about everything that happens and i feel weird deja vu feeling. The thing is that the Deja Vu isnt of the event its more of me thinking about the event word for word.
<br />

<br />
And example of this is today durring action class we were watching video's student made last year. Last year was the year Nikki Blonski graduated from my school (Star of hairspray due to come out next year) and i remember seeing her on wikipedia but wanting to see a picture. I found a picture with her and one of my friends and i thought she was pretty because she was dressed up for this certain production or whatever. Then i see her in the video and i relise she realy isnt that good looking (kinda ugly) and unforunetly i couldnt keep my thoughts to myself lol. i kept saying tottaly the wrong thing like &quot;wow she looked prettier in her myspace picture&quot; or &quot;i bet they're going use alot of makup in her movie&quot; lol seriously i couldnt help myself. Now i'm home and i'm remembering that same exact thing happenning but slightley diffrent. The way it happened when i remembered it is the when i get this deja vu.
<br />

<br />
Sorry i feel like i'm going on and on and still not making sence. The first paragraph sums it up. Does anyone know what i'm talking about?

The de ja vu feeling kind of freaks me out.  I used to get it a lot, but haven't had it in over like 3 months.  It's still cool though, but scary... boo.
