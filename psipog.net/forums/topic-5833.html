			I don't mean giving up practicing entirely, but I was giving OBE's a try last night.  I stayed motionless and tried to count myself down and could tell that many parts of my body had fallen asleep.  Unfortunately, anytime that I got anything close to a vibration my heart started to beat very hard and fast and thus I lost my concentration.
<br />

<br />
Now, that I know just takes some practice and getting used to to overcome.  But when I looked at the clock I realised over an hour had passed of me being in that still state.  So, my questions are, how long on average does it take to induce an OBE, and is there any point at which you can realise it simply won't happen?  A whole hour seems a tad excessive to me.

			Like most Psionic stuff, it varies from person to person. the amount of time shouldn't matter. personally, i practice friday nights (unless i'm going out) because i have saturdays free from anything for me to wake up early to (work on sunday, college during weekdays).
<br />
problem for me is i sometimes get waves of discomfort come over me, which make me want to move so badly that sometimes i just have to. i usually take that as a sign it's not going to happen that night.
<br />
Just try to remain passive. tell yourself that You'll be an observer to whatever happens. this, coupled with practise should lead to you successfully acheiving the vibrations (or something to that effect) and once you've gotten used to those, you can begin to be more in control.
<br />
hope that helps.

			I did motionless meditation for abot 45 minutes, and a couple of times during the meditaton, I told myself in my mind that I would have an OBE, even though I didn't want to have one, I was meditating. I just wanted to check out the vibes. Anyways, the vibes started about 40 minutes into it, and they were there for about 5 minutes.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I kept myself in though, just observing those weird-as-hell vibrations. It felt like I had the spins, you know, when you've drank alot, but it was much more pleasnt. Definately stay 100% motionless, and be in a position to where you know something wont fall asleep 'cause you're cutting off circulation.

Heh, I like that you have mentioned that fact in several threads already.  No really, I mean it!  And I know all too well what those spins are like, so I hope they aren't accompanied by the inevitable throwing up. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
It's interesting too, because I think it was about 45 minutes for me when I experienced what could best be described as vibrations.  Except they seemed more like trembles... I expected something more violent.  Also at one point I seemed to shift entirely to one side, as though two of the legs had been removed from my bed.
<br />

<br />
@sparkz - It also got to that point for me where I almost couldn't <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> move.
<br />

<br />
I suppose I'll keep practicing at it.  If anyone else has input, it'd motivating to hear.

The spins you guys are talking about aren't bad at all...They're just like being drunk or very dizzy, then laying down and closing your eyes, but without <span style="font-weight: bold">any</span> of the sick feeling. I do them every single time I'm trying to OBE now. And I say &quot;do&quot; because you really can induce them easily once you've done it a couple times already. Although I've only got the vibes in my feet so far....I don't know if these &quot;spins&quot; are even helpful to induce the OBE's at all, or if they're the starting point of having one <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />....But to get those vibes in my feet and the spins it usually only takes me 25 min..give or take
<br />

<br />
Monroe was eventually able to induce OBE's a lot of the time instantly!...So it probably does vary from person to person..or mabye you get better through experience...Also trembles is a better way to describe what I feel in my feet rather than vibrations...but continuous trembles...

I've been practicing for just over two months now and as of the past week or so I'm getting the vibes just about everytime I try, so maybe I can shed some light.
<br />

<br />
-How I get the Vibes-
<br />

<br />
 I suppose the best place to start is from the beginning (duh)....So Ill start from there. (don't worry ill get to the vibes)
<br />

<br />
The first thing you need to keep in mind to make your practices productive is to keep your body still without fighting your body. I figured out that the whole time I thought i had been relaxed I had actually been really tence. Your body moves and jerks naturally so don't fight it, just let your body do what its gonna do (Im sorry if this is somewhat vague).
<br />

<br />
Some people suggest visualization, montras(sp?), and many other techniques to put your body to sleep. But I found, for me at least, the best way to put your body to sleep is to...well go to sleep. Usually I let my mind wander off long enough to start cooking up a dream, then once ive notice i let my mind wander (it sounds wierd, but its true) I let my self snap back to conscienceness. At this point my body is asleep, and I should be midway between sleep and awake. But how do I know if its time for the vibes? Well I have two ways of knowing. Usually, I just know when they're about to come. But that dosn't help you guys out, does it? Well alright, here's the other. When I first lie down I see swirling colors and whatnot (afterimages, etc.). But when when im in the right state of for the vibes everything on the back of my eyelids is very still (aka your mind). So you should see blackness as opposed to anything else.
<br />

<br />
Ok, now its Vibe time! Now this next bit is hard to explain, but Ill try my best. Focus your eyes so that the blackness is a 3d plain (you'll know what i mean when you get there) now let loose of all muslce control and wait, but make sure you keep everything realxed. Since your semi-conscience your mind'll wanna keep the muscles &quot;primed&quot; for use. Don't let it, just relaaaaax. To keep your mind clear, preoccupy it by controling your breathing. And when you do this for long enough youll feel your body stiffen and then the vibes will just come. But when they do, DON'T get exicted. Just say to yourself &quot;Oh, it's the vibes. That's nice.&quot; (not outloud btw). And continue to control your breathing.
<br />

<br />
Sorry for such a long post, but it seems that this is a common problem that I more recently surmounted then alot of the more experianced members, so by hammering out all the details I more readily remember would be an assest. If there's anything you need me to explain better, please pm me.
<br />

<br />
Good Luck

Whoops, you mean I wasn't suppost to throw up...? I think I've tried to OBE too hard!! <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

<br />
Yeah, I've been saying it so much because I was exited 'cause I felt the vibrations, and now I know how to induce them for an OBE. Yeah, derrick, the spins are the beginning of an OBE.

			i got a huge tingling feeling multiple times while trying to obe last night. this happened when i found my mind wandering and then i brought it back. as soon as i brought it back i felt a huge wave of tingling that almost made me move (kinda tickled/hurt/weighed me down.. was weird). but then my attention shifts to my breathing and it all goes away =/. have to work on that
