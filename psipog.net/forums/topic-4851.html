			So i once saw a documentary on an ancient society who lived in a village constructed atop huge boulders and slates that were all placed down by man. The mythology of the civilization around the area was that the 10ton boulders were moved by the village's magicians from up the river. The documentary only acnoleged this because it honestly did seem like the only plousable explanation. The kind of stone in the rocks was only native to an area a long ways down the river. Meaning they couldnt even send the boulders down on a raft since the rivers current was going in the oposite direction.

My point is that how much weight do you think is possible to carry with TK. Back then im guessing people were more in tune with there natural abilities and were probably taught by there wise-on-the-subject ancestors. Even with all the knolege and skill they might have had back then do you think its possible to have moved 10Tons of stone up stream miles away?

			I think weight doesnt matter in TK. Sure, smaller makes easier, but with enough practice you would be able to move almost anything.

			I to beleive that the weight issue is just a mental  block in your head since your subconscious is moving the object.   The thing is, you have been programmed/taught that heavier objects weigh more and are harder to move/lift.
