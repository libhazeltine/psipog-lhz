			One idea I would bring up, though... this should not have anything to do with the girl.
<br />

<br />
If the boyfriend truly is &quot;psycho,&quot; as in abusive and manipulative and junk, I'd suggest... you know... messing with him.
<br />

<br />
You know, like... talking to him telepathically and making him think he's going crazy.
<br />

<br />
However, that'd be only in the EXTREME case.  I believe that if you are skilled enough, psi should be no different from martial arts.  Don't use it to go picking fights, and don't harass others just because you feel like it - but for the love of all that is good and pure, if you are left with no other choice, DO it.
<br />

<br />
For the most part, though, I suggest waiting it out.  And if he tries to force himself on her, then yes, you do it to protect her.  But you have to know she's not a willing participant.
<br />

<br />
Though if this is high school, that junk shouldn't be going on anyway, so you'd hafta interfere anyway.  Though probably that should just be regular interference....
<br />

<br />
I dunno, sorry, I'm tired and ranting a bit.  All I know is if you want to talk to her on the phone so badly, you should call her first.

			&quot;Whatever you do don't be the friend guy in that time just because it gives you a very slim chance of her seeing you as a boyfriend ever. &quot;

Interesting.  Don't relationships normally come out of friendships, rather than the 'love at first sight' principle?
<br />

<br />
Also, shouldn't this topic be in the 'General discussion' forum now since it isn't really about tp anymore?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Well, sometimes relationships are generated from tight friendships. Other times, the friendship is so great that that's the way it should stay and will stay. 
<br />

<br />
My opinion is don't be a jerk, be her friend. And if you never end up with her who cares? At least you've got her as a friend, so consider yourself lucky to at least have her as a good friend. What you do from here is up to you, but might I suggest just staying her friend? You can't always get what you want, trust me. What if you end up with her, what then? The fights, the arguments, then you end up losing her completely. If I was you, I'd just be thankful to have such a good friend and I wouldn't contribute to trying to move things forward as to end up happy no matter what.

But hasn't it occurred to you that SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND! If she liked you more than him don't you think she'd dump him for you? She obviously likes him more seeing as he's boyfriend, and you're friend. Not trying to burst your bubble, I'm just saying. If she wants you, she'll let you know. *Don't get lead on with false hope.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

it's not as black and white as you think.
<br />
since i am female im going to give you a girl's perspective. don't be too over-zealous about it or else she'll think you're creepy. when i say over-zealous i mean like don't seem too overly into her, if that makes sense.
<br />

<br />
just because she's going out with this over-obsessive guy doesnt mean she doesnt want to date you. if this relationsihip she has with him is a serious one, she'll of course have some difficulty totally separating because to some degree it'll feel wrong to her. that doesnt mean you should stop trying. 
<br />

<br />
if he's being over posessive that means that he may be mentally abusive towards her, or at least i wouldnt be surprised. if this is the case, that this opportunity and make yoruself seem like someone she would be better off with. jsut try becoming friends and make sure you comfort her and stuff. make her feel that you want to be there for her. this is where it gets tricky because if you dont do it right you could screw everything up.
<br />

<br />
if worst comes to worst, you can just tell her the way you feel. one thing to do is try and study the boyfriend. try and find out a little more about him. like is he a romantic kind of guy or not. sometimes girls go out with guys wanting a sweet romantic boyfriend and if the boyfriend isnt sweet and romantic, then usually the relationship breaks off. if this is one of those situations, you can do wonders by being sweet and romantic. 
<br />

<br />
but if i was in your position, i would just tell her how you feel. tell her that you think she deserves better.

Luckily I'm still able to keep up being straight.  That's why I call myself a lesbian with a penis.  &gt;.&gt;

<br />
But yeah... she's basically right.  Try and not be obsessive about the girl (because that's what he is doing, right?) and if you can read minds, only use it to anticipate what she might like.  Don't try to force her into anything, just recieve thoughts she might want you to know but might be too afraid to say.

Careful, Xiam, your swelled head is taking up too much room in this thread.
<br />

<br />
Remember, everyone, that this is just one woman's opinion. Your stereotyping them into all being exactly the same deep down. Then you regret having changed to fit into her category. Just be yourself, don't worry about anything. Sure it may be hard sometimes to NOT worry, but give it a try anyways. And if she ends up liking you for that, well then good for you.

			true a girls opinion is very helpful...and i think ur right, ive thought about it for a while....before i used to be the worst kind of person- stealing, fighting etc. now that ive finished school, well i know that my dreams arent gonna come true...so i dont know...i might go back to how i used to be like, mainly because i dont like hiding who i really am -i gave school a shot and now evryone thinks im a nerd- showing her who i really am might have an efect (since she doesn't like the prospect of being governed by rules either) but just to put some more info on the situation, she kept saying 'maybe', referring to if she would go out with me if her boyfreind wasn't there, i dont know wat this means ( she might be saying it to keep me as a freind, cause she used to stare- im talking more than a few seconds- at me when we were in class- and im not the only one who noticed, it was her freinds as well) but a chick frieind of mine said she prolly would date me but doesnt want to admit it cause shes dating someone. so i think i take freakinrican626's advice and be not too over-zealous...but for the guys....i could smash him...do u think i should if he gets pissed and comes at me, or should i let him beat me so she can see how much of a psycho he really is?

Ya, let him beat on you, that's a good idea. *rolling eyes. Are you serious? So she can see how psycho he is, and how much of a punching bag you are? Don't do anything stupid like go after the guy, but if <span style="font-style: italic">he</span> initiates a confrontation and throws the first punch, lay him out. She'll see he's psycho and also that you have the ability to keep her safe. All girls have the need to feel safe. Consciously or not. (I think it <span style="font-style: italic">may</span> have been proven, but don't quote me). Although I guess everyone wants to be safe. Not fighting back is always the high road (worked for ghandi, but he was fighting for human rights), but sitting there and getting pummeled over a girl who may not even want you after the fact, is not smart. In my opinion. (If it doesn't work out with this girl, it <span style="font-weight: bold">may</span> hurt your chances at getting another you want) 
<br />

Let him come to you, then show him whos boss.

			Thanks for considering my suggestion, Arcadus.  But let's get something clear:  You can't call the boyfriend 'psycho' unless he has been diagnosed as 'psycho.'  This applies to everyone, especially since Arcadus is the only one who knows him face to face.  He may just have a personality that we can't relate to.  I will refrain from calling him a psycho until I see some proof.  The only reason I take offense to this is because I had a friend with a slight case of schizophrenia and people made fun of him.  Long story short, they now know what it's like to have schizophrenia (not permanently).  
<br />

<br />
I agree with high adrenaline though, you do need to be yourself.  You don't want to be fake, and then if you two do start dating, have to live a double life and constantly lie to her.  Just be yourself.  
<br />

<br />
Oh, and something that just occured to me.  If (and I'm not saying you will) you try to get into her head using TP, and she happens to be psionic, she will know what you are doing and will find it intrusive.  Just another reason to leave TP out of this.  Keep things pure, don't taint it with psionics without permission.
