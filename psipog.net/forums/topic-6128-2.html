			You know what's REALLY funny?
<br />

<br />
In a town called Salem, which is Hebrew for &quot;peace&quot;, many women were executed for simple things, such as using herbal medicine or living alone, and were branded as &quot;witches&quot; because of those things. 
<br />

<br />
Not very peaceful, was it?

It all depends on how you define things, in the end they're more or less the same thing, in my opinion anyway (emphasis on the more or less, there are some differences), the major difference is in the technique more than anything.
<br />

<br />
Might want to watch that ego as well, possessing skills others don't doesn't necessarily put you above them in anything except perhaps your own mind.

			Well, actually, it was from WKRP. Less Nessman says &quot;Funny like, 'ha ha', or funny like 'strange'?&quot;
<br />

<br />
But yeah, his parents would most likely cite Exodus 22:18, which reads, &quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&quot; (KJV)
<br />

<br />
It's an over-referenced passage, and apparently, nobody knows that what was translated as &quot;witch&quot; in the Hebrew text is a word meaning &quot;a woman who uses magic against others.&quot; So really, Exodus 22:18 only applies to those who use magic for evil.

And, according to my study Bible, magick refers to summoning spirits and other entities.

			Meh, each to his own. My girlfiend is a pagan, and does all that funky stuff. I don't mind, as long as it's not used to anyone else's detriment. I don't see why you should worry about it if it doesn't result in anyone else's detriment, and they're not consorting with the firey one.

<span style="font-style: italic">Witchcraft/ Satanism</span>- I think this would be what your parents are worried about. Basically, worshipping satan to get magick/ psychic powers. not good. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
so, basically, magick and psionics are very similar, although in magic you just say a word or think of a rune to use your energy in a certain way. No programming involved. It's already taken care of for you. In magick, the things you can do are based on 3 things:
<br />

<br />
1. your power (comes from practice, like psi)
<br />

<br />
2. the words/ runes you know
<br />

<br />
3. the amount of energy you can use at one time without being exhausted
<br />

<br />
it works because your just telling your psi what to do by using a rune or word.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />   it's similar to psionics, tho, and so I don't see why the Bible would ban magick.  I think it means satanism. or candle voodoo magick. stuff like that.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Assuming, of course, that Satan exists. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
All 3 do work the same way, though.
<br />

<br />
xD thats the problem you get when you try to 'hush' something. subcultures will pop up, with their own way of doing the same thing. In the end, the 'result' is the same, but the methods are different (except for the actual physical changes happening). 
<br />

<br />
Thanks for putting into words what I couldn't &gt;_&gt; been trying to find a way to say something similar to what you said for ages.
