			Tell you what Stupplecrout, since you don't think that changing eye color is hard enough... Why don't you and I try to change our skin color somewhat say for 2 week period, and then compare results? I would be very interested to see if you could even do this bio pk let alone more of the difficult aspects. 
<br />

<br />
I was born with a hearing loss, don't you think that I wouldn't be doing my damnedest to cure that hearing loss so I could hear like everybody else and be able to speak the same way.... Let me tell you, that's something i've been trying to do for years, and all the changes that I've made only amounts to a very miniscule progress which basically I can hear certain sounds above the human range of hearing, and also be able to hear some sounds below the human range. 
<br />

<br />
A prime example, when I go star gaze at night, I have to focus on not hearing the bats chittering and it is quite constant. It gets really bad when they are out mating as well with the agressive communication between the males and females sending out their calls. Let just say that there are certain body functions that we don't want to mess with...

Heh isnt eye color enough?  Sure skin color would be cool but changing the melanin count is a bit risky especially if you plan to spend alot of time outdoors. When I change my eye color to green all Im doing is making my melanin more fatty, but when we start messing with other things in our body, side-effects will be highly prevalent. I dont think messing with something as important as skin is worth it. Though hair is another story so if you would want to try something more reasonable like hair color then I would highly encourage it. Remember its not just changing the way we look when we do stuff like this, its also making different chemicals, etc. Some of the stuff we want to do could be very harmful to our health if we dont acually know what we are doing. You might want to find out what you are doing to your body when changing its outside appearance so you dont go and muff up your whole DNA. Becuase remember something has to happen to your DNA for your eyes to be a different color; its not just going to change something with no other side-effects; chemical processes <span style="text-decoration: underline">are </span>occuring. So lets try to stick to more basic stuff right now before we go and kill ourselves <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			I've been trying to change my voice for a while.  It's kinda annoying right now so I wanted to make it sound better.  My technique has been to &quot;hear&quot; myself talking the way I want to sound while mouthing the words, but so far I haven't noticed any change.  I'll keep you informed.
<br />
I'll also probably try the eye thing when I'm done with my voice.  Yellow eyes would be sweet.

			Whoah, I wasn't expecting a freakin attack. Chill out Marcus. I 'm just saying that everyone is doing eyecolor or hair and it would be interesting to see if anyone else is trying something. I'm trying right now to fix my ambliopia (I think that's how it's spelled), or lazy eye. No that doesn't mean I have a wierd sagging eye. It jut means  that my right eye doesn't have its information processed correctly. Patching my good eye works on the short term, so I'm working on fixing it for good, and maybe improving my vision at the same time. I believe you go about this by having your sub-c add rods and cones to your retina and broaden your optical nerve. I'm also working on healing a crack in my olna and that appears to be going well.

			I enjoyed reading this thread. Very interesting. And although many techniques have been posted I would like a little clarification. First of all, is &quot;meditating on it&quot; just visualizing your eyes/hair in the color you want or just meditating to prepare your mind for the process? Now for the techiniques.
<br />

<br />
1.  If I wanted to change my eye color to grey, could I just visualize myself with grey eyes and say to myself mentally &quot;The color of my irises will change from brown to grey.&quot;?
<br />

<br />
2.  Could I just say that to myself without visualization so long as I trust my subconscious (in both cases)? 
<br />

<br />
3.  Would visualization work by itself so long as you trust your subconscious and intend to change them to the desired color?
<br />

<br />
4.  If I tell myself that my eyes will change to grey, would my subconscious assume some random shade of grey or would it choose a very natural shade of grey? 
<br />

<br />
5. When I tell myself that my eye color will change should I mention a period of time for the whole process to take place or do I just wing it and wait for results? (perhaps giving your subconscious a short deadline would prompt it to produce results faster) 
<br />

<br />
***6.  <span style="font-weight: bold">When I read about the impermanance of changed eye color I got a little discouraged. Would telling yourself something like: &quot;The color of my irises will change from brown to grey and when my irises have reached the final shade of grey they will stay that way unless I want them to change to another color.&quot; work?</span>
<br />

<br />
The only thing that worries me about changing my eye and hair color is the reactions of those around me. Although my eye color change wouldn't be that noticabe my hair color change would be. I wouldn't lie to someone about why my hair changed from brown to black by saying I dyed it (That would lead them to believe that I'm gothic or something and I'm far from it. At least I think I nothing like a gothic person. I don't really know much about them at all.). I'm an honest guy but it's not like I could just say &quot;I used the awesome might of my will power to change my hair color!&quot;. The best response I can think of is &quot;You wouldn't believe me if I told you.&quot;. If any of you can think of a better honest excuse I would like to hear it (I mean this literally not rhetorically or sarcastically.). 
<br />

<br />
The guy (I forgot his name <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />.) who made the post about putting on muscle mainly by thinking it was very interesting. I myself lifted weights for about 6 months and I gained about 20 lbs of muscle or so and doubled the strength of some of my muscles. If what he says is true then his method is much more effective!

			GreatWhiteNinja,
<br />
In response to your questions:
<br />
Regarding the first paragraph, most I would say visualize themselves with the new changes and it tends to be more forceful &quot;in my opionion&quot; which if it works great but I personally take a more laid back approach that if it happens great, if it doesn't oh well keep trying. Regardless how you look at the various techniques, You must Trust that your Sub-C will know what its' doing and that you won't be harmed!! if you don't have this level of trust achieved, I would forget about this!
<br />

<br />
1. For different people, different results happen, go with what you feel most comfortable with doing and use that method. I would say doing it right before you go to sleep would work best, your body is resting and your conscious mind is in the process of relaxing and drifting off which allows the sub-c free rein to start making changes.
<br />

<br />
2.  And the answer is yes.
<br />

<br />
3.  Yes, I would personally suggest using your emotional desire to bring this point home to your sub-c. Sub-c tries to keep us happy in most cases and will always attempt to protect from any eminent dangers.
<br />

<br />
4.   It varies from person to person, it probebly would go to a more natural shade of grey until you say something different, this is another example of sub-c attempting to protect, it's aware that differences in people from the society norm causes fear which would in turn bring potential emotional and physical harm to yourself.
<br />

<br />
5.  Setting a time limit tends to act as a force on the sub-c and sub-c's are notoriously known for being stubborn. Make your desires known to sub-c and then let it go at it's own pace.
<br />

<br />
6. I wouldn't worry about the impermance it's something that takes practice, and each time you practice it changes faster ect. I'd say it's probable that you could make it permanent but then that adds a whole new set of complexities that your sub-c has to deal with.
<br />

<br />
As for handling society around you, I would just tell em &quot;look i'm a unique individual learning to tap into my own personal abilities, Try tapping into yours and see what happens&quot; They might think it a bit strange but then they'd get use to it ok so you found something new but if you don't blatantly dangle it in front of their faces they'll forget about it.

			New update on last week to this week. I've always been completely flat footed and of course my folks been concerned about that. First 3 days didn't see anything happen, sort of forgot about it. Well in the last 4 days, where the arches suppose to be, been cramping severely on me and I didn't think anything about it. However, this evening I was looking at my feet and went damn! got arches now! There still quite small as far as arches go, but it's great progress, now I need to get arch support and put em into my boots.
