			Mods: I'm unsure where to put this, here or in the Dream Phenomenon forums. Please move this to where it should be. And its basic stuff so...if its been mentioned hundreads of times (even though I didn't find anything like this when i searched) feel free to lock it.
<br />

<br />
After having a small experience last night I've decided to share a few things about OBE's that I have learned over time. This is for people new to OBEs, many common questions under one topic. I'm sure experts will read this and laugh and tell me, we already know this, silly.
<br />

<br />
May I start off by saying that there isn't a single technique out there with a 100% sucess rate. Everybody is different, and so are their astral and energy bodies. I have tried countless techniques I've read on the internet that were said to induce OBE's easily and quickly. They never worked. In my own opinion tapes and binurial beats are not needed and drugs are just a joke. Don't take any type of drug to induce an OBE. The power to leave your body is in your mind, not in any drug.
<br />

<br />
Now I know the Monroe techniques and rope techniques and such work for many but they always seem to need tweaks, and many forums still have people asking, how do you do it? I've looked everywhere but I've failed! Many techniques make it either seem too easy (where you barley try at all) or too hard (where it gets too confusing to concentrate). From my own experience, the easiest way to put it is just to...explore it your own way. Fall asleep at night and see how your energy works. You leave your body every night when you dream, OBE's and AP are just concious awareness of that state. Now don't practice OBEs at midnight because you're bound to just fall into deep sleep. You have to be full of energy but at the same time, still have the ability to drift off into a light sleep, which is why the morning is the best time, at least for me. For others it may be different.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, I've found that every time I do experience something, it was very random. It was always the times where I was intending on it. Last night I practiced for a long time and thought about it for hours with no results. This morning I woke up and started to drift off again, when I suddenly heard a rushing noise past my ears and the middle section of my body rose upwards. A few months ago I began to feel vibrations just as I began to drift off and dream, but since I was so excited and startled by it, they faded away. Many times I'll finally achieve an OBE only to fall right back into a dream. For example: I'll rise out of my body and as soon as I leave my room I'll find myself in an unreal dream world. This proves how importaint it is to maintain control of your astral body and subconcious. You're mind is powerful and can manipulate itself to its liking. 
<br />

<br />
Lucid dreaming is a good example of this. I have yet to experience an actual lucid dream, but from what I've heard, it is easy to slip into an OBE from a lucid dream because you have control. Now I'm sure this requires more than just simply slipping from one state to another, but I have yet to experience it. For some people it is natural to feel these things right away and for others it could take years. (Thats whats happening to me.) For some, OBEs are easy without energy works, though for others, you should try to understand your energy body and chakras before practicing OBE's. It will definetly help to meditate as well.
<br />

<br />
And theres three things you MUST know. You cannot be afraid of OBE's to induce one, otherwise it will never happen because when something occurs, you freak out. Second, don't doubt it. Believe in OBE's is the way to sucess. And third, practice. Practice a lot, even though I said many times it may happen when you don't practice, it helps get you ready. Practicing for OBE's also opens doors to new skills such as telepathy and empathy. But...don't practice so much that you stress yourself out. You MUST remain calm and very relaxed, stressing yourself just means you're focusing on your physical body, and it doesn't work. This is all mental, people. Keep that in your head.
<br />

<br />
And one more thing, many new people come to different forums and ask, is this an OBE? Is this how you feel? How long does it take? I'll answer some questions now.
<br />

<br />
If you feel something was an OBE, it probebly was. But if you're unsure to the point where you don't know if it even exists, it probebly wasn't. 
<br />

<br />
There are many side effects that tell you you're on the road to an OBE and its different for everyone. But you may feel one or more of the following: Vibrations, tingling sensations, rushing sensations, disconnected (especially limbs), a pulse in one or more of your chakras, you might hear odd clicking sounds, or rushing sounds, or in some cases voices (don't be afraid of them), and you may feel like you're being electricuted but it never physically hurts.
<br />

<br />
The length of time it takes to learn an OBE depends on the person. Theres no set time. For some people its a matter of minutes. For some it may take a few hours of meditation. When you get good at it, the time may or may not cut down.
<br />

<br />
Hope this might've asked anyone's questions. Prety much the technique is simply put like this: Become interested in it, explore different feelings and techniques during practice times, find one that works best for you, keep patient, don't doubt it, and it will come naturally to you, no matter how much time it takes. (: Happy OBE'ing.

			Good article, I enjoyed it very much <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.

I would like to add that becoming interested in the subject and reading about it as much as you can will help too. It helps your subconsciousness getting used to the subject and not be afraid or ignorant about it.
<br />

<br />
Also willpower is important. If you tell yourself you can do it, then you can do it. If you are uncertain or doubtful, it lowers your chances quite a bit. Even if you don't make it tonight, you can still be happy about it as you are one step closer and one more experience is behind you.
<br />

<br />
Good luck!

peace ?
