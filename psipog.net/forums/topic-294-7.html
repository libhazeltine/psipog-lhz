			My mom believes in &quot;supernatural&quot; things such as ghosts and psychics and whatnot. My sister has had experiences with ghosts on many occasions, she studies astronomy  or whatever its called, the thing that predicts peoples days depending on when you are born...
<br />

<br />
My dad however is skeptic of most of those things, but he believes in the whole mind over matter thing, and somewhat believes in ghosts. When I can move the psiwheel, and maybe some pens or something, then ill show my mom for proof, then my older sister (although she lives in a different state so I don't get to see her that often) then eventually my dad. Luckily my families all atheists, so they wont go nuts if they catch me practicing, my mom already has and she just didnt really care...

			I told my parents. It's weird, I thought that my parents would be supportive. My dad doesn't follow the religion of my grandparents (Jehovahs Witnesses) but I think somehow the upbringing has affected him and he doesn't really like it. It's worse with my mum because she openly laughs at it, and one day I brought the psiwheel downstairs and went to move it. It worked, but mum said it could have been draft etc. Then when we moved into the kitchen, where there was no draft, and I did it again, she still didn't believe it. Until I can do what Matilda can I don't think she'll be convinced. I still feel better that they know. My boyfriend thinks its cool, but thinks there is no way he could do it and after negative results just gave up, so I don't think he is that bothered.

			Whoa, more proof that psionics is 100% real! I was surprised to hear this but its awesome (to me anyways!). Somehow me and my mom got into a conversation about &quot;Mind over matter&quot; and that &quot;The mind is a powerfull thing&quot; and she mentioned, yeah, one of the people I used to date was able to make a visible little ball of light with his hands. My mouth just dropped. A psiball, my mom knows and has seen one with her own eyes so there is gonna be no skepticism from her about psionics how awesome is that?!

i dont think it was intended as a question - more like &quot;fuck that&quot; - its an often used saying, not literally meaning intercourse. just to clarify -_- bit unappropriate

			The multiple chat windows are a bit of a give away. Most of the time, they dont bother to notice. The y probably know somethings up, though I guess they reckon its more spirit stuff, not psi <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> Most people don't bother to notice, so its not a problem. PSI is invisible, so theres no need to leave stuff lying around. So feel free to tell em, but dont assume there going to be remotly interested.
