			personally, my opinion is that it should be shown in public if you want to. The question of using it for the wrong reasons, depends on what you think &quot;wrong&quot; is. not using it morally (like cheating) shouldnt be that bad, but using it to harm others should be crossing the line, whether it be physically or emotionally. I would not want to see a world where everyone knows psionics, because you know there will be bad people using it for bad to harm others severly. as for the fluffy of &quot;using psionics for bad will take your powers over&quot; never believe that. you have muscles in your arm to move it, if you were intending to punch someone out with it, does that mean that you wont be able to use your arm because your planning to use it in the wrong? no. personally, i train with psionics to learn more about life, myself, and my limits, how far i can go. if i can help people with my abilities (in the very distant future...damn you pen roll!) then i will. i would love to have strong pk like in xmen3 so i can help people, make the world a better place to live in, a more happy place. but i geuss i can dream...

This is a ridiculous goal to have. Not only ridiculous, but blatantly against the Psipog rules of &quot;No Combat&quot;. Not to mention it calls into question the level of maturity and respect that you have for your fellow human beings that you hold.

Mostly your friend is right, except the &quot;er, no&quot; part, and the end sentence. The rest of the logic that I don't like is based on &quot;fear&quot;. It is insignificant if you are labeled a &quot;freak&quot;. From my own experience people tend to &quot;forget&quot; about Psi stuff after a few weeks/months.

She is correct. If you can't think of any other reason to learn psi than the specific goal you outlined, then you are better of not learning Psi.

<br />

<br />
The whole &quot;dark Psion&quot; thing is stupid aswell. You won't be a dark Psion, you'll just be a bad person. If someone is messing with you, you can usually stop them by confronting them about it. And the latter CAN get you in trouble, depending on who you tell.

			public or private doesn't matter.  What matters is if you're doing things to bring world peace or to make chaos.  If you try to be righteous then there is no problem being public.  If you try to be greedy and powerful then even private is a problem.  If you try to use power to get dates and make money, you have a problem.  If you try to use power to reach HaSheM and spread love and happiness then you are doing good <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

1. Revenge is wrong, self-defense is allright. 
<br />
2. What do <span style="font-weight: bold">I?</span> intend on doing with psionics? well i plan on helping people out, having fun, and i hope that one day it will save my life <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />
3. What reasons? uh, well why NOT learn it?
<br />
4. Wrong reasons: to hurt people. Right reasons: to make the world a better place
<br />
5. It is OK to display them, but just be careful who you show.

			you can display it whenever or wherever and for whatever reasons you got.. it's no one's business since it's your choice not theirs.. may it be for revenge or self defense.. no one can stop you from what you want.. your sub-c has the same views as you do.. it, he or she will assist you anytime.. 
<br />

<br />
-my reasons for practicing psi is well it's crazy, misunderstood, and at the same time fun.. how i use it depends on my mood and the situation.. whether i wanna harm, help, or just have fun with it.. it's my decision alone.. 
<br />
-right reasons, wrong reasons why bother thinking 'bout them? it's like taking an exam, you cheat you don't cheat.. same outcome..

1. Protection is fine, but revenge is unacceptable in MY OPINION.
<br />
2. Use them to improve my daily life. Nothing too major, really. Maybe freak people out.
<br />
3. To harness a new and useful skill.
<br />
4. Right reasons: Because you want to learn Wrong reasons: Aren't really any, other than world domination.
<br />
5. Yes. I plan on doing so when I become more adept. I'll mass-ping everyone in my English class, MWAHAHAHAHA!

			if we think of the stronger users, the 'masters,' they all seem to be good
<br />
i see very few using psi or ki for malicous intent
<br />

<br />
so isnt it kind of obvious the path that will make you stronger?
<br />

<br />
i dont think it is a matter of public display, you can show anybody you please, just dont use it for harmful reasons in public, or in general and all will be fine, and you will more than likely be strengthend
