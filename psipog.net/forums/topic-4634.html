			If one person can move a psi wheel or roll a can, then wouldn't it be possible to move larger objects by having multiple people?

It's probably more complicated than it seems, but has anyone tried this?

			I read somewhere (probably a fluff site) that the effect of manifesting with more than one person increases in squares.
<br />

<br />
e.g.
<br />
2 people = 4 times as powerful
<br />
3 people = 9 times as powerful
<br />
4 people = 16 times as powerful
<br />
...
<br />

<br />
This might apply to PK too, not sure.

			Well, In theory it is possible...if you were to &quot;become one with the object&quot; In this case a very large object, then I don't see why you couldn't move it. But I thought that PK was manipulating energy around an object to move it. IDK It would seem possible.

			I imagine it would take synchronizing with the other person as well, for if people connect to something, conflicting energy would be off.

			You would most likely not only have to connect to the object, but also the other person.
<br />

<br />
But would that throw off their focus, or their energy, or would you even be able to connect to the person and to the object at the same time? It would take a lot of focus, that is if it is even possible. 
<br />

<br />
Someone more experienced than I should try it.
<br />

<br />
It would make quite a Vid wouldn't it? 2 people lifting...oh, let's say a car? Or a fridge would even be impressive!

			when i first started i worked alone then i told my brother when i got good at the psi wheel when he practiced he didnt do to well.  so one day i thought why not both of us on the same wheel at the same time.  we both attempted to spin the wheel at the same time and we got it spinning so fast it almost flew off the pin ive never been able to spin it that fast again by myself anyway but ive stopped the psi wheel im on bigger objects now.

			the biggest problem i see is that most people cant move large things, ya get 2 people who can move a psiwheel together and they can move a empty pop can?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  yeah sad but true, it would take a massive amount of people to move a car if all they can do is lift a psiwheel. Leviting a pound of anything would be a almost mariculus stunt for anyone in this community.

			well i think if you maybe use the same amount of psi on the object and focus on the same thing visulize the same thing breathe the same way then your psi wont interfer but it would be very hard to focus like that

			Hmn...I was thinking, and maybe this is all in the belief...
<br />

<br />
Maybe the only reason people cannot lift, lets say...a car, is because they are convinced they cannot do it alone. Just as skeptics are convinced they cannot spin a Psiwheel.
<br />

<br />
What do you guys think?

might benefit, might not.  depends if all of your sub-c's are &quot;in tune,&quot; or trying to accomplish the same goal, or if your energy patterns are disrupting each others.  
<br />

<br />
also, moving heavier objects takes more practice, and more discipline.  the psi-wheel doesn't take much of either, a week of practice at the most (but i have heard of months) and not too much discipline.  heavier objects can take weeks to months to see any success in even budging the object.  people are used to seeing results quickly (from the psi-wheel and light objects) so when they don't see quick results with heavier objects, they may give up and think that it's all fake, or that they simply can't do it.  it just takes more practice.
