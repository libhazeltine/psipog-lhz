			OK so communicating with my sub c it normal. Now when a Sig. of another person is thought up I can communicate easily with that, however I can?t figure out how to tell the difference between talking with someone?s sub c and their consciousness. I?m beginning to think I only hear their sub-c and the average conversations don?t connect consciously because of translating and intuition.  Any ideas?

			Pay attention to the feelings you get. If you want it to be their sub-c only, then it will be. Usually it will be in the form of thoughts or ideas. Most people i communicate with, have no idea i am communicating with them (their sub-c) until i do/say what they were thinking while i was talking to them.

			<span style="color: darkred">My sub-c will not communicate with me on a regular basis, like others. The only time it will communicate with me is when I'm Pendling. I have found out many things about it, for example;
<br />
I asked: &quot;If you could have a human form what would it be?&quot;
<br />
It's answer to me was: &quot;Does that really matter, as long as I'm here, it's not relevant.&quot; 
<br />
I got annoyed and asked the question again and it said: &quot;For your sake, blonde with green eyes.&quot;
<br />
Another question was (I thought that I should ask random things to test it's accuracy): &quot;Is there a pig in my tub?&quot;
<br />
Do you know what it feels like to be stared at like you are insane, well that's the feeling I got in return.
<br />
But it only communicates while Pendling, is there a way to break it from this habit? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</span>

			Tsutana the less thoughts you have the more things you hear. Meditation is a method along with visualizing. Simple answers yet true. Now all I hear is sub c or c (still cant figure) every time I do something...be it a thought or just sit down in class. I actually hear sub-c conversations...now those make me think that they are c. Any ideas?

			<span style="color: limegreen"> Tsutana, I think that you should try talking to it outside of Pendling, and see what you get. Maybe, it's just not use to speaking on a regular basis. Just try to get to know it a little better, and see what you get out of it. </span>

			The_Musician when you said most people have no idea you?re communicating with them...do you say that because you have full conversations with only their sub-c?    That to me makes partial sense; it seems that when I message them they react  A. Physically B. Emotionally C. Responsively. Now with these 3 I assume they actually hear me because of feedback.  Is the feeling when a consciousness replies more then feedback?

Everybody does or they wouldn't know when to eat or they get messages emotionally during certain decisions, but do they follow what their sub-c tells them? Sometimes. Most inventions are accidents or just gut feeling...some inventions.
<br />

<br />
I just talk to myself, that is how I communitcate with my sub-c, just babbel about nothing or something.

<br />

<br />
PS. I named my sub-c Sebastion  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> it kind of looks a sounds a litlle like subconscious so yeah... &gt;.&gt;
