			I was practicing with my psi wheel again yesterday and it still didn't move the way I wanted it to.
<br />
We probably all know that emotions are a killer for psi because they distract us.
<br />
But after about 5 minutes of constant left and right turning I tried another methode - I got angry.
<br />
I yelled at in my mind, I screamed (in my mind) and it immediately stopped.
<br />
I was able to re-create this scene everytime it didn't move the way I wanted it to.
<br />
I was even able to force it into one direction at a speed I never had before.
<br />
Don't get me wrong I knew how to &quot;soft&quot; control one, I did it before but this was different.
<br />
It wasn't the soft and void control I had learned some months back.
<br />
No, this was VERY different it felt like my psi would get drained out of my body.
<br />
After some time I felt cold and tired and I decided to stop.
<br />

<br />
What do you guys think? Was it just my mind? Or are emotions really capable of releasing such powers?

			Emotions are very inportant for results of your training, but experimenting with them is very dangerous.
<br />
It may be like this : A weightlifter tries to pull up 50 kg. Its rly hard for him, often he fails. Then he become angry and starts to pick 50 kg really fast, several times. After that his muscles are totally out of use.
<br />
it may be same with telekinesis. I guess thats why in articles everywhere are tips like : have fun, let it go, take it easy blah blah
<br />
Your safety is much more important then results you get, keep it in mind. Also remember that you practice even if youre not moving wheel, every safe training is step forward.

			Emotions do release that kind of power, especially when you are angry.
<br />
I once let a glass explode because i was angry (no one got hurt fortunately)
<br />

<br />
I wouldnt recommend to use anger with pk because the force can be extremely powerfull and harmfull.

			I've used anger for PK before  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />
Just to see what would happen of course. But it gives me a headache like that, So I havent really done it since
<br />
Wouldnt recommend using anger for PK all the time..
<br />
But trying new things are good  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			not only is &quot;anger pk&quot; a hazard to other people, but it can be a hazard to yourself.  you're putting your body, and more importantly your mind and nervous system under so much strain with the anger, that i'm sure after adding pk to it and can cause some health problems.  i wouldn't recomend using it, even if you use the &quot;let it happen&quot; method of pk...unless you're trying to give yourself a brain annerism (sp?)  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Yes, anger is very dangerous when using PK. Trust I know from experience. Some boys were picing on me at school for being a &quot;freak&quot; and I had. had enough. I got very angery, turn around and let loose control of my mind. The both of them were knocked backwards and slide a bit. I was TOTALLY drained and passed out in the hallway. Had, a migrain for 3 freaking day. So yeah, anger and emotions in general are dangerous when using ANY form of kinesis.
