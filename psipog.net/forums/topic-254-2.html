i'm a LOTR fan, i tried to open my house's door with &quot;mellorn&quot;, &quot;mellon&quot;, &quot;mellor&quot; and it didn't worked...
<br />
meaning: you know that luke skywalker is in fact a tiny, baby-faced actor? and yoda just a bunch of rubber?
<br />
as many fantasies, they're made out of real things, but they are not real, that's  the key on arts they are just a reflex of reality...

			If somebody on this site knew the &quot;ultimate truth&quot; as you put it, don't you think they would've advertised it more? The site is &quot;Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance&quot; not &quot;Psychic People Who Want To Be Told All Of The Answers Insted Of Finding Them Out For Themselves (or PPWWTBAOTAIOFTOFT for short) Just as there is no one correct technique to do psionics, there is no one correct way to interpret the Universe. This is a psionics forum, not a philosophy forum. (althought that would be pretty freaking sweet if they put one up)

I didn't think that worked, did they try again?
<br />

<br />
I think that the Force is kind of real, but I don't think it's a religious thing. A while ago I played this game called Star Wars Galaxies, and I was very attached to my character (I still use his name a lot). When my character became Force Sensitive (You had to collect badges to do it) I felt something. I didn't relate it to anything psionic (Because I wasn't a psion at the time), and even after I became a psion it still feels different than when I sense psi. I'm starting to wonder, but I don't see much of a connection. I might've messed up tenses there, but that's because while I still feel it, I quit the game a month ago (Don't try playing it, it's painful now).

			Although Star Wars is just a movie, i think George Lucas based his story or his imagination from reality...on my opinion the  &quot;Force&quot; mentioned on the movie is the Energy or Psi energy, where the jedi can control it and move things. He uses the word Force instead of Energy, coz i think force is nice to hear than Energy, example &quot;May the Force be with you&quot;..instead of &quot;May the Energy be with you&quot;..hehehehe. The Jedi power there refers to PK, to master PK..as what master jedi Yoda said to be patient and concentrate, if you dont have patience you can't be successful in becoming a Jedi and as what master Qui Gon said to Anakin &quot;dont think, just use your instinct&quot;...i think that words apply in practicing PK...am i right?..hehehehe.

Depending on which &quot;Sai Baba&quot; you are talking about... although the most recent one was proven to be a fake.  If you search in google for &quot;Sai Baba&quot;, you can find videos of him that clearly show how he is faking.
<br />

<br />
...Actually, I just tried to access the videos, and they aren't online anymore.  I think I have them on my harddrive somewhere... performing search...

he places it between the index finger and the middle finger but no one tells because the thingys are very small...and he places the thingy through a hand pose that people might think its part of the ability

			I have a game where an F16 can take 6 direct hits. 
<br />

<br />
In the real, non-animated world, an F16 could easily be taken down by a ONE PROXIMITY hit.
<br />

<br />
So, it has a small root in reality, but can we all agree that taking ideas from games and movies is generally a bad idea when it comes to psionics?
