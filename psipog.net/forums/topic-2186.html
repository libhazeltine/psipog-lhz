			I'm not sure what is but I constantly feel like I'm half asleep, like my life is bland and all my sense are weak. Nothing seems like it used to be, could this have anything to do with me getting into a state of consciousness slowly and not realising it. It's get really bad at school, and it's not because I'm bored.

			I feel the same way, when I was younger, the world felt so... I don't know, it felt a lot more real.  Now, as the days go by it feels a lot different.  Some days feel different from the others as well.  When it started, and a while after that I used to wonder about it.  I think it might be connect to our psychic perception, I feel more, spiitual I think it would be described as.  Its either that, we are being constantly attacked, or its a reaction from our hormones <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> I am 15, so I haven't ruled that out <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

Scorch, did you not see that he said it wasn't because of boredom? I feel the same way whether I'm bored or not.  Also, IMO people who flame every chance they get are losers.

			gahhh i'm getting something like that too.
<br />
I used to be all uppity and out there, and just when i started tapping into psi, everything seems so.. real.  My friends worry about me because i'm always seeming so out of it. I'm so damn quiet, i'm so calm.. on the good side my friends say that I look like I have more life inside me.
<br />
All my senses, especially hearing; have greatly improved.  Everything i now touch, it's as if &quot;woah, this is it, this is what i'm touching, and it's so real..&quot;. Everyone sounds so loud, but my hearing has just gotten better.. i can taste and small the air, new things i never smelled before.
<br />

<br />
It's like i'm going through some rebirth stage.

			It can be alot of things.  It may be your reaction to psionically overexerting yourself.  It may also simply be a lack of sleep.  Could you provide some more details?

			Me? uhm..
<br />
All my life, it fealt like there was a veil around me, I could never see past it. I didn't know what it was but it was frustrating me.  I was a little skeptic about psions.. I just didn't think much of it i guess.  Learning even the basics of psionics, I can't really explain it, but all i know is that it removed that veil.  I can see much more, but now another veil is a little further away.  I will continue to break through these veils, and expand.

			Well, for me, I don't see how it could be a lack of sleep, unless I'm really that bad of a sleeper for the past few years <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.  It doesn't matter how much energy I have, how many red bulls I drink <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />, I still feel the same way, although what I'm describing isn't being tired.  I do feel tired a lot though <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
I personally have been a lot more calm, quiet too.  My psychic senses have definitely increased over the past few years.  Sometimes the feeling inccreases day by day and I end up having a little bit more control.

			You are always tierd if you convinced your sub-c you are always tierd? I have heard of disorders that cause you to have sleeping problems... and then i've heard others that keep saying they're tierd all the time, they don't have any health problems, and yet it seems like it.  Seems like you are only convincing your sub concious.

I don't think this is in the right section anymore XD

I am not convinced that I am always tired, although for a point I did convince my subconscious  that I was, when I realized it I got over it.  It isn't like I try to be tired, it is just that, well, sometimes I am, sometimes I'm not.

Dark Destiny, do you have any more description of how you feel?

			Ok you guys are all having your senses boosted, I'm having the opposite it's like I'm under water, or I'm daydreaming all day. It's like I'm fading from reality and I'm not actually in control of my body I just observe everybody else as if I'm just a viewer of reality. I've been thinking maybe it's not psionics and it could be a disorder or something, maybe depersonalization disorder, I'm getting it checked out I just though maybe psionics might be doing it or could help.

			I see exactly what you mean.  My senses aren't necessarily getting boosted, other than my 6th sense, but I feel like I have been fading from reality and am observing others.  I can also feel more of what people are like before I get to know them.  So, I know exactly what you mean, it has felt like that for a long time for me.  I have control of my body, but if I want I can let go and pretty much watch myself go on its own.  It has took a little bit of practice to get it going to the extent it is at. The first time I let it go was the wierdest thing ever.  I could walk with hardly any input <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.  Now I don't need any at all where I normal at least feel like I'm telling my body to do something.  I have played around with it a little bit.
<br />

<br />
At first I thought it might be signs of depression, from how I first felt, but like I said before wether I'm sad, happy, angry, depressed, I still feel it.

			Haha thats funny how you said you can tell how someone is before you meet them. I knew who was going to be my girlfriend even before I talked to her, I knew who my best friends were going to be before I even talked to them. Do you click in and out of consciousness, sometimes I feel like I'm daydreaming my whole life. Also alot of weird thoughts come with this, I think out of the box big time, like what if I'm in an acoma right now and everyone is just a figment of my imagination and before I can wake up I need to find my reason for being here.
