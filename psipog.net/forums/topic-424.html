			Recently, i have noticed something very strange involving meditation. Usually i meditate a couple of minutes every day but the last couple of days i have been spending many hours due to been very stressed about personal things. Usually when i walk down the campus park i feel a certain way, connected, aware, the smallest sound will make me turn around. After these days of meditation, walking down the same path gives me a very different feeling. I feel as if my body is walking by itself and even though i try to focus i cant &quot;connect&quot; to nature around me. I feel like i am in a dream or everything around me isnt real. I dont know if any of you have experienced this before but in my humble opinion too much meditation does the opposite of &quot;Connecting mind an body&quot;, it actully detatches it. I am not sure if this could be harmful in the long range or if it actully makes you more attatched to your subconciousnes. Has anyone else had a similar experience?
<br />

<br />
Edit: A clarification. Some people think that meditation is only involved before a psi practise. I do meditation to center myself, not to increase my psi abilities.

I get that feeling often, but I almost never meditate, I'm leaning towards the fact that it's 10:15 AM on a school day in which I've gotten 4 or less hours of sleep  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Is it almost like, feeling lightheaded and in a dream-state? (For some reason the feeling &quot;extremely embarrased&quot; comes to mind, like you embarrass yourself over and over in a chain of events because you are so nervous you get detached from reality).
<br />

<br />
Ok that example is odd but the best I can give  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I've felt that extremity of detachment before. Sometimes I can find myself walking and it feels like a dream, the thought runs through my head, everything flows easy, and I don't even feel anything as I would normally, it's like im walking but I don't feel like im walking I just feel like im moving forward all by itself, not moving my legs. Bit confusing to follow, but best I can do on explaining this.
<br />

<br />
I'm unsure if its anything psionic, probably not for my case, but I thought i'd mention it since it has relevance.

			Hmm, I think we cant put the blame on meditation without facts. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

This &quot;numbness&quot;, Thanatos,  may be a consequence of sleep deprivation, psychological stress and many others factors.
<br />

<br />
However, I bet there will be many articles in the internet that may mention the results of meditation.

Finally, to test it on your own, stop meditating for some period...and if these &quot;symptoms&quot; persist, then meditation is innocent  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

			I don't think it's harmfull, the feeling you get. I used to get the same feeling, you feel like you are disconnected, in a dream, more aware of things and all. Honestly, I believe that's because after a good meditation, when that happens, you are actually more aware of your surroundings, and this is a result of being more relaxed, because you don't have things racing through your mind and you tend to notice more subtle things in and around you that you would ignore if you were thinking to yourself, doing something, keeping your mind busy ect. 
<br />
Just another thought, you may have heard that health researchers, doctors and scientists approve and recommend meditation as being good for you, and through research it has proven to be a benefit yto your health and well being. So in my opinion, you shouldn't worry too much about meditation being bad or risky to you. Have fun with it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I experience the same exact thing; almost always when I'm just hanging out with freinds for some reason.  I personally find it to be more a situation of detatched lucidity, where I get to view and exmine &quot;reality&quot; from an outside standing point.  All of the problems and worries I had been hanging onto seem so hollow and fake for the short time i am in this state.

You're at the verge between getting your emotions under control, and having total control over your thoughts. It's like you normally have all these surface thoughts running through your brain, noticing this, noticing that, but they are all fading as you train yourself. Once your brain goes silent however, you will find it much easier to concentrate, focus on one thing in particular, or be more sensitive of your surroundings.

			Dear All,
<br />

<br />
Meditation is a process of purifying the body and bringing it back to the natural state, if done correctly it will make you more alert, less stressed, and realxed.
<br />

<br />
Now when the body is not tuned to the level of comfort being provided by the mind , it tends to balance itself by sleeping or dozing and many other forms too. This actually means that your body is still not &quot;Cleansed&quot; enough to support the power being provided by the mind, hence &quot;Body Conditioning&quot; is required , i.e bringing the body  into its natural state. Conditioning/ Cleansing of the body is involved releasing of the hidden stress, suppressed emotions, hidden desires, excessive happiness, too much love, raised sexual desires etc.
<br />

<br />
Based on my experience I would persoanlly change the technique of meditation and prefer a more slower technique. There are certain practices in meditation that can actually lead to this kind of  state, and it means that you need to go a bit slow and give time to your body to adapt to the kind of power being given by the mind.

			Clarity in life is a good thing.
<br />

<br />
But ignorance is bliss.
<br />

<br />
Whenever i feel like that and don't want to i tend to whack up the volume, turn on some Janes Addiction and go skate
<br />

<br />
but its a good state of mind and will increase your attachment to your subconsious.
<br />

<br />
Use the time to try and communicate with what it wants.  If you want to do a random thought that pops into your head then do it.  Its usually your subconsious talking.
<br />

<br />
but then again this could all be complete rubbish and i could be wrong!
<br />

<br />
thats what i love about Psi don't you?

			I prefere this state, being able to exam things from a third person viewpoint almost is a great skill and helps you see past your ignorence and arrogence. I meditate quite regularly and it's changed the way I think about things because all the surface chatter usually racing through my head has died down to a minimal.
<br />

<br />
For me meditation makes my head clearer, my psi abilities better, my mind more aware, and it allows me to solve problems better.

			Thanatos, I totaly understand you. I know that feeling.
<br />
I suggest you work on your grounding, so you will feel more connected to earth, which is opposite to moon (subconcious, dreams, dreaming).
<br />

<br />
Wikipedia:
<br />
&quot;Grounding&quot; in spiritual experience can mean a living energetic connection between person/space/thing and the earth; necessary for: sustaining authentic presence, and experiencing emotional and spiritual safety.
<br />

<br />
Meditation is supposed to make you more aware and grounded, not dreamy.
<br />
You should check your technique, cause maybe you are not doing it right.
<br />
Maybe before meditation you should try some asanas (yoga).
<br />
Tadasana is good for grounding (check google images for tadasana). 
<br />
Dreamy stuff and feeling like flying is associated with influences of the moon. Moon pulls you up, but you must stay on earth <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
Don't worry, meditation is good. This dreamy feeling will pass.
<br />
You cannot over-meditate. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
