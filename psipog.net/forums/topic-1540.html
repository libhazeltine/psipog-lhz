			Rainsong has lifted a canoe, NI moved a chair after 9 months of practicing, JoeT moved a book on cam and some Psipog users tell us that they are able to do similar stuff. Why don't we have more videos? I love those we already have, but it would be cool if any of you experienced guys found the time to make more. Server space shouldn't be a problem, we can use rapidshare.de or something.
<br />

<br />
Here are my ideas for even more inspiring videos than the ones we already have (NI's spinning clock is the coolest one this far IMO:)):
<br />

<br />
*A fight with paper airplanes, as mentioned in Rainsong's article. If paper airplanes are too tough, any two objects will do.
<br />

<br />
*Any light object (ex. small ball of paper) being guided telekinetically through a little obstacle course on a table
<br />

<br />
*Flying liquid (maybe two blobs of liquid mixing in mid-air)
<br />

<br />
None of these should be too hard to do, judging from some of the mods' PK skill level. (Some users may be able to do these things, too.)
<br />
The videos in our media section aren't boring by any means, they just have a lot of potential to be a lot more inspiring. People need to see that advanced PK can be fun, or else they may have problems keeping up their motivation. Why don't we have videos like the ones I suggested above? Are these things really too diffucult, or haven't anyone got the time to film this?

			Pyroman, there aren't many people able to do stuff like that. If Bob could do something like that, he probably would've made a video or two before making this thread.

			The majority of the video submissions I get are people spinning psiwheels.  I don't add them because it's just the same thing over and over.  If someone submits an original video that I think is legit, then I'll post it (if the PsiPog server can handle it).

			Sounds like a good idea. As for checking for the reality of the videos i would suggest that we have a poll for each vid and ask if they seem real. Unless of course they are so unrealistic that you KNOW its been moded.

			Most people here don't know any better than the staff when it comes to debunking videos.
<br />

<br />
I'm talking about the really big PK masters here, like Rainsong, NI, float.. 
<br />

<br />
Considering JoeT could move a book, he can surely guide a paper ball through a little obstacle course, which would be a lot more inspiring and fun to watch.
<br />

<br />
If none of you who are skilled enough to do this have time/ access to video camera, <span style="font-weight: bold">I respect that</span>, but there is *so* much more cooler stuff you could do with TK on video with your PK skill.. All videos can be faked anyways, so don't bother too much trying to show the viewer that there is no trickery. Marbles moving in a pattern, paper air plane show..

			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
After reading this thread, I decided to write new video ideas. Please visit the following link.

Take care.

			I never got into TK because I thought at best after a few years of training you could lift a pocket knife, or something lightly heavyer.
<br />

<br />
Show me a guy who can make the remote control for his TV float to him from across the room, and I'll show you the guy I admire most. ^_^
<br />

<br />
I think the idea of videos where people lift heavyer stuff is a good one by far.
