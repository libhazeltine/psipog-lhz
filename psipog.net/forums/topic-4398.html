			two events, both felt very much real.
<br />

<br />
the first happened a year or so ago: i was sleeping then woke up (or so thought i did), looking straight up at the ceiling. something was wrong, i felt something on my left arm. it felt like it was stretched out, being held, but it was clearly by my side still, so im guessing it was my astral arm or something like that. so im laying there unable to move anything except my neck, enough to turn and look over to my left. it was there that i saw this shadow person thing gorging itself on this supposed astral arm. immediately i turned to reciting the lords prayer (i'm not religious at all, so i guess it's just a defense mechanism from when i was very young, mother always encouraged it whenever i was scared). after a few rounds, it stops looks at me and says something along the lines of: &quot;he is not in your house&quot;, as i was shocked by this statement i kept on with it anyways. it clearly was annoyed, let go of my arm and faded backwards instantly into my dark closet. i spontaneously got up as if it was not a dream.... weird...
<br />

<br />
the second happened about a week ago, but again felt very much real: i fell asleep listening to a program repeat about aliens (maybe that has something to do with the following experience) on Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell. anyways, i woke up in the middle of the night, unable to move anything except my neck. i can still feel the earphones i wore to sleep on me, though can't hear anything at all. i can still see the light emitting from the stereo next to my bed. i turn to face my left, and see what i would describe as an alien (about 5ft tall, classical grey) holding something up that looked like a flashlight, pointing it at my side. it must have noticed me because it turned its head at me after i turned mine. the whole thing lasted about 10 to 15 seconds. then i spontaneously woke up, looking up this time.
<br />

<br />
dream or no dream, both incidences were very eery.

anyways, most dreams are metaphorical so as both dreams involved your left side maybe thats your bodys way of telling you thers something wrong there? 
<br />
dont let that worry you though as im not an expert  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Meh... the greys. I have no idea how &quot;real&quot; they are. I haven't really been interested in them... they're kind of secondary.
<br />

<br />
From what you describe, your experience sounds like sleep paralysis.
<br />

<br />

<br />
However, I'm interested in one thing.
<br />

<br />
Have you ever seen a creature (dream or not), that's tall, reptile-looking but still humanoid, brown scaley skin, and elongated, almost glowing eyes that are black, red, and yellow?
<br />

<br />
If anyone has, please reply. Because I had an experience similar to the original poster's, only with one of those.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

			Ya, it does sound like sleep paralysis. The not being able to move, and the really scary &quot;other&quot; in the room with you. (thx for the nightmares too btw) It's common, from what I understand, to see something altoghether frightening during sleep paralysis. It's likely that whatever you might be interested in (something scary) at the time comes out during one of these episodes. Some scientists think that's why alien abductions are so common. People have sleep paralysis and have a dream (which seems real to them) in which they are abducted. In the middle ages it was demonic minions. Today it's aliens ghosts and shadow people. Or this could all be a lot of scientific justification bull and the greys are out to get us, the government is covering it all up, and demons have lost interest in humanity. (Sounds like a novel hmm...)

Man I am getting sick of hearing the term &quot;sleep paralysis.&quot;
<br />

<br />
So what if there are certain chemicals released in the brain when these things happen to people? That's the brain's job. If you want to look at it from a very shallow perspective, then ok. Leave it at &quot;it was sleep paralysis.&quot;
<br />

<br />
But, from numerous experiences, I know that there is a little more to this phenomenon than chemicals fucking around in your brain.
<br />

<br />
The alien thing is pretty crazy. I don't know what to think regarding that, as you WERE listening to Art Bell, so it very well could have been a hallucinogenic expereince resulting from a classical case of sleep paralysis.
<br />

<br />
As for the shadow &quot;person&quot;, I believe you had a genuine encounter with another being. I, too, have had four seperate experiences where I woke up, paralyzed, only to have a shadowy figure leap from some part of my room and wrap itself around my body, and start to &quot;suck the life right outta me&quot; as I like to blatently refer to it as... Think of being electrocuted, hit with liquid nitrogen, and set on fire after being doused with gasoline, and then combine all of those type of pain. That's what it felt like for me every time. 
<br />

<br />
Besides those experiences, I've had several other encounters in waking life with shadow beings, though not attacked by them.
<br />

<br />
I haven't seen them in years, but I still sense their malevolent presence occasionally (once you get a feel for their presence, it's unmistakable). I've simply come to the conclusion that If I don't want them to attack me, they won't... Not sure of their alignment or disposition towards humans, but I get the feeling they don't like us very much, even if they aren't themselves evil.
<br />

<br />
Yeah, lots of &quot;rational&quot; individuals who read this might think im nuts or STILL try to pass it of as sleep paralysis, but the truth is, I don't give a flying fuck what any of you think (though I do let your narrow notions annoy me at times).
<br />

<br />
EDIT: for all of you devotees of science, please don't take offense at my harsh manner... I just get pissed off sometimes, and I haven't gotten some ass in a while, so i've been moody of late.
<br />

<br />
d_f_h, i'm not gonna say that you definitly had an encounter with one of the shadow beings, but I tend to believe that it is a definite probability.
<br />

<br />
I don't think they can hurt us if we don't want them too though.

			Hmm... nobody's seen what I described, either in a dream or the astral plane?
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I agree with Xiouslaidyn that &quot;sleep paralysis&quot; is a cop-out. If multiple unrelated people see the same thing, the chances that they all hallucinated the same thing are pretty slim.
<br />

<br />
After all, what we call &quot;real&quot; is just what the largest number of people can percieve. I really don't think that's a justifyable reason to call it &quot;real&quot;, but it's the best we can do.

   Sleep paralysis. No doubt about it. If you've seen them in your &quot;waking&quot; hours then you should see a doctor about it. Can you give us more details about your experiences please?
<br />

<br />
   Also... there are more than just chemicals in the brain and all that. The rest of your body needs chemicals too. That's about it though. What have you seen/done that proves otherwise?
<br />

<br />
   Shadowbeings? More details. Details, details, details. Please.
