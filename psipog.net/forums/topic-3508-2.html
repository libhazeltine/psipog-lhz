			I've played around a bit with moving photons, the problem is they are so damn fast.  What you need to do is set up a construct that moves any light that passes through it, as a side note this makes the construct visible.

I've tried making objects invisible, the only problem for me that I can't figure out is that they just become distorted <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

haha! Do you know how much power you would need to make a black hole? You would need the equivelant amount of energy as a dead star! Think about how much energy you would need to suck in planets and even light itself. It's not possible to manipulate light in my opinion, since with a black hole, it can suck in planets, but it's the only thing in the universe that can actually suck in light. Have you ever seen light being bent or sucked in anywhere on earth? Of course not, because there is no other source as powerful as a black hole. It's just not possible to bend or affect light like that.
<br />

<br />
 The only thing you can do to light without making a black hole is reflect it. You could take a telekinetic that can pull planets and stars towards them, but I bet you they could still not manipulate light. It's the strongest and the hardest thing in the universe to penetrate.

How much energy is around you to use?  How much is a lot?  How much is too much?  How many joules does it take to make a black hole?  I don't know the answer to any of those questions, if you do I guess you can make those claims, if not I don't see the point really.

Any proof or theory to support this?  To me this claim doesn't make sense, light photons are small and fast moving (3^8 m/s), but the hardest thing in the universe to penetrate?  What does that even mean?  Do you have any experience in moving photons or a stream of reflected photons?
<br />

<br />
My point with all this is to point out that your responses seem to me to be based solely on opinion or what makes sense to you at the time.  If this is not the case feel free to correct me and back it up with something, or at least give supporting arguments.

			to move light i'm thinking you could try doing what crystal does: refract the light. this doesn't move light, but it causes light to change its path due to the speed of light going down as a function of its frequency.
<br />
thats my 2cents, i dont think anybody will do it though but i like to be surprized.

Hmmm...sorry, about that, I seemed to use the wrong word. What I meant was that the last possible thing that a black hole can suck in is light. An example of this is if you were to make a vacuum cleaner so powerful it could move a house, it won't affect light. It's actually quite hard to explain. Light would be the last thing in the universe you could move because it's so fast and strong. This may not apply to what you can do with light and psionics, but I was just stating that light is very, very hard to affect apart from refracting and reflecting. I hope that was clear.

			Well I was actually reading a magazine one time.  Scientists have actually created a man-made black hole but it's so minute and lasts only like millionths of a second that it's basically useless.  They used a huge particle accelerator miles long to do it....miles long.  So yeah, it's pretty hard to do that eh?  Pretty much the only reason they did it is to prove that other dimensions exist

			Light is neither a particle or a wave, it is a duality, which means it is both and nbeither at the same time. It displays characteristics of both.

I'll buy this somewhat, light is indeed fast (3^8 m/s) and changing its direction would need a good bit of acceleration in the direction you want, but I wouldn't say it is impossible or the last thing you can move, it is still energy and in my experience it is easily affected.  Not only creating constructs that distort light, but ones that give off light are possible and not too hard with practice.  At least these statements are true for me.

I understand what you are saying, and yes there are many models to explain the movement of light.  But I fail to see how it affects our ability to effect light psionically.  Insight into the way that light works may give us a better understanding on how to bend it and such, but I guess I'm just saying that I don't understand your point really.

You may think this is easy because light has no mass, wrong, everything that is made of atoms has some mass no matter how small. Light moves so fast that you can't even think of altering it's path with pk, move onto something else. Manipulating light would be harder than manipulating a speeding bullet.

It is not that light has no mass, and I don't see where you have to &quot;think&quot; about moving every single photon or wave if you make a construct that does it.  It's just like telekinesis in some ways on regular objects.  You don't need to think about moving every single atom at once, you just need a general awareness of how the object should move as a whole.

Right, so you are saying that we can bend light? I think not. This is hte same as being able change the direction of and manipulate a psiwheel flying at you at the speed of light. You say that you don't have to concentrate on every particle at once, this is true, but with particles moving that fast you don't even have a chance to concentrate your energy enough to get an effect on it.
