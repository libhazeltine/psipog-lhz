			Going to set up a warning here, Yaham... Though you may find it a viable solution to &quot;aquire energy from &quot;Hashem&quot;... It is not within the scope of PsiPog to deal with such things.
<br />

<br />
So, please refrain from making references to &quot;God&quot;. Same goes for everyone. Talk about religion somewhere else. Talk about Psi here.

			I personally believe that when you draw psi from other sources, you really are drawing it from other sources. And that when you use your body, you are using your body.
<br />

<br />
This reminds me of something I did once when I was using my body for energy and I was completely drained. I made two psiballs, one designed to pull that bad, dull feeling out and the other one designed to feed new, fresh energy into me. It was feeding it into the right side of my chest, whilst the other one was pulling the bad feeling out of the left side.
<br />

<br />
The right side of my chest started hurting in a small area as the psiball fed energy into me xD Eventually I had to dissipate the ball because it was getting too painful.

So this I did not know and yes I am new to this. So I have to take energy from something? I thought I just used the supplied air around me... and teh energy in the air was some how tangled in you mind and then being manipulated some weird way. So how do I drain energy from a source and a person?
<br />
Thanks and please supply an answer for a person and a source.

			Techically all psi comes from the earth or sun if you look far back enough. Energy is  generated in our body when we eat things..these things come from the Earth but without the sun they couldnt grow. If I makea  psiball I go and have a drink of water.

			I am sorry if I have offended anybody.  The problem is that the majority of my energy work deals with G-D.  Would it be more acceptable if I called Him by the name &quot;The Source of Existance&quot;?

there is nothing wrong in taking energy from air.....psi = chi (which is chinese means air in itself)   it would be easier to do so as less focus is needed in drawing energy from the air...can more of your concentration could be used to model that energy that u got

			Yeah finally some info on energy.
<br />
Now I need to know a little about chakras. I have a documant on how to unlock them but it doesn't say what to do for well like this. This document tells me how to position my haands and other stuff along those lines but it doesn't say how to do it. Do I need to meditate or just do what it says while constructing. If you think that is confusing just remesage and I will use a different word phrase.
