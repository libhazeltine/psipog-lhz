			Alright, I tried last night because I couldn't wait until today, I wanted to practice psionics and I thought of this last night. My mind wasn't very clear and I was getting some aol from your name, skalord, which is like skatelord or sk8lord, so I kind of thought of the skater type of person. Here's what I got:
<br />

<br />
Location: you're South-west of me, I'm in Kansas. I'd say that at most, you're 3-4 states away from me. I got an image of an rectangular red house, 2-story, I think. I'd say a middle class house. I think you had cats as pets.
<br />

<br />
Age: Got 19 at first, I'm thinking it's an odd number, maybe 17, 15, or 13.
<br />
I got that you were in high school, or maybe just graduated. Maybe in middle school, doubtful on that, though. March b-day?? 
<br />

<br />
You: I got an image of someone who looked like someone in my science class. Probably AOL, or something, but I'll give it a go.... 
<br />
I got dark hair, and freckles or acne or something across your face. I saw you wearing a necklace and a tank top. You might skateboard a little bit, but that might be AOL from the name. I think you're popular in high school, or you were, and I got an image of a blonde girl? GF? I think you like pizza and maybe soup, that's what I got for your favorite food. You might play video games, XBOX in particular?? I got the image of a flag, are you patriotic? I think you like PK and telepathy and you are a little bit, but only slightly, doubtful of some psionics. Like you are somewhat skeptical of some parts of psionics? but only a little bit. This scan was partly to prove psionics to you. Like 95% curiosity and 5% to prove it to yourself. You have had past mild experiences of psychic stuff and/or you were curious to see what psychic stuff was all about, so you looked it up and found this site. So you're new.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Some of this sounds a little off to me, but whatever..... <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  That's what I got. I forgot to search for a name. <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" />

			lol yea . A lot of it  seems to be pretty generalistic of a teen guy though. Likes videogames, obviously curious about psi(or you wouldn't be on the site) and also we all have SOME little doubt of some things on here, you can't help it. And c'mon who doesn't like pizza  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ...And the age 13-19 is pretty much 85% of the people on here...if not more...but mabye he's 100% right I don't know just seems so general to me.
<br />

My guess about your name is david or darrol

			well the first age that popped into my head was 19, but I also thought he might be in high school, maybe a junior, so the 19 probably wouldn't fit. I'm not so sure about the high school thing, so I'm going to say that he probably is 19 and just graduated.

			Hi all thank you for scanning me. Wel i start:
<br />
My name is Christian
<br />
I like skating but the ska on my nickname refers to the ska music.
<br />
I'm 14 years old and i have brown hair.
<br />
I'm not tall and i live in switzerland not in USA ^^
<br />
My hosue actually has a red-brown roof and it has 4 floors
<br />
I don't wear necklaces  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />
Yes i have acne lol
<br />
I like pizza yeah mmmm.... I'm in 9th grade
<br />
and yes thats all i think. 
<br />

<br />
A yes i thought of telekinesis and telepathy they're my favourite skills. But im a newbie in both especially in telepathy. Wel i believe in telekinesis and in telepathy but the thing i cannot really imagine existing is phasing but i would really like if this is real. So i neither believe nor do not believe in phasing. In telekinesis i'm pretty sure as in telepathy that it exists.
<br />

<br />
Thank you for trying.
<br />
Sorry for my english  im spanish.
<br />
Bye <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Well.... I got some of it right... I saw you as someone who is interested in skating, but not a hardcore skater.   I should have came on here and read your post before I tried to scan, but my computer was already turned off, so I didn't and I didn't get a good idea of the sig and probably scanned the wrong person, lol.
<br />

<br />
your english is pretty good, btw
