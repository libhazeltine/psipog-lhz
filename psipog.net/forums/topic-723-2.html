			I've managed the odd cloaking shield, can be fun, having people walk right past you and asking &quot;Where's Nick?&quot; when I'm less the 10 ft away <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />. Some people, and most of my friends swear I'm a ghost (Mostly because I've practised walking silently :p) My method isn't quite like the one in the articles (everyone thinks differently, so I do what works for me). I  integrate 'invisibility', 'not-here' and 'look over there' into my shields and it seems to work pretty well <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Also dreamed up another kind of shield, the Keep-the-hell-away-from-me shield (Intimidation Shield). I generate 'negative' or 'intimidate' (feelings?) around me, like a shield, when I get on a bus to goto Uni (unless I'm travelling with a mate), mostly because I don't particulary like the weird people who used to sit next to me when the bus was full..Managed to keep the seat next to me empty when the bus was full and some people were standing...<img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I'm not the worlds best shielder, my talents fall closer to micro-pk, precog empathy/healing (and the odd bit of telepathy), but I'm beginning to think it doesn't matter, you can do what you believe you can....the shields work because I <span style="font-style: italic">know</span> they work. That said, Macro-PK still mostly escapes me (I no longer care, it's fun to make the wheel move, but I <span style="font-style: italic">doubt</span> I can do much else...so I can't).

			I've used cloaking shields for two things: 1) scare Jamie. 2) Not get called on in LA. Works pretty well. The teacher didn't notice me until someone started talking to me. (It was only programed to not let the teacher see me)

			Well, im an Imago (guild terms; am almost always invisible, also known as Switcher) but I find that I can walk right into lessons, do the work, and walk right out, only to have the teacher in question try and find me later and make me explain why I 'wasnt in class'

			CD, because you asked for the specific procedure, this is my <span style="font-style: italic">personal preference</span> for &quot;tuning yourself out&quot;.
<br />

<br />
This works reasonably well if you have no shields up... if you do, you'll need to add a layer of &quot;programming&quot; to them that either reflects incoming glances or simply makes them transparent.  I am a very visual person so each of my shields has a strong image I associate with it, so I sometimes end up &quot;hedging&quot; myself in the shape of a bizarre dark-green egg (my labradorite stone) or a kind of foggy white ovoid... which obviously attracts more attention than my normal appearance!
<br />

<br />
Keep in mind that I am somewhat new to this myself, and I am being as thorough as possible.  You can really skip steps 2, 3, and 4 if you don't mind psionically sensitive individuals noticing you.  These are usually the people I'm hiding from (just for fun, teasing them on campus) so they are the more important steps for me.
<br />

<br />
The goal of this &quot;cloak&quot; is to make yourself indistinct by surrounding yourself with a fog, then vanishing, or in step 6, replacing your self-image with something that won't attract attention.
<br />

<br />
1.  <span style="font-weight: bold">&quot;Blanking&quot;</span> - Clear your mind (blank-mind meditation) to avoid telepathically triggering notice from people.  I find that if I'm thinking too much, I'll start pinging people by accident and attracting their attention, just by glancing at them.
<br />

<br />
2.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Find your bright spots</span> - Try and move your perception a few feet in front of your body, and look back at yourself.  What do you see?  You can look in a mirror to get familiar with your physical appearance.  If you see your &quot;chakra&quot; or different energy pools, great, even if you only see one or two glowing areas, these are where you will start.
<br />

<br />
3.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Hide your bright spots</span> - For each area you can see, or even just feel energy radiating from, move your concentration to the center of that point and &quot;feel&quot; the energy bundle inwards.  Reiki uses imagery of a closing flower, hiding the color of the petals in a disinteresting bud.  You might decide to wrap a blanket around your energy source; use anything you are comfortable with and feel like you can undo easily.
<br />

<br />
4.  <span style="font-weight: bold">&quot;Fogging&quot;</span> - Now that you have hid your low-level psionic appearance, move outwards and examine the thoughts you are projecting.  If you are practiced at blank-mind meditation, there shouldn't be too many thoughts flying out of your head.  Visualize a fog or some other translucent substance in a little cloud around your body, obscuring everything you put out and keeping anyone else from getting a clear &quot;look&quot; at you.  If you need to, you can still &quot;peek&quot; out through the fog, so you are not blinding yourself to constructs and energies, etc.
<br />

<br />
5.  <span style="font-weight: bold">&quot;Cloaking&quot;</span> - Once you have &quot;faded out&quot; psychically, concentrate on your image of your physical self.  Create it in your mind with as much detail as you can.  Standing in front of a mirror can help for the first few tries, but you should eventually be familiar enough to have a good image of yourself just by concentrating.  Once you have your self-image, slowly visualize it fading away.  Put it on a plain white background, and start &quot;looking&quot; through it in your head.  Each of the features of your appearance you can think of, watch slowly get hazy and indistinct, until you've made your entire appearance fade into the background.*
<br />

<br />
6.  <span style="font-weight: bold">&quot;Hedging&quot;</span> - If you have trouble allowing your mental self get fuzzy and fade away, you can use an alternate style shield that replaces your image with something else.  There are are an unlimited number of methods for &quot;cloaking&quot; or &quot;hedging&quot; and annie has already explained a few in her <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html128" target="_blank" class="postlink">seminar</a>.  I'll reiterate her method here.  Visualize your image replaced by something entirely disinteresting, and try to project only the thought &quot;Don?t notice me. I am a hedge. I am a hedge. Don?t notice me.&quot;  She explains that this also involves a degree of telepathic suggestion, so if you don't have much luck, I'd recommend practicing sending focused thoughts.
<br />

<br />
7.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Adaptation</span> - Obviously desert covert-ops gear is probably going to get you noticed inside an airport in Canada.  I have found that the key to maintaining an effective anti-appearance is by choosing an image of an inanimate object that matches your surroundings.  For example, a blue or black backpack might be a great image for hiding in school.  If you're making your way through a crowded airport, visualize yourself as one of those electric handicap-cars.  Add in the airport logo on the side, the whirring noise, and even concentrate on the funny sound of their horn... it's fun making people get out of your way.
<br />

<br />
*  I've found it to work better if I use the scene I plan to hide in as the background, and concentrate every few minutes on &quot;not being there&quot; as I walk around.  You can sit in your bedroom and visualize an occupied room in the house, then visualize walking into the room and concentrate on not attracting attention.  Once you feel comfortable with your visualization of it, repeat it and actually walk into the room.  Sit down next to your friend and say hello, and enjoy their reaction when they finally notice you!
<br />

<br />
Again, I apologize for writing up such huge replies.  Keep in mind that I am only offering suggestions from my limited personal experience and the tips Annie and other authors have offered on PsiPog.
<br />

<br />
Happy hiding, and be careful not to get stepped on while you're invisible.  It's actually kind of annoying...

			Hmmm... Is it just me or do I keep coming under interesting coincidences of doing things without thinking then later realizing what I did? I sneak up on people all the time. I do it on accident, although I'm a very chatty person, and I usually come up to them and talk, and sometimes startle them. I'm very quiet, due to being lithe, and knowing how to be silent. This is all very interesting, and I may use it more conciously in the future for some shits and giggles.
<br />

<br />
I can see how it would work though, when in a bad mood, I practically exude &quot;stay away from me&quot; and people do. I'm not much of a loner, but in a bad mood, it can seem that way.

			I have a weak natural cloaking shield... I strengthen it whenever I get sick of dealing with people (which happens pretty frequently). It does help. It's not a matter of becoming invisible... more that people just don't notice. It's like when you're staring past someone, and just don't register that they're there.
<br />

<br />
Has anyone else found that it's very difficult to keep up a cloaking shield with a busy mind? I've found that the quieter my mind, the more effective it is.

			I think that Theman01's idea could work. You would just have to program the shield to give you a confident, attractive presence. It would be the anti-cloaking shield, one specifically designed to get you noticed. I might have to try it.

Shields work on perceptions rather than physical. You become invisible because you block people's ability to see you or recognise you. 
<br />

<br />
You are still there under your shield, sunlight still warms your skin and the wind will still blow your hair around.
<br />

<br />
At least that is my take on it.
