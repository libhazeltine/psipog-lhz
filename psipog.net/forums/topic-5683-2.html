Also I have a question about the heats from your hand thing. Why can I control which way my wheel goes if it is heat from hands? My hands stay in the same place and somehow I can control which direction it goes. When I try not to move it with my hands around it, it never moves.

That sounds good. I just see loads of videos where its spinning one way and people always move there hands to get it to spin.
<br />
I wouldnt be hear if i really didnt believe it was possible and just wanted to make fun of people here and prove your all fake.
<br />
I just wanted you to help me prove its real.
<br />
As i said, its very hard believing something thats not scientifically proven and that i havnt seen done in real life before.

			I'm well over 20. not that age really is a true gauge of desire to lie.  But if it helps you to feel more secure in the belief it's real so be it.  To be honest in most communities age is usually a better gauge of type of reaction your likely to get.  As you can see, sometimes the young don't have the patients &quot;noobs&quot; like you and me might like.  They tend (though it's certainly not universal) to think that because they've answered 50 people already the 51st person doesn't need the same answer.  Also, they seem to think everyone has hours of spare time to read though message boards.  Again, it's not universal.  Sometimes us noobs have to put up with a lot of hash reaction when they get defensive too.  How old are <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span></span> btw?
<br />

<br />
That said, the heat of your hand isn't high enough to move a psiwheel.  Most likely your hand is near the wheel rather than under it.  Heat goes up rather than sideways, so again, even if your hand could get that hot it's not going to affect the wheel unless you have the wheel sitting on your palm.  The only effect your hand MIGHT have on the wheel is static electric.  If you bring your hand close and one of the points of your wheel moves toward your finger and follows that finger, I would find the closest metal object and touch it.  If it continues to follow afterward then your sub-c is doing it because you have discharged any charge you might have.
<br />

<br />
I like the videos but they tend to keep the camera only showing the wheel and not their nose or mouth.  If the videos were fake it's more likely they were exhaling on the wheel.  There are however many videos that clearly show the person's face and their attempt to ensure they are not creating any air current which would effect the result.
<br />

<br />
I'm guessing, but I think you can give yourself a pat on the back.  You have gotten results.  My psiwheels will spin when I look at them.  I got my brother to sit and watch the wheel when I left the room.  According to him it didn't move even a bit during the five minutes I was gone, but seconds after I set eyes on it again it started to slowly spin.  You may not have been trying consciously but your sub-c was well aware of what you wanted it to do and it's that part of your mind that turned the wheel.  I personally can't get my psiwheel to turn under glass.  My theory right now is that my mind is trying to move the glass rather than the psiwheel.
<br />

<br />
I would suggest that you try slowly taking your hand away in order to get your mind to move it without your hand being there.  According to some caffine enhances psi, maybe try after you've have a few cups.  Unless you are accidently breathing on it I think I have clearly proved you have been successful.

			Hi Ivan. Im 19 years old.
<br />
If you say the wheel didnt move the 5 mins your brother just watched it and you got it to move without putting your hands around it, then it sound like the tk worked.
<br />

<br />
The only thing that really made me wonder if tk was real is when i saw people on this forum talking about how they phased through stuff.
<br />
I am quite open minded and i do believe that there is a lot of things we can do that that we dont know about.
<br />
There are many things that we dont understand yet. I think tk and all the other things like reading minds or scanning as i've seen it been called is definatly possible.

			Many people here may be older than 18 but I think they're just doing like me, ignore most post here due to lack of time and patience to convince 13 year olds. FYI, I'm 25 myself.

<br />
You are correct. Maybe the glass you are using is too small or isn't clear glass. Try something big that you can see clear throw it and in a form you can focus and forget the glass is there in the first place. That should work. Many I feel can't move some objects because of focus, It seems the way you position yourself to the object has effect. To make it more clear, do you think you could move the wheel with yourself backwards? Hmm...
<br />
For starters, sit yourself right at it, and make the place clear of things that could make you distracted, make sure to put your attention in the object you want to move, not in the desk, for example.
<br />
But that's only a problem because almost all here start TK looking to the object. Looking is not a requisite, I heard of blind people learning TK with someone telling then what was happing to the weel so they could have some feedback. After sometime, I think they wouldn't need that as weel, since they would start feelling the connection with the object.

Yeah, a lot of this stuff is hard to grasp.  That's why you need to start out slow.  If you are interested in psi-related things, then just start off by doing what you do think is real.  Once you get that skill, you can look at yourself and say &quot;wow, I actually did that!&quot; which gives you a huge boost in confidence and allows you to be more open on other things (in your case, phasing).

Plus: heat is energy, and energy doesn't carrie matter along with it. (sea waves don't carrie you along with it. it comes, and passes by you. heat don't make you move, cause if it did, you would feel heavier while on the sun than out of it, and so on)
<br />

and yeah dude, too many stupid people wasting their time with lies.

i'm sure that there is no limit to stupidity, but THIS would be ridiculous.

It took me about a week of meditation and practice to get it to move just a little.

I don't use my hands.  In fact, I'm getting good enough to move it from across the room.  But I can't do it under glass <span style="font-style: italic">quite</span> yet...

If you read between my bragging (yes, I'm proud of what I've been able to do <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />), then hopefully this'll help convince you that not everyone here are 12 years olds that are obsessed with Dragon Ball or whatever.

			I'm 19. It seems as if I've been blessed with a very open mind. So I think the opposite many do. It's possible before it's disproven. You need to go beyond thinking you can do it and 'know' for a fact you can. Read up on two or three of the articles on TK, and also read the one on how to expand your awareness. You need to expand your awareness and psi to intertwine with the object. That is the connection. That is what's been working for me, anyways. Visualization helps, but I visualize the object already moving, which seems to work the best for me.
<br />
      Did you know that scientists have not been able to pinpoint where our consious minds are in the brain? I'm just saying that there are so many un-answered questions, and most of them stay unanswered because of dis-belief. There are ridiculous amounts of things we do not know. We only use about 10-15% of our brains. We also only use about 10% of our muscles power. When tk is performed, you start learning how to utilize those parts of the brain that have never been exercised. The ability is there, and always has been. maybe you should try psi-balls. Not until I started practicing psi-balls was I a true believer. It'll also help you to move psi and your awareness, which helps greatly when dealing with tk and the like. I hope this helps you on the road to discovery, and unlocking the hidden potentials of the mind.

			Keep in mind that a large amount of the members here are very young, ranging from as low as 8. While I won't say that they bluntly lie, I think younger people get frustrated easier and thus give up faster, so I believe a lot of exaggeration happens on their part to keep themselves motivated until they get more solid results. A friend of mine told me while she dislikes the supernatural for her own reasons, she believes that an existence can be found in anything so long as someone believes in it, and I think that was very wise of her. In short, if results aren't happening as fast as you would like, keep trying, the subject was not created to suit your needs. Read the works of the more experienced and follow suit until you start to make progress of your own.

			The only reason that people have no results is because of a mental block. You have to have 100% certainty knowing that you can do this. If this isn't the case, then yeah, maybe you just weren't meant for this field of psionics. Try something else, like empathy, remote viewing, or telepathy. Still, keep on trying.... sometimes it really does take that long of practicing everyday.

			WOW trytryagain. 2 years with no result. That sucks, BUT I admire your determination and perserverence. Mabye PK isn't for you, but with determination like that your bound to succeed in something. RV, telepathy..something. Keep going don't give up
<br />

<br />
I'm 20 and spun my wheel 1st day, 1st try. (was like 17 when I 1st tried it, then stopped PK for like a year)..I now quit the psi wheel when I got pretty good so not to get stuck on it and can ALMOST roll things now. I get a lot of shaking, sometimes half a roll..but this stuff is obviously real. Otherwise we'd have about 30000 people who are just fooling themselves  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />
