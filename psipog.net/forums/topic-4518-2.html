About China and Russia.. perhaps they're still at it? Who knows?

Either way, that should concern each country's government and their own institutions, not us anyway. We're no one to tell them what to do.

As I've always said, just try and see what happens.

			&quot;I see where you're coming from, but you must remember that there will always be people like that in the world, no matter what.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
true, but they are very common now, although their numbers are dwindling, of course, it would probably help if most religions didn't teach that you can't return after leaving the religion, then they'd be dwindling even faster.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Take, for example the weirdos who hold nazi-esque Harry Potter book bonfires. They would be most certainly afraid of something like psi.&quot;
<br />

<br />
yeah, those people are called fundies, or fundamentalists.
<br />

<br />
&quot;True, but I prefer just to laugh at them.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
then you'll like <a href="http://landoverbaptist.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink">this</a>
<br />

<br />
and yes, making fun of them is nice, but Remember their numbers are great.

			Geez, they're so dumb!

It's as though they lived in middle age! <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

Wonder how they've got online without being afraid of it? Maybe took it as a tool by which they could find mislead souls? <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

<br />
That made me remember, I've read an article in &quot;QUO&quot; (magazine) that they've invented kosher cellphones, they are suposed to block evil numbers (porn and hotlines), they cannot send or recieve multimedia or even written messages! Weird, uh?
<br />

<br />
One more proof that world is not THAT prepared. I mean, we're not hiding underground or anything but people just don't want to know. Maybe that's why it's called &quot;psipog&quot; (Psychic Students In PURSUIT Of Guidance), we searched for it, didn't we?

			I KNOW it's a parody! Still, they all seem to be in middle age. And they are not the only ones.

<br />
About the cellphone thing... I know it IS for Orthodox Jews, I have no idea if it's a device, but the point is... there is irony in the fact.
<br />

<br />
And finally... why would we want to force people? What's the point anyway? If you're so confident, why don't YOU shove it down their throats? <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> We're actually not forced to, and will never be forced to do such a thing.

			There is a very simple reason this subject is not widely accepted: it's fairly useless. Everyone's heard of it here and there but no one knows for sure. I've heard remote viewing was studied officially by a government to be used for intelligence gathering in military situations, other than that what good is it? So you can move a piece of paper on a pin, so you can make a pencil roll, so you can soften very light metal using only your mind, what good is that to society? It's a neat trick to show off to friends and family but once that novelty has worn off no one will care. Don't say the world isn't ready for it, you are you and can only speak for you and no one but you, it's more that it doesn't benefit the progress of humanity as a whole until you have enough knowledge on the subject to do something useful with it. Who in their right mind would waste money or time training themselves in something with no foreseeable value, with telepathy being the exception for obvious reasons.
