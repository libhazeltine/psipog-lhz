			yeah sounds hot. clairboyancy seems like the obvious explanation and most probable as well but what came to mind was psychic suggestions for some reason.
<br />
Think its possible that you might think about the show because you want to see it, thus you will whoever is in charge of the channel to air that episode? Dunno. Just thinking out loud over here lol

			I've had a few experiences like that myself, and they're getting more common (signs I'm getting better?  Yays!)
<br />

<br />
One thing I found awesome was the other day I was at work and my manager was having us sign birthday cards for a couple coworkers.  I have only been working there a short while so I don't know them very well, but on the one to my Irish coworker I wrote &quot;Don't drink too much beer &lt;3&quot;.  Later, when I asked him what he was doing for his birthday, he replied &quot;drinking lots of beer!&quot;  This was before he read the card.
<br />

<br />
Coincidence?  Psychic awesomeness?  The logical comment considering he's Irish?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> LOL, I don't know, but it was pretty cool.

			Hi
<br />
Happens to me sometimes as well, not on T.V , radio but some general stuff.
<br />
But the thing is I don't think of the things that will happen it's like my sub-c is telling me or something.

			I'd imagine the times that you say the line from the TV show and you see that TV show later that day are dwarfed by the times you said a line from a TV show and it WASN'T on the TV later that night.
