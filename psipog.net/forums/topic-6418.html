			I think it is theoretically possible to become invisible, though it would take more skill than any of us have, and lots of energy. You would either have to make light pass through you or bend around you. 
<br />

<br />
If it were to pass through you, what would stop other things from passing through, like air? And if air is passing through, then logically there's gonna be some passing through when you go visible again. I'm no doctor, but air bubbles inside you all over your body sounds painful and fatal.
<br />

<br />
If it were to bend around you, then you would need an huge amount of skill in PK. The gravity of our planet doesn't bend light, and it holds everything on the planet. If you've got that much skill in PK, do you really need to be invisible?

			That statement just pinged my interest- does every planet's gravity field create a distortion effect similar to the bending of light when looking into water? I mean, if black hole theories were true, wouldn't this be as well?

			Oh yeah, and I should remind you that you'd be blind if you were invisible, because your eyes need to absorb light to see.
<br />

<br />
To get past that obstical, you'd have to absorb the light and replicate it, which would make things a whole lot harder.
<br />

<br />
You'd probably have to train hard for most (if not all) of your lifetime to get true invisibility, so it's impractical. If you want to be invisible to everything, use illusions with TP (cloaking shield), and you'd probably have to disable the cameras using PK.

			Where does everybody get these ideas that you have to do long lifetimes of training to get something as small as invisibility. I've known people to teleport to reach destinations and others who change their fist into round balls and people who can run at 20 mph (clocked at that speed). It's not too difficult to attain a good concentration level. The secret is not to hold on to energy but rather to keep a constant flow.

			Dude, Psi takes a long time to master, just think about it, to attain true invisibility, you'd have to make light go through you or around you, as said by a post above. 
<br />

<br />
To make light go through you, you'd have to change the chemical makeup of your body to allow it to pass light through it, and humanity doesn't quite know how the brain works, what if when changing your body, you end up messing up an essential part of the brain? You're toast! But it's not just the brain, I'm no biology expert but I'm sure that there are some other body parts that couldn't stand that kind of change.
<br />

<br />
So that method is pretty dangerous, what about the other one? Making light bend around you, you'd have to use PK. Now, light photons are very small, so it shouldn't be that hard to move them, except there are billions, trillions of them everywhere, and they move at lightspeed, so it'd be pretty damn hard to make every single light photon come close to you, move around you, go in the direction it was going before, then release, and it's all happening more than a billion times, in less than 0.000001 seconds, and in all directions.
<br />

<br />
Yeah, true invisibility isn't that easy.

			Yeah but you don't have to imagine all that. Too many complications make this one big visualization. Can't you just imagine being invisible and leave at that? If you start to believe that you can toast your brain and that you have to move so many light photons it's just too complicated. I say you imagine all things visual bending around you and you travel around in an invisible pocket of existence. When you move, you try to push through all the visual info while you're completely separate from the visual world. It might work.

			I think it's impossible to be truely invisible using Psi, perhaps when you visualize yourself becoming invisible, your sub-c finds the mind illusion trick, then uses it. It's not true invisibility, but it's still invisibility.
<br />

<br />
But then again, we don't know everything about psi/reality, so there is a chance that it's possible, but it sure as hell ain't easy!

The Earth bends light with its gravity, the Sun does, everything does. It's just a matter of magnitude. Most things' bending of light is negligible, because they are not heavy enough to noticeably bend it.

			Do we seriously have to BEND LIGHT to become invisible? If you want -true- invisibility, sure, I guess. However, given some articles on telepathy--it's possible to induce hallucinations upon other people, right? Why can't you just make a kind of cloaking shield that's -extremely- powerful, and uses really strong TP to make people not even see you (inducing a hallucination of sorts)? At the same time, it'd be interesting to see how someone percieves such a thing. Can they see through the person to something behind? How would it work? Can we effectively create a sort of X-Ray vision that way? Invisibility? I dunno. Of course, the user couldn't do anything drastic.. unless they were really, REALLY good at TP.

			Exactly. Actually, a few of the shielding articles talk about cloaking shields. Just program a shield to project whatever you want to cloak yourself as (a bush, part of a wall, open space, etc...). When other people see you, they'll pick up on what your shield is projecting, and ignore you (if you did everything correctly). Just remember...
<br />

Cloaking = easy

Actual Invisibility = near-impossible
