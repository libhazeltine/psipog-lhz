			Ever since I was 8 I've been running on walls, jumping 10 foot drops, jumping over fences, climbing walls.  It's so much fun!  The only thing I'm not so good at is flips and rolls.  Where I live there doesn't seem to be anywhere to do it. I live in a city, but all the buildings are the same, and aside from running on walls there's very little creative stuff I can do.  I want a climbing frame like the one at the start of that video!  Get me an abandoned parking lot! <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Parkour is really fun! You should try it. In fact i just got back from a Parkour meet a few hours ago. 
<br />

<br />
Parkour was invented by David Belle using techniques his father learned in the army. David Belle lives in France. There are many Parkour networks and if you live near a large city there may be a group there. The whole point of Parkour is to get from one point to the other in the fastest, most efficient way possible. If you can't find a group, you don't need to practice it with others or even in the city! There are a whole crapload of tutorials out there and you don't need to practice on concrete and steel; instead, try the forest. Parkour is not to be confused with 'free running' or 'freestylePK' where there is added &quot;flair&quot; such as flips and inefficient vaults. It is still cool, but not truly Parkour. The most important thing if you are interested is to get out there and train, be intelligent about it, and have fun <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Well, you should be in ok shape, i.e. not overweight. But if you are you can always do some physical exercise to get back in shape. If you can jog for about 5 min then you should be good to start Parkour. The great thing about Parkour is that it is a great workout and is still really fun!

			Ok, two things. One, whoever this dumb idiot is, He almost deserved that injury for even attempting that jump. Secondly, When starting Parkour, nobody (in their right minds) ever attempts stuff like that. I even doubt that David Belle, the founder of Parkour would attempt that jump. And if he did, he has over ten years of training under his belt and he would know for sure if he could do it before he even attempted it. In fact, most (if not all) Parkour is based on the ground doing vaults over obstacles, going over walls, and dropping from a max of 10-15 feet (and rolling afterwards). If I were teaching the fundamentals of Parkour you would first be doing exercises to improve your strength, fitness, endurance, and balance, drilling vaults, tic tacs, cats and rolls until you were good enough to do more complex stuff. If you do Parkour, even drills it should be fun, and you should not be worrying about killing yourself if you screw up. So don't let this idiot deter you, go practice Parkour, get into shape and have fun <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
EDIT: By the way, the guy wasn't even doing Parkour. He was probably _standing_ there and getting _egged on by his friends_ to do the jump. Parkour is about improving _yourself_ and _flowing_ from one point to another. And it probably would have been faster to hang off the side of the building,  drop, roll, wall run up the wall climb up and go over (or just go around) <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

ya we know it's not parkour, but he seems like a parkour kinda guy. I know Dave might not be willing to attempt this kinda jump, but that doesn't mean everyone else isn't hence the stupid guy that just fell. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
