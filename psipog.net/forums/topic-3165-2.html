			Well, if you figure, that plane and our plane probably have different ideas of what is acceptable in society, or may not even have society at all, same goes for intent (good, evil) and corruption. Good and evil are technically made from us on this plane and worked it's way into our society as what is 'right' is good, and what is 'bad' is evil. I'm saying that good and evil might not exist in that plane. But again, just a theory. Remember that when thinking on topics of something so unknown, you will have to start from scratch when you think about what makes up the other planes. Just a thought.

			I must confess I consider ghosts to be a concept yet I have encountered that concept quite recently, intensely. I don?t know what was going on but a sense of &quot;contact&quot; would always have described it best. In any case, what helped me when I lived at that place was to be open to contact. I was at points where a feeling of the ghost sitting down at my beside would encouter me in a quite obvious sense. Also, I had been driven out of this flat before I moved in by this same encounter. The problem seemed to be that my mind had no clear defining concept of ghosts whatsoever so naturally I was starting to freak out barely able to control me. However, be open and see what ever &quot;it&quot; is trying to tell you and it will be okay. I had just one encounter like this in my life so that?s all I can tell you. Be open, do not judge images or thoughts, let it go through, and it won?t bother you. When this encounters you, it is not -you- seeing or feeling, it is percieving, and won?t do you any harm.

There was NO case of possession or bad things while the experiences occured, none of the thousands obers even gotten possessed. Possession is impossible because you are tied to your body until death. The only danger is fear itself, if you get too terrified, it might keep you from doing obe again.  But of course if you have a heart disease or malfunction or whatever, you might die of fright.. but this is all. And to speak about the ghosts, they might react in any way but they can't really hurt you</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

hmmmm....i don't know if i would necessarily use this explanation to urge the point of possession is impossible.
<br />

<br />
in order to possess someone all you need to do is be good at telepathy and those related abilities. i mean, since that is my concentration i can 'possess' someone to a certain level. (example, i can make them believe they feel a certain way about something) that is possession on a certain level. 
<br />

<br />
i don't in anyway undermine monroe or his research in a demeaning way, but i think those experiments might be incomplete. i'm trying to think of a way to explain this but im having some difficulty. let's try this way, i think that if monroe wanted results saying that possession is possible in a OBE, then the demon or whoever was doing the possessing would have had to know of the exact time in which the experiments were taking place and then possess the subject in that timeframe. the chances of someone capable of possessing others to happen try and possess their bodies at that time is kind of low...so that's why i think that maybe the research is incomplete. 
<br />

<br />
but, if he did have a possesser and possessee involved in the experiment and it wasn't possible, then maybe i would take the results a little more seriously, depending on circumstances, etc.
