Practice takes time you know, dont expect anyone to be able to project blue flames from their hands that can boil the sea, Dragon Ball Z style within minutes of trying. It really annoys me when people want proof of Psi, when they cant be assed to do it themselves, why should i put huge amounts of effort and time into doing something, just for it to be blown down by a bunch of people who have no experience in the manipulation of Psi at all. Im angry because i went to the doctors about my stomach being painful, as many of you know ive got IBS, well, its not IBS, its colon cancer.
<br />

<br />
But now ive had my rant, i welcome skepticism, but i do not welcome assholes, before you write a skeptical comment, ask yourself, 'am i an asshole?'

There's no point becoming angry just because people ask for proofs.
<br />
I'm ready to believe anything provided there's some evidence.
<br />
You say practice takes time and means huge effort and everything, I can perfectly understand that; that even sounds logic to me. But compared to that, what effort is it to take a camera and record what you're trying to achieve... not much I'd say..
<br />
I don't think anyone wants to see you throw fireballs like StreetFighter, we'd be happy to see you grow progressively
<br />

<br />
ps: not I'm not an asshole, I'm asking myself that question several times
<br />
ps2: sorry to hear about your health. Wish you the best
<br />

<br />
cheers

			I see what you're saying, and my asshole comment wasnt directed at anyone inparticular, asshole was the wrong word to use. I wasnt angry because of the skeptics here, i was just angry at the fact that some skeptics have to be completely one sided, closed minded and terribly foul mouthed. I would welcome skepticism if it didnt involve the mentality of 'i am right, everyone else is wrong'. On the contrary, i completely welcome skepticism like yours, larryleisure.
<br />
As i said in this thread, or a different thread, i will film myself practicing Pyrokinesis just as soon as i have something completely outstanding to show, I.E, igniting a newspaper, you've all seen the usual 'make flame bigger, make flame shorter, make flame wider....' and most of you have seen the extinguishing of flames using paranormal means. But not many of you have seen something even more out of the ordinary than what is already being practiced here, and i wish to be the one to bring it to you.
<br />
Larryleisure, thank you for your concern, my radiotherapy appointment is on Thursday.

			well, nifty vid ill say that. but yeah, a candle would be a good idea, matches tend to have too many variables. ive practiced with a candle for a bit but havent got much more than lengnthing the flame a bit....oh i may want to discribe all the variables that could have effected it at that time so kief doesnt flip out.
<br />

<br />
and i must say, reading throughout this whole thread ive nearly wet myself from laughing. that kief guy should take up stand-up. i mean really, if you have nothing better to do than watch a video created in a few miniutes to satisfy a few people and then spend that much time looking at every flipping variable and then bashing the creator.
<br />
there are plenty better things to do than flame a quick video. perhaps learn common courtesy? if you need help:

<br />

<br />
heh that aside, try out a candle, they seem to be alot less prone to other things effecting them. and do what i do, pull your shirt up over your mouth and nose to prevent breathing on it.
<br />

<br />
also, i read your post about colon cancer...are you recieving treatment? best wishes for that to clear up.
