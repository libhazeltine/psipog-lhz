<br />

<br />
I?ve been getting some PM?s lately asking my technique for moving objects. I?ll give you the way I first started out (I skip some of these steps now, however). This is what I do/did, as follows:
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
Step One:</span>
<br />
Enter a Trance-like-state
<br />
I used to stare off into space. When I felt my mind was relaxed enough, I would begin.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Step Two:</span>
<br />
BE the object
<br />
Put your awareness into the object. BE the object. Feel out what it?s like. Is it a pencil? How does it smell? How does the wood feel? Look through the pencils ?eyes?.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Step Three:</span>
<br />
MOVE IT!
<br />
Move the pencil just as you would your own muscle, since you ARE the pencil. Your body should start shaking, if you haven?t put your ?brain? into the object enough. When this happens feel the object out more and try to relax the spasms, it might feel numbing. If you do this right you should have the object spasm.
<br />

<br />
My article is very similar to NI?s. Coincidentally we both started with this technique around the same time, or so it would appear from his article. We?re a very visual society. IF we do evolve we will probably gain bigger eyes (just my theory). I think we need to learn to FEEL more. For me that is the trick to telekinesis.
<br />

			Nice technique. It makes enough sense for me to work with, unlike some of the techniques I've seen. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

So do you actually 'see' out of the objects eyes, or imagine you do?

			If your consciousness / 'awareness' / whatever, is strongly enough with the object - I don't see why a 'from the objects point of view' sight couldn't come about. 
<br />

<br />
Granted, you're not telepathicaly recieving something the object sees or anything that far out. Just like clairvoyance, but as if you were the object.
<br />

<br />
Last time I checked someone on the psi-scape forums sometimes purportedly gets a black and white movie-image as if he's seeing from the psi-wheels 'point of view', and apparently it works for him.

			Actually, your probably right, I don't try to feel the object enough. I attempt to clear my mind(which is the first difficulty), and then go straight to trying to move it, and I oftentimes shake, and my vision blurrs too.

			When I try this technique, as soon as I get to step two I start twitching very violentley, but as soon as I get to step three the twitching stops.
<br />
(Also, I find that step two works better for me if I just imagine the taste of the object. Then again I'm known for chewing my pen so much that it'll snap in half so maybe the taste thing is just me.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />  )

<br />
If this was in reply to the psiball question I may have an answer.  I used to make a construct without shelling it so that I'd have something I could easily concentrate on while trying to move the object.  It works for me personally so that I don't trance out deeper and get nothing done.  Usually I make a very small construct that goes wherever I'm focusing my sight on.
<br />

<br />
The alternative for me is that I would quite possibly not be able to focus after longer periods and would fall asleep or trance deeper.
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure if anyone else uses a &quot;focus construct&quot; such as this, but it was an idea I got from my subconscious and seems to work for me *shrugs*.
