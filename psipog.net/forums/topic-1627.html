			As noted in my other post, &quot;Shaping Flares?&quot; I am still going at my newest construct project, PsiFang. This is the first of my PsiPet attempts and it is mostly going to be parlor pet, a basis and a bit to just amuse myself since if I can pull off shaping a flare i'd enjoy making the little thing bounce around the room.
<br />

<br />
Alrighty now then onto the main part, as i've been told Shaping Flares is no easy feat at all, let alone making them for most. Though if your daring to dream why not dream big, eh? This topic I want to be as a sort of main page for me asking for advice or other things concerning this project, I do this so I dont swamp the forums with many topics on one subject, keep everything a bit more organized.
<br />

<br />
Anyways what help could you give if you didnt know the project? So let me detail it out.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
(If you wish to help me, please read this question first before reading the project details and try out the scan. This is to not cause AOL as Sean said.)
<br />
_________________________
<br />
1) The first request I have is can someone scan around me to verify if Wolfy here is intact and hasnt fallen apart under my underskilled programming.

<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Project PsiFang:</span></span>
<br />
Purpose: To make a self-sustaining flared construct in the shape of a wolf.
<br />

<br />
Programmed:
<br />
<ul>To gather energy to maintain shell.
<br />
To gather energy to maintain, strengthen, and self flare.
<br />
To be cold and shocking.</ul>
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
First of which I have made the first official PsiFang, the other PsiFangs I have destroyed and reabosrbed in effort to practice a bit before I made the final decision. Before I kept changing its program to do other things, but I have to do it by steps and im already taking a large leap, but hey its good practice overall.

			Perhaps it would be a better idea to not tell a psion about the project, THEN ask for him/her to scan around you, and see if they notice anything.  Reading this project, and scanning immediately afterwards, might produce some AOL.
<br />

<br />
If someone who doesn't know about the project scans and describes something that could be specific enough to interpret it as a wolf, then you are probably on a good path.

			A little update on my Winter Wolfy of energy. Well the pup is up and running, ran some tests with KiethD on the Psipet and he followed his programming... That being to use nearby Psi Sources (excluding myself) as a power source to suck in and sustain itself. Well Keithd had sent in some probes to scan the wolf and it kept, well, eating them, I think thats a more suitable term given its a wolf psipet. I later programmed it to not absorb constructs, but it seems the wolf either didnt get the message or is pretty picky given its personality I gave it. It wont eat certain constructs, but it will eat weaker ones and ones that arent put together well.
<br />

<br />
So wolfy is doing well. If anyone cares to scan for him and sends a probe I suggest you cloak it, the wolf didnt register on finding the hidden probe Keithd sent, even after I tried to program a sort of &quot;upgraded awareness&quot;.

Psidemon it's a bit uncontrollable right now because every demon that I fashion is either untrustworthy or just goes and tries to posses me I hope to get a controllable one by 666 to be part of a super army

The apocalypse. I think PsyKillerX is saying he wants a minion.

Flared PsiPet? I think that is an extremely good idea. Going to start about now. Nice ideas, I'm sure they're great.

			Sorry to be state the obvious but, PsyKillerX, aren't demons a religious belief????  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> Last time I checked, you weren't supposed to talk about religion. I am going to say this as nice as I possibly can; READ THE DAMN RULES BEFORE POSTING! <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" /> I really don't think its that hard. Now then, I appologize for being an asshole, but seriously read the rules. It's just that simple.

			Demons are religious of course, but while we can't say if they exist or not, I'm sure we can say we are making psipets in the shape of a demon. Even if they don't exist we all saw demons in games and movies. In my opinion it's a grey area. But of course this was abit of fluff talk... I mean, a super army and 666... PsiKillerX should have kept this to himself and it's against the rules.. To bring back the topic, are you able to see the wolf with only your eyes? Are other people able to see it? I'd love to be able to do this <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Im planning on making a psipet in the near future. But im using a different method where i keep the blob of psi somewhere for about a couple of weeks until it becomes really strong (of course it will be using several sources to constantly gain energy) and then i can release it and shape it. Effectively this is kind of &quot;growing&quot; a construct if you will. By then it should have enough energy to be able to be programmed nice and also maybe flare a lot easier too. The cool thing about this is that you can have about 10 of these all &quot;growing&quot; at the same time and worry about the shaping afterwards. This probably sounds very ambitious but im going to try and aim for a flare so vivid that it can be seen sort of vagly (sp?) by anyone, sort of ghost-like. Although it could take years for that to be acomplished.

			Well, I havent tried to Auric View PsiFang yet, sort of curious now as to why I didn't think that, but given its completely Psi i'd probably need to induce a trance-meditative Auric View so I can make for very certain. It has been scanned and verified from KiethD, not sure if I posted that above or not, its been a while and my laziness is stopping me from rereading all the posts.
<br />

<br />
Anyways i've been upkeeping him, but PsiFang is usually doing his own thing, mostly wandering like a normal wolf would, *sighs* It is a useful construct when its _around_.... Maybe I should program a proximity maximum for it...a PsiLeash if you will.

			This is pretty cool. I must admit, I thought it was a bit fluffy when I read the first post, but it was ShadowWolf, so I gave him/her the benefit of the doubt.
<br />

<br />
But then I realized how cool this is.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I would just make a Psi-Bodyguard, or something like that, that would serve both as a companion AND as backup, should anyone be dumb enough to mess with me and my friend-of-cool-looking-light-stuff.
<br />

<br />
But whatever, a wolf is just as cool. Imagine the looks on people's faces if you took that thing for a walk!
<br />

&quot;Helluva dog you got there! What breed is it?&quot;

&quot;Psionic.&quot;

			I have to admit, I've been lacking in my trainings on PsiBalls, I need to get back on bar with it if I ever wish to get a psiball flared let alone shape the flare. I can verify they are there, I just need to master the ever elusive and desired skill of Flaring.
<br />

<br />
PsiFang seems to be sustained still though, I &quot;feed&quot; and &quot;groom&quot; it every so often so it isnt destroyed under its own weakness. I have to begin &quot;overfeeding&quot; it with Psi so it can store enough energy to flare, also keep it &quot;groomed&quot; so it doesnt just blob out and that it will keep form.
<br />

<br />
A side note,
<br />

<br />
Feed I consider giving it Psi
<br />
Groom is mainting is shield and reinforcing its shape, also adding new layers if I have to.
