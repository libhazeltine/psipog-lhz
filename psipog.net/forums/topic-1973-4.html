			Well, the first time I felt tingling, some throbbing around the right side of my left hand, and then it felt heavy.      The 2nd time (which was about 5-10 minutes after this) I felt tingling, heavyness, throbbing, and it felt like my hands didnt want to get closer to eachother when i slowly tried to force them closer.
<br />

<br />
The third time which was about 5 minutes after the 2nd one I got tingling, pressure, slight coldness (Though that couldve been me breathing, but the coldness kinda stayed there until it was over.) well after I got the throbbing feeling I kind of took my hands apart slowly and they got really weak, and then as I was trying to make it denser I brought my hands close together and thats when I got extremely weak, my arms and hands were sort of shaking but not like a low blood sugar way. My heart was pounding aswell.
<br />

<br />
I guess it sort of felt like I was exercising for awhile. Anyway... I don't know if any of this is psi-ball related because I'm still a beginner. Its been about 2 hours and my energy has returned.    Is this normal? and did I create a psiball?
<br />

<br />
This is how I do it: First I sit down indian style and close my eyes, i'll take a few deep breaths and then cup my hands close together, i'll then imagine a white ball of energy in my hands which is when I get the tingly feeling, then after about 10-20 seconds i'll visualize  a blue spiralling beam going around my arms and then shooting into the ball to make it bigger. After I get the heavy feeling i'll try to bring my hands apart and make it look dimmer but bigger, and then i'll bring my hands closer together and imagine it smaller and denser, usually when I do this I feel a slight weakness as if i've been holding a 20 pound weight for 10 minutes.   Am i doing it right? Tips are appreciated. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
And also, I think (but I am not sure) that the reason I get so weak so quick is because I'm out of shape. Don't know if this has anything to do with it though, that's just my guess.

			Ok this is my first time making a psi ball, day i found this site. Anyways i was trying to make a psi ball when i felt my hands getting warmer everytime my hands got closer, so i was wondering if this is a psi ball even tho i dont feel pressure or any tingling?

			Ok I have a question here.
<br />

<br />
Whenever I try making a psiball I just put my hands about 20 cm appart and in like 5 seconds I start feeling that magnetic thing that pushes my hands further appart if I try to join them.
<br />
All this happens even if I'm not visualizing the energy from any source coming to my hands so it's weird.
<br />

<br />
Well after that I try to make it denser just by visualizing energy coming from nowhere and it really works. I told my sister if she could feel it. She said just a little. My other sister just felt hot. A friend of mine asked me: what the hell are you doing?
<br />
I told him to feel the psiballs. he was like: what? just hot.
<br />

<br />
after that he put his cellphone between his hands with the backlight on and showed it to me.
<br />

<br />
I just realised that maybe everyone feels the same psiball in different ways.. could that be possible?
<br />

<br />
Like my sister felt the magnetic thing, my other sister felt it just hot and my friend saw it :S I haven't asked him if he saw something but oh well..

			I pool the energy into my stomach, and wait until it tingles. Then, as the tutorials say, I move it through my chest and into my arms, and out my hands. But, I somehow think it gets stuck at the chest, because I feel a little pressure on my sternum, and a very faint, but real feeling in my hands.
<br />
Did it still work, even very weakly?

			Yes i think that those were psi balls, especially if u felt warmth. First time i made one i didnt really feel a actual ball of heat but after practiced i felt heat. And i know for sure that its not a fake one or anything cause i was able to move my fingers and touch the ball and my fingers felt heat once it got into that exact spot where i imagined the ball. Anyways just practice and u will find out by yourself. Dont expect to see results rite away.

			Well i cant make it dense either, well just a little bit it gets denser after a while. Just practice more and u will get dense ones. Oh and if u want to make it dense just imagine energy still flowing through ur hands into the ball for 20 minutes and then u will get a really dense psiball. Good Luck.

			I'm new to this. Same results two times.
<br />
Today i was trying to make a psi ball...
<br />
I visualized an electric,white ball as always,growing and growing. After a while,i felt this classic &quot;magnetic-field thing&quot;. It felt like there was a force in my hands,pushing them further and further away from each other. (It's always like that for me. Happends automatically.) 
<br />
Like.. It was growing...
<br />
Could that possibly been a psi ball?
<br />
EDIT: I'm not really understanding the thing of making Psi balls denser. Could anyone describe?

			I'm not new to the the site (just forums). Well I have been doing psionics for about a year and I stopped (no reason) Now I'm trying to start gain and I realized I lost all my great progress with psiballs. So now I'm trying to make one again and I don't know if I made one. I get a sensation in my palms when thinking about the psi flowing in my arms (like when you move your hand fast in the back and forth and it feels like energy around your hand).I can feel energy like a two magnets are in my hand but I NEVER get heat in my palms like most people do, is this normal? Am I making one?
