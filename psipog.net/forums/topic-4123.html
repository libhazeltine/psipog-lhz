			I'm not sure what the irc channels are like I am still waiting for my 2 weeks to be up but I think it would be prettty awesome if there was a room where some of the higher up psions teach psi techniques to lower level psions.  I'm unsure what peebrains schedual is like as well and any of the other psions but if there was like a specific day of the week whewre some one taught I think that would be pretty cool.

			Teaching people in an online class chatting system is very ineffective.  We hold seminars every once in a while, but even those only help maybe 100 people.  In comparison, my psi ball article gets around 114 reads PER DAY.  After a month, the one article has been read 3420 times.  It's much more effective to post the majority of the information in the form of articles, and then help people when they have questions about the articles.
<br />

<br />
There are a bunch of other reasons online classes aren't a good idea.  We ran telepathy classes a while back, and with only 10 students, we had a lot of schedule conflicts, lazy students, lazy teachers, and bad results overall.  It's one of those thigns that sound great on paper, but actually DOING it is something else.

			but they are effective in giving individual attention to specific people and issues where your article is just in general.  Its a suggestion if it flys it flys if it doesnt use tk to make it lol j/k but yes I do see the issues involved. Just a thought I decided to post.

			Well what if we were to try classes again, but with a more selective student and teacher base. Pick people who WANT to teach and/or WANT to learn. People who are dedicated would show up. 
<br />

<br />
What if we also did it as a mentor program? One mentor for a certain amount of students and use the mentor as a private tutor teaching each of his students on an individual basis. This would at least minimize schedule difficulties.
<br />

<br />
Just some ideas.

			If you're thinking in terms of getting the most milage out of the information, you could always log the teaching sessions. I don't know about anybody else, but I like reading over logged seminars, because most of the time, my questions were asked by other people. They also ask other questions I wouldn't have thought of, and it's always interesting to read the answers. 
<br />

<br />
So I think that whatever we do, we should log it.

			Ya logging is a good idea. That's already done with seminars, but I think that if we do start private classes up, logging those would be a good idea too.
