			Quantim Mechanics states that when there is no observer of an object it literally doesn't exist, so what if you use your perception of an object to alter the reality of it? - Then it's easy to manipulate it; much like breaking down a program to it's code, and modifying it, rather than trying to tamper with the program while it's running, which is in most cases impossible.
<br />

<br />
So what if the only extraordinary thing your are doing with your mind is altering your perception of an object?
<br />

<br />
Any thoughts?

			When you look at light it changes from a wave to particles.  This means that instead of the particles being anywhere in the wave, simply perceiving places them at a specific position... Maybe I'll draw a diagram oneday.  But if everything is made of energy, (probably electro-magnetism of some kind) then everything is a wave, and the particles of an object can be - and are - in every possible position until you perceive it.

As far as we know, psi is a form of energy.  I guess your distance control will increase over time.

			Interesting post...

Often times I find myself in an altered peception when I begin to work with Psychokinesis. Almost as if I do not exist. I wrote about it some time ago in a blog of mine called the &quot;Universal Perspective&quot;... Where you are viewing the object in question from multiple perspectives outside your own. As if the universe was &quot;watching it&quot;. Kind of sounds like a bunch of spiritual poopy, but it was rather interesting.

			Ah, this ties in with something I have been pondering a while now. I saw a cartoon vid of an experiment done by scientists on particles. They fired them through a wall with holes in. I can't remember the details of it but when they surveyed it with cameras, the pattern on the wall that they hit at the end was different; the particles changed their path through the holes. I have been thinking...what if this is related to pk in any way? Think about the technique on forkyou.com. They talk about directing your attention somewhere else...then it suddenly bends.
<br />
The same could be said for pk. You have the intent of moving the object (this is when you would shout at the fork to bend) and then you don't think of anything. The intent is there but you are not thinking about the object, you are merely observing it. Then it moves. Bam! You start thinking about the object, and it stops. This could also explain &quot;beginners luck&quot;. They are so preocuppied that they are moving the object that they aren't thinking about it anymore. They are shocked and in bliss. This theory could also explain why psiwheels start to randomly spin out of the corner of your eye. You may have been practicing it earlier and then forgot about it. Then it stops as you look at it. 
<br />

<br />
It seems to me that this is all connected somehow due to the particle experiment. The conclusion of this is that matter behaves in an unnatural way when the intent is there but the thought waves are not.

			Don't think that was it. It was something different to that. The particles actually went through the holes, just made a different pattern on the wall. And it was reproducable.

			I see you guys are catching on. I'm not physicist, but the science of quantum mechanics is fairly familiar to me. Guys, bear with me here, as it gets extremely complicated. Wikipedia on these subjects if clarification is needed.
<br />

<br />
By way of the Uncertainty Principle as described by a Werner Heisenberg and later bolstered by the EPR Paradox, an electron cannot be described in natural and scientific ways to determine 100 percent both the exact location as well as the velocity and direction of the movement of an electron. Kudos Bob for pointing out wave-particle duality.
<br />

<br />
For example, if one was to take an electron microscope to determine the exact location of the electron, it suddenly becomes an impossibility to the observer to as well determine it's velocity and direction. The opposite is true as you learn the latter.
<br />

<br />
Jumping ahead, I assume that most of you guys are familiar with the function of an atom. Most people assume the model to be correct, with the orbiting layers of electrons following a distinct and path on the valence level and what not. This is untrue. Valence levels determine NOT where the electrons are, but rather the PROBABLE location of such electrons. Basically, because the nucleus of an oxygen atom says, electron, you are probably going to be here, then it is so. Quantum mechanics in a sense determines that electrons are not in fact in a set, determinable position in space, but rather in each and every location that can be conceived.
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/emachines/e11/86/bose.html#" target="_blank">http://www.fortunecity.com/emachines/e11/86/bose.html#</a>
<br />

<br />
Check that link out for further proof of the existence of such phenomenon. 
<br />

<br />
The nucleus of an atom, a molecule, is what we have all been taught throughout school. It is the building blocks of matter, of what we conceive of as reality. The electron, the supposed location of that electron, is the guidelines that tells our sensory input device, eyeballs, which in turn is relayed to the brain to put together all of the matter into forms in which we can relegate as reality. The energy that is coming from the sun, a lightbulb, your computer screen, it is electrons that are bouncing off the surface of these nuclei of atoms and the information is being processed in the amazing processing power that is our brain.
<br />

<br />
What you think of as a bird in the sky, is in fact not. Because our mind conceives that the, key word here, probable location of such protons, neutrons and electrons, then the average culmination of such information being processed in our mind, makes it so.
<br />

<br />
By the introduction of the string theory, multiple dimensions that is unseen to us(10 in all), causes a flow of this energy, Psi as some of you like to call it, which connects through each and every particle of matter in this universe. By theory, with enough power over the mind, not only can you move an object with your mind, you can transplant it to another location in this universe.
<br />

<br />
The connecting factor in all of this--Electrons. Our body, our conciousness is comprised of nothing different then what everthing else in this universe is made out of. Your flow of thoughts, and sub-concious thoughts, is nothing more then a flow of electrons between nerve receptors in the brain. This energy that we all sense is no special jedi powers, no special power over matter. It is electricity, electrons. It is simply the power in which every conscious human being, including Jesus Christ, has had power over for ages. It's just now it seems... We are all beginning so sense, and most importantly, Believe.
<br />

<br />
The universe, or rather universi if I may say so, is a rather phenomenal realm in which I believe we have only scratched at the surface of such power. And boy, for such a long, strange trip its been, who knows what is to come in the future? The word Apocalypse is Greek for revelation. Maybe the Apocalypse is not the destruction of mankind in which we know, but rather then coming of what has been destined this whole time for our expanding minds. Hell is not a place of demonic torture and destruction unforseen by man. Hell is in our backyard. Hell is the world of limitation that has set boundaries upon the souls, as well as minds, of the human race.
<br />

<br />
Then what is Heaven? I don't think I have to answer this. Many of us are already experiencing the oncoming of true ultimate bliss, Our Heaven, our world in which limitations are non-existant, a place where there are no boundaries, a place where the free spirit of the human mind is in it's true and ultimately, pure form.

<br />
Very nice post, I couldn't've explained it better myself - it really helped clarify what I've been pondering for years.
<br />

<br />
This would explain accurately how we can see auras, they are simply the electro-magnetic/static electric field surrounding matter, I believe our brain and eyes can see this as easily as any other radiation, but we have been conditioned to believe it isn't real, therefore it isn't real.
<br />

<br />
However I'm not too sure about PK, wouldn't we be able to split the molecular bonds of a psiwheel (X-Men 3)?  I think there's more to it:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_levitation" target="_blank" class="postlink">Electrostatic Levitation</a>, and also Photoelectric effect (thanks pepsiboy).  Basic concept, we could just be charging atoms, and making them atract/repel our charge - the &quot;psychic&quot; bit is controlling these fields.
<br />

<br />
p.s. Doing a presentation on the theory of everything for school, thanks Revelation.

			for some reason i have always known that atoms give off electrons when they dont NEED them. thus creating energy fields proportional to the number of atoms the object has. there are also experiments where they shoot radioactive particles thru walls (was this the experiment)  and the parts end up on the other side. well this is easily explained because radioactive atoms have a LOT more energy than those with lower atomic weight.... i can go on forever, but i'll stop here
