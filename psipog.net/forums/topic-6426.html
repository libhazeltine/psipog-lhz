			Well, well.
<br />

<br />
My interest is piqued.
<br />

<br />
In the video's description: &quot;Please note: This video is for entertainment purposes only. It is... in fact... only an illusion.&quot; - what does this mean?
<br />

<br />
It gets better - much better, in fact. On page 3 of the comments on the video, he says, &quot;I can assure you, no computer trickery was used. And I demonstrate this for people face to face quite often. If you live near the Tampa Bay area, I'd be more than happy to do this for you in person.&quot; [NB. According to his MySpace, he is a computer graphic artist and video editor, and this was a response to someone proposing that he did this via computer video editing.]
<br />

<br />
Well, guess what? I just so happen to live near the Tampa Bay area - about three hours' drive away.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps I could arrange for a visit and have him demonstrate for me in person. Perhaps I could bring along some video recording equipment and record a video even less capable of being called fake. I'm thinking four to six video cameras, all synchronized, to prove as well as I can that it is not trickery or sleight-of-hand. (Of course, that begs a question as to where I would procure so many video cameras... but my philosophy is never to let logistics get in the way of a unique opportunity!)
<br />

<br />
I know Sean is being... strange, for lack of a better word... about PsiPog, but perhaps he can be persuaded to put whatever I come out with on the website.
<br />

<br />
This is, of course, assuming that he is actually doing TK on the wineglass. If it does have some sort of mundane non-TK mechanism behind it then, hey, at least I learned a neat parlor trick!

The author of the video won't be reading this thread, I'm pretty sure, so no need to address comments to him.
<br />

<br />
I would note that *if it is real*, Leo (maker of the video) is orders of magnitude better at TK than pretty much anyone here... so I'd say that his technique works very well, strain or no strain... <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Also, if you got strokes an aneurysms from clenching arm musces, push-ups would be a fatal activity...

			Not really. Did you &quot;clench&quot; your neck/head region so that your head would shake violently and your blood pressure would increase? Pushups don't put much on your body, to the extent the blood flow would increase so much. 
<br />

<br />
Like, how well do you know your body? Do you know the quality of your vessel walls, the composition of your blood or the nature of your blood flow? I'd just imagine anything that creates that much pressure, toppled with an already dangerous and volatile activity, isn't worth taking risks with. Meh. Like you said, he probably doesn't give a shit; it's his life.

			Just before the Wine Glass starts to move, there are some strange lines over the Glass, clear indication of video trickery. Also, when the Wine Glass is in motion, look closely for the blurred area around it, also sign of editing.

			I'm impressed by the one which he moves the glass using TK and hands. It is VERY similar to the real thing, when  I used to move glass, it goes like that. And using the hand closed works too, and I'm pretty sure doing like he did would work too...

			Why are we arguing? This exact discussion is taking place in another thread. Granted, with a lot of videos, it's easy to find out how they're faking PK. This one's a bit more ambiguous. 
<br />

<br />
I'll wager a guess that, if he hadn't said it's an illusion, that everyone would believe that it's legit PK. Keep in mind that his word is as good as anyone's. If you don't have the slightest clue how it's done, then it's just as great a leap of faith to say it's an illusion as it is to say it's true PK. 
<br />

<br />
And honestly, I don't think any amount of arguing on the internet will change anyone's mind to a significant degree. How many people have we had come in here and ask us what drugs we're on? We've argued with them, and they still have their original opinion, for the most part.
<br />

<br />
I've noticed lately that this forum's become somewhere to argue about the legitimacy of this or that PK video, rather than the productive discussion forum it's supposed to be. If we spend all day arguing, we stop being psis and start being politicians. Then everything goes to hell around here.
<br />

<br />
so please, can we have more productive talk, and a little less arguing please? I know I'm not a mod, or Peebs. I'm just a simple psi who would rather use this place to improve himself and strengthen his skills than use it as a debating club. Thanks for hearing me out.
