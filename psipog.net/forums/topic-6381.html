			Just the fact that I'm comparing myself to a guy sent to Hell by a chorus of demons should say something, but I'll explain.
<br />

<br />
This is too much, even for me. All of my friends would tell you that I'm really laid back and can take anything. <span style="font-style: italic">Anything!</span> Yes, I'm using a universal. Now, the overwhelming fluff and overall BLARING STUPIDITY! have taken their toll. I can't think straight anymore. The amoung of idiocy here has revealed new levels of it in everyday life. I look for logical people who can think things through. I see.... 3 here, out of the.... 50 or so active users. It's worse at school.
<br />

<br />
I just don't know where to go. I feel like I have to escape the world. Maybe I'll OBE and never come back. I feel as if I am being drowned in an infinite pool of industrial waste. I just have to hide for a long time. I start by leaving PsiPog, then sever the rest of my connections until I can redefine myself. 
<br />

<br />
Instead of being calm, I find myself ever angry, bristling at the slightest breach of sense. I know I am unjust to criticize those who cannot understand my philosophies. Especially if I never bothered to explain it to them. But every question I hear seems so Stupid! I can barely control myself anymore. I just need a year or two to reorganize myself.
<br />

<br />
I have a dream that one day this planet will be inhabitable. That everyone would be considerate. That people could think rationally.
<br />

<br />
Here is my MSN:
<br />
<a href="#">music2bgr8@hotmail.com</a>
<br />
Be warned: I am very irritable and will block you for even the slightest sign of stupidity.

Oh, very wise. 
<br />

<br />
Hmmm, I am very sorry to hear of it Lleu. This is becoming quite the common side of things. Everyone is complaining of stupidity. I can't see that much, so I actually wonder if it is me... <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I feel so many more words within me, but I can't express them. They aren't ready to come. 
<br />
Anyways, goodbye Lleu. Perhaps you should meditate a bit. Feel as if it is a blessing to be smarter than everyone else in the world. (Even though that is impossible, but you seem as if that is the way it is.)

Also a few thigns to say. I can understand your point of views and can see why you would leave. I will say is that wisdom can be found in unexpected places. I will say that you must become stronger, if wrath have gotten to you, suffering will only come. I will say that you must aloud others to speak, even if they don't seem a likely source of knowledge.
<br />

<br />
And I will say that you must listen...just like how you like people to listen to you.
<br />

<br />
Be strong my friend and fairwell and be strong!

Never try to take everything alone, I have seen this before.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
