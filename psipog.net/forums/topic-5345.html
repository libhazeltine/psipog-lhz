			Hey, i just tried to get onto the IRC Chat, on the channel; #psipog, and it said that i cannot join the channel, because it is by invite only. Does this mean i have to be invited by someone to enter the chat, or that the channel isn't working, or that it just doesn't like my face. 
<br />

<br />
Could someone shed some light on the situation?
<br />

<br />
Thanks in advance.
<br />

<br />

Chat Room 
<br />

<br />
(Our chat room system and policies have changed recently, so please make sure you read this entire page again if you're a veteran to the PsiPog Chat.) 
<br />

<br />
Once you've been a member of PsiPog.net for 2 weeks, you can join us in our chat rooms to talk about psionics, practice with other people online, or just relax. We host our chat rooms on the IRC server irc.darkmyst.org. If you have no clue what IRC is, then please click here to read a detailed tutorial on how to get in our chat room. 
<br />

<br />
For those of you who know what IRC is, and how it works, it isn't that hard to chat with us. Our chat room is controlled by a bot, appropirately named PsiPogBot. We have four channels registered on irc.darkmyst.org, and they are:
<br />

<br />
#psipog_lobby - This channel is open to anyone, but no one can talk. Join this channel first to login with PsiPogBot, and get invited to the other channels.
<br />

<br />

<br />
#psipog - This is our main channel. You can only join after you've been invited (+i). You become invited by logging in with PsiPogBot while in #psipog_lobby (via /msg PsiPogBot LOGIN Username Password).
<br />

<br />

<br />
#projection - This is our practice channel. You can meet friends online and practice psionics in this channel. To join this channel, you must already be in #psipog, and then you can be invited by PsiPogBot via: /msg PsiPogBot JOIN #projection
<br />

<br />

<br />
#psirelated - This channel is specifically for psi related discussion. While you are free to discuss psionics in #psipog, sometimes it's nice to break off from the random discussion, and focus specifically on psionics seperately. You can be invited by PsiPogBot via: /msg PsiPogBot JOIN #psirelated
<br />

<br />
Before you join, please read over the summary of our rules. Most of it is common sense! If you lack common sense, you can read ALL of our rules by clicking here. If you have some common sense, and generally want to be nice and have a good time, read the summary below:
