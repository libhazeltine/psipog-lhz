			I'm not really sure.How can you tell. I mean I have a nack for moving psi around my body and I have (from what I have read) managed to affect the psiwheel pretty fast compared to other people, but I have also started this at 14. How would I know if I were born with it? I probably wasn't, but I was always interested, deep down. I even tried moving stuff with telekinesis when I was young, but never moved anything. Not sure. I would probably go with developed quickly.

			The 3 terms I had in my head to determine someone is either:
<br />
Radical: cannot control psionics very well but they have alot of it. (someone who sees 'spirits' as a child for example)
<br />
Natural: can control it well. (Can create the first psiball in 5 minutes)
<br />
Non: not as gifted. (seem to struggle with psi, however we can be all equal given the input of hard work and determination.)
<br />
Everyone is born with the ability to control psi, the characteristics just vary from person to person.
<br />
None of my family members have shown me any sort of psionic energies whatsoever, however I believe I am born with it. Or within the terms I say, Natural.

			I hate these types of polls.
<br />

<br />
Every human is born with psi. Every human has the ability to manipulate psi (unless dead or braindead).
<br />

<br />
The thread\poll deserves much of edited for the mild misleading information.
<br />

<br />
(END OF TROLLING)
<br />
I found out about psionics about 6 years of age, practice sesitivity.
<br />

<br />
then, Psiballs...which I stopped because it made me feel weird and I didn't enjoy it.
<br />

<br />
then Psychokinesis of the body (DMILS).
<br />

<br />
eventually, over the years. I progress in knowledge through Psipog.

			I had active abilities from the moment time I could speak... basically telepathy / rare moments of precognition. Erm, 'poltergeist' stuff too. 
<br />

<br />
Parents are 'psi-active'. But was never called &quot;psi&quot;... it just <span style="font-style: italic">was</span>, only became apparent later on others didn't really have the same shit happen. Instinctive and mostly uncontrolled.
<br />

I suppose, broadly, that would make me a &quot;born/born-on/natural&quot;. [ ? ]

			While it IS true that all humans are born with the capacity to manipulate Psi, it's also true that some people have an easier time manipulating it. These people are known as &quot;borns&quot; or &quot;born-ons&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
There is also a third group, who have an easier time than most, but not as easy a time as the &quot;borns&quot;. These people are known as the &quot;partials&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
So, we're not really putting down the &quot;nons&quot; (&quot;non&quot; being a term that is used for lack of a better one, and describes the majority of people. I take it to mean &quot;non-affinite&quot;, meaning &quot;one without a particular affinity&quot;.), we're just trying to get a basic idea of how many people are Borns, how many are Partials, and how many are just Nons with &quot;m4d sk1llz&quot;.

Many people have their doubts about this sort of classification due to a lack of empirical evidence, though, I do believe that everyone can agree that some develop a proficiency in psionics naturally, while the majority have to do so through diligent practice.

ya thats definitely where i got it granted. let me explain my self first (i have noticed that this site sort of considers psion guild to be a taboo kind of thing), this past month i have had no interaction w/ psions, let alone w/ psions on the net, so i admit i'm a little naive on where i should get my info from. but i decided i would just check it out and formulate my own opinion. the only page i've actually looked at is the definition page. 
<br />

there were concepts that i hadn't attached words to and some were interesting. i dont know what else they have on the site though. so if they have like fighting things im sorry for mentioning the site and i'll just stop talking about it.

			Umm, I suppose I was a born psi user. I've had telepathic and other happenings to me since early childhood also both of my parents have been said to be psions, so I guess that qualifies me as a born one? Also i've had all &quot;natural&quot; starts in each field of psionics, though I still must work on them to get better like everyone else, so I guess I may fall into partial or born, but I voted for born.

No need to get down on yourself about it.  It's only natural that everyone goes to, and reads information from, different websites.  I myself started at the psion guild and floated around cyberspace until I settled here at Psipog.  Also, I'm not saying the theory is wrong, it just can't be validated via objective means.  If you can't test it, you can't prove it, but you can't disprove it.

wasn't born into this. dad's full blown against it so never discovered it till 3 years ago. still, it's hard to do stuff other than manipulate things around myself. however, empathy didn't take as long as i thought...
