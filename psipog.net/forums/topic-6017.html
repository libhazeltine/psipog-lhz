			well, I think I was in an OBE. I got the vibrarions and everything, and then I started getting really light, and felt sort of formless, like water or something.
<br />

<br />
I have a chronic shortness of breath. I can very rarely take deep breaths, and am always yawning just because I never have enough air, even while meditating and completely relaxed, I can't draw a propper breath. Needless to say this is very uncomfortable, and makes practicing psionics (or playing sports) quite difficult.
<br />
Anyways, when I went into what I think was an OBE, I all the sudden felt like I could breath properly, except the air felt sort of like cool liquid flowing into me. It was very strange, is there an experienced person who might be able to explain this to me? I'm actually not even entirley sure that this was an OBE, come to think of it.
