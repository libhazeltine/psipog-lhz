			i had a dream i was doing tk instantly. I was moving books, plates, pillow and macro stuff like that trough the air. It was one of the best feelings i ever felt in my life. When i woke up. i pulled out my psi wheel and tried to move it with that feeling. it work a tiny bit(tiny tiny bit) but i was still suprised, because that was my first result with tk. a day later i forgot what that feeling felt like.

			If only it were possible to do TK at that level. I hope I have a dream like that. It dosen't seem that unlikely.

			i've had dreams like this before and the feeling is amazing. i woke up one day from one of those dreams KNOWING what it felt like to perform PK at a grand scale.
<br />
oddly enough. the day before i had one of these dreams, i was trying to think of a &quot;formula&quot; to PK, a set rule. but i realise now that Pure PK is a state of mind. i rarely trance, but i rarely practice PK either, but from what i hear trances help with PK alot. so try some meditation and trancing if you can.
<br />
hope that helps. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Coincidently I dreamed last night that I was sliding a glass around my desk, and then I filmed it and did it even better. When I woke up I at first didn't quite realize that it hadn't happened. Someone said that these dreams may be your subconscious helping you with your PK practice by inspiring you. I think that may be true.
