the terrible truth.... it threatens to devour him and crush his mind and his sanity....  randywm is in denial.  he pretends to be angry with us.  He pretends that we are stupid... He's really angry with himself.

every night he sits up and thinks... maybe there's some way I could have prevented it... maybe..   But he crushes those feelings inside and pushes them way down deep and puts on a mask of anger to cover his sadness.

Although what you said could very well be true--about him being mad at himself.

I don't know exactly, but I see some signs left by him. I haven't had the chance to talk to him yet, if he will even talk to psions at all...
<br />

<br />
As far as stopping future incidents, I don't think there is anything that can be done. Many people just see one bad subject, and then freak out. &quot;Arghh, too many noobs on the forums nowadays.&quot; 
<br />
If you ask me, you shouldn't say that unless you have contributed greatly to the forums. I sometimes see people who have only posted a few times nevertheless good posts and leave complaining that Psipog is dieing. 
<br />
The only people causing the death of Psipog are the people who say it is dieing.

Heh, thanks Eldibs. I thought it was spelled &quot;dying.&quot; I was too lazy to check.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I wasn't correcting your spelling, I was correcting your statement. That's what I don't like about the internet. You don't get handy things like voice tone and body language.

Don't feel bad about misspelling it, though. I went to college with a guy that couldn't spell his girlfriend's name correctly, even after having been taught how to spell it.

Aww, you weren't? What is spelled like &quot;dieing&quot; then? What's the difference?

I do feel obligated to speak properly, it's just what I try to do. I never want to lower myself to improper spelling. Grammar is a little more difficult, and I do make mistakes in that.
