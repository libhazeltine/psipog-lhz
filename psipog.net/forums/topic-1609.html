Rainsong mentioned in her &quot;<a href="../art-normal-uses.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">'Normal' Uses for Unusual Skills</a>&quot; article that manipulating locks provided an excellent example of helpful psychokinetics.  My personal approach is somewhat different than what she alluded to, but I thought I'd offer my (limited) understanding of both concepts and ask for comments here.
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Messing about with locks, both traditional and electronic, is another useful PK bit if you tend to lock yourself out of your house. This one takes quite a bit of practice, though, for most people, and it really helps to know how the lock works.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
This brought to mind the concept of a psychic key, in which you could create and memorize a handy little force bubble that matched the shape of your key.  I suppose you could keep a drawing of the key in your wallet or something of that nature as an aid to recreating the &quot;key&quot; later.  Having a set of these ready to build at will makes it a lot harder to lock yourself out.  Personally I find it easier to keep a &quot;tag&quot; or beacon on my cell phone, etc., because I've been working with tags for quite a while.  (I think it'd be a bit more difficult to build a functioning psi-cell-phone... but that's beside the point.)
<br />

<br />
Anyway, my personal technique is a bit simpler, though seems to require more energy.  I feel rather dizzy after doing it, which passes quickly but seems to indicate there should be an easier way.  I developed it from a method I call &quot;Chancing&quot; in which I will myself to accept a possibility evidence would suggest is not currently manifested.
<br />

<br />
It works best opening locks other people have (supposedly) locked themselves, as I have trouble opening locks I closed myself, though have done it.  My mother went around and locked all the doors to our house as we left... when we came back I simply walked to a side door and &quot;expected&quot; it to be unlocked, and it was, much to her surprise.
<br />

<br />
Certainly it's possible that in this and other cases a door was only <span style="font-style: italic">believed</span> to be locked by the individual... though isn't that how we determine our entire experience?  That might seem esoteric, the way I've worded it, but really our expectations have a huge influence on our results.
<br />

<br />
You may decide that what I'm referring to isn't even a psionic trick, because I made no mention of directly channeling energy into the lock, etc.  In my experience, it seems to be the result of powerful visualization and the mental suggestion that the lock <span style="font-style: italic">is open right now</span>.  It does seem to help, though, if you shield yourself from mental suggestions of the opposite (that the door is locked and won't open for you) as well as shielding the door and lock.  Perhaps you prefer to consider it subconcious TK.  I don't know!
<br />

<br />
I've heard chains slide loose at my touch on the door, so I'm convinced!  I'm sure that helps (whether it helps me be gullible, or actually accomplish my goal is up to your judgement).  If you are good at remembering details, I'm sure a &quot;force key&quot; would be much easier to construct.
<br />

<br />
Now don't get any ideas from those skeleton keys maintenance workers carry around...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  I have had no luck duplicating the credit-card hotel keys with purely psychic energies, though it's possible enough to snag your card from inside the room with PK if you've practiced a bit and know where you've left it.
<br />

<br />
If you're really desperate, I suppose you could make a psi-pet to go fetch your keys for you.

			I believe it would be easyer to, instead of making a Psi-Key, to simply use TK to lift the tumblers inside the lock one by one as if you were using a lockpick. You would not have to hold sway over so much force them.
<br />
Though, I may be wrong. TK is not my area.

*Sigh* 19 posts in one day. This is the reason for not having a late night job that has no use at all. &gt;.&lt; I think this is a sign I should leave the forums for now, and stop thinking about the occult. Almost time for me to leave anyway.
