			Hey, i just joined tonight. i have always been interested in these types of things especially psychokinesis. I guess i'm just posting to introduce myself and ask for any tips before i get started. i'm going to really start trying tomorrow (its too late to do anything tonight). This psiwheel thing i keep reading about...what exactly is it? What i did was was i took a little pin thing that i have on a corkboard and stuck it through a small piece of tin foil and have the pin standing up. is that basically what it is? Also, how long did it take you guys to move the psiwheel? how long did it take you to move it on a consistant basis and for it to become easy for you? And just out of sheer curiosity, what is the largest object you have ever moved? Anyway, this site is really interesting and i hope i can learn some cool shit.

			The psi wheel is just a tool mainly for entry-level psions to practice pk on. It (along with a few other things) is the easiest thing to move with your mind, becase it's so light. You start with that, and then work your way up onto heavier things to move.
<br />

<br />
Incedentaly, I think you goth the wrong idea. You should have a square piece of paper (or tinfoil) and it should just rest on the point of the needle. it should'nt be stuck through. Everything else is on fine working order.
<br />

<br />
It takes different people different amounts of time to move the wheel. It can take anywhaere from a few days, to a few months, to a few years. And that's practicing every day. Gaining good control also depends on the person. And how much time theyre willing to put into practicing. Pk is hard, it's not something that you can practice for a week and be able to lift a car with. It may take months before you can even master the psi wheel. 
<br />

<br />
But if I haven't scared you off by now, welcome to the forums! And good luck with the psi wheel.

			Welcome and such.
<br />

<br />
I can see Isotope set you straight on the Psi wheel's construction so no need there.
<br />

<br />
One thing I will say, and you'll see it a lot here, is practice. Before you ask if you're doing it wrong, read the artciles and practice. Practice for a few days or even weeks before assuming you're not doing it right. Generally the first impression is the right one of you read the articles carefully. Don't complicate the process, just be relaxed and enjoy it. Yes it can be a lot of sitting around staring at a piece of tinfoil, but with time, patience, and practice. I would also recommend watching all the videos of Psi wheels as well just to get you started. There's a thread at the top of this forum and the media section of Psipog has some good stuff as well. Oh, and as some extra recommended reading, JoeT has a thread at the top as well for when you're done with the standard articles - trust me, it's very encouraging and helpful.
<br />

<br />
Overall it's important not to become impatient. It's recommended to work in short periods of 15-20 minutes and take breaks in between. It can be important to let your sub concious digest what's gone on - and that may take a few days - it is afterall learning how to manipulate the world without the rest of your body.
<br />

<br />
But enough of my rambling.
