Thank you all, to everyone who answers these questions for me. There are so many wonderful topics on this site for learning, but some of my questions are far too uber-simple, I think.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

<br />
Yes. It's surropunding energy, and can be programmed to do different tasks. But not always a &quot;force&quot;.
<br />

<br />
You form this shield through pure concentration? Y or N 
<br />
Basically. yes. And viusaliztion and the likes.
<br />

<br />
To form this shield, you must concentrate on nothing at all? Y or N
<br />

<br />
Not sure about that, possible and has been done , pretty sure. A bit like meditation, suppose. But I would say no at first, until you are good enough to &quot;just do it&quot;.
<br />

<br />
To form a psiball, you concentrate on your own energy flow? Y or N 
<br />
Your won and from other sources of energy, e.g. objects, sun, moon, etc.
<br />

<br />
A psiball serves no purpose? Y or N 
<br />
Surves whichever purpose you wanted it to fill in the first place, before you made it.

			Thank you! Your responses are greatly appreciated and helpful. So, are you saying that psiballs can be used to affect the physical world in some way? Rather than only my mental?

			it interacts best with itsself. if you were good enough to influence alot of psi, you could probably interact with enough psi to influence the physical.

			A shield would be a force of surrounding energy? (Y) or N
<br />

<br />
A shield is a Psi construct that usually ressembles a sphere around ones body. However, it does not have to be in that form. It is designed to keep unwanted psi from interacting with your mind.
<br />

<br />
You form this shield through pure concentration? Y or (N)
<br />

<br />
I do not like your wording. You form a shield like you form a Psiball, it does take concetration, but it also takes the process of moving Psi <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. There is a fine line between concentrating, and concentrating on making a shield. Such as concentrating on drawing a picture, you still have to draw, not just concentrate.
<br />

<br />
To form this shield, you must concentrate on nothing at all? Y or (N)
<br />

<br />
No. You concentrate on making the Shield. It's structure and it's Program &lt;-important. The program dictates what the shield allows through and does not allow through.
<br />

<br />

<br />
To form a psiball, you concentrate on your own energy flow? (Y) or N
<br />

<br />
When you form a psiball you concentrate on your energy flowing into the shape of a ball, generally between your hands. With a shield, you would concentrate on your energy flowing into a sphere around your body, or molding around your body.
<br />

<br />
A psiball serves no purpose? Y or (N)
<br />

<br />
Psiballs can serve a purpose, like any construct (programed strucutre of psi). It can be used to create stimuli, transmit information, or just for &quot;Fun&quot;. Purposless exercises do not aid you in growing your skills, thus, if it helps it isn't purposless.
<br />

Good luck to you, Hope I helped.
