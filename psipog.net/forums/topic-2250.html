But thats just my personal opinion, I dont think Im a credible enough source to make that statement :/

			silly willy, apollo, there is more things in Bio-psychokinesis then altering DNA, although, it seems to be a common use, actually...might be pure DNA altering...
<br />

Meme, I really can't say, I don't think it can, but I could be wrong. I've had heard humans used to have gills, so maybe one could manipulate that trait to trigger, but I doubt it'd start to form gills on you, maybe if you were a fetus.

			ive never heard of a solid case of biokenisis. If there were at least one credible case, id love to try it. I just dont think that changing &quot;dna&quot; is possible on such a vast scale. That would have to affect every single strand in our bodies. Trillions of things happening all at once. I mean, you cant do it over time, telling only half of your body to have gills and expect it to work. Im totoally into psi and all, but id have to discredit bio pk for now. Maybey when im older and bored as heck ill try it out and give myself a set of eagle wings.

			People have said to change eye color before most of the time its mentioned with DMILS not Bio-PK, even though they are the same thing, DMILS means Direct Mental Influence on Living Systems. Though as my friend told me &quot;Dont go messing around with that, if you mess up those are your EYES, dude&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, you can but I dont believe you'll find any articles easily, the acne thing, well why not just buy some of the medicene?

			well, bio pk is very different from biofeedback. Biofeedback is the concious takeover of subconcious tasks, like oil production(acne) and the petuitary gland functions(puberty, breathing, etc.) I have actually affected my heartate a few times after running. It is possible but not on a large scale as to affect the phyysical dna. Just some tasks that your not supposed to do by yourself.

			DMILS (aka Bio-PK) is just manipulating something that's living via the mind/intention.  If you google the term &quot;DMILS&quot; you can pull up some interesting studies.  Some uses for DMILS that I've heard of and/or used, include: building muscle mass, correcting eyesight so that you don't have to wear glasses, and various healing effects.
<br />

<br />
If you'd like information on how this is possible, the DVD &quot;The New Biology&quot; by Bruce Lipton presents some amazing information about how the brain interacts with the cells in the rest of your body.
