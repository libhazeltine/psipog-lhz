			i was watching a show and it had a character that could link with anything that was electronic and see the program. she could manipulate the programing to whatever she wanted so i was thinking that it could be possible since everthing on the net is just signal waves in the air if we could pick these up we could connect to the machines by thought and we might just be able to download files into our minds. that would save alot of time, instead of reading a book for hours we could just download it and know the whole book in a matter of seconds. this is just an idea, i don't know if this is really possible or not but i think it's worth testing out, but i have no idea how to sart so if anyone has any ideas of how this is possible please say so because i would love to try this and see if it is possible.
<br />

thanks,

			If that is possible, it would be very very complicated. You would probably have to learn binary and be very fluent in it to get decent download speeds.

			yeah i thought that would be one of the problems but i thought that if there was a way that there might be a way of creating a program that could translate the binary code to images and words but that’s if you could make the link and create this program which would probably be very difficult to say the least. Or maybe the sub conscious mind could translate it but that to would probably be difficult, i just throwing out any idea that might be possible.

			Exactly Lightbringer. Please for once and for all understand that your conscious mind does not need to understand everything in order to manipulate it. I see the same 'misassumption' being made on a frequent basis. Think about how often people try to sound interesting by saying: &quot;No that is not possible, that would require sooo much energy, and you would have to know all this difficult information about how these atoms are structured and relate to each other. Impossible dude!&quot; Please understand that there is a subconscious and energetic intelligence at work that you will never fully understand and comprehend with your conscious mind. All you need is AI. Attention and Intention. <span style="font-weight: bold">Attention</span> is the <span style="font-weight: bold">fuel</span>; for the power of <span style="font-style: italic">Intention</span> to <span style="font-style: italic">transform.</span> This is all you need to do in order to interact with the intelligent energy which then takes care of your desire with mathematic precision. There is no conscious step by step schedule that one has to follow in all these complicated areas. Just have a clear intention and improve the quality of your attention as you progress. 
<br />

<br />
You'll see that eventually desires become reality even without that much consicous attention at all. Desired events will materialize and manifest itself with such perfect precision, that once you become aware of these manifestationsyou will realise that it cannot be the work of a conscious mind alone. The latter just triggered the underlying intelligence. Make use of this intelligence; have faith in it; trutst in its capability, and you'll see how perfect life is co-ordinated. 
<br />

<br />
Im very glad that it is <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> your conscious mind that is coordinating this dance of energy. I really am <img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" />

Anyone here able to read them binary clocks? They are weird little funny things arnt they.

yeah that makes sence at first glance but movement of a psiwheel is common sence to us. computer programs and such are binary and translated for us using the computer. please correct me if i'm wrong

The movement of a psi-wheel is common to us? Please explain me then how exactly that wheel moves and what happens on a molecular and energetic level? What happens exactly and how does the movement relate to our nervous system or our own energy? We don't know shit about the psi-wheel <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> . We move it nonetheless.

Why would you need those things?  Use electronics you have at home like your mp3 player and computer to experiment.  That how I got this skill, by practicing with my PC...
