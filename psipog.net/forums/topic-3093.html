			Hello everyone. I have a hobby for interpreting peoples strange dreams. I can't figure all of them out, but I do have very good insight. You dreams allways tell you what is on your subconcious. A lot of people just have troubles interpreting these signs. This could be useful for you and entertaining for me.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> It's a win-win situation.

			Last night i dreamed that I had a TK traing session with Lucidess and Vladimir. Lucidess told me and Vladimir about this really cool ability he had, for some reason he could see all the people that was out on the sea. 
<br />
Vladimir got so jelous at Lucidess that he developed a &quot;transform&quot; teq. (in just a few seconds), i remember how he showed Lucidess and I in cam how he turned orange juice into vodka.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I dreamed lots of other stuff too, but this is what I remember as the main thing.
<br />

<br />
So what do you think edge_of_reason? Maybe my subconcious is dying for a really strong drink? <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Good idea edge... but I've tried to consolidate the various spamfest topics into one thread before, no luck. People want their strange dreams that nobody cares about in their own topics, because they're IMPORTANT PEOPLE. (Not implying that nobody cares about your particular dream, Ephyria. Isn't that a drug?)

			Have you recently been trying to cut down on your intake of alchohol? It sounds to me like you're having a craving for alchohol. Also it sounds like maybe you really like vodka. So maybe vladimir changing something into a substance you really like is a signal that you really like vladimir and you think that he knows how to make you happy. Thats what I was able to get out of your dream. Very strange indeed.

			I had a two dreams today one inside the other if you know what i mean, the first dream i dreamt that i was dreaming about showing my girlfriend and my sister the psi wheel and my abillities suddenly skyrocketed and the wheel started to levitate, then i woke up in this dream and lay there and looked at my door which was open and said close! and it slowly started to close and i went round my house opening and closing all the doors in my house, then i woke up and thought &quot;wow that was weird&quot; and decided to try the psi wheel suprisingly i moved without hardly any effort but it only lasted a few seconds the it stoppedand i had to try a little harder to move it, this was a really cool dream, im going to try to recall it.

			Ive had a recurring dream. It varies sometimes but the theme is the same... Im falling. Mostly it happens over the ocean but before I hit the water I wake up, or the dream &quot;skips&quot; to something else. Until 2 weeks ago I never saw what happened next.
<br />

<br />
Then I had a dream I was at work, and I was on top of a building in an arguement with a worker and he punched me off the top. There I was looking up as I was falling toward the ground.
<br />

<br />
Halfway down I decided I was not going to die today. I turned my body with my feet toward the ground, and bent my knees and focused. And just as I got 2 feet from the ground I quickly decellerated, stopped, looked up and took off BACK!!!
<br />

<br />
The last thing I remember I was about 2 feet from the top of the building.
<br />

<br />
I woke up feeling as if it had really happened. It was one of the strangest feelings....

			Mike V: Sounds like this is just a fantasy about having great telekinesis skills. This isn't interpreting, but try and recreate what happened in the dream, how it felt, etc... Maybe this can help you to be able to improve in the real world.
<br />
JynOsiris: The falling dream is vaguely described but I can tell you a couple of things. Falling in a dream usually tends to be a sign of distress. Depending on your emotions when you're falling, it either signals that you are failing something, or trying to drastically change something in your life. 
<br />
When you decided that you weren't going to die, you defied your fate. Which could signal that you know that what is happening in your life is changable, but you think it's just the way your life is meant to be. I think that your subconcious is trying to tell you that it IS possible. And the conflict in your life might have something to do with that co-worker. This is what I was able to get out of your dreams.

			Ok i had this dream awhil ago so i will recall it as best i can. But be warned this is a really screwed up dream.
<br />
    It started out where i was hanging out in a city like place, it looked kind of like the city level in tony hawks pro skater 2,i with a couple other people, i only recognised my friend jen in the group. well after awhile my friend jen took a small saw and like strated sawing her arm off, this lasted a long time in my dream until i stoped her and went to get help, we ran i think... then we came to a building with glass doors, it was suposed to be a hospital i think and inside the doors there were a bunch of guys that were dressed like off duty firemen. the doors were locked so i knocked and pointed to my friend's arm. they kinda motioned &quot;no were closed&quot; i tried nocking more. and they eventually let me in....the rest i don't rember. See i told you it was screwed up.

That's interesting.  I had a dream in which i was able to levitate last night.  Though I was in metro type building.  In the middle of levitating I was also taken to a scene of my self in my bed, then i started dreaming something else..
<br />

<br />
It's funny because when i levitate it was like i was playing on monkey bars.  Reaching out for the next invisible bar in order to advance.

			I had a dream in which a volcano came up in my backyard, another at a local store, and a third at a mall. I live in central U.S. Anyway, I saw these in succession, in reverse order that I presented them here. I packed some books and clothes, and left when I saw lava coming in through my basement room's window.
