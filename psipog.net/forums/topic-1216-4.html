			I just downloaded it, but I have a quick question: 
<br />

<br />
Does the course help improve overall pk, or just when you are in the altered state? In other words, will will praticing in the altered state help me move things better when in a normal state of consciousness?

			Hi.
<br />

<br />
There's this workshop where expanded consciousness is experienced, using Hemi-Sync meditations (with audio CDs), with one of the main purposes being psychokinesis (PK).

			Wow. Within the first minute of the third course, I've gotten further into an obe than ever before. I seriously would be in the astral right now if I didn't freak out and &quot;pull the plug&quot;, so to speak. It's gonna take some getting used to... but there's definately something to this.

			Probably because of a combination of the guy telling you what to focus on (when you try it yourself, you're probably focusing on other things on and off, so you're not always being told to &quot;relax&quot;) and the soft music in the background.

I completely agree, this course is so incredibly relaxing, i use it to go to sleep, as i normally have enormous trouble getting to sleep in the first place, i havnt noticed much difference with my Pk, but i did what he said and held a spoon while relaxing, it went soft, but did not bend, im going to keep at it so i can win the bet with my mum and dad, the bet was that i couldnt a 7mm steel spoon, and if i did, id get ?50 from them, i accidentally broke the bowl off though while listening to this course, but the bet was that i could bend the main rod into an 'S' shape. This course is also great for OBE's, i totally recommend it for anyone having trouble with OBE's.

			i don't know if this happens to you all, but i have media player.  once i download the seminar, i try to add it into my library for future use.  once i do that (or exit the little box with all the recordings in it) my connection is lost and i can't listen to the seminars for another 72 minutes.  i wanted to know if there was a way around this, somehow keeping the seminars permanently, or semi-permanently in my library, or on my computer.  thanks for any help.

   Does it work? I'm really busy and if it's not worth my time, I won't bother.
<br />
   Also, is anyone aware of any subliminal/supraliminal programming besides that of psychokinesis? I've never undergone hypnosis or &quot;altered state of consciousness&quot; or subjected myself to subconscious programming before ... I'm very weary of that stuff :-/

I'm christian as well and I know how you feel about being weary. However in the end you are in control of your mind and can unprogram or program it in whatever way fits best. Altered states of consciousness are normal because you go through them without realizing it. Beta is the normal state of consciousness. Delta is the state of consciousness you go into while you sleep. Alpha is a creative level of the mind where you use both sides of your brain. All these levels have specific functions and there are more levels if I recall correctly. Alpha is the level you would use to program your mind. 
<br />

<br />
Since this is a natural human ability and you believe (as a christian) that God created humanity this is not a bad thing. However you're allowed not to believe this and I encourage you to be skeptical. I can provide you with a link to the meditation program I used.

			Ok, I tried it (2 times on different days) And no results yet. But it made me feel very weird. When he said deeper and deeper, it felt like my whole torso was being sucked in, also felt kinda tingly. Normal feeling? Or potential heart attack &gt;&lt;
