			hey..... you know that has happened to me before...  (except i hadnt been on psipog then) didn't know what the heck was going on but all of a sudden my right ear started losing its hearing and kind of a loud vibrating humming sound was in my ear and i started freakin out but it stopped after about 5 seconds like u said... doesnt happen as often as you tho  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> wow..... only once and maybe almost twice did it ever happen to me. I have no idea wat was happening so this could be a completely different story. Just had to say my ear did that once or twice.

			I do not know about the whole esp thing when you hear the sound, but I get a ringing sometimes.  A ringing in your ears means you are losing a little bit of hearing.  Every time you hear the ringing, you lose a little of your hearing.

That's normal then, people tend to get it when there isn't much or any noise. It pisses me off just hearing it, I start making noise because it desturbs me and I freak out.

but, it's normal, nothing psi related.
