Your wish is granted. All attempts to corrupt your wishes fail, however in an attempt to prove that it is impossible to corrupt your wishes, you wish for a paperweight in which to kill a bug walking across your desk, and you are given one. You say, I wish that bug was dead! You squash the bug with the paperweight, but it turns out that you were acccidentally given a 20mm anti-aircraft shell instead of a paperweight, and it explodes. The bug is now completely and undoubtably dead, and you are in need of a hand graft.

			You wish for a wish and get a single wish. You want it to be the perfect wish, unfortunately right now you don't know what that is. You get paranoid that something you think will accidently get interperated as what you wanted to wish for and start trying not to think of anything at all. It becomes a habit. Since you no longer think of anything much, you never end up making your wish.

			Wish granted, but unfortunately you did not think of what this might do.  You get a backpack that never runs out of room but expands every time you put something into it.  When you finished putting things into it, it was the size of a bus.  Then you decided to go outside with it.  Unfortunately for you, the backpack's weight started at 0 pounds, and never increased while increasing in mass.  This caused a dangerously strong lift since the backpack is lighter than the surounding air.  You were flung, constantly gaining speed 50 miles into the air, shortly after climbing the first 30,000 feet, you begin to sufficate from a lack of oxygen.  Your backpack begins to expand more, loosening the thread.  At about 100 miles up in the air, 3 minutes after you began sufficating, your backpack rips open and violently explodes from the lack of sufficient preasure, revealing a sigularity and destroying you and a random bird.  The black hole proceeds to destroy the earth and the rest of the solar system.

wish granted.  unfortunantly, &quot;someone&quot; isn't available right now...actually, he died 2 days ago, which is why it took two days to corrupt your wish.  since you wished for &quot;someone&quot; to corrupt your wish, that means that the person has to be &quot;someone&quot; in order to fufil your wish.  i, unfortunantly, am &quot;a nobody.&quot;  since &quot;a nobody&quot; corrupted your wish, and not &quot;someone&quot;, your wish has now been corrupted.  have a nice day.
