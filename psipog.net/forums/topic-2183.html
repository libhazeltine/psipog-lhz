			I don't know if what I am doing for my technique is really having any affect on my psi wheel - whether it's under the glass or not. 
<br />

<br />
Here is what I do:
<br />

<br />
1. Sit or lay comfortably on my stomach.
<br />

<br />
2. Make a mental connection with my target by visualising it and I becoming blue while the world around us fades to white.
<br />

<br />
3. Clearing my mind as much as possible and visualizing it spinning.
<br />

<br />
NOTE: Sometimes I ask my subconscious to help.
<br />

<br />
So far I have seen no obvious results, and it's been about a week or more scince I have started. I REALLY believe it is real, but I am just stoked as to what I am doing wrong. 
<br />

<br />
I would greatly appreciate it if you would all post your techniques on here so I can get a better idea of what I should be trying to accomplish.
<br />

<br />
Thanx,
<br />

There's nothing wrong with what you're doing so far, so just keep at it.
<br />
Good luck.

			read as many possible articles and techs you possibly can, the right one will pop out.  And dont worry it takes some ppl a day some a month.  Keep practicing.  It took me a week, and watching about 50 different Psi wheel videos(though they can be faked, but what loser would jsut fake psi wheel movies all day???)  for me to make it move.

			Watch some videos, think about another way of doing it. 
<br />

<br />
Personally, I never enjoyed the tips that peebs gave on the Article, so I became frustrated on my pin wheel and tried to levitate a paper ball which caused my hand to go numb. After a few days after, I could slide objects because I decided to do it my own way.
<br />

<br />
so, did you thought of this technique or did you adopt it?

then make one up, let your mind allow to choose how to do it, it might work, it worked for me, and it seems to work for others.
