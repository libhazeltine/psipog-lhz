			Dear psionics,
<br />
	I am so glad that I found out about this site.  I have come here to ask for your advice about a dire situation that my family is facing with regards to psi.  I am not a psionic, but I believe that my son has developed such strong psi abilities that neither myself or my husband can handle them.  It has been almost two months since we brought our son Marc (13) home from the hospital after he fell of his bmx, and since then we have been unable to handle him.
<br />
	Every time that Marc wakes up, myself and my husband both get terrible headaches.  We hear his screaming and terrible indecipherable noises.  It is so intense that we can barely even move when it happens.  When he falls back asleep, the headaches go away.  
<br />
	For the past month, we have been keeping him asleep using animal sedatives, and this has been working, but he is growing weak and we cannot keep him like this forever.  We want our son back.
<br />
	What can we do? Is there a way we can stop his abilities without making him sleep? Is there a psi specialist we can find in the Wichita area??  We need help desparately.  The doctors would just laugh at us.

			O_O Your tranculising him!?!?!? Why cant you just take some pain killers? And how did you connect psychic abilitys with this? Also there are these things with parents and children that when the child or the parent is in pain, they will feel it with a headache or a sideache. Is you son in pain? It makes sence because if he is asleep he probably doesnt feel the pain he might having. So in the morning, if he does have pain give him some advil or something, When the pain is gone see if your head aches are gone. So when your son is healed you wont get headaches

			Are you SURE it's psionically related? Does he intend to harm you? Or is it uncontrollable?
<br />
If it's unintentional, Direct him to the main site and let him learn about psionics, and how he can control it.
<br />
If he IS intending to harm you like this, Learn to shield, I'm sure everyone here would be happy too help.
<br />
I am pretty sure animal sedatives aren't too good for the human body, but whatever works!
<br />
Good luck.

			tranquilizing Marc was the hardest decision we had ever made and we did not make it lightly.  there is no way that it could not be psychic when myself and my husband are affected by him. what else could it be?
<br />
marc is clearly in pain because of the awful screaming.  i wish that we could just take pain killers and let marc live normally, but we cant ignore marc's pain and we can't ignore our own.

			thank you for your replies
<br />
marc would never try to harm us and i am sure that he is out of control.  but i dont think we can let him be awake long enough to learn to control himself.  i am going to read about psychic shields tonight and tomorrow i will give him some advil instead of sedatives (and have some myself).  please wish us well!

			Man, that sucks. He can't be awake long enough to control himself?
<br />
Have you and your husband thought about taking Marc to a psychologist? If he can't physically control himself, then there is something WAY wrong.
<br />
Good luck with everything, anyway.
<br />

P.S. Parents that believe in psionics, Are WAY cool.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Wait, Did the bike accident harm him? I mean is he mentally challenged? I dont mean to sound rude. What if his screaming is causing your headaches. If he is &quot;challenged&quot; i saw this show where some challenged people can do things most people cant. I dont know. i think you and marc should go to a docter. Maybe they can figure this out.

			I don't buy the story either.
<br />

<br />
However, even IF the story is true - this post is still against the rules.  No one in our community is qualified to touch that issue with a 10 foot pole.  GO SEE A PROFESSIONAL DOCTOR.
