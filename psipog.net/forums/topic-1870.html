			Hey everyone, sup?
<br />

<br />
Anyway, ever since I was born, over the years i learned to generate unusual but intense static and heat throughout my entire body, and if i hold it up i eventually see little black sparks and foggish bolts of black mist (sometimes white sparks appear as well), around my body as if it was some kind of field. What is this? I've been trying to figure out what it is for years, and now that I've come across this site, is it possibly anything to do with Psi?
<br />

<br />
Also, if i continue focusing, and i maximize the rate of which it forms, my body starts to burn and the static will sting a lot, and I feel like exploding when it happens. Of course this can be controlled at will.
<br />

<br />
When I do this &quot;technique&quot;, i usually recall memories that involve strong emotion and sort of &quot;relive&quot; those memories in thought and go through and feel the experience again in my mind. I can also do it relaxed, but it gives a more cooling effect static than a fiery one. Also, sometimes it automatically just flares out of me like crazy, as if i feel something is either off balance or i'm about to be in danger or something, almost like immediate foresight, or sensing.

			Really, this could be anything. When it comes to detailed manifestations of energy, it could be due to anything. It is very complex. So I would say, just go with your feeling. Offcourse it is usefull to know what exactly is going on, but it is not necessary in order to handle it, as you done it for so long already. So as long as it feels right, don't worry about it.

			i have something like that happening to me aswell, except its not nearly as strong or visible for that matter, but it feels like a rush of something moving through a limb. Like someone just blew on your feet.
<br />

<br />
no other experiences other than that. It happens randomly, and without warning. Also, the frequency of it happening has lowered from the time that it first started, to now.

			A mixture of an aura and a large mass of psy energy? Damn...i wonder what kind of magnitude that combination would make...
<br />

<br />
Which reminds me. I was practicing Psi for the first time last night, and i attempted to make a psi ball. First i followed the regular method, and i felt slight heat in the spot i was forming the psi ball.
<br />

<br />
When i tried to do it again, i ended up using this unknown energy with it, and it felt as if the psi ball burst into more like a fireball (except with a black flame around it), and it was very very difficult to control. It went absolutely haywire, as my mind was also going berserk controlling it, and it ended up bouncing around the room like zig-zag madness, then it hit me in the back, and yes i felt it. (Slight pain that ached for a while)
<br />

<br />
So i did it again, this time with one hand with the palm facing upwards to the ceiling. I used my energy with psy energy again, and it formed the ball of black fire again. It went berserk, as well as my mind controlling it, and it bounced off the ceiling and hit me in the hip..and that hurt a little more than the last one &gt;.&gt;
<br />

<br />
Then i tried a number of things, such as using multiple energy sources at once (the sun, myself and the earth), and it did have much stronger results, yet i can't truly control or form a proper solid psiball as yet... just crazy wild black fiery orbs.

			Well i have no idea why my energy is black (probably because i have a lot of negativity?)
<br />

<br />
But when i tried the psiball, it wasn't 100% visible if you thought so, but a lot of black sparks and mists could be seen emitting from the spot i focused on (mainly in my hands)
<br />

<br />
But what were you gonna say though? (when you said &quot;that means that you're a... &quot;)

I'm a what?

			Kaigen, when i gather energy, i always end up envisioning a ball of black flame, does this happen to you? I end up with a heated psiball but i have no negativity about me. 
<br />

<br />
It seems to make forming the psiball easier, but that psiball from hell sounds very interesting...

			huh, mines always black fire. Even when i try to change my mental picutre it stays the same...
<br />
Welp, from what i know or have heard/read, you might have a pretty powerful aura, are the psychic equivilant of an Energizer Battery, or have a natural shield that you've been born with. 
<br />

<br />
Sounds really cool though.
<br />

<br />
P.S. i mean the Battery comment as a compliment, not an insult.

			Aura's don't really do anything...at least not that I know. I think it's more of a marker. Like your bio/psi/spiritual energy radiates outwards when your not concentrating it on a specific task.
<br />
But, I might be wrong, Seek a second opinion just in case.

			Well, i tried more practice with forming psiballs again, and it worked better than last night. This time though, the psiballs i formed were cold as ice, and i tried dipping the psiball into the palm of my hand and i felt a lot of cold static, then i raised it up again and it really felt as if i was controlling it better. I'm still somewhat a little confused though.
