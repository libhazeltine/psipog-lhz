			I only have 3 friends who are aware of psionics.  One time 2 of my friends and I tried to make a weak psi ball by putting our hands next to each other and visualizing.  I told them what to do and, amazingly enough, we produced so much heat that I began to sweat a lot.  Moments later I illustrated what I thought just occurred and one of them said to the something like: &quot;Dude! Lloyd just drew exactly what happened! Awesome!&quot;.  My other friend I introduced it to cautiously, since I thought he might be a skeptic.  I didn't tell him what he was doing; I just told him it was a test. I told him to visualize energy in his arm and to be aware of any strange feelings he might experience there (I told him the possible feelings).  He felt a tingly feeling and then I spilt the beans of psi and about how far I have progressed and all that.  He is somewhat of a skeptic, but he is openminded like me.  I don't think he practices psionics but he is at least aware.  Maybe I should go online and discuss it with Buddists with the same test I gave my friend. (I'm sort of a Buddist) The more psions the merrier.  (Sorry if I upset anyone by talking about Buddism.  It was't meant to be offensive.)

			I know one person in my entire school who used to do some stuff with psi. i should put up an advertisement like that-just to find somebody. and there are 2000 people at my school. at least one person
<br />
(other than me) should do some psionics practice.  Although almost everyone in my U.S. government class knows about me-none take it seriously though. they think i am trying to &quot;hack into their minds&quot; when i look at them. and that's my life.

			I live in a town where the best place to shop is wal-marts.  Seriously.  I only know one person who even knows about psi, and he's my best friend.  I wouldn't be surprised if I am the only psion in the whole town.  It's 14,000 people and most are like, &quot;I can't live without jesus.&quot;  So if I even mentioned psi they would either think I'm satanic or that I'm crazy.  I'm christian but people like that just make me ugghh.  I'm going to freak out my friends though when I learn how to flare.  I already freak people out with the cloaking shield.

I'm pretty sure i'm the only one in my school but there are some open minded people who are quite so i might bring it up. Firstly though i want to experiment with a construct to find any other psions in the school.
