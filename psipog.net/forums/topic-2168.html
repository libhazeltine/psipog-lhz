			I'm confused, the poll has nothing to do with the question. Also, like LOTR, I am confused as to why you would hack a passerby for no reason, what is there to gain? Also you don't even know the person, what did they do to where you have to probe their mind for information?

			Meh.. RVing to a random person and &quot;hacking&quot; them.. Sounds stupid (what if they happen to be a more skilled psion then you are? Then you're fucked cause if some unknown person was trying to pry into my brain I would take as a sign of agression. Wouldn't you?) Plus it's rude(I'm not really one to talk, but really. That's just not something I, or anybody with a brain, would do). And on top of that &quot;hacking&quot; might not neccisarily mean combat, but it's still an act of agression (or can be interperted as one... Think about it. If somebody started trying to &quot;hack&quot; somebody like Roy, Rainsong, peebs, or another one of the mods... or me.. It would most likely be taken as &quot;hey, this asshole is trying to probe me... haha *smite*) He can clarify it all he wants, but either way, it implies combat, so I think it should be considered combat anyway.

			changing the question cause i wrote it wrong (no wonder i got an e in paraphrasing!*
<br />

<br />
Can remote viewing be used as a long distance connection in places where the normal connection (tendril between two minds) can not reach <img src="images/smiles/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
one i know that my poll has nothing to do with my question  i did that on purpose
<br />

<br />
two scorch
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
2. Respect Others 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
7. Keep Things Fun
<br />

<br />
i may not have been 3a good author but 2 respect others is nice to do scorch and these comments were not needed (Then you're <span style="font-weight: bold">fucked</span> ) ( hey, this <span style="font-weight: bold">asshole </span>) (That's just not something I, or anybody with a <span style="font-weight: bold">brain</span>, would do) i have a brain (And btw, you're an <span style="font-weight: bold">idiot</span>) (your poll and post are both <span style="font-weight: bold">stupid</span>) (closes threat with powers he doesn't have)
<br />

<br />

<br />
3 scorch your not a moderator so (It will be closed soon) (He can clarify it all he wants, but either way, it implies combat, so <span style="font-weight: bold">I</span> think it should be considered combat anyway) should not be there if all they do is hurt
<br />

<br />
4 i was not talking about combat or hacking random people, i wrote my question wrong (no wonder my teachers say i cant paraphrase)
<br />

<br />
5 i had too much grape soda
<br />

<br />

<br />
thank you and i hope this clears things up  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
