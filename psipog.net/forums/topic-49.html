			I think I am a natural empath. I sense the feelings of people I am close to or just some friends. At first I thought I only read my friends body language, but lately I've been feeling people's meotions over the net. When i was talking to a friend I suddenly felt sad and upset. Then I asked if something was wrong and my firend explained how her firned was pregant and such. I don't get overloaded with emotions, does this mean i have natural shields as well?

			Possibly, but if your not overloaded and this is true then signs point to yes, possibly a more selective shield on whose emotions to let in. Sort of a question for the question, why ask us? I mean if you had a natural shield you could deduce it from what you said, I mean were just going to read this and say it. If you wanted actual dead on results you should PM a seasoned Psion and ask nicely if they can scan you for one.

			I believe that most people have at least of hint of empathy when growing up.  Especially when people are younger (infants, todlers, etc..).  Whether or not people allow the senses to stay or develope I have no clue what determines that.  As for not overloading, I think the average person with natural skill really doesn't reallise what they are doing so they're sensitivity doesn't really get the point of where an overloading problem would occur.  Before any of the mentioned is stated as a fact I think more research would be needed but how the hell to go about that I don't know.  Just my observations.

			Pretty much as Dago said, empathy is the most common &quot;skill&quot; (some people might call it a curse =P) that people have without practice. The point where you start to worry is when you get overloaded and it interferes with your life. This happened to me (imagine taking a final feeling the frustration of 25 other people) and I had to learn how to shield myself, but as long as you're not getting overloaded then it seems like you've learned to do that subconsciously as well. Congrats, you're luckier than some of us. =)

			Yes, I personally find emotions can stick to your field. Just ground.
<br />

<br />
You should try practicing some empathic sending and receiving to see if you're sensitive to emotions.
<br />

<br />
And do as was mentioned before, get someone to scan you.

			I myself am a lot like you in the reguards that I can sense people of the net, in real life, etc. I've had this ability for as long as I can remember. I know that at some points if you become powerful enough emotions can be turned into words or even pictures. The fact that you have never been overloaded is for two reasons under a sort of theory I've been trying to come up with. One is that you are naturaly empathic. So it would make sense that you have adapted over time. The idea that when the colonists came over for Europe and colonized America, we brought disease which killed many Native Americans, but all those colonists live through those &quot;deadly&quot; diseases because their bodies already built an immunity. This is similiar in the fact that when a person makes themself empathic they don't know how to stop all emotions, while we subconsciously learn how to block it over time. The other reason is that you might have not been put into a situation where the emotions are too high for you to control. Being naturaly empathic means that you are not only able to feel emotions be manipulate people's emotions without even blinking an eye. If you were to get an overload it is because your subconscious is no longer able to fully control the other emotions. Your subconscious then sends out a sort of warning stating that its getting dangerous because you can't control it. Your conscious starts getting stressed and nervious. Your mind becomes so concentrated on the emotions that your &quot;adapted shield&quot; kind of gets turned off and you get hit by the brunt of the emotions with no protection. Kind of like if you were to try and hold back a huge amount of water with a wall. Suddenly an enormous wave pounds and breaks the wall. Then all of the surge <span style="font-weight: bold">plus</span> the normal water will rush in. So not only will you be feeling their emotions but because you no longer have a shield EVERYONE's emotions will hit you. It's quite overwhelming and dangerous.

As for the topic, yeah. I'm naturally empathic too. Heck, my first attempt at using psi (this was before I'd even found psipog, man am I glad I found here) was probably decently high-leveled empathy. 
<br />

<br />
What had happened was for a church activity we'd gotten blocks of ice and were sliding down a hill. Well, one of the girls there had gone down on the block and hit an ice block that was in the way square in the chest. She was having lots of trouble breathing, an ambulance was called, and she was taken to the hospital. Needless to say, the activity was immediately ended and everyone was taken home. 
<br />

<br />
Well, I got home and going on basically instinct I visualized her lieing on a bed and tried to draw the pain from her into me. Surprisingly, it worked. From her I got this sharp pain in the chest, around the sternum, and extreme difficulty breathing. I kept on doing this on and off as often as I could while still convincing my body I could breath until about 10:15 at night. Tomorrow morning I was told that she had died. The time she had died? About 10:15 at night. 
<br />

<br />
So, yeah. Don't know why exactly I decided to share that, but here it is.

			If I'm naturally empathic, then why can't I control it. I've tried many times to do the methods on psipog and various sites, but I can;t seem to feel their emotions. Whereas when I am around someone or just glancing over I sense an emotion. Even when someone IMed me over AIM i usally automatcially feel them a dn the i don't need to ask how are you, I just send, what's wrong, or why are so happy.
<br />

<br />
Should I still learn empathic shielding, just incase of the overload Tenkei_Enzeru was talking about?

			It's always good to learn shields. Most psionic ablities are controlled by shielding (psychokinetic geisting, telepathic/empathic overload, combat even)

			ive been a natural empath for about 3 years now... got me into a lot of trouble in public school.
<br />

<br />
it's easy to sense other's emotions but to block them out... that's the hard part. what works for me is to create a shield and fill it with a &quot;netural&quot; emotion like &quot;im cool... yeah... just sittn here chillin&quot; or something like that. really helps when you got an overload or something.

			I guess it could be entirely possible to be a natural empath. I don't see why not. If you can sense feelings without even scanning for them then you obviously have a gift. Good luck with it!

			actually, natural empathy isnt all that rare. most people have it and not realize it. go to a party. be in a crowd. you eventually will &quot;get in the mood&quot;. this is natural empathy in a sense. learning empathy is to my mind, to control your ability to sense emotions. that's the hard part.
<br />

<br />
ive been able to sense a person's emotions by observing their body's behavior, and by listening to them. this in turn, works as a sort of conduit to the person. ever had a friend lose something close to them, and feel the same way they do? that's from what i learned to be natural empathy. 
<br />

<br />
my real ability is to listen to a person, and their emotions can be read like a book. this however, can get you in a lot of trouble as i found out in public school. for some reason, other people's emotions are really easy to change my own. untill i learned to shield, i was rather unstable.
<br />

<br />
one interesting event was when i was on lunch break with my class. i don't have many recollections on what happened but i remember getting really angry and violent for no reason to a friend. i later learned that my enemy-at-the-time was for some reason angry with me and was watching me. i think i was feeding off him. because of my actions, i was suspended from school for a few days.
<br />

<br />
if anyone has any feedback on this &quot;natural empathy&quot; i discussed, please let me know cause ive seen proof that we all have it, some more sensitive than others but if i am wrong, tell me.
<br />

<br />
i'm just a really sensitive guy... 'snif'....
