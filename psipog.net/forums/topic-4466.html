			First, a bit of background: I've been doing PK for months, day after day, sometimes by hours in a day. Have been constantly improving, now I'm able to move bigger objects, even if by a little. Have quiet good control on sliding small objects, sometimes, when I start late at night, its amazing. Now, the other day I went to pratice some psi-balls (I know this is a PK forum, but this cross both domains), and noticed something very weird. I didnt quiet feel the energy getting shape in my hands, but when I looked down, I saw something that looked like some kind of smoke. At first tought I wondered if it was a start for pyro tk. I continued putting energy into it, and I could see it very clear. It didnt have color, was like some kind of warm distortion that you can see on very  hot surfaces, like roads on mid day, but the waves where more tiny and with higher frequency. I didnt smelled like smoke, so I think it it something else. Now, the real weird thing: since that happened, everytime I do PK, even by a small amount, I saw that smoke emerging from the object. I cant see clearly where it goes, but I have a feelling this smoke connects back to me, but dunno where. Have anyone seen something like that? I have read tons of articles everywhere and never seen a description that sounded like that.

			Very interesting. I took a model lightsaber hilt (NERD ALERT!!! <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />) and me and my friends all tried to make a blade for it out of PSI, and there was smoke coming out of the emitter...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> so im sure its related..

			Yes, As I write in the thread &quot;quantum physics&quot; I recently started to see waves. Those waves look ( a bit) like water evaporation on road on hot days. What I can see is that the peek of waves are slightly white ( or obscuring colors under) and at a &quot;low&quot; ebb,  colors are brighter.  (I suppose that higher density part of waves reflect more light and produce the white effect, lower density waves let pass more light thus enhance the vision of colors)
<br />

<br />
Now you say your see smoke like patterns. I think that they are electromagnetic waves of electrons. If you train your vision, you will see waves crossing ( which I supopose is the effect of smoke you see)
<br />

<br />
After practice you will be able to see that movement is produce after specific wave movements. By training your vision, your subconcious will learn to affect the patterns of waves and you will switch to another level in control ( and in power in a way because you will be more precise).
<br />

<br />
The difficult part in memory. The subconscious dosen't seem's to be very good in memorizing the patterns. But fortunately you can do it conciously. After visualisation of patterns and effects, and good sleep. Your sub will learn.

			hah that?s funny. I?ve been seeing smoke when attempting psi-balls as well, I was seriously seriously doubting my senses at first. It might be heatwaves, just looked a tad more smoky than that. Then again, after a harsh drumming session my body was literally smoking definitely due to heat.

			Lol nice pepsiboy. I seem to be saying that to a lot of your posts. Anyway, yeah I've gotten that &quot;smoke stuffz&quot; twice. Once in the car, and once in the shower. The shower was first, and i was like &quot;ah w/e its just steam&quot;. But it was like the only place there was steam, so i was just being skeptical. It could be limited Aura Vision, a mild Flare, or something else (next stop... the twilight zone... *music*). Either way it seems to represent a crapload of energy.

Star wars isnt nerdy man.. seriously. When i was like 5, star wars was IN. i mean me and my friends would like watch star-wars movies, and one of them had this whole rack of figurines, it was awesome. You think thats nerdy, try &lt;u&gt; Calculus the Easy Way &lt;/u&gt; , a book written to teach calculus, and at the same time be read as a fantasy novel <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

I actually believe you are correct.
<br />

<br />
A day or two ago, when I was in a trance-state, I just sort of stared &quot;through&quot; all the stuff around me... and after a few seconds it started all looking like it was composed of interlacing waves, horizontal and vertical (actually, both were intersecting diagnally, but you get the idea  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> )
<br />

<br />
So after that, I've decided to change my mindset from &quot;move that psiwheel&quot; to &quot;tell the waves that make up the psiwheel to create the psiwheel as a spinning object instead of a stationary one. Getting better results since then.

I agree with Mordak. It takes me about 10 seconds to focus my vision correctly, but I can see the waves of energy at will. I can also see what I refer to as the positive energy (the smoke is negative energy). The positive energy, or positive magnets (they <span style="font-weight: bold">are</span> like little magnets, after all) are like little white flashes, and sometimes they explode brightly and very visibly around an object I'm done PK on (I think that's a result of a failed attempt). they move around in 8-shaped patterns, in multiple directions, sometimes diverting from their 8-type pattern and just zig zagging a bit. What I see of them, i could not possibly count, as I see them in large numbers, especially after a while into a PK session. And, i'm sure that there is way more to 'em than I can currently see. It seems to me that I have control over the positive energy, and I use that to guide the negative energy, which I have no control over. I'm guessing that some kind of a balance, or near balance, of the energy is necessary for best psychokinetic results, but i've only been doing pk for a little over 3 weeks now, so it's I won't assume that is the case.
<br />

<br />
Truly, I have been able to see these energies, or &quot;magnets&quot;, for quite a while now, maybe 4 or 5 years since I first noticed em. I've always had a feeling they have something to do with gravity, and therefore, psychokinesis. I truly believe it's a partial perception, made visible somehow through conscious or unconscious mental training (the more i saw em, the more I wanted to see) of the electromegnatic grid that surrounds this planet, and is responsible, in part if not entirely, for the earth's gravitational pull.
<br />

<br />
I read up on ed leedskalnin, like two years after I saw these energies for the first time, and I read a report stating that HE stated he could see &quot;white dots&quot; of energy everywhere to someone who asked about how he built coral castle.
<br />

<br />
I am on the right track, but when I get too preoccupied with the possible explanations for it all when I'm practising PK, the object i'm practising on will not move quite as well as when i'm not thinking at all (not thinking in words anyway)... So, I don't know how much we actually have to understand, scientifically.... In fact, I'd go as far as to say that we don't have to understand a fucking thing beyond the act of doing it, detailing just enough to help our minds get the best results.

			This sounds interesting, i've had a similar experience, but i was hallucinating.
<br />

<br />
I had just came back from my friends country house, it was a 3 day drinking and grilling marathon. On the last day, i couldn't sleep at all, i was hung over like a sob and i had to go work that day.
<br />

<br />
Well, after four hours of carrying 15kg crates of booze around, i sat down to have a glass of water, and what do i see? All the surfaces of the room are smoking. The room was totally engulfed in smoke. I didn't freak, i knew i was hallucinating since i couldn't disrupt the smoke with my hands or at all.
<br />

<br />
But yeah, it was a cool experience.
<br />

<br />
By the end of the day, i was seeing molecules. I just looked at stuff and i could see molecules, magnified about 10000x times yeah, but everything was made of teeny-tiny shaking spheres.
<br />

<br />
Coolest hallucination ever.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
(I was okay after three days of rest and relaxation. But i still remember clearly what i saw and remind myself not to drink that much, never, again.)
<br />

<br />
But it's an interesting technique, i'll try it out and try to train myself to see those energywaves myself.

			Very interesting Xiouslaidyn, 
<br />

<br />
I do think that scientific knowledge help TK. But not while doing it. If you can give good infos to your subconscious on how it works, he may integrate the ideas and improve. 
<br />

<br />
I would?nt be able to say which part of waves are positive or negative. Since electrons have negative charges (convention in physics) I suppose we can say that white part ( dense part) are negative. I?am not sure we just affect the white parts since I think white parts and clearer parts both contain the same stuff but differently organized in space (density). 
<br />

<br />
I do agree that the effect produce is a magnetic one. Probably that waves of electrons are disturbing the magnetic field of objects.  I?am not sure this has to do with gravity since gravity is related to the tendancy of matter to attract other matter ( by mass). Gravity is a relatively weak force according to physics. Electromagnetism is much more likely to generate movement of objects in TK. 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, we are in the theory field. In practice, if you focus too hard on waves, you will have a free show but not necessarily mouvement of objects. I could not say why. Probably for the same reason if you focus too much on something else, you will not produce movement.
<br />

			Yes, I am being assumptive in saying which are positive and which are negative... I just intuitively believe that the white dots are positive, while the wavey ethereal smoke is negative, and I go with that assumption because it's the first thing that came to me once I started trying to reason it out...

			I have seen these waves around everything for my whole life, and the smoke as well (usually as the first step to seeing waves). If you notice, they're more apparent around live wires and magnets, and also around living things in a different sort of vibration. I call it &quot;the grid,&quot; because my stepdad was joking around about it one day saying stuff about foresaid grid. Very cool. Nice post.
