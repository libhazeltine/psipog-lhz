			lol this is the wierdest things that happen to me, atleast once every other day i get a deja vu, and when i get a deja vu its like really big deja vu... as in i remember remembering and start thinking whats gonna happen and remember that and know that its going to happen anyway.
<br />

<br />
its wierd but cool. when it happens everything like turns into a black and white sorta thing only in blue tint not black and white tint. in the other eye i see whats actually happening, like a split vision depending on which eye im focusing with. ive actuallly managed to change an event as well!
<br />

<br />
what happened was i had a deja vu which mine also go further than whats currently happening, about my dad walking into the kitchen, i started remembering thinking about hey i remember this, hey and these thoughts too,(i was hearing them in like echo), and was like wait hes going to say, such and such, and im going to be to busy with this to stop him, so i decided to stop him and when he walked in i said hey dad! and stopped him from talkinga bout the bread or something about food, i 4get it was awhile ago.
<br />

<br />
anyway i also have them in my dreams, which from what ive read is normal. but neway its pretty cool, and creepy at the same time
<br />

<br />
bwahaha! i am the master of the current and the recent future! lmao!
<br />

<br />
anyone else able to do this?

			From what I know, Deja Vu is random, so you can't be able to do it at will. But yeah, last Friday I had a very strong Deja Vu. My cousin was playing  Tomb Raider: Legend and I was watching. He was just about to hang from a roof's edge and suddenly I got the Deja Vu feeling and I knew what he was going to do for the next ten seconds. And he did all that.

			I have the same thing happen to me. But my vision only go's black and white, then its back to normal. This also happends to me every to every other day it just depends on how much rest i got the night before. I have it on random stuff like reading something in a book, or seeing someone in the hall at school. I have been having this for about six years now.

			Except for the split vision thing, yeah it does happen to me too!

You know how it is, when you can recall an image from a dream you had the night before, and you're looking at it at that current moment?!

It's so freaky!

It'd be really cool if we could start controlling our future by our dreams eh?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I've been getting them increasingly nowadays. One time, I had two in one school period. I get the Deja vu feeling and then for the next 10 or so seconds, everything seems familiar, the thoughts, what people say, what I see. As far as I can tell, I can't actually predict what happens, but I never remember to check thoroughly when it happens.

			I was going to do something in my friend's car last night, I don't even remember what, but I closed my eyes and not even two seconds later I saw a grey, 4-door car pulling out in front of us, and we wouldn't have had time to stop and would've had a car crash. But I haven't seen a car that even remotely looks like that since then. It's weird, I just kinda disregarded the thought, but I still keep an eye out for it.

			I used to get it everyday or near that a few years back... now I haven't had one in over like 6 months.  They would get anoying because for me I would go space cadet for a minute and my sub-c would like take over and I would observe everything really intricatly, I don't know how to explain it.  It was still fun though.

			Anyways... I've been in two car accidents, and one, i thought that it was going to happen.  I was with my family driving to Indiana for a wedding.  and as usual, i fell asleep in the first ten minutes.  I woke up half an hour later, and we were on a highway.  Nothing interesting, so i closed my eyes again, but i didnt see my eyelids this time.  I saw the car i was in, and my family and i were standing outside of it, staring at the smoking hood.  I didn't sleep after this, but i didn't worry about it too much either; i was just paranoid or something... but an hour later, the hood did start to smoke, and in a minute, my family and i were standing outside of the car, staring at the smoking hood.  we were two hours late to the wedding &gt;.&lt;

			I used to have the regular Deja Vu that most non-pis practicing ppl have... You know I went out to the mountains (i live in vegas nevada) with some family and i could swear i was there before, and i think i had a dream of the same thing happening but i was on a field trip insteada with my family.. and then i knew what the next stop in the mountain trail looked like before I got there... but it was fairly rare for me to get a realy definate vision insteada just that &quot;feeling&quot; it happend before.
<br />

<br />

<br />
But Ever since i REALY tried to get into the more mental and less physical/psionic part of psi... (wich is also the time I got closer to the woman of my dreams who used to be my friend{saying this because im not sure weather it was her or the psionics that trigerd it}) 
<br />

<br />
I had UBER strong deja vu(s) whichever the ploral may be... to the point where I went with her cross country when she moved and when i met her family besides ehr parents wich i knew when we were still friends. I could swear from the second i steped on to the steep steps of the outside of the house of some of her family on her mothers side that i KNEW that it had happend before. Then when I saw all of her family on both sides after that I could swear ive seen them all before... herd there voices and knew there personaltiies and what would happend with them in time. Now im back far away from her and the Deja vu has slowed back to just bairley above what it used to be... but every time i visit her or she visits me everything becomes slightly dream like.. and my Deja Vus are literaly increased 12 times more often then usual... like 1 a day at least and at least 3 a weak that are filled with details up the wazoo

			De ja vu is the result of an error in the brain... it has something to do with what you're currently seeing being written to the wrong area of memory, and so you end up thinking you've seen it before, when actually it's just a false memory of having seen the scene in question.

			I usually have something occur in a dream and Deja vu happens later. Wish I could control it. Like the Deja Vu isn't strong. I remember elements from the dream happening. Just not everything
