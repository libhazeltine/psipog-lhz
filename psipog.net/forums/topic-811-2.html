I wasn't saying it's not important. I was simply saying that most people don't really care about learning this stuff (ie. Not interested.).

Okay maybe I gave bad or over exaggerated examples. Still, many people over 18 dismiss the concept of psychic phenomena because of what they see in the media without ever looking into the subject. Many others may believe in psychic stuff but think it to be evil or demonic mainly because of thier religion's influence. And then there are the few that believe in it but do nothing, and a minute amount that actually practice psionics.

			What? Since when does psionics have to do with religion? Unless our nervous system has a religion? That's stupid. The media just doesn't know, probably. And if they do...so what?

People will treat us differently....like a different race. They'll want us dead...or they'll want to hurt us...we won't be accepted...and all for one major misconception.

			Psionics does not have to do with religion in any way. What i am saying is that some religions preach that psionics is demon worship or evil or the people who do them will go to hell or things like that and the people just follow the religion like sheep not thinking about any of it.

Usually my conversation goes something along the lines of:
<br />
&quot;well... you know how you have gut feelings about people right away?&quot;
<br />
&quot;yeah&quot;

&quot;I believe that the 'gut feeling' is a skill just like anything else, and you can learn to get better at it&quot;

<br />
The reason why the media dosen't talk about it is because psions don't come out in public much. They're afraid to reveal themselves when really many people are psions and many more believe.

			psionic in some way ties to religion because people before never actually understood what it was and, remember, that something misunderstood is feared.. before, people where too superstitious(in fact there's no word on how i can describe how superstitious they were) and since psionics was an unknown phenomena for them they feared it which drove them to conclude that it was tied with the &quot;DEVIL&quot;.. therefore, they jumped to a conclusion that it is evil and all that stuff.. actually, the truth about all this is that people fooled themselves with their own petty-over-religious-superstitious delima.. and those story books contribute to this.. they portray psionic or magick practicers as bad people.. 
<br />

<br />
and it doesn't get recognition as well since everyone sees it as something that is fictional nothing more. in their mind it is only something that was taken from a story book.. it's not because they are not interested in it, it's because since they have no solid proof that it exists therefore they need not persue the truth about it being real or not.. well for some people that is..

About her talking about astrology, appearantly it's a fact that religion is mostly based on astrology. Video google &quot;the naked truth&quot; if you know where i'm coming from.
