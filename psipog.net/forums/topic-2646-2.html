			I still think it's all mind over matter. If you look at his stunts, they are all related and form a pattern. Standing on a pole for hole many days, holding breath for so long, lying in a bath tub of ice cubes for a world record, bending bars, it's all stuff that's mind over matter. I would be suprised if psi was involved. It's stunts that you a)train your body for and b) convince yourself to do. This is the exact same as meditation. Those who read the convos in the meditation section will recognise the topic &quot;consuming prana&quot;.

Well, it's either that or he's just a complete illusionist/fake. I  would be dissapointed. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

It is TV.

Do you believe everything you see on TV? Was that alien autopsy video real or just another Fox game?

Bent bars? Fake bars.

because that works so well on live audiences that are a few feet away. Magicians don't generally use camera shit like that, they use sleight of hand and stuff, like the disappearing elephant thing, it's not done by cutting the elephant out of the image, it's done by putting mirrors in the cage bars.

Um.. No. It is 100% illusion. He isn't dabbling in anything, except to try and get silly girls to watch his show and go ga ga.

<br />
What magicians do IS special effects and yes, they hire actors all the time. Oh let me pick someone out of the audience, yes you there. That guy, is an actor. It doesn't go against why they do it. There are no rules for magicians, save for the unwritten one about not letting the public in on the gag.

I haven't seen it, but one way to do it is this.
<br />

<br />
Start filming
<br />
When he goes under the can, stop filming, and quickly rush him up to the roof without any of the background changing too much, resume filming, and it'll look perfect.

the one guy is an actor, not the whole audience, and do you realize how time consuming it would be to hire a whole audience of actors? They use sleight of hand, they don't use camera tricks, the whole thing about magic tricks is using simple tricks in complex looking ways, but camera tricks are too boring. Look at Blaine's fly resurrection, he doesn't cut the camera and say, &quot;okay, bring in the not dead fly.&quot; he freezes the fly and his hand warmth revives it. I do think that it's almost, if not all, tricks, but I don't think camera games are responsible, for one, they don't work on live audiences, and hiring an entire audience is absurd, for one thing it isn't profitable, for another it would take way too much time.

Live Audiences??

- Hired Actors!

Really i read on a forum on magic about a guy that wanted to go in a street where Criss Angel was performing but the guards stopped him unless he was one of the actors.

			&quot;how exactly would you know? have you read his mind?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Yes, I read his mind. And his script. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;the one guy is an actor, not the whole audience, and do you realize how time consuming it would be to hire a whole audience of actors?&quot;
<br />

<br />
UM.....
<br />

<br />
WTF did I ever mention anything about needing a whole audience? 
<br />

<br />
That one actor is all you need for the illusion to be pulled off. 
<br />

<br />
OR! A handful of actors. Or a small audience, sure. Remember that guy who made that statue of liberty dissappear on TV in front of all those people? They were paid actors. Like the people you see on David Blaine's and Criss Angel's shows. 
<br />

<br />
Some guy is on the street doing tricks. People gather round. He picks a few people to perform tricks with. The people round are amazed as he makes a quarter dissappear and reappear inside the guys sock in his shoe. Another has his ring made to dissappear and reappear in his gooch, the space between your balls and ass. The audience is wowed, how did he do that? Because those people are just lackeys, paid assistants to help along with the gag, who are force chosen from the audience. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;They use sleight of hand, they don't use camera tricks, the whole thing about magic tricks is using simple tricks in complex looking ways, but camera tricks are too boring.&quot;
<br />

<br />
They use a mix. Sometimes it's pure sleight and illusion. Othertimes it's camera tricks, cutting, and editing. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Look at Blaine's fly resurrection, he doesn't cut the camera and say, &quot;okay, bring in the not dead fly.&quot; he freezes the fly and his hand warmth revives it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
So what? His levitations use cutting, editing, and actors. He could palm a fly, or it could be cutting. Who cares, it's tv. When people find an object they signed their shoe or up their ass, they are a paid actor in on the gag. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;I do think that it's almost, if not all, tricks, but I don't think camera games are responsible, for one, they don't work on live audiences, and hiring an entire audience is absurd, for one thing it isn't profitable, for another it would take way too much time.&quot;
<br />

<br />
You obviously don't know what you are talking about. 
<br />

<br />
They mix it up dude. It's tv.
<br />

<br />
And yes, if they wanted, they WOULD use a live audience for TV. It does not cost much to hire extras, and TV shows raking in millions of dollars have a large interest in making you believe in the powers of the person on the show, and having unknown people allegedly on the street or in the audience attest to the miracles of the performer. John edwards et. al do the same things.
