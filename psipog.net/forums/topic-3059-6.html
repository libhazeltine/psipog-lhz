I meditated for around 10 minutes last night and around 20 this morning, for a total of 30 minutes. There was no noticeable changes in eye color, and no noticeable symptoms. Most likely, just 1 day isn't going to result in anything noticeable. I've got to wait longer.
<br />

<br />
I'll repeat this tonight and note any differences after school tomorrow. We've got finals...I'll still do it though.

			I'm trying it too. 20 minutes meditation per night, 5 or 10 when i wake up. I'll try to change my eye color to blue, and then try some weird colors like purple or orange.

3 days - so far no noticeable results. I'll post more results next week

I'm not &quot;sure&quot; if I'm using PK right, but I must be, or I'd be hurting myself. So far, no hurting has taken place. I'm guessing that's a good thing.

			i dont want to talk about that because the furom rules but i will say small thing god is beautyfull and like beauty so it is not wrong thing to change your appearance to look good instead of seeing people look at your bad sight and try not talk or look at you . 
<br />

<br />
i think that is not changing god creation it is making yourself look more better as you cut your hair and cleaning yourself to make yourself smells good.    that is answer to ahmed khorshed_5
<br />

<br />
for the main topic , lol we all here move the psi wheel and little people like about 5 or 6 can move pencils and other things so i think to change our appearance is realy hard and need alot of exp before we go start in something that we dont know its side effects.

It might have been &quot;The Craft&quot; but that's kind of offtopic...

Maybe one could even change the length of his/her hair eventually? (WITHOUT waiting years for it to grow  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />)

okay anyway, It's already my 20th or so day in my changing eye color experiment...
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">the results:</span> my dark brown eyes have changed to a more noticable lighter color and had a greyish tint near the pupils, under close observation on a mirror that is.
<br />

<br />
I tell my sub-c to change it to silver/white whenever I meditate.
<br />

<br />
it seems this thing may take more time than expected, then again I will put more enthusiasm, confidence, patience and time to it. And no side effects whatsoever happend since I started.

			Heh. Braindead...usually how I look most of the time.

Anyway, last night was completely tiring as I was studying for my finals today. No time to meditate, therefore no results...which is generally expected.
<br />

<br />
I'll meditate tonight, promise!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

I'll also re-organize my future logs, making them easier to read, and take less time to type out.

			Alright, I've been trying this for the last 3 days, and I'm actually noticing some results.
<br />

<br />
My eye color is naturally a grey-blue-green combo.
<br />

<br />
I want to change it to purple.
<br />

<br />
So, every day I constantly suggested to my subconcious (just by saying &quot;turn my eyes purple&quot; and imagining myself with purple eyes) to change them.
<br />

<br />
They're not purple yet, but there's a difference. My eyes have no green anymore. Wait, scratch that... my LEFT eye has no green anymore.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" /> It's a more blue color, on it's way to becoming purple.
<br />

<br />
My right eye is the same though... lol. Maybe I need to focus a little better.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, from my experience I would say that with time, this will definately work.
