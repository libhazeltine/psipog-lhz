			jesus guys. i dont have any proof and im not paranoid. i just wanna know what goes on in area 51 and if the government knows about psionics. until anyone provides an explanation and proof of what does go on, ill make up my own theory. i dont really believe that theory either. its just some random thought i came up with.

      That's cool, that you can't get into area 51. The government probably has lots of psions putting heavy shields on the place. personally, I wouldn't try breaking the shield. 
<br />

<br />
      As for what's in area 51, I used to think it might be aliens, but my dad says they're testing technology there. Real advanced crap. Thay have underground buildings, that's what the craters are. My dad's a pilot, and he flew over a corner of area-51 several times and looked down in there. One time, he looked at the radar when he was going over there, and planes started flashing on and off. What I mean is that the radar kept showing airplanes surrounding his plane and then they disappeared. Then they popped up again in different locations. It did that a couple of times, and then I think, someone came over the radio and, addressing my dad and the other pilot by their flight number, said that they were just testing a new kind of technology.

			i have the fact that the american government only started a remote viewing prodject because they found out there enemies were using it to get a edge on them. I love the idea of remote viewing being aplied in war though. I mean.. if you look at the big picture humans were made to survive right? We gained an edge and climbed the food chain. What better way to survive than to use your psychic abilities in war? Someday i hope to see my great great grandchilren on top of a building somewere negating a bomb with there mind  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

I agree with that.  I have heard that they have sensors so advanced that if you even so much as disturb the sand then alarms will go off.  They have so much advanced technology in that place it's not even funny.  They probably have spy planes that have advanced camoflage that even if you were looking for it in the daytime you wouldn't see it.  Direct energy weapons, new stealth technologies, supercomputers, when I get better at RP then I might try going there.  If you never hear from me again then you will know what happened. <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> 
<br />
But seriously I doubt they will hire psions to put up sheilds because if I RP'd there and went public with what I saw, who would believe me?  You guys might but how many people that aren't psions would believe me?  Not alot.  Not alot for the goverment to worry about.

			The covert projects done at Area 51 have long ago been moved somewhere else.  Why do you think the government would declassify its existence?  But really, let's get down to earth, people.  The only things being tested there are things that would normally be against the law and cutting edge aeronautics technology.

			Where to start...well first I like to correct someone who said they keep technology because people are afried of them. I'm not going to say your wrong, but I believe they keep it from the world for the only purpose of national sercuity.
<br />

<br />
I heard rumeners from some military people of the military such that there is a complete (TOE) or was it GUT (Grand unifeild theory). That the government are even able to use this theory to create teleportation devices (Big ones). I know for a fact teleportation is alive today, but the machine can only teleport photons (a laser) through in a random place. I know supercomputers that work so close to the mersoscale or even &quot;in&quot; mite exist. Such new planes such as the F-22 rapitor, that is not only smooth but evades radar &quot;AND USES RADAR&quot; which is of cource top secret.
<br />

<br />
Want to know a funny story? I tried to join the air force, which I was shortly kick out some time later. Here is my advice. Don't talk about your dreams! Now I have a personality disorder on my work form. Sure it's gone in 6-8 months...but its hard to explain while getting a job. Also don't make jokes about bombs...people in boot camp are so stressful.

JBoii, excellent find.  There are some experimental descriptions in chapter 5 that I've been searching to find for several years now.  I have copies of some of the Chinese studies on psionics, but several of the details mentioned in that document are new, and there are some studies I hadn't heard of at all.  And as Rain mentioned, the references list is worth it's weight in gold.  Thanks for posting it.  
<br />

<br />
I'd highly recommend that everyone read it (at least chapter 5) if you'd like to get an overview of several countries' government programs which have studied psionics (and their areas of interest within psionics).

			There's a guy in the CIA/FBI that teaches RV in a really short time, like a week or something. There was something about it on tv that my brother saw and he said that a number of his students were tested right after the guy finished teaching them. They had to draw out the route that this van was driving on. Also, they had to draw/name certain things that a guy in the van was pointing at with his camera. Most of them were right. Crazy stuff.

If Area 51 is sooo secret...why would they allow anyone else to look at it through google maps. I think we shouldn't take those maps to be true. The gov't isnt stupid and to allow a secret base like that to be monitored by random people on the internet via google maps is stupid.
