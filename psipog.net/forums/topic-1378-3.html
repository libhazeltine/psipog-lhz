			E=MC2 simply states that energy and matter are two forms of the same thing - like water and ice. It makes sense that if we can manipulate matter, we are in fact manipulating energy.

It's not a matter of if; it's a matter of how.

			Thanks, but I prefer to use more competent sources of information concerning <span style="font-style: italic">physics</span>. Matter cannot consist of energy and there is no pure energy in Universe. The thing is how to explain the transfer of kinetic energy from inductor to the flying cup or somthing you move with your mind; explain what are the <span style="font-style: italic">carriers of interactions</span> in this case.

What Todd presented on the link I posted was not without references:
<br />

<br />
1. Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, Bernard Diu, and Franck Lalo?, Quantum Mechanics, Volumes 1 and 2, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1977). 
<br />

<br />
2. John J. Brehm and William J. Mullin, Introduction to the Structure of Matter: A Course in Modern Physics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1989). 
<br />

<br />
3. Donald A. McQuarrie, Quantum Chemistry, University Science Books, Mill Valley, Calif. (1983). 
<br />

<br />
Those are pretty old texts. These concepts are not new.
<br />

<br />
An experiment in classical physics does not have to work every time; it only has to work most of the time for most of the scientists. This ?fudge factor? in classical physics is there to account for things that occasionally happen in our physical world during an experiement that have no physical science supporting them. 
<br />

<br />
Things happen in the physical world for which there is no classical scientific explination.
<br />

<br />
TK is one of those.
<br />

<br />
Quantum science accounts for it. 
<br />

<br />
E=MC2 flatly states that matter and energy are two forms of the same thing.
<br />

<br />
Resistance to information that conflicts with the paradigm is not uncommon.

Of course, no. I read those references on the page. Old texts do not make them postulate correct things. Todd Stedl is Ph.D. in Chemistry and I respect <span style="font-style: italic">his point of view on quantum mechanics</span>. If you are so interested in this I may suggest to read a book by Nobel Prize winner L. Landau and E. Lifshiz &quot;Quantum Mechanics&quot; or even another NP winner, an outstanding american physicist, Richard Phillips Feynman - his lectures on physics.

Second: the theory of relativity needs a revision and specification of machanical laws. As we know, equations of the <span style="font-style: italic">classical dynamics</span> (i mean second Newton's law) satisfy to a principle of a relativity relatively to the Galileos' trnsformations and so on.. This means that moving from one inertial system to another with low speeds like v&lt;&lt;c, equations of the relativity dynamics transfer to <span style="font-style: italic">classical</span> ones, because in this area their correctness is proved by <span style="font-style: italic">an experiment</span>. We also neglect flaw of masses here.
<br />

<br />

&quot;Within the mystical texts relating to the creation of golems two themes consistently reappear. The first theme is that two or more practitioners, working together, are needed to create a golem, and there are many instances of this occurring. For example, every Friday Rabbis Hanina and Hoshia studied Sefer Yetzirah  to create a prime calf which they ate as their Sabbath dinner (B  Sanhedrin 67b). Rabbi Schlomo ben Aderet, known as The Rashba, held that it was significant that this was done on Friday, the day in which mammals were originally created (Genesis 1:24)&quot;
<br />

<br />
I don't know where you're going to find an enlightened enough individual that is capable of creating complex matter in this day and age.  However if you know and believe that the power is within you (as it is within all of us), then anything is possible.
<br />

<br />
It also says in the paragraph previous that he had successfully created a calf after three years of study, then had to try for another three years to successfully do it again.  The world is a complex organization of thoughts and ideas and our will (which is in the end, a part of the Creator's will) can bend reality to our liking.  For example, those that believe that moving an object with their mind is impossible, can't move an object with their mind.  Those of us that do believe it can, although we can only move it very slightly - because our previous experiences and ideas are telling us that it requires a humongous amount of forces beyond our control to move.  That is why you will see an exponential increase in psionic skill, because your mind is breaking away barriers that make it believe that it cannot do certain things.
<br />

<br />
Or at least, that's my view on the subject. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  Let your own experiences and thirst for knowledge form your basis of reality.
<br />

			Ok let me try to put a different perspective on this folks, what is matter precisely? We know for a fact that it is made of protons, nuetrons, electrons. However, that is not the end of the story, it breaks down into 6 different forms of quarks and 2 forms of leaptons. The way it works out, there are 16 possible combinations between up quarks, down quarks, up/down quarks, anti quarks, anti leaptons, ect the list goes on. 
<br />

<br />
If you look at the Big bang it was supposedly tweedledums &quot;represents several forms of these exotic particles and tends to contract space&quot; where as space and time wasn't what we would reconize today. Don't remember all the details of it but theorectically speaking it all came from one particle that basically had a screen image splitting into all these other different particles and that there was two universes made, ours, which expands and then the other universe that is made of nothing but exotic particles and anti-matter plus negative time, with space contracting. 
<br />

<br />
Anti-matter and matter are all made of same things but with different combinations of these exotic particles and we are getting to the point where we can begin to create these things.

Mind-over-matter usually only effects the body of the practicer, not the external physical laws, thus the practicer is altering/modulating the physical laws of his own bodily matter slightly. This is what I thought atmo-consciousness was: a form of consciousness that is atomic, not just neural.

Oh, it would create a helluva lot more energy than that.  A matter-antimatter reaction is one of 100% efficiency, the only 100% efficient method known.  10 grams of Anti-matter could power the whole United States for 2 1/2 years.

			Indeed, my friend. But it matters not because we speak about different things: there are some experiments with polirized photons. This is a new method which is applied to new age crypthography and you can find some information on the subject in Scientific American journal or global network. I heared interview with some scietists saying that they obtained the non-locality effect during those experiments.

Lol, it actually equals energy.<span style="font-weight: bold"> A handful of antimatter detonated would equal more or less the energy released from an atomic bomb. </span>I think you should start reading up a bit as well. And Energy=Force is like saying Baseball Bat=Swing.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Oh, it would create a helluva lot more energy than that.  A matter-antimatter reaction is one of 100% efficiency, the only 100% efficient method known.  10 grams of Anti-matter could power the whole United States for 2 1/2 years.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Actually.
<br />

<br />
US uses roughly 3.66 trillion KW/hours. <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/fields/2042.html" target="_blank">https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/fields/2042.html</a> 
<br />
1KW/h = 3,600,000 Joules. So thats 13,176,000 trillion Joules.
<br />
1 gramme of anti-matter according to NASA produces around 180 trillion Joules. So youd need a little over 73 kilos of anti matter to power the US for a year.
<br />

<br />
Although 180 trillion is more than twice the power of the first nuclear bomb a modern ones can be some thousand times more powerful and 4 or 5 hundred times the power of a gram of antimatter so LOTRfool is about right.
<br />

<br />
(I know most of this cause I wanted to know why it wasnt our power source. Turns out its because it would cost well, well, over quarter of a million times the GNP of the US every year...)
<br />

<br />
Although just so people dont go thinking antimatter is weak sauce, one gramme would power your house for well in excess of 5000 years.
