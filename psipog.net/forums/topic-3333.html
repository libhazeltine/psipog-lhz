			hmm. well if you can move the psi wheel without looking at it then i suggest moving it without a container first, then ask a friend to put it on top at any random moment and see if it works just as good.

			I started practicing with the glass first for several days with no success, then I took it off and I could move (and control) it 'pretty' easily, now I put the glass back on and I can make it twitch a bit. So just keep practicing, you'll get it eventually.

			One thing I think that helped out the blind person in that one experiment that could also be a factor is that when people that can see are trying to focus on something they use their vision so you may be focusing on the glass instead of the actual psi-wheel, while a blind person probably focuses on the feel of it and stuff instead so they don't need to use vision to focus on things. Just a thought though...

			thank you all for the help.  i read the article sent to me and it said to become one w/ the psi wheel.  I imagine the psi wheel and i are the same color and the rest of the room is white is that enough of a connection between the two of us?  it said in the article that if you dont have a strong connection it will be harder to move later on.  That sounds like my problem because now i cant make it move at all i guess ill just try making a stronger connection w/ it first.

			Yeah try to be casual with connecting dont force it, you need to feel one with the wheel, i think of it as being me. me, the wheel and everthing else on the plannet have the same energy, since this is my energy i can do with it what i please.

			Wow. Uh, I think the bit about the focusing on the container was right. I was trying this about ten minutes ago and the tupperware bowl I was using started to turn. That was, um, kind of odd. I thought moving larger objects was supposed to be more difficult, is it not?

			Thats what your brain tells you, that is the mental barrier &quot;this is a big object, ill never move this&quot; same as the container &quot;there's a container over it i cant get to it&quot; we have been brought up to use the laws of physics this way, where as we know its not really true, we need to make our sub-c know this too.

			Ok, tried repeating that as a mantra, and this time I knocked the whole thing over; my little psi wheel rig and my container. Pushed it right off the table. Seems you are right, but this has had some very unexpected effects. I did happen to achieve a trance like state, which is apparently condusive to positive results, even undesired ones. I'm going to have to give this more practice. Please attempt this yourself, and see if you get similar results.

Note: what was really bizzrae was that this wasn't the usual short jerky movements I get when pushing a pencil, this was <span style="text-decoration: underline">fast</span>  and quite frankly freaked me the hell out.

			what mantra are you repeating?  and how to we make our sub-c know we can do it w/ the container?  i probably sound stupid but i need to get that clarified.

			As embarassing as this sounds, it was kind of a Matrix/Yoda-ism. I was saying over and over again, &quot;Size matters not, distance matters not, mass matters not, obstacles matter not, gravity matters not, friction matters not...&quot; just repeating it over and over again until I believed it. I'm working on repeating it until I know it.  
<br />
You don't sound stupid. I think you have to kind f feel with that part of your brain, and switch it on, then tell it this stuff.
