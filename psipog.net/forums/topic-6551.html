			i was wondering if this would be good for a temp shield.
<br />

<br />
 my dampening shield
<br />

<br />
I sat in a comfortable position in a quite place, with my eyes closed, I went to my basic psychic level, and then I saw my body in my mind. I then straightened my right arm out and saw that in my mind. Then I pictured a dark energy sphere gathering in my right hand. I then made the sphere grow larger and larger, then the sphere covered my body and started spinning around my body faster, and faster until I liked the speed, then I felt the shield to check its density. I visualized the spinning energy as dense as I wanted and then when I sensed that the shield was dense enough then I say, “This dark shield shall absorb any dark energy that comes its way, or weaken what it can’t absorb by as much as it can” I repeated this twice.Then I pictured the energy collapse into a small dense black sphere and said, “When I say shadowsphere this dense black orb shall become my shield, when I say collapse it shall become a small black sphere again and reside within me until I call it out”, I repeated this twice as well. 
<br />

<br />
so would this be a good shield? i would appriciate any feedback so i can improve my shieling, thanks.

			Well, as all such things go, it depends on the situation. However, I would take out the part about &quot;weaken what it can't,&quot; since that could hypothetically cause you to mentally associate failure with the shield, and you can guess the possible results of that. You could, however, word it like this: &quot;Weaken all negative energy that comes this way, and absorb all the energy it can.&quot; At first glance, it may seem like I just said what you said, but notice how I didn't use words like &quot;can't...&quot;
