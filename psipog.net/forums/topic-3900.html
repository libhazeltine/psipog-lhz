			hey just wanted to ask sometime. I need help on something here. Everytime I try to move the psi wheel, and it JUST STARTS to move that little BIT.
<br />

<br />
youknow that? when it just starts to move, and the psi kicks in? Anyone who's done psychokinesis should understand that right?
<br />

<br />
ok, back to my problem, instead of &quot;feeding&quot; more psi to the psi wheel, I can't stop that &quot;Euphoria&quot; feeling we all get when we realise that our &quot;psi-meter&quot; isn't defective. 
<br />

<br />
How do you stop yourself from being so happy and excited everytime you move the wheel? I mean, i'm like, YES ITS MOVING....then 1 second later it just stops.?
<br />

<br />
tips?

			Keep doing it until you get used to it.
<br />
Than you will have the &quot;normal&quot; feeling and than you will be beter in it.

			You got to learn how to focus, instead of thinking. Thinking is often interpretated as focussing. Thoughts are no focus at all. Focus is really <span style="font-style: italic">being there</span> with your presence, your awareness, your consicousness. Experiencing the psi-wheel in it's fullest and not thinking about it. When you do this, it doesn't matter if it moves, because you will still be present with your focus on the psi-wheel and you will just <span style="font-style: italic">be</span> there with your conscious energy all over those molecules. Therefore, you cannot think: Oh look! Its moving yay! It is impossible to be in concentration, ?nd using the process of thought at the same time. This is why the psi-wheel stops when you start to think about how it is moving. The moment before, you experienced a moment of focus, no-thoughts. Because of that little moment of focus, the psi-wheel moved, but you could not remain focussed, but started thinking. 
<br />

<br />
Next time the psi-wheel moves, notice how your thoughts start to come and how excitement starts to come. Then when you notice that, bring your presence back onto the psi-wheel. As if you teleport your entire being, your entire body, onto the psi-wheel...and experience that. Experience the shape and structure and texture of the psi-wheel again. Fully <span style="font-style: italic">be</span> there. Then you won't think about it. And even if it is moving...if you are in real focus, that would not matter, it still remains the psi-wheel, just in momentum now, nothing special about that. You will be able to maintain focus. this is the key-element in PK. Focus. For me, it's all about that.

			I have kind of that problem, and like MartialArtist said, really it's about focus. I get very excited when it moves, and snap, there goes the concentration. What I found helps is just ignoring everything. Like, this is going to sound contradicting, but ignore that the psiwheel moves, but don't ignore that it's there. I guess a better way to explain it is to just accept it's moving, but act as if it's like breathing; it just happens and is normal, no need to get excited about breathing.

			When I first moved the psi wheel, I did think that what you said, but then I had another idea about it.  I wanted to push the paper off the nail, so the feeling of turning the wheel subsided and I focused on pushing it off. Soon afterwards, it fell off.  So I think that when you see something spetacular, do freak over it and start being happy, do that after your done with doing whatever your doing.

			Yeah, of course. I do it when I get the wheel to turn just a bit  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> It's a small victory, but a victory nonetheless.

			It helps to [obviously] focus on only the object and care nothing of what will happen or what has happened. Think of what IS happening. Be with the moment, as the moment. Or at least this works for me.
<br />

<br />
While fighting you must imagine that you are fighting for your life, but not care weather you live or die. If you understand . . . The same applies to concentration.
