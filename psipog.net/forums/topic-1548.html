			Heres a little concentration/meditation exercise that i swear by. (if your not too good at meditation this is probably gonna be hard for you).
<br />

<br />
Step1: Imagine your on top of a big spiral stair case with 11 steps, now try and imagine this stair case in as much detail as possible, so what are the stairs made out of (wood, stone, paper!(realstic is probably better but experiment see waht works). But try and decorate this staircase as much as you can make it as personal to you as possible.
<br />

<br />
Step2: Imagine your self walking down the first step and mentally say to yourself &quot;deeper psychic level&quot;. Try and feel the stpes use your senses, so see it feel it and hear it etc. Do that 10 more times and on each step say 'deeper psychic level'.
<br />

<br />
Step3: After the 10th step say to yourself &quot;I am now totaly focusees and am at a good level to perform psychic exercises, I can easily return to this place whenever i want by simply counting from 3 down to 1 3.......2.......1.&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">The top parts were used from a book which i read but ive lost sicne so i cant give credit if anyone knows then please tell me it and i will add it to the post</span>
<br />

<br />
My own variation added to the exercise:
<br />

<br />
Imagine your self walking towards a door, again personalise this door, is it a great big medievil door, or a tiny miniture door which somehow your going to squeese through, really try and add your won personality and prefernces to this door. Reach out and feel the door is it cold? or is it hot? Is it rough to the touch? Then try knocking on it, what kind of sound does it make. IS there anything else on the door, prehaps its been grafitied?. Really personalise it.
<br />

<br />
After you have a good feel for the door open it, decide how your going to open it, if its some kind of furturistic door do you open it by command?. Or is it just your conventional twist knob door?
<br />

<br />
When the door is open step inside, as you step inside imagine an area you feel safe or that you think is appropriate. Depending on waht im doing my place changes i think its probably better to keep things the same but my mind wanders and bores easily so it likes to surprise itself. What is your place like is it pictroesque hill sides, or deep in space with beautiful lit up stars. Again personalisation is the key here <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
In this place imagine there are certain areas you can go, like in my personal area i have random doors across the place wich lead into differnt areas, each with a name on the front of the door of the thing i can practice. SO for example if i would like to try and AP (Astral Project) then that would be written on the front of the door. Again personalise it <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
You could just stay in your personal place and sit down and meditate and think on things. I use this as a great focussing exercise and all round fun exercise to perform. It also allows me to try things that i cant do in real life, and also almost communicate with my self <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
I hope you like the tech and i hope it comes in use, i know it helps me. Bear in mind i have personalised this tech from the information i have gathered over my years of browsing (i have never taken it seriously tbh). So a big thankyou to those sources which have helped me.
<br />

<br />
Ok bb all sorry for the typos, its late ill correct them tomorow <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.

			This is great! An awesome mental anchor for any psychic ability, or any activity indeed. Thank you, I will certainly use this! The doors and rooms thing is very intelligent, much better than the stair visualization.
<br />
Our mind knows that when we go through a door, we get to a new place, and therefore, visualizing personalized doors are ideal for this purpose.
