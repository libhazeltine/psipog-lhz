			Hey, I'm new around here, thought I'd jump in because of my interest in the occult (if you'll excuse the expression). The scepticism here is ironic IMO--psions disavowing the existence of less-attuned psions? The logic behind a psychic vampire is that they have some natural energy deficiency and need to take from others to replenish their lacking supply. Check out sanguinarius.org and go to the messageboard, I've found it really interesting.

			I don't think anyone was disavowing their existence, but making a distinction, in particular between the real thing and posers. Unfortunately in these circles, the psychic, the metaphysical, the occult, there are far too many poser people and things need to be put into perspective, as a result the skepticism is more a defence mechanism - not denial of an existing phenomenon.
<br />

<br />
I've read that on the American east coast villagers believed in vampires as a result of Tubercolosis, the disease would pass on to others killing them, and when the previous victims bodies were exhumed the blood remained liquid in their veins and hence people asumed that they rose from the grave or something along those lines to reek a most horrific vengence. Emphasis on reek, corpse with fluid? not nice

     I'll throw in my two pennies here.  There is a good bit on Amazon.com for those interested on the subject, and your local library will have some 'referenece' material on these lovlies (not much but some).
<br />
     I picked up a book on Psy-vamps by a chap that goes by Kostintinos, or some such.  He has several books out (summoning spirits, using electronic devices to talk to the other side( see 'White Noise'), etc.).  All the books preach the concept of responsible use, but Mr. K states, rather flatly, that there are some that will not use their power/gift/curse responsibly.  There are also those who don't know they are doing it, or cannot control it because they've never been shown how.  Push comes to shove, look for a new-age store or, as cliche as it sounds, a used book store.  They're treasure troves for stuff like this.

			Yeah, unfortunately, there are going to be imitators and imposters for every culture in the world. Miss Cleo being the classic example. Actually, I've heard the &quot;big thing in fashion&quot; for 2006 is supposed to be a darker, industrial look, with fishnets and ripped black clothing and the like. Sickening, really. I can't imagine industrial suddenly becomming ab-fab. Bletch.

			I don't personally believe in psi vampires. Not ones that NEED to vamp energy, anyway.
<br />

<br />
Psi isn't a vital function in your body, so even if you couldn't generate it, it wouldn't matter, would it?
<br />

<br />
The current theory is that it's a byproduct of the nervous system, so basically anybody with a nervous system produces it.
<br />
You could argue that inability to produce psi energy could be a birth defect, similar to blindness, etc.
<br />

<br />
But if the nervous system produces psi energy as a byproduct, how would it compensate if it couldn't dump somewhere? If there are parts of the nervous system &quot;fuel&quot; that aren't needed (psi), then where would it go, if one was a vampire?
<br />

<br />
Nobody really knows enough about psionics to say for sure, but this is my opinion.

			The theory of psi being a byproduct oft he nervous system always seems to me to be a tad far fetched. Such a thing could be detected using an ecg when a psion is concentrating and actually using psi, the abnormal neural patterns would be relatively easy to find. And if psi was a byproduct of neural activity, most animals would have it as well, althought hat depends on what is meant by &quot;byproducts of the nervous system&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Stories of vampire like things have been going arounda cross the world for centuries. Human imagination is limited, while human exaggeration is not so this kind of thing has some root in fact. So I always keep an open mind, and if one day i suddenly find someone suckling on my life force/chi/psi/neural byproduct/(insert bodily fluid here)/ I would feel quite stupid.

			I've got a small question that relates to psi-vamps, but not much probably. It's probably something else anyway. As roy said, 99% of people are bullshit in this case.
<br />

<br />
I just tend to feel depressed when around other people. I'm happy when I'm away from people though, and that's what confuses me. Even if I'm talking to people on MSN, using forums, etc, I'm fine. But when I'm near people...yeah.
<br />

<br />
I mean, a psi-vamp would have the exact opposite effect - they'd practically exchange moods with the people they're around.

Lawl, my whole school's depressed. (But really, help me)

			Artful Dodger, animals do produce psi energy. They just don't tend to use it.
<br />
Cats sometimes use manipulative skills (in the form of links) apparently, but most animals (in my experience) are perceptive, rather than manipulative. Unintentional broadcasting in distressful situations is the only skill that uses psi energy that I've personally experienced animals using.
<br />

<br />
You won't find animals using psychokinesis or making constructs (except links), but they do produce psi.

			thnx I didn't know that - I'm curious, you say they produce the psi and can percieve it from your experience - would you mind elaborating on that? and you say cats can form links? I'll go read about it, but I'm asking about your experiences in particular.
<br />

<br />
Any experience in other life that doesn't have a nervous system producing psi? It would seem that part of the psi question could hinge on that. The by product of the nervous system model is out of the question if trees etc. produce psi, but if they don't then the particle model comes into the picture. That psi could be &quot;particles&quot; in the photon sense, energy emitted by falling an exergy level or in this case, falling from an excited level of neural activity to a lower state. But then more questions. sorry! Huge tangent.

			Dodger, I'm not too sure about the whole &quot;trees producing psi&quot;. You'd have to ask someone more sensitive.
<br />
In my PERSONAL experience, animals have only used perceptive abilities (telepathic/empathic receiving), except for unintentional broadcasting.
<br />

<br />
The fact that they can broadcast should imply they produce psi energy, but for the record, animals do have an energetic field or &quot;aura&quot;.
<br />
(I personally believe that energetic fields are waste psi energy.)

			Thanks, didn't know that. Now however the threat of the Psychic Vmpire Super Kangaroos is all too real. I always said they were coming (twitch)
<br />

<br />
Are animals aware of their perception of psi? or do they accept it as part of the world, as a part of what everything/one should percieve? I suppose the prospect of psi-vampire animals is going too far...

			Animals seem to realise what they are perceiving. 
<br />
If I was to send a telepathic message to one of my dogs stating &quot;stop barking&quot; for example, and assuming my sending worked (ie, left my body and got to the target), they would recognise this as a command from me (whether they know it's me because I'm the only person to have sent telepathic messages to them, or if they interpretted my sig, I'm not sure).
<br />

<br />
Occasionally, they will argue against the command. You know when dogs are on a couch or bed and won't budge if you tell them, and dig themselves deeper into the covers? Well, it's like that. Telepathically, you can also pick up things like &quot;But I'm so comfy...&quot; etc.
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure if this is an intentional reply sending, or just passive telepathy on my part. 
<br />
When thoughts are directed at a person, as if to get the message across to a person, the thought itself is literally directed toward the person (in the form of a weak sending), in my experience.
<br />
I think Rainsong once mentioned this in a seminar, that you'll get overloaded much quicker if you're the centre of attention.
<br />

<br />
Back on track, they effectively attempt to reply. Usually something incredibly simple and easy to interpret (probably due to the significantly lower complexity of an animals mind in comparison to that of a human).
<br />
To me, telepathy with animals feels a lot different than telepathy with humans. There is more empathy involved.
<br />

<br />
Animals are much more sensitive than the average human, and have much simpler minds, and so it's much easier to use telepathy in both forms with animals.
<br />

<br />
In conclusion, animals appear to be aware of what they perceive, but unintentionally send, but sort of...know they are doing it.
<br />
Hard to explain, hopefully you'll understand.
<br />

<br />
P.S. If I forgot to mention it at some point, I'm saying it now. THESE ARE MY OPINIONS AND OBSERVATIONS, NOT FACTS.
