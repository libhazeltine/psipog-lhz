			I have but one question here.. My Aunt came over, shes a powerful psion compared to me, after waking up this morning I realized I was much more powerful than days previous, increased Auric sight, Psi balls are a breeze and I'm more alert phsychially (I can NEVER spell that right, bear with it please..) but anyway I was wondering if its possible, upon coming in contact with that of a higher power, to try and &quot;level the score&quot;?

			Well there's a telepathic skill called suggestion, wich is pretty much telling someone that they want to do something, but I'm not sure about the extent of the powers of suggestion.

			Actually, (I'd recieved permission first) I've pulled telepathic suggestion before and i didnt have all the bodies sensations as I did when overshadowing my girlfriend, short and sweet, I once told her to walk downstairs (tele. suggestion) and she did it but I felt nothing, saw it all but thats the extent of that. She walked back upstairs and i overshadowed her this time, I must say its interesting feeling literally everything a girl does when walking downstairs, room temp, motion, sight, hearing, the whole 9 yards. Once i pulled out she said she felt as though she took a backseat, like in a car being taken somewhere by her mom, watching everything on a &quot;tv&quot; as it hapened.[/i]

			Try making a psiball and you'll see. I wish I could cool myself down effectively like that, I've tried it before, only works a bit. I just use visualization.
