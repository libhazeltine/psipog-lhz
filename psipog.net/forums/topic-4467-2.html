Well, this definition is made by western people, I guess.
<br />

<br />
Here is a definition made be the famous yogi Swami Rama:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yoga defines itself as a science--that is, as a practical, methodical, and systematic discipline or set of techniques that have the lofty goal of helping human beings to become aware of their deepest nature. The goal of seeking to experience this deepest potential is not part of a religious process, but an experiential science of self-study. Religions seek to define what we should believe, while a practical science such as meditation is based on the concrete experience of those teachers and yogis who have previously used these techniques to experience the deepest Self. Yoga does not contradict or interfere with any religion, and may be practiced by everyone, whether they regard themselves as agnostics or members of a particular faith. &quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
If you were born in India for example, you would have seen yoga just as you see the western science now, becuase it does work...
<br />
Do you thing that millions of people for over 2500 years studies a method that doesn't work? <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

   It's not a science. It doesn't actually attempt to explain how humans or anything works. It doesn't look at the chemical/biological processes. It doesn't really involve much if any psychology that I've seen. It doesn't do any of that. It's not a science.
<br />

<br />
   I don't see Yoga as being bad. I think it's pretty good as just a physical exercise. I don't care much for it for when it comes to meditation though. But that is it. Not a way to reach &quot;enlightenment&quot; (which I don't believe in) or any of that. It's just a good way to exercise your body. I don't really care much for all the non-physical parts of Yoga myself; it's good for my back is all.
<br />

<br />
   &quot;Western&quot; society tends to do things better. &quot;Western&quot; medicine is much better. Our logic is better than &quot;Eastern&quot; philosophy. The list goes on and on, but I don't think you want to hear about that. I use &quot;&quot; because the same applies to non-good medicine in the West too. New age trash and all that.

How can you even say these things. Have you studied &quot;Eastern medicine&quot;? How did you compare these medicine to the Western medicine? Have you ran tests on people using both medicine? And what about our society, how is something as complex as a society examined properly enough as to conclude that Western society is <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">better</span></span>? How dare you even use the word <span style="font-style: italic">better</span>. How dare you say we as Western people are better at these aspects than eastern people. How Selfisch and blind you are. I bare with you. 
<br />
Our logic is better? Do you know all human being that go by the ways of the Eastern Philosophy and do you know all the people that go by Western philosophy? Have you manage to compare them properly in a scientifically responsible way? <span style="font-weight: bold">Sources please, sources. </span>
<br />

<br />
You lack most of what you are accusing me and others of, those are: Proper Knowledge and stating sources when you are making powerfull claims. You make ridiculous claims which really prove to me really how ignorant of a person you are. You are just trying to be right all the time. Every thought which falls outside of your little mind, is stupid. And every person behind that thought must be a stupid idiot right? Ignorant child.
<br />

<br />
Oh and btw, why don't you try for instance to compare the level of happiness, peace and contentment between the West and the East? Or in other words, between you and someone who goes by the ways of the eastern phylosophy? Because is that not what matters most? Is that not why we have medicine, society, infrastructure, and all that chaos in the first place? Is not every action we perform, an action performed because we are in search of more peace, happiness and contentment? If you honestly observe yourself, with an humble mind, you will see that these are the aspects you are searching for. It is the reason behind every action. Would you even do <span style="font-style: italic">anything at all </span>if you were<span style="font-weight: bold"> 100%</span> content and at peace and happy? Think about it. Really think about it. Try not wanting to prove your right for once, instead try wanting to know the truth, regardless wether or not it in harmony with your already conditioned thought-forms.

	Actually, I think that we first started using herbs and all that stuff because we accidently (or perhaps some other reason) used it when we were first cavemen. Nope, I can't back that up. That's before written history. After that we learned more about all those other things for various reasons. To help cure humans, to find out more about the universe, on accident while doing something else, and so on. Which do you want me to back up?

&quot;Would you even do anything at all if you were 100% content and at peace and happy?&quot;

	Of course I would be doing more. I'd try to make this world a better place. I'd try to make myself happier too.

			DanielH, Everything I have seen you write on this forum EVER has been an annoying, small minded comment about the negativity of anything. Not once have I seen a positive contribution to the welfare of the site apart from deleting BS of newbies. Not once have I heard a piece of insight come from you. Not once have I felt positive support from you for anyone. You've never even posted a video on PK or done anything that might inspire the newbies to be less fluffy. You may think that you're purfying the world by yelling at everything you don't fully understand, but you're only contributing to your own personal downfall. I'm tired of it, and I think if you stopped even for a day, you would find yourself in a more easy going world with much less hostility.

you know i dont mean to jump in but what you are doing is completely wrong.  so you have the power to change people posts but you are going through and changing his opinion that he is telling other people.  it is their choice to decide whether or not to believe him.  last time i checked you dont need sources for an opinion.  i would say back off and try to open your mind and then i might start respecting you again as a moderator

You need sources to back up what you say. An opinion like &quot;Damn, that movie sucks&quot; doesn't need a source. An &quot;opinion&quot; like he makes does require sources. I don't want people to believe fluff.
<br />

<br />
My mind is open. The problem is that some people have a mind so open that their brain is about to fall off.
<br />

<br />
I don't care about your respect or lack of. I don't even know who you are.

believe what u want, I personnaly don't care.
<br />
I care about my own mental health, and probably DanielH is doing the same, instead of blindly believing things.

I'm not saying everything's crap or true, just trying to get a rationale behind all your stuff.... isn't that fair????

Your problem is that you are basing your opinion on things you heard/read.
<br />

<br />
Other people here base their opinion on their self experience.
<br />
IMO self experience is like many times more interesting, relevant and valuable.
<br />

<br />
Else then asking from people to back up their self experiences with sources, I think the policy should change and people, if there are interested in commenting on other's self experiences, should first try the things for themselves.
