			I can't explain this.  I don't know if it was a tk or something else.
<br />

<br />
I was at work spraying some cleanser on a table, I was thinking of absolutely nothing and this empty plastic cup slid a good 4 or 5 inches away from me.
<br />

<br />
at first I thought maybe it was sitting in a pool of water and a shot of the spray had propelled it forward so I placed it back were it had been and repeated spraying like I had done and it didn't move again. I kept spraying that cup any old way and nothing else happened.
<br />

<br />
 Plus the table top was barely damp when I started.  And if anything it leans more toward me than away.
<br />

<br />
I practice tk at work all the time but not much today cause I was too busy actually working 
<br />

<br />
If it was tk and I have no control over what where or when then what's to stop random things from happening and giving all my co-workers heart atacks over the poltergeist in the building?

			yeah i had an experience like this about a week ago where i slid a laundy basket w/laundry in it <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> . i was a little freaked out by this. i tried to recreate it but was unsuccessful. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> but kudos. maybe ur sub-c was in the routine of being active and since you didnt practice that day it just decided to     practice on its own.

I think practice is the key here.  The more you practice on different things the more you understand how it works and then how to control it.
<br />

<br />
I just want to say that when I practice at work I do it with a gnat like attention span.  I can't just stand there waiting for the door to open itself.  I would look strange.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I picture something doing what I want it to do, give it a mental push and then I have to move on.

			yea i think that too that everyone has accidental pk and i think it is because of practicing in that day , it might make it active so you sub-c start to try move everything around you , but not complatly sure but my experience tell me that .
<br />

<br />
but i think the question is how we can be that strong in pk in accidental pk and when we try to do that again we cant do that ? 
<br />
for me how i can levitate carpet and im practicing on psi wheel and 3 times only moved pencil . i mean how we can be in that strong level when we want  , not be strong by accident.

			the cool thing is that if we moved something big once then we can move it again.  
<br />

<br />
I think that size and weight aren't a big consideration.  If everything is made up of energy how much can it weigh in those terms. does that make sense?  is there a scientist in the house?
<br />

<br />
Maybe it's about having enough energy put into the thing with a clear intention and visualization.  Giving it a mental push and then clearing your mind of everything and it will move
<br />

<br />
eventually
<br />

<br />
that's the theory I'm working on  let me know what you all think of it.

I think he only moved it once, -accidental tk.

We're trying to figure out how to purposely move big stuff again.

Ok well here is my 'geisting story. I was like sitting down watching some TV (cant really remember what show it was), and i was like &quot;hey after this i should go and do some TK!&quot; and then there was a commercial break, and i heard this huge THUD like someone had thrown a rock at my window. well, whats really wierd is that it was my window, but it looked like the force had come from the inside, because the blinds were pushed against the window (you know how they fold a little and then stay folded), and there was no evidence to suggest that something actually touched the blinds. so i went to go check it out and when i was done i watched some more TV lol.
<br />

<br />
But yeah, i dont watch much TV anymore. Nothing good on local channels.
