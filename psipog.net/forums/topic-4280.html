			To be quite honest, my question doesn't exactly fall in either the empathy or telepathy category, but I was hoping someone could shed a little light on it anyway.
<br />

<br />
I've always been decent at &quot;healing&quot; myself, so to speak. If I get a headache, I simply sit down, shut my eyes, and visualize removing all of the pain from the area and replacing it with pure, soothing energy. It almost always works within seconds. I was wondering if it was possible to &quot;heal&quot; others in somewhat the same way. 
<br />

<br />
Here's an experience I've had; I'm wondering if it sounds like anything anyone else has experienced.
<br />

<br />
About a month ago, I was on a trip with a large group. There was a guy with us who, at the time, I didn't know very well, but somehow felt connected with. Sometime during the evening, he started complaining about his stomach. He said it could be just from hunger, but every other time he had gotten that particular feeling/type of pain, he had ended up throwing up. I found myself concentrating on him, trying to remove the pain from him. A few minutes later, he remarked that he felt great. I had been feeling like myself all day, but after that, I had a strange sensation in my stomach that I'd never felt before. I ended up getting really sick later that.
<br />

<br />
So, in short, I'm wondering if it was possible that I somehow did manage to remove the pain from him, but somehow ended up taking it on myself. If so, is there any way to try to help people feel better, without having to take on the negative effects?
<br />

<br />
I appreciate all suggestions/replies.

			The short answer is yes, you can heal someone without getting sick yourself.
<br />

<br />
I hesitate to go into much healing information in a forum, simply because of liability issues.  Having familiarity with anatomy is very helpful.  You'll be able to note what you think you have done in a way that can be helpful, and you'll actually have a clue about what you are doing.
<br />

<br />
Treating someone for what you &quot;think&quot; is wrong can be dangerous.  For example, helping a wound heal is significantly different from healing cancer.  I believe Rainsong discusses this in her seminar on taking care of pain posted on the Psionic Social Club webiste.  
<br />

<br />
When I treat people using acupressure, I find that I need to ground and re-center on occasion.  Note that I use a system that may or may not be psionic (the mechanism is unknown in both areas).  However, I imagine those actions might be helpful in keeping you healthy should you try healing again.  Also, I have been reminded that moving the pain into an object such as salt would be better than moving it into yourself.  Especially if the person has a nasty disease rather than simply feeling unwell.
<br />

<br />
Something to keep in mind... if others mess with my energy system without my knowledge and I notice it, I tend to respond in what might be considered an impolite manner.  Granted, if I am unwell, I might not notice or be able to respond, but I would still find it rude and possibly a threat.
<br />

<br />
At any rate, I do hope you enjoy researching healing.  I find it fascinating.
<br />

ps.  I believe this post is in the wrong area.  My understanding is that healing is psychokinesis.

			Here's search results you might find useful:
<br />

<br />
Search Results (Healing Other):

<a href="../cat-manipulation.html" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/search.php?sq=healing+other&amp;st=3</a>
<br />

<br />
I think this article will be useful for you (Empathy &amp; Healing):
<br />
<a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html154" target="_blank">art-outline-to-shielding.html154</a>
<br />

<br />
On a strictly non-psionic level, it's possible to internalize other people's feelings (emotionally and physically) to such an extent that you take on those feelings or sensations.
<br />

<br />
Psychologists, Social Workers, and others that often deal with emotionally charged individuals (nursing home, hospital, jails etc.) often are trained in relaxation techniques to deal with this. Additionally, training your mind to not take ownership of other peoples problems and feelings helps.
<br />

<br />
According to articles on psipog, appropriately programmed shielding can help prevent internalizing others emotion and sensation.
<br />

<br />
I'm still working on psiballs, so I can't speak on anything else but my psychological experience, which is an effective place to start. (Program yourself to choose what feelings and actions you will allow to affect you and how you will allow it).
<br />

<br />
<img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Hope that helps. Maybe some of the more experienced folks have more insight.

			Thanks for all the help/information, as well as the warnings((Jael)). I haven't done it since then; I figured it was probably a skill that required caution((I wouldn't want to cause more harm than good)) and more knowledge than I had at the time, so I stuck with healing my own minor issues.
<br />

<br />
Now... I'm going to take a take a closer look at some of these links, see what I can learn about all of this.
<br />

<br />
I have a few questions about telepathy, but I'll start a different thread for that, or look around the board to see if they've already been answered somewhere.
<br />

<br />
As for where in Texas I live- around the Houston area. Not exactly in Houston, but not far from it, either.
