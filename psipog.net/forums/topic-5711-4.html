			Where is your logic, where is your deeper thoughts about this...cats are definely not &quot;o mightly&quot; that you have claim. Cats are still weak, they get run over by cars, they get eated by dogs. There no different from any other animal. If they are show me why..........SPEAK MORE CLEARLY! Or the crowd will never accpte your ideals, but if they do... its clearly a pitiful pathic lie.....

			Hey man. Guess what. FYI we don't go into a seperate world while we sleep either. Omg this thread is so stupid and pointless. And is my mind really naive? If I was naive, I wouldn't believe that stupid things like cats going into different worlds was a good topic. So shut up.

No proof or logical explanation of that. Their brains are different (MUCH, MUCH less adavnced) and therefor they most likely cannot do what we do. yes I know &quot;there's no proof of that either&quot;, but it's much more logical and plausible than the other world idea.

You know I just pretty much smile during this whole message, I looked at your age and can understand what you are going through (all teenagers have admit and will). But you must admit that you can be wrong and people other then yourself can be right. True I can be wrong, but what I can saying is that I can be right. What I do is try to create a pleasent feeling while reading my messages. Simply because people think better when there happy. 
<br />

<br />
But what is even more importent is that even if all of us are wrong and you really are right has no excuss. 
<br />

<br />
Who are you to talk to others like this? You are still young compared to myself and most of the world, even most your own logic tells that you are be to yelled at. But your own attitude seems to be in more contorl then even the simplest of turths. I don't care how smart you are and what is your past. Even the most ridiculous of minds can comperhend that a terrorible eviorment can cause the most destrutive of elements to the human mind! Calling me names , no....anyone names donest have any excuess, its selfish and disrepectful! You have by far so much to learn.......learn to read between the lines......or that navie mind of yours will rot even more....

I don't see how his logic says he should be yelled at. Cats sleep like regular animals with regular minds, or cats have special psi abilities and also travel to other worlds or have OBE's when they sleep. Which to you is <span style="font-weight: bold">logical</span>. Yes, his attitude is bad but I can understand why. It's very frustrating to be debating such a rediculous idea. (especially with <span style="font-weight: bold">no basis</span> behind it) I too, laughed when I read your post only because it seems the 1st thing out of anyone's mouth here when debating anything they have no proof for is &quot;DON'T BE SO CLOSE MINDED!&quot; It's not a matter of being close minded. He (and I), read your ideas, comtemplated them, then gave you our opinion about them. Just because we don't believe in it doesn't mean we're close minded. There's a fine line between being open to ideas and being naieve. There's no basis, scientific evidence, or logical reason at all why some might think cats have &quot;psi powers&quot;.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

It's not the fact that he IS immensely closed-minded, it's that he's fucking flaming which deserves to be yelled at [although that is hipocrasy]

Tankdown, fruitcake means you're a homosexual. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> Which means he's a homophobe too!

			Ok. Fine by me getting banned. Look, I may care a little. But, did you know you've been wasting your precious time in life doing this because the site is going down. Notice, you aren't mature? It's quite obvious from the way you talk. Also, it bugs me so much when people, like you probably, come on this site to lie about experiences that they have had so people respect them. So get a life Matt. I'm not even kidding.

You're so stupid, it's not even funny.

And where the hell do you get the idea that I'm close-minded. You are the one close-minded because you think you can perform psi, but I know you can't.
