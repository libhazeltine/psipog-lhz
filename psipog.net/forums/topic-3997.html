			I tried some obe's before but didn't continue to practice. Then about 4 weeks ago I had a sort of dream/obe. I felt my body totally relax, stretch out with a hollow back and slowly lifted up high. Like my waist was attached with a wire and then I got lifted. Was this more a dream or am I close to an obe?

Then there's also this. I was sitting in a car driving to the beach last week and fell asleep. Then just a very short time before I woke up I felt me zip back into my body. The day before I smoked some pot (don't worry I had a festival, I only do it seldom like twice a year), I don't know if that could be the thing that made me feel getting back. Was this an obe with me only being conciouss of the last part?

Or you have just been real relaxed, that happens to me sometimes, i get real relaxed, then i feel like im floating, but im not, cos i open my eyes and check. If you had excersised or did some heavy lifting before you relaxed, this could be a factor, yesterday when i was at school, i have this mate called andy, and i carried his little brother about 300 yards to the 'snack shack', after i put him down, my arms felt so light, that if i tried to move them up slightly, id end up hitting myself in the face, because they felt so god damn light after putting him down, this is only an example, im not saying this is what happened to you, we just have to check out every possible answer before saying, yep, you had an OBE, thats what makes a good skeptic.

			hehe that could be. But the feeling of floating isn't that your spiritual body that's just moving a little bit up or something? Same with a boat, if you've been on a boat all day and you go to sleep you still can feel the waves. Wouldn't that be your spiritual body moving?
