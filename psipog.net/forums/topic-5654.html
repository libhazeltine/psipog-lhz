			Wow... after reading a lot of the articles, I'm completely blown away by the sheer number of things you can do with psionic training. However... I am a little confused. I have heard a lot of &quot;starting places&quot; for different fields of psionics, but I would like to know where should I start in general? I'd like to at some point be able to use both TK and telepathy, but I know that I need more help in psi manipulation. Aside from meditation, what is the best exercise to start?
<br />

<br />
Note that I have two friends (Both have an IQ of genius, I am fairly certain, and I think that I am somewhere up there as well... dunno if intelligence has anything to do with it, thought I'd throw it in there) who are also participating in my study of psionics. We, as a group, have been attempting to create psi balls as a starting point and comparing our individual progress. If I were to start with telepathy, I believe they would be willing to participate.
<br />

<br />
Thank you so very much for your advice, in advance <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			it sucks doesn't it. Then when you ask the legitmate question of where you should begin they tell you to &quot;just practice&quot; and when you ask how long and how often they vaguely say don't burn out. Things like &quot;how should it feel&quot; or what is any indicator that I'm on the right track are like taboo questions here that are looked down upon because &quot;it's different for everyone else&quot;. Yet and still, all the telepaths I talk to relatively agree that a link for kn3wb telepaths feels like a &quot;headache in the third eye area&quot; and I hear the same five general discriptions for how psiballs and shields feel. 
<br />

<br />
In other things you need to know the a training regiman so you wont have to go through the pains of trail and error but that is not done here.
<br />

<br />
So I had to go through the annoying process of answering those questions myself. Very annoying. Very annoying answering your question to. PM me through one of my profile contacts and we can have a conversation.

			Psi manipulation (making Psiballs and constructs) is the easiest and most simple Psi skill, that's probably the best place to start.
<br />

<br />
It's also a good beginner psi skill because it proves to you that psionics exists.

			Once again.... you DON'T have to start with energy manipulation and psiballs.  Wow, don't you understand.  It doesn't matter.  Do whatever intrest you, and you will succeed!

			Yes every person is different and has a certain area of psionics they enjoy more than others. but energy manipulation is a good place to start. getting used to energy flowing through your body. Then you can move onto whatever else.

			I may have made progress today... funny, I find that I can concentrate well in crowded rooms with a lot of talking people... Maybe that's because I've learned to tune people out, seeing as how most of them never have anything good to say.
<br />

<br />
Anyway...
<br />

<br />
I followed the instructions in Peebrain's Tactile Method psiball tutorial (This one: <a href="../art-psiballs-tactile-method.html" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/show.php?cmd=wp&amp;id=19</a>), specifically the ones about making spirals on your hand and then reproducing the feeling without contact. I think it may border on biofeedback, but at the very least it's a good concentration technique. Anyway, I made another attempt to create a psi ball, and followed a friend's advice to try and &quot;roll&quot; it like a ball of dough. I'm fairly certain that my psi ball had some kind of mass, because I could feel pressure and movement on the hand that was, in fact, not moving, albeit a very small amount of pressure, and not even enough to produce a visible indentation in my palm.
<br />

<br />
I'm having trouble controlling the temperature of my psi balls, though. They seem to always want to be hot, which brings me to the impasse of the fact that my hands generate heat, and it is possible that it is nothing but heat collecting between my hands. On a few occasions, I have been able to generate a faint coldness, though. Any tips on where to go once I have managed to create a *stable* psi ball, specifically on temperature changes / visibility?

			There are many forms of intellegence out there, to understand one would make yourself look like a genius. Your friends sound smart, but you could have some hidden &quot;skills&quot; in you yet.
<br />

<br />
I think everyone has a genius in them, waiting for that certain &quot;influence&quot; in there life to awaken it. But like everyone else told you...try to do what feels right.
