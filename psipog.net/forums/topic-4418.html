When: Today, July 8, 2006

<br />
I had tried to put forth a lot of force to close the bathroom door, and had only succeeded in making it wiggle back and forth about 30 minutes ago before it happened. I went back to my computer after I had failed and went on about my business websurfing, when I heard a strange cracking noise outside. I had stopped typing and turned my right ear so it was facing the window directly behind me, so as to hear better. The creaking stopped. So I naturally shrugged it off and continued to type in my web search, about 4 minutes after that the creaking started again and a branch from the tree directly outside the window of my bathroom had fallen. It was fairly large in size, even a strong storm wind should not have broken it. I'd say it was about 7 to 10 centimeters thick. There was not even a slight breeze at the time it broke. I could have climbed a tree and sat on a branch the same size and I am 100% certain it would not have broken.
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure what I could consider this. A coincidence? The conditions were not right for the branch to break like that.
<br />

<br />
Even before I started practicing PK there was never an occurance like this, even during a bad storm.
<br />

<br />
I've been practicing PK every day for about 2 and a half weeks. I've gotten the psi-wheel to spin, both under a glass and outisde, I've learned how to stop it and change its direction.
<br />

<br />
I have not been successful in bending spoons yet, I can get it to bend about one centimeter down, over a period of about 20 minutes. I can get doors to wiggle slightly, but I have not yet been successful in opening/closing them as well.
<br />

<br />
I know of some circumstances during these past few weeks where the psi-wheel should have spun but for some reason it didn't.
<br />

<br />
Should I consider this a strange coincidence? Or something more? Was there a lot of pent up energy?
<br />

<br />
Perhaps I'm jumping to conclusions way too fast. I may be acting foolish.
<br />

<br />
If you have any ideas as to what I should think of this, please respond. I'd really appreciate it.

			Yeah, I was just wondering since that was the first time I tried meditating before doing PK.
<br />

<br />
So I'm thinking meditation is REALLY important, perhaps. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

The branch was more like a decimeter thick (about 10 centimeters, which is fairly thick).
<br />

<br />
I really didn't use a kind of meditation, and if I did I'm not sure what the name for it is, I just sat down by my bathroom door, shut my eyes, and payed attention to my breathing, I didn't care about moving anything at the time, I just told myself to store up energy. I did that for about 15 minutes and then tried to close the door, it wiggled a bit, but it never actually closed.
<br />

<br />
Then the whole branch thing happened.
<br />

<br />
I can take a picture if enough people are interested in it, but I don't think it's neccessary.

sounds like meditation to me.  Congratulations on getting the door to move <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  To bad about the tree though <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
