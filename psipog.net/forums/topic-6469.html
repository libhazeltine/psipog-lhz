Did you understand everything? I would like some feedback you see, because I am the only one who read it so far and I don't know if it is understandable enough for others, or maybe too simplistic or maybe too... you name it. If you got some feedback, I would be most pleased.

No one else read it yet? Well, I will get right on it. I have a lot of free time available to me as of my Winter Break. 
<br />
So far I think I have found one spelling mistake and one grammatical error. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> (no offense) 
<br />

<br />
Felix: Wow, I didn't think you had it in you. I had no idea that you would just bluntly attack MartialArtist for sharing his knowledge with us. Seriously, many people greatly appreciate what MartialArtist does and what he has done; I am one of them. If you do not like what MartialArtist has written, or what he has done, keep it to yourself. 
<br />

<br />
Eastern religion? I see nothing of the such. Lots of people in the psionic field and on Psipog, have become more open to things such as spirituality. They are moving on, I think you should too. If I may, Peebrain is one good example. 
<br />

<br />
I feel bad to show this but, I spoke to you on AIM because I used to admire your intelligence and calm persona. That was what I saw in the past you, when you once belonged to Psipog. Now you have come back, and I do not necessarily see the same person. You still have your intelligence and wit, but...

			I now send the book to a dozen people or so and I would really appreciate it if you would be so kind to note the page or something where you notice grammar flaws as in words not spelled right or very bad sentence constructions or anything else that appears unproffesional for that matter. You can then mail me or talk to me on msn and tell me about them, Every bit helps and I can that way change it before publishing it on a site or something.
<br />

<br />
And off course content related feedback is always appreciated.
<br />

<br />
Thanks in advance and enjoy reading,
