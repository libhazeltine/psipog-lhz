			I'm totally new to all this psi stuff, but recently I found out something
<br />
very interesting. 
<br />

<br />
I don't know if I should post this up in Dream section or here...
<br />

<br />
I started to have dreams about other people's memory.
<br />
For example: I was dreaming about crawling down mountain, and 
<br />
it was fall. I felt desperate, and I saw leaves everywhere, orange,
<br />
brown, yellow colored leaves were everywhere. It was very vivid,
<br />
and the whole time I was dreaming, I thought of my boyfriend.
<br />
I &quot;knew&quot; that somehow, this dream is related to him, even if he 
<br />
wasn't in it actually.
<br />

<br />
So I asked him if he could recall anything like that, and he was
<br />
very much surprised to hear my story, because it was what 
<br />
happened to him when he was 7, at a camp, while hiking,
<br />
he fell off to a cliff, (slid off really) and luckily survived.
<br />
But he was so shocked and paranoid after the accident, he basically
<br />
&quot;crawled&quot; down the mountain. Literally like a baby.
<br />
He also said that he saw leaves everywhere, it was september.
<br />
(I didn't mention it to him. but HE TOLD ME) The mountain was
<br />
basically Covered in fallen leaves (this is exactly what I saw)
<br />

<br />
And things like this kept occuring to me with people I'm close with
<br />
I saw my girl friend's middle school day(another interesting story)
<br />
I remembered how exactly her school looked like, what color the walls
<br />
were, what kind of windows they had, how her friend looked like,
<br />
how their school uniform looked like, and what they were talking about.
<br />
It was so detailed and specific, that my friend ended up really
<br />
freaking out about.
<br />

<br />
I don't know if this is related to any of the &quot;telepathy&quot; thing
<br />
Maybe it was just a coincidence.. but to every detail, it was amazing
<br />
how I could see it so accurately.

In the original post there is a space between 'girl' and 'friend'.  I'm not the grammar or dictionary person, but to me that indicates that the girl is a friend but not a 'girlfriend'. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			sounds like retrocognition to me.  search retrocognition on google, and see if the results are simmilar to your experience.  
<br />

<br />
also, by girlfriend, she meant her friend that is a girl  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			yeah that can get confusing I've discovered it's much easier just to say &quot;female friend&quot; it might not be shorter then saying girlfriend but it saves alot of explanation typing.
