OtherKin is bullshit. *Shurgs* I avoid beating around the bush. Anyone who wants to disagree with me, try it. I'll gladly debate this topic with you.
<br />

<br />
Take care.

congratulations on bluntness, there, JoeT.
<br />
but i personally don't write something off untill i know a little about it first. that said, going on an otherkin site seems a bit like a role-play site. all talk about vampires and 'hunters'. it's all very &quot;final fantasy&quot; (no offence to any FF fanboys/girls).
<br />
i accept othekin like i accept that i'm going to die, or the constant threat of terrorism. i place myself purely in the middle of the balance, neither for, nor against otherkin. i will, however, try to see what it is that the 'kin get up to, just so i can FYI you nice people. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

I don't hate otherkin, I kind of understand why people are like that already, it may just be a roleplaying thing. Feh, when we see the basic bone structure of reality, it's pretty boring imo; why not make it fun? Who cares how we do it, as long as it leads to happiness without any harm done then that's a good path right?
<br />
I feel the same way on music, I like my own music, not alot of people listen to it at all, everyone tells me to listen to tool, listen to this, listen to that, but i'm just not into them, i'm into my own stuff.

			If I was a Christian hypocrite I would say souls only belong to humans so it is impossible to have the soul of an animal. But I don?t believe in souls our god. And even if someone got a Sole of a dragon? whatever it doesn?t matter because it doesn?t effect his current body anyway.
<br />
Its like any other religion. People thing god will help them if they are a nice boy and pray?
<br />
Where is the prove there? Millions of people believe in god without prove. If some one is able to believe in a religion another can believe in otherkin.
<br />
No offense but its sad that stupidity doesn?t hurt.

			Doesn't the soul kind of play a role in personailty? As it is your true self? So, theorietically, if you had a soul of a rabbit, you would have lucky feet. Sorry that was lame...
<br />
Anyways, that's the basic point.
