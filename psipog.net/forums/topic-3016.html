			I'll put in my 2 cents worth here:
<br />

<br />
\Only problem with otherkin, is that it opens you up to a completely different set of beliefs that get wierder and wierder. By otherkin, I'm not too familiar with the word, but you're referring to human versions or dragons, or werewolfs or cat demons and such right?
<br />

<br />
That's more along the lines of Wicca than Psi. If you were to believe that, you would have to believe the spiritual races: Phoenixes, unicorns, vampires, dragons.
<br />

<br />
To believe in them, you must believe that either they exist in a type of astral world, or believe that they exist in the way that humans take after them. Or that one of those mythical races would be reincarnated into humans.
<br />

<br />
It sort of crosses together fact and fiction. 
<br />

<br />
I personally don't disregard anything as impossible until I see some solid proof that it's a load of crap.

What do you mean? Are you saying that nobody helps each other? What about community work? What about simply being a good person? What about trying to help others? Or using empathy to try to heal someone's inner pain? Angelic traits? Maybe. Then again, maybe not. 
<br />

<br />
What about people who always give you a sickning feeling? People who seem to feed off of others pain. Demonic traits? Perhaps. Perhaps not. 
<br />

<br />
It is far out there, but people believe in all kinds of stuff and anything's possible until proven otherwise. I do think that otherkin is more on a religious basis than a psi one.

And knowing full well that this forum is anti-religious discussion, you decide to create a new post about a locked post to discuss it.  Locked.
