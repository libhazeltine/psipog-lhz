			Ok, so the laws of gravity can be defied in an OBE (if gravity even exists at all) and black holes have intense gravitational forces.  I want to know if somone has gone into a black hole and come back to say what is inside/on the other side of one.
<br />

<br />
Also, according to mathematics other dimensions exist.  Could it be that spirits/obe's are taking place in one of these other dimensions?  Maybe the 4th or 5th dimension?  Wouldn't this make sense why we can usually only see a glimpse of them or something that they influenced, but they can see us competly (at least for obe people - not exactly sure if spriits can see us)?

			As far as I have learned, spirits (and OBEd people) can enter any of the demensions/astral planes - whatever you want to call them. And I think OBE gives you the basic properties of a spirit, so it makes sense to think that spirits can see you also. Maby physical eyes arent strong or well trained enough to see them back. Last thing, I dont know anyone who went in a black hole while OBE and im not gona take that chance either.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

Indeed. There are many a black hole in our universe. They are considered to be the centerpiece of galaxies like our own. See, a black hole is not like the popular definition, an object that sucks and keeps on sucking everything in around it and from which ones your caught in it?s gravity there no way out.
<br />

<br />
Not quite.
<br />

<br />
While it does effect the gravitational pull of objects around it and over time can lead to nearby planetoids and other objects to be pulled in, black holes are much more constrained then SCI-FI shows them to be. There are limits to there power, in fact it would not be very hard at all to, if we could ever fly to one, to enter an orbit around it. Only once you?re past the event horizon, the field that cuts them off form the rest of the known universe, is it to late. Even then, there is the distinct possibility that they create rifts in space-time allowing us, if we could remain intact, to enter other realms of the universe, to which we can only speculate at this time.
<br />

<br />
I'm not a scientist so I don?t have all the sources to back my claims up, but I am sorry to say that it is more unlikely that black holes DON'T exist, then that they do. We will have more information when in a few years we start making them in Switzerland....quantum sized black holes that last for a millisecond and evaporate into a burst of gamma radiation. It is believed that these black holes permeate the universe to a greater or lesser extent.
<br />

<br />
We have also observed gravitational lenses, which we at this time, have no other explanation for but large black holes. A gravitation lens effect occurs when light actually is thrown AROUND not into the black hole by it's intense warping of space-time, resulting in a distorted image of whatever it behind the black hole. In the case of Hubble, there have been seriously distorted images of distance galaxies that we believe were, at the time the picture was taken, a black hole was between us and the telescope.

This mass limit is only a couple of solar masses, that is about twice the mass of our sun, and so we should expect at least a few neutron stars to have this mass. (Our sun is not particularly large; in fact it is quite small.)

Obviously you want to make it hard for yourself. Please notice that I never called you an idiot nor did I imply it. Your starting to annoy me. I'll make this clear, if you do not follow the rules of this forum then you will be punished. If you do not agree with the rules of the forums then by all means leave. No one is making you stay here.

Well, you're both right, and wrong at the same time. Let me put it this way so you understand. Let's look at the word &quot;black hole.&quot; It's called black because not even light can escape its grasp, now, why does light get trapped in a black hole? Well, that's were the term hole comes in. You see, photons have no mass, they are NOT affected by gravity. In other words, no matter how dense or big something is, it won't affect the path of a photon passing by it. You are right about the highly dense part. However, it is because of the high density that a &quot;hole&quot; is formed in space time, which traps photons. It's the hole shape in space time, not the dense object, that keeps in the light. Oh, and conceptually, this hole is more of a dovetailed shape dent in space time, not a hole that leads to some other dimension. Next time you may want to check your own facts before calling someone else an idiot.

Your right of course about the &quot;4th dimension.&quot; Now coming back to physics, no 5th Dimension? You might want to take a look at Super String theory or &quot;M-Theory,&quot; currently they are up to theorizing the existence of 11 spatial dimensions. Now, of course these are not &quot;alternate universes&quot; (which, string theory suggests also exists, but that's a different matter). It's not some metaphysical dimension either, it's merely another factor of space (linear, plane, 3D, time, etc.)

I never thought i had to get into any detail in this post. Before trying to be a smartass. Why would i even want to quote SR in this post? Of course photons have no mass, the intense gravitational field of the colapsed sun &quot;bends&quot; space/time traping photons as you said around it (Not in it). They in no way go into any sort of &quot;hole&quot;. I never mentioned anything like that above i merely copied a text from Cambridge University if you had bothered to check my quote.
<br />

<br />
Excuse me? Your saying the fourth dimension that einstein theorized and the other dimensions you claim from the string theory (I am aware of but hold low regards to) is all &quot;Mathermatics&quot;. Of course physics HAS mathematic embedded. But i dont remember my algebra book in both highschool and first year in univeristy to mention either.

I think he's talking about a wormhole, not a black hole.
<br />
A black hole is just a collapsed (It's either super nova or a red dwarf...) star, with inane mass... and gravity, of course.
<br />

<br />
A wormhole is just referred to as a black hole...due to popular belief. They look the same, but I have no knowledge of wormholes - I believe that when you go in one side, you'd go out the other side. Kinda like a portal.

I think he's talking about a wormhole, not a black hole.
<br />
A black hole is just a collapsed (It's either super nova or a red dwarf...) star, with inane mass... and gravity, of course.
<br />

<br />
A wormhole is just referred to as a black hole...due to popular belief. They look the same, but I have no knowledge of wormholes - I believe that when you go in one side, you'd go out the other side. Kinda like a portal.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Yea, the difference is, black holes are based on facts, wormholes are just theory.
