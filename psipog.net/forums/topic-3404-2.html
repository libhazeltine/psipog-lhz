			it's all a matter of veiwpoint.
<br />
you can look at it one way or a different way.
<br />
that's the difference between psionics and Skeptics. (in a nutshell)

I agree. The same way you delude yourself thinking that pin wheels can be moved only by air currents and similar things.

			I asked around to some certain people and I met one guy who heard of the website. He wanted me to give share his opinion to everyone here. This will probably be locked because of some religion on the god paragraph, but it does make sense, and it does relate to Psionics.
<br />

<br />
I would like to teach you about something I have pondered and learned about during my years of studying and training. It sounds like you have done a decent job in your experimenting and conclusions about TK and God, but there are some things that you have not done. I will explain them below.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Telekinesis: Ok, so when I first started studying this amazing power, I thought, &quot;Well this is impossible! There is no possible way that I can move something with my mind!&quot; I then started practicing and using techniques from the internet and different sites on how to move certain things. I found what you did in your experiment, also known as a psi-wheel. I then started the experiment with both of my hands around it and then as amazing as it seemed, it started moving. I was surprised and then I decided to take it a step farther. I then used one hand to try to move it and then I noticed some jerky movements here and there. I then started to believe that it was because of thermal temperature, but then I decided to do what an experimenter should. Practice. Once I felt I got good enough, I decided to go back to the psi-wheel and see if I had made and progress. I used my hand again wondering if it would work. At first, it didn't move, but then I discovered it was moving, faster than ever, at a constant speed. This happened for about 1 minute. Once again, I recorded my result and I wanted to see if I could do something amazing and something that would prove you wrong. I visualized the psi wheel moving in my head, and with one hand over my nose and mouth and one behind my back, it started to move. I was very shocked to find that this had happened, especially in fron tof my own eyes. I wanted to take another step, so I took a paperclip and put it on the table. After a while, I wondereds if it wasn't going to happen, but this is heavier than normal paper. After viewing it for 5 minutes, I had noticed a small movement in the paperclip and then a little bit more. After more time, I noticed that I had moved it about 5 inches from where I had placed it. After taking in what I just saw, I decided to study about what was causing this and I had finally found the solution. Psi. Psi, if you do not know, is energy in our brains, energy that helps us think. The brain is a very powerful object, and it still holds mysteries to this day and maybe forever, about what amazing obstacles it can overcome.

			I'd reccomend taking out that last paragraph as it is highly religious.
<br />

<br />
And I could argue on the points in that paragraph, but that's flaming for a different forum.

			I agree with the original post to a certain extent. I had my first go at a psiwheel last night - after reading this post I thought i'd start with the wheel under cover of glass, therefore eliminating any possibility that anything else could be making the wheel move. I couldn't get it to move (yet! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />) but just as an experiment I took off the glass cover and out my hands either side (a couple of inches away) and it immediately started to rotate. As soon as I moved my hands a bit further away, it stopped. To me this does prove the 'thermal' theory, and I urge anyone new to TK like myself to start with the psiwheel under a glass, otherwise I think you may get prematurely excited over flase results.
<br />

<br />
Right - i'm off to practice! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
