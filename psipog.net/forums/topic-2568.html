			So, hypocritical let?s say that somehow we were all able to unit together as one through some kind of a group or organization. Let?s also say that this group or organization is also extremely organized, some might say that the administration could be viewed as more of a government.
<br />

<br />
The main purpose of this group or organization would be to help any and all whom need assassinates and to help bring a stop to the ignorance of inhuman persecution to those whom study and or wish to learn about things which may be deemed ?occult? (that just means ?hidden?) in nature. These goals would be achieved by none violent means; mainly through the use of educating the general public.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
(You can choose to answer only one question if you like or you could answer however many question?s you want. Please just put the number of the question(s) that you are answering. Thank you.)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Questions:
<br />

<br />
1.) My first question; how do you think that we should reveal ourselves to your country and or world? It would preferable need to be a way in which was none violent (such as: without the use of mass panic, and without the use of force)?
<br />

<br />
2.) Second question; how might we be a benefit to your country/world by revealing ourselves?
<br />

<br />
3.) Third question; Do you think that such a group and or organization could even come together to exist?
<br />

<br />
4.) Do you believe that individuals (including yourself) might be interested in such a group and or organization?
<br />

<br />
5.) What other goals and or purposes might you believe would and or should be apart of this group or organization?
<br />

<br />
6.) What type of hastily would you assume that we might face towards the general public and also how might we counter it (preferable through none violent means)?
<br />

<br />
7.) My last question, how might we pose a problem and or challenge for our country and or world?
<br />

<br />

<br />
Thanks for answering my questions,

			ehh...isn't that what Psipog is? A Internet Organization to help those taht are seeking help. A place to meet other psions and converse about interest.
<br />

<br />
A public gathering would be just like the internet, but possibly smaller unless you make a building size of texas.

			Questions:
<br />

<br />
1.) My first question; how do you think that we should reveal ourselves to your country and or world? It would preferable need to be a way in which was none violent (such as: without the use of mass panic, and without the use of force)?
<br />

<br />
I think this question is kind of flawed. It jumps simply to &quot;The Country and The World&quot;. There are a lot of inbetweens. The first steps would have to be around communities, and small groups. The best way to do it would be through some type of training course, in which the instructor is skilled and can demonstrate his/her skills. Along with small &quot;talks&quot; on what &quot;psi&quot; is.
<br />

<br />
2.) Second question; how might we be a benefit to your country/world by revealing ourselves?
<br />

<br />
It could have two outcomes, assuming that the group manages to get nation/world wide. The first outcome is quite bleak: &quot;New Practices&quot; are often frowned upon by many people, especially those who hold religions that ban such things as &quot;Psychicism&quot; (Or whatever you want to call it). Even something that has nothing to do with Psychic things has been prosecuted/frowned upon/harassed/hurt. &quot;Falun Gung&quot; is only one example of such thing, and many other religions could be used as an example. Even though Psi is not a religion, it would still be treated as some cult or whatever.
<br />

<br />
The second outcome, the beneficial one could come first, or follow the outcome I outlined above. A better understaning of human nature and reality, possible applications in technology, health, and many other things. Maybe especially communication <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
3.) Third question; Do you think that such a group and or organization could even come together to exist?
<br />

<br />
Right now, the prospect seems bleak. However, we have many members coming to Psipog everyday. I am not saying Psipog is that organization, but I am saying that a website like this is the start. There is on problem, though, and that is a sort of &quot;Non-Standardization&quot; of terms and theories. There are many which are radically different, and at this point, our knowledge could be said to be merely a stab in the dark. THis would impede our progress in creating a &quot;larger&quot; organisation.
<br />

<br />
4.) Do you believe that individuals (including yourself) might be interested in such a group and or organization?
<br />

<br />
Yes, very interested. It would be great to be involved in such a project.
<br />

<br />
5.) What other goals and or purposes might you believe would and or should be apart of this group or organization?
<br />

<br />
It would be important to learn about the possible applications in everday life, aside from what we can already do. That means applications in science, technology, and possibly in the advancement of the human conscience.
<br />

<br />
6.) What type of hastily would you assume that we might face towards the general public and also how might we counter it (preferable through none violent means)?
<br />

<br />
Hostilities? There are quite a bit. Currently I think the main would come from &quot;Skeptic Groups&quot;, Religious groups, possibly governments, and from &quot;Science&quot;. More scientific evidence would be needed to &quot;persuade&quot; the masses that it exists. After that is accomplished, and after the reputations of members skills increase, then I think we could look forward to less hostility.
<br />

<br />
7.) My last question, how might we pose a problem and or challenge for our country and or world? 
<br />

<br />
I could only think that some people would have &quot;bad&quot; intensions, when it comes to Psi. Attempting to use it to manipulate politics, hurt others, or whatever else that you could think of that's bad. That's assuming, however, that abilities reach that point to be used daily and effectively by everyone. Other than that, I'm not sure.
<br />

<br />
I think the word you are looking for is 'hypothetically'.  'Hypocritical' means when someone forwards an opinion and then doesn't act on it.  For example if I said, &quot;No Psion must ever make psi balls.&quot; and then made one, I would be being hypocritical (hence 'hypocrisy' - the act of doing so, and 'hypocrite', the person who does it).
<br />

<br />
'Hypothetical' refers to an imagined situation.  For example, 'Hypothetically if I made a psi ball in space, I would not be able to feel it'.
<br />

<br />
This is an important distinction to make in order to avoid a lot of confusion.<img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Well, I don't think that an organization like this could happen unless <span style="font-weight: bold">everyone</span> (by that I mean most Psis) wants it. It will never, ever happen through one man's (or woman's) vision. I would know. I tried. Does anyone know of the Society for the Transmundane and Gifted? Didn't think so. 
<br />

<br />
That's why it has to be a major group effort. If someone else is up for it, I'll put in my efforts. But you can't do it by one person's efforts, it will invariably fail.

Well, you have neutralists (People who don't care one way or another, or are just in the middle section between a 'believer', and a 'sketpic')

You have skeptics (Ones who don't believe in psi, but may still have their mind changed)

I can't see any as of now, but some occults may appear, those who practice psionic combat.

<br />
Which is definitely a problem.

xD The Psionic Inquisition, set in Monty Python style, doing The Spanish Inquisition - used to find people who practice and/or participate in psionic combat.

Or just a physical beating to those.

Ooh... good idea. I might write one for my school's newpaper.

Well, i did try to start a little underground community in my school. I was going to teach a few people in my school, then when we have about 10 people or so... we would start showing people some TK and doing some telepathy. Then we would tell people to join if they wanted to learn. But... it isnt going so well...
