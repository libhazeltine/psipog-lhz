			Zemeon: You really don't know what you're talking about when it comes to communism.  You've obvioulsy only been told in detail about communisnm by anti-communists, and whether or not communism is truly bad, that leaves you with no ability to determine it for yourself because you're working with nothing but biased information.  Read Das Kapital and find out what communism is in it's ideal form, then you can weigh that against communism in the form it's been applied in over the course of the 20th century.  You'll find a strikingly obvious contrast and will come to conclusion that a horrible mis-labelling of ideologies has occurred.  Thus, whether communism is good or bad or not is still a hypothetical argument until someone actually implements Marx's plan as he envisioned it.  This is a realm of theory regarding the human condition and just how primal we are or may become.  History about the USSR or Maoist China really has very little significance.

			Thanks for summing up what I meant to say. Me write bad english. I disagree with the issue of human nature though. Russia was a land of ignorant people that wanted equality fast in any way possible. That's why the revolution worked so well. The workers all thought they were getting an instant fix. Capitalism is the natural system that arrises from primal humans and it instills these primal ideas of greed and selfishness. The ignorant workers wanted an equal soceity but they didn't know how or maybe not even want to change their ideas. They would keep their ideas that they thought were theirs but really just products of capitalism. These ideas would drive them to capitalism again. The educated leaders of Russia, like Lenin, wanted to change soceity with a plan that needed all of soceity. All of soceity was not on the same page in Russia. They could not follow the plan and shape their ideas correctly. Thus the government had to be very controlling to force these ideas unto the people. This just caused the workers to become angry since what they had received from revolution was, what they thought, not equality. You can't have liberal equality with people who have primal ideas. And this is why Marx's plan can never work. The people who fight for it would have to be educated one's who want to change soceity and ignorant ones who want instant equality. The ignorant ones would need soceital shaping so that their primal, deep rooted ideas can be eradicated. The educated ones should have shaped themselves already. But the ignorant ones will be part of soceity to and without everybody working towards the same goal of shaping themselves, the basis of socialism and communism shatters. The basis being unity. The revolution cannot allow any ignorant people in. The soceity must be shaped before the community is set up. Then you bypass the flawed system of socialism which will always fail because power corrupts, and go straight into the promise land of communism. In conclusion, the primal ideas are not a basis of humanity, they are a factor in us all kept alive by capitalism. They can be uprooted though. Primal ideas are not human nature.

Dude, please don't tell me I have no idea what I'm talking about. I know exactly what I'm talking about when I say communism is bad.

<br />
Don't try contradicting me, because it just doesn't work, buddy.

I will say this one final time, because it is totally and undeniably the truth and nothing but it.

Why do you use the word &quot;contradicting&quot; as if it can't apply to you? Like everything eles it can have a good result.
<br />

<br />
I'm not going to say your wrong, because honestly I know I can't give a expert opinion to either side. I only want you to open to option in your mind that you are wrong.
