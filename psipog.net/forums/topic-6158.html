			I recently became curious about the whole aura thing and figured the best way to decipher if it's real or not, is to try to experience it myself. I read the online guidlines some of you have previously posted, and was successful within seconds. I attribute this to those 3-D &quot;magic eye&quot; things you see in the paper. Since childhood I've always been able to see those in seconds by simply changing my focus, and I noticed that the focus needed for aura vision is the <span style="font-weight: bold">EXACT</span> same focus needed for those magic eye things. I'm just posting this to mabye help others who are having trouble attempting aura vision. Just try seeing the images in the 3-D puzzles without putting your face close to the picture. Just keep it at a regular reading distance and try to extend your focus <span style="font-style: italic">through</span> the book, as if focusing on the floor behind it. It's <span style="font-style: italic">very</span> simple once you've done it a couple times. If you can do this, you can have &quot;aura vision&quot;
<br />

<br />
BTW: I'm not saying I believe in aura's now, I just understand what everyone is talking about when they are speaking about aura's. I see the light/colours, yet still have to decide if I believe the whole aura idea.
<br />

<br />
P.S I posted it here because I'm under the impression clairvoyance and aura vision are linked together to an extent, and there's not really another category for it.

			y'know, when I saw the topic line, i thought this would be so fluffy, you'd think you were in a pillow. But after reading your topic with an open mind, I noticed that it just might make sense.
<br />

<br />
Of course, you bring up a valid point. It would need further research, of course, but it's an interesting idea. It makes sense, as I use the same focus to see energy (I prefer calling it &quot;Visual Energy Perception&quot; to using the fluffier &quot;Aura Sight&quot;) as I do for those magic eye things. I never focus long enough to see the picture, because I get bored with them easily. They just have no application for me... until now.
<br />

<br />
Look into this a bit more; maybe you're on to something!

			I too have heard of this technique.  Unfortunately, it seems as though I have more trouble than the average person seeing stereograms (ever since I was a child I've been trying), although when I focus I can see what seems to be my own aura.
<br />

<br />
Anybody have any tips that go beyond the basics?  Because the results of most of my practices only end up with me having very sore eyes <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

If your eyes get sore then it sounds like you're trying too hard. This &quot;focusing&quot; is more like relaxing the eye muscles so your vision goes out of focus. It's like trying to find the right <span style="font-style: italic">level</span> of relaxation. If you relax them too much your vision makes it seem as though you're cross-eyed, but you're not. I would just keep trying the Magic Eye things and just sit there looking at it and let your eyes go out of focus and then, slowy bring them back into focus. Try to find that point of focus where all the sudden the figures/shapes pop into view.
