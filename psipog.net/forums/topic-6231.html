			How seriously do you take life?
<br />
Do you analyse every part of everything you're given? or do you just say f**k it and not look at everything under the microscope?\
<br />
i'm wondering because it seems like some people take things waay too literally on these forums sometimes, and basicly just need to lighten up a touch.
<br />

<br />
so. thoughts? feelings? opinions?
<br />
do you take life too seriously?

			I don't really take life seriously on average. I just let life happen. Go with the flow. Not a care in the world. But what I'm I really saying by being not serious? I don't know...can someone answer that?  
<br />

<br />
Some don't like it when I'm not serious, because they are. So, then I have to change and act serious. Maybe I shouldn't change myself, but I like to keep making some friends here and there and to do that, I have to act as they wish. Seeing myself write that, I don't really like what I just said. But I have my reasons. 
<br />

<br />
Maybe I can put it another way. If things aren't going well in my &quot;non-serious state&quot; then I switch it to my &quot;serious state.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I think it is only a good thing if it is balanced. With no balance between serious and not serious...some things will probably be bad. 
<br />
For instance, there is a serious person 100% of the time. He/she is then looked as stuck-up and may actually have some bad emotional problems inside because you can see that they close themselves in reality by being serious in reality. They are too much in the wrong reality. 
<br />
Then it is the other way around, there is a non-serious person 100% of the time. But this person's problem is that he/she doesn't care about his or her mistakes. And ends up with tons of problems because they don't care about those mistakes. But maybe that is a good thing not to care about your problems? Because they are only problems if you make them problems...everything can be good if you think it good and make it good. Hmmm, this is interesting...
<br />

<br />
But as I said, I think that balance is definetly needed.
<br />

<br />
Another thing: People judge non-serious people as immature. But that is not the case guys. Don't think that way, they just aren't serious. That has nothing to do with being immature.
<br />

<br />
Huh!? Or maybe it is the other way around? The non-serious people are the one's hiding from reality!? Maybe I am not ready to answer these questions.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
EDIT: But you know what? On average people are too serious. People really do need to loosen up. Because in such a stiff state, they can be broken easily. Be loose, what happens? You just bend, bend with reality, bend with time, bend with all. Be as everything else is.

That's what I do. But I usually tend to be more serious at school to protect my image. At home I'm usually a lot different. At school, I get more work done because of my ego's fear of public ridicule for being lazy. At home this goes away and it becomes harder for me to concentrate and I don't get much done <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />. But I still believe in balance. I just need to be serious while DOING work and not serious when I don't finish as much as expected and start freaking out. But usually that doesn't happen at home since I remain not so serious most of the time. Not being serious makes me calm and indifferent to the consequences. But being really serious makes me uptight, stressed, too worried about perfection, and too worried about the consequences. The only benefit being that you get more work done. But if balanced you could get work done comfortably and without attachment. So I'm 50% with seriousness and 50% against it <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.

			I'm quite serious most of the time and I hate all the people who aren't caring in the least about what will happen next, all they do is fuck up today thinking it isn't fucking up tomorrow..

<br />
 I think some people should loosen up and some people should get more serious since there isn't really a good combination around here....
