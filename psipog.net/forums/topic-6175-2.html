Well, I can make a second voice in my head making or answering questions. But it isn't worse or better than the primary. Sometimes I get a big answer, but I think these come really from inside.

			What I mean by my statement is that when I think of something I usually get a reply instantly. Usually its words but its often mix with emotions about other solutions and people actions. I tend to go there and back just through out the day.
<br />

<br />
From what I said somethings when I listen to my sub-c and I give my reply to it, I often get a another reply over that thought quickly. It hards to keep up with it sometimes. So I have to end up backing up to scan over some over my eariler thoughts, but not just through thought but with my sub-c as well. Once I understand everything I can relax and sit down.
<br />

<br />
Its very trieding......

Lesbian, on all, lmao. It'd be kind of interesting if my subconscious took on a male personality...

			When I was first getting into sub-conscious stuff, it could be a pain. I'd make it repeat stuff over and over--and I can't even remember why. My sub-conscious started verbally abusing me after a while, too. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> I don't know. We don't talk that much anymore, but I can still get little snappets of information out of him.
<br />

<br />
Oh wait, now I remember! It's because I needed to hear things loud and clear to make sure it was him.. or something. I DON'T KNOW. I still don't know. We're sort of merged, not that distinct. &lt;_&lt; And the first time I tried asking &quot;What is love?&quot; I didn't get an answer. I definitely got an answer for &quot;What is hate?&quot;, though.

			Well, seems my subconscious can at least do a bit of.... remote viewing? Dunno, anyway, my brother went upstairs, and I thought into my room. Since I wanted to use my computer...
<br />

<br />
&quot;Is my brother on my computer or playing my Xbox 360?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Neither, he's currently in the washroom.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Lo and behold, I go up, and he's in the washroom. Score one for Mr. Jeff! That's right, my sub-c has a name... sort of.
<br />

<br />
&quot;So, do you have a name?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm technically you, so would I not be Jeff as well?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Um... suppose so, yeah.&quot;

			The sub-c is a really awesome aspect of the mind. Sometimes I get very deep and profound responses that leave me quiet and pondering at the moving insight. And other times he/she/it/me can be quite a smartass <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .
