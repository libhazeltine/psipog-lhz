			After so much time and hard work invested in PK, Don't you think we should start compliling all the best methods and data, what works and what won't, into a condensed and focused manual on PK? By doing this we could analyse all the methods and experiences, and get a clearer view of what PK actually is and how it actually works. This may be a great addition to our knowledge on psi, as we gather sources from various psions. I personally find that reading personal posts and articles from so many psions rather confusing and frustrating, since most of them have different opinions on psi.

			They kind of already have that.  Go to the features page on psipog.net.  Click on the manual and wallah.  I am not sure if this is waht you mean but if not jsut let me know!

Hope this helps!

			There isn't any &quot;best&quot; way of doing PK....
<br />

<br />
Experience only can't figure out what or how PK works. Scientifc research is need. 
<br />

<br />
Personally, I feel we should cease in telling anyone their methods of doing stuff, because it makes people more dependent of others. It's already showing, more and more new people come one seem more dependent.

			neveza, I completly agree with you.  That actually happened/ is happening with me.  I am trying to create my own methods which will work for me.  Great advice!

			Hmm, I was just thinking, if we put our heads together we might figure out what excactly this Pk thing is, in a scientific way. science is just a method of analysing data to find out the truth of something, it doesn't nessasary mean high-tech instruments or expensive equipment. But you got a point there, though.

			An analogy to my idea would be: Let's take the game of football, every football player has his own unique way of playing, and a unique strategy that works for him. But no matter how they play, they're playing football, and football has rules that any football player must obey. 
<br />

<br />
Now PK is just like football, and PK practitioners are the football players. But the thing is now we don't know a thing about the rules of the game, and we try to make a guess by observing how the players play. If we make a careful observation of many PK practitioners across a long period of time, I think we might just figure out the rules of PK, it might be inaccurate, but it's way more intelligent than plain trial-and-error guessing.
