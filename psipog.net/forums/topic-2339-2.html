			That's the thing... it's too easy to make toilet oriented jokes at it's expense.
<br />

<br />
but then i always say X-box when i mean a ladie's fun-zone... so i guess it's kinda the same thing... ish.
<br />

<br />
but, i'm okay with the name wii. it's not like nintendo were going to call it the gamecube2, gamecuboid or gamedodecahedron or anything. nintendo have been renowned for their innovation. and this is just another addition to the wierd yet wonderful catagory. like, when the DS came out everyone thought it was a gimmick and it wouldn't catch on. but now some of the best games, no possible on any other system are on the DS. stuff like Trauma center, Rub rabbits and warioware touched make the DS refreshing and new in a world where all i've seen of the PSP is near straight ports of ps2 games (trust me, i have a psp, i know)
<br />

<br />
but let's hear your opinion...

			I'd say it's a brilliant name.  The hardware's name is almost completely inconsequencial as far as it's performance goes, so people won't base their purchase on the name.  And while it's got a ton of implicit meanings (the 2 i's being two gamers coming together, the word being &quot;wifi&quot; minus the f, the ii in japanese being good, the 2 i's symbolizing the controllers, etc.) but sounds ridiculous.  As a result everyone's talking about it, and who can say that's a bad thing for Nintendo's business?  If anything this should help Nintendo's sales greatly with the publicity and subliminal message they'll be exposing their Japanese market to (which is their main consumer base).

			No more nintendo bashing. Nintendo, despite always making the best games, never gets any respect. Nintendo is excellent, People bash N64 and GCN. N64 was great, people say the graphics were bad or whatever, well first, graphics, while cool, in no way affect the fun of a game, secondly, while the graphics were bad for the first few N64 titles, I distinctly remember the later ones being amazing. Next, GCN, same thing only GCN Graphics were great from the outset, and the 44 Memory Block Processor was infinitely superior to PS2's piddly 24 Memory Blocks, and the GCN graphics very nearly rivaled X-Box's 68 Memory Block processor, think about that, 24 Memory Blocks less and still very close.
<br />

<br />
For the record, I believe 1 Memory Block=8,000 Mb(that's megabytes, for the techno-illiterate.
<br />

<br />
8,000 X 24= 182,000 
<br />

<br />
not much more than a windows 98, Maybe less, I don't know 98's exact memory size, I think it's around 150,000.
<br />

<br />
PS2 travels at the speed of a snail in peanut butter.
<br />

<br />
As for the name: I think being able to joke about it actually helps marketing, and you can make anything sound dirty if you really try...
<br />

<br />
Playstation: Not hard
<br />

<br />
X-box: actually that's been done in this thread
<br />

<br />
and Let's not forget that X-box will give you Brain Trauma if it falls on your head, so when you play X-Box, Make sure you have some Trauma Center playing buddies nearby
<br />

<br />
See you later, I am going to go try and find a way to make my Wii bigger... LOL

He said GCN was amazing because it was almost as good (not better) than the Xbox graphics-wise with significantly less processing power.  It didn't fit into the trend PS2 falls into, and that's what he claimed made it amazing.  You seem to have read that as something quite different from what was written, so I figured it was best to clear that up.
<br />

<br />
As for my own input:  the GCN controller was awkward (especially to those with big hands)?  This is news to me since I have played GCN plenty and had no problems using any of the buttons despite my freakishly large hands.  I don't know what kind of crazy, 8-fingered, gargantuan hands you have, but it's not Nintendo's fault they didn't design the controller specifically for people who could thumb wrestle a Titan.
<br />

<br />
Oh and Wii doesn't mean Nintendo in Japanese.  Nintendo in Japanese in Nintendo.  Duh.  That's like saying &quot;Toyota&quot; in Japanese is &quot;Camry&quot;.  Wii is the product name, and lacks any previous meaning in English or Japanese language.  Nuff said.

			Ive always loved nintendo, and the revolution sounds very interesting. Imagine playing legend of zelda and actually being able to swing your hand and in the game link slashes his sword at the same time. The only bad part is, whenever I get a new game thats good, I end up staying up all night playing it, I don't think my parents would be too happy listening to me slashing a controller wildly around my room trying to beat a boss or something...
