			Well, heres the deal...I started psionics in October, 2005. Up until about January, i always had the tingly psi and could have others feel it strongly too. I use my psi to move objects such as mobiles, pencils, and psiwheels. Now, after January, I suddenly and completely lost my psi. Its all gone. Cant get the tingly sensation, and i cant move anything. I cant even make a psiball anymore. Why is this happening and how can it be fixed? I have absolutely no abilities or skills whatsoever anymore. What is going on?

			maybe you dont think you can do it anymore, the scenario is, if you begin to be losing your abilities, dont think 'oh no, im losing my abilities, theyre gonna go anytime soon', because that will probably help the process of them going, just keep practicing and if nothings happening, just keep thinking 'yea, im gonna move that psiwheel over there'

			Check between the couch cushions.  You'd be surprised what you can find there.

If it's not there just wait a while longer.  I doubt you can totally lose your psi for life.

			You are creating a mindblock. Don't do that. You are being too attached to your ability to perform psionics and because of that attachment, there is fear of loss. Because of that fear of loss, there are thoughts of fear with a potential power of becoming a mindblock. Negative thinking and negative programming of the mind is what results. Thus, you block yourself from performing that what you desire so badly. 
<br />

<br />
Try to let go of your attachment to psionic abilities, and soon these mindblocks will fade because they lose power. You feed them no longer with energy in the form of self-doubt and negative thinking. Now you say you are not doubting yourself, but somehow I doubt that. If this really is not the case, then there must be another reason why it doesn't work anymore. But it doesn't make sense to lose those abilities just like that. Only your own mind can stop you from doing so. Goodluck finding out what the problem is.

			Maybe you came to such a level that you are having a break on your powers  so you can suffer all the needed modifications and mental developing to go on with your pratices. then you will be much more powerfull and have an easier time doing what you want to do. think about it.
