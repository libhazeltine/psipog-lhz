			It was pretty cool, when i was about 6-11 years old, all the time I could sense things before they'd happen.  CONSTANTLY, not once or twice, but daily, hourly, I thought I'd just &quot;guess&quot; at what might happen, and every single time I was right.   
<br />

<br />
When I was younger I was outside and in forests all the time, there weren't loud noises, and TV's, and high pitched annoyences every 30 seconds.  Since then I think it's been fading away, since when i was younger I was in a quieter, more focused place.  Can I get it back?
<br />

<br />
Precogs seem to have their gifts by raw talent.  Do I have to work at it to get my gift back?  Is it gone for good?  Any tips?  
<br />

<br />
I'm kindof new here, I don't really know if I can do any of this stuff really, but I just want to know if it's possible to get what I had back. 
<br />

<br />
Thanks.

			What you wrote really intrigues me. It makes sense to be able to bring something back that you once had but to do it is another story. I would say meditating...or return to the forest. 
<br />
In my future, I wish to live in a forest.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			The skill seemed to come natureal to you because you may have been more open minded when as a child. Stop looking for it, its already there. My advice is to stay relax and stay tuned in with yourself and whats around you.
<br />

<br />
Also if you hear high pitch sounds from tv and such sort of means you have good hearing..I have the same problem with some electronic things. But I didn't understand if you mean while in the forest when hearing them or outside.
<br />

<br />
Well I'm still a noob at all of this, but it donest stop me from giving the advice I think I can give.

			Kags I have this same ability right now. I too have been using it since I was little and I strongly believe you can get it back. I think it's just practice. You described it very well when saying you just &quot;thought&quot; of the outcome of a situation and that's what would happen. But it's like letting the outcome, come to you and not dreaming it up yourself. (which happens a lot and you must be able to decipher which was the real outcome and which one/ones did your mind just make up real quick.) I use it with almost every dicision I make everyday! which is a lot. And I'm easily right 90% of the time. Believe it or not it even works for me in poker. Before I'm even dealt the hand I know if I'm going to raise or fold. If I'm going to win the hand or not. (Although it's not specific like how much to raise) Just practice everyday in your regular life. i.e is this route to work faster, what if I go here instead of there, wear these socks or those socks lol...Even though they're little decisions, you still have an outcome from them, and they help you start to decipher what &quot;voice&quot; in your head is the &quot;right one&quot;....That make any sense to you  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> ?

			I used to be able to precog when I was little. Not quite like that all the time but it was more than just little things here and there. It only worked when I sort of tried. If I tried to hard it didn't work so sometimes I had to let it come to me. But I was real little and I had no idea what psionics were. Sometimes not I get random precogs without even trying. But it's only small things.

			Yeah derrick I get it <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

It's wierd because whenever I &quot;try&quot; i'm always wrong.  I think I used to just go by impulse, to just pick whatever came first into my head.
<br />

<br />
I think that's the key, my first instinct is usually the right one.  You know how you sometimes get that gut feeling, how it crosses your mind that you should do or say something, but you just ignore it for whatever reason, and then it turns out, that that specific situation could've been diffused/resolved/made better if you'd just done what your &quot;gut&quot; had been saying.
<br />

<br />
We know how it is when we're kids.  We take everything we see as the truth, we usually don't question too much what we're thinking or feeling, we just accept things.  Maybe as I got older, it got more difficult to hear my &quot;gut&quot; because I started to take everything that I heard/felt/thought/knew with a grain of salt.  And so, it's like I'm &quot;filtering&quot; all my feelings through, and the &quot;gut&quot; feeling is getting filtered.
<br />

<br />
So, in my case, I'm assuming, I should start listening to my &quot;gut&quot; and go with what first pops into my head.  
<br />

BWAHAHA!  Thanks guys you're awesome!
