			I'v been trying to move the psi wheel for several days now and havn't come close.  Then one morning i decided to try tk on my bedroom door just for the heck of it i knew it wouldn't work but after i tried i covered up w/ the blankets and made a psiball which gave me a whole new feeling when i made it it felt like it had a pulse.  My hands kept going in and out by themselves.  anyway when i looked at the door again it was shut but no one shut it the air couldn't have shut or nothing so im not entirly sure if i did it or not.  Does tk sometimes have a delay?

			It can have a delay and also that could have been your sub-c that did it. Sometimes, the mind moves stuff like that when you're not focusing on it. For example, my psiwheel will sometimes move out of the corner of my eye when i'm not thinking about it. The sub conciousness can move stuff in other places like rooms and houses, even way further too.

			I had the same thing, but with a model jet plane. I could spin the psiwheel pretty good but I couldn't do jack shit outside of that. The plane somehow got off my shelf, dropped about two feet onto my desk, got past my keyboard and mouse, dropped about another two feet onto the floor, and traveled about 1 and a half metres across my floor. But that's the way the sub-c works. You could say it's stubborn.
