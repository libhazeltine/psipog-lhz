indeed, in the thread called Tk in a Day, psi maipulator sent me a link to a vid of uri geller 'bending a spoon with his mind', biggest pile of w*nk ive ever seen, he keeps saying, oh look, look, its bending, but it wasnt at all, then his hands go down near his crotch and he bends the spoon in half, but he does it in like half a second and then he says, look, look what ive done with my mind, what an asshole.

			Skeptic: Are they practicing psions? NO WAY!!!! THEY DON'T CARE!! Every person I have told is to this day is NOT A PRACTICING PSION!!! Every single person just drops it and we don't care. My point is everybody dosen't care because of the way we present it. Let's rephrase who I am telling you to search for. Someone who dosen't care if psionics was WIDLY proven and WIDLY used in PUBLIC matters. Just do it. You'll see that people really do care and the fact is, THERE IS PROOF! Go find a good telepath and ask them to read your thoughts. PROOF! You want more; rent one of those like white like airtight sound proof rooms and ask them to read ur thoughts in other room like that.

people doesn't know about it because they disregard it as nonesense... i've seen countless documentaries about kinetic powers but the problem is that most people just think it's staged or coincidences.
<br />

<br />
everyone knows about kinetic powers. and many people kinda belive in it but they don't know how to practise it and they've never seen indisputable proof, therefore they're stuck in a grayzone between beliving and not beliving. i've seen people on talent shows doing telekinesis but everyone thinks it's just tricks (off course it might've been).
<br />

<br />
besides, very few people know how to use psi.

			One argument from a skeptical friend, not sure if it's been done before:
<br />

<br />
Why if there is psionics, have there been no &quot;prodigies&quot; or &quot;geniuses&quot; of the sort? If there was one, it would be obvious and known to the general public.
<br />

<br />
(at least, that's what I believe the question was, to the best of my memory)

There may not have been prodigies, but there have been very skilled people who have been took as loons and such.
<br />

<br />
Regarding the knowledge of psionics, they may not be well known because TV doesn't make enough publicity and schools don't have it as subject.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

Just imagine an open minded world where sensible ideas were accepted instead of denied.

			Psion:
<br />
this is a known fact by psions and skeptics usually, The reason there arent many people practicing psionics is because:
<br />
1: not many people have an opened mind to things that cant be explained by science
<br />
2: they are afraid of what they cannot understand
<br />
3: they are afraid its demonic(im a catholic but i dont think it is)
<br />
4: There isnt much proof of it all and people are just to freaking lazy to try somthing they can only read about and not see videos of
<br />

<br />
not personal attacks only truth, oh and btw skeptics, tell me why velociraptor felt the freezing cold psi ball i sent him when he lives in a different country from me?

true i felt it, it was like a cold wave.. of course the skeptics here will tell me i faked it, but perhaps psi is related to this things and are moved and controleed through this

I've also sent cold psiballs to other countries. Mine are feebler but they can be felt anyway. I live in Mexico and a boy in Utah felt it while chatting with me.
<br />

<br />
Not so long ago, I read &quot;The Properties of Psi&quot; (I don't remember where, too bad). There it said that psi can travel to the infinite at any speed without losing &quot;power&quot; or any of it's properties, etc.
<br />

<br />
What I did that time was to imagine my cold psiball travelling fast (while seeing a Hanna-Barbera-styled background speed by) and stopping suddently at my friend's hands.
<br />

<br />
He felt it at... 7 ?F. It wasn't freezing, but it was cooler than most anyway.
<br />
Dunno how that can be possible (the properties), but cold psiballs are cool! (And my joke was so un-cool <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> )

Maybe they were just newbies, or maybe they were just whitelights.

Why is it too good? The practice bit seems like a nightmare for everyone.

Where's the wrong part? There are no pills, or magic stuff (not magik, I meant magic in a fluff way), or anything quick and easy.

Psionics has not been proven real, true, but has not been proven unreal either.
