			Ok, here it is......
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">STEP 1</span>
<br />
Stand up, take a few deep breaths and relax
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">*NOTE: If you want, before step 2 you can absorb energy from something else.</span>
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">STEP 2</span>
<br />
Picture a ball of energy around your bellybutton area spinning around and getting denser and denser and denser and denser and denser and denser.......and denser. Just about as dense as you can make it.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">STEP 3</span>
<br />
Now shoot some energy from your dense ball of energy out the bottom your feet, and picture it coming out like how energy comes out of a rocket booster. And picture yourself slowly lifting off the ground.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">STEP 4</span>
<br />
To get higher after you've lifted off the ground just shoot more energy through the bottom of your feet. The higher you go the more energy you'll have to shoot. Do this until that once dense ball of energy is gone or until you notice that you are starting to lower to the ground because that ball of energy you formed earlier is almost gone. And once it IS gone, you'll land(or fall)to the ground. Obviously.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Well, that's MY personal technique for levitation, I hope it helps you to levitate or to find your own technique. And as I said earlier, you can absorb enrgy from the sun or something if you don't think your own energy alone can do it. I personally like to use my own energy, so absorbing energy from something else to give you a boost may make it a little easier, but I wouldn't know since I've never did that. Well, anyway have fun with it. ^_^
<br />

<br />
I have also come up with another technique that I'm still playing around with, but I'm not gonna tell you that one just yet.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

Whoa whoa whoa. Hold up. You've actually had success with this technique? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I beleive that is a major milestone for psionics. The true test will be if other people can do it as well. If so, then this is groundbreaking.

			I'm very excited about this. And it's not really a milestone in the traditional sense, because many people experience levitation and just don't talk about it or don't call it psionics, but it will still be cool if this works. I'm gonna try it for a couple weeks, and if it works, you get a big telepathic high-five, Ronoshie!

			I've tried it once, I felt...pushed. Not up though, forwards..
<br />

<br />
I can't say if that's a sign of plausable chance of it being it. But I can say my mind doesn't enjoy the idea of being lifted off the ground without any support, especially standing. I might mess with it a bit...might, depends on how motivated I get.
<br />

But I do want to see a video, just out of curiosity.

			Mind over matter, guys. If you can have an Out of Body Experience, you can surely levitate. I mean, wouldn't an OBE be harder than levitation.

			I think i'll try this levitation technique, ive tried various techniques and they seem to make me lighter, but not quite lift off the ground.

			I had some succes with this last night (first try! that's good for any technique) but it wasn't that high and only lasted a second. It was kind of like I was just standing on my toes at first, then I came off the ground, opened my eyes and freaked out because I thought I was falling over; I only went back on the ground though.

Thanks Ronoshie!

			well, sounds interesting, havent quite trried it yet but for those who are, i have a suggestion.
<br />
try standing on a scale and doing this, look down if you think you are doing it and see if it reads any lower. this is a definate way of seeing if your actually pushing yourself up at all.

			Nice technique......although i believe it can be done..i'm not very convinced you can do it...i think it may be easier convincing yourself your truely off the ground than really being off the ground....need a scale or vid to convince me on this one.....but i do think it's been done  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
