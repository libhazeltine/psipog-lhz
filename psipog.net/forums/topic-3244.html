			Hello to everybody
<br />

<br />
I have been interested in telekinesis on and off for the probably last eight years.  Just about three weeks ago I got back into it and I truly believe almost anything to possible.
<br />

<br />
I started a couple of weeks ago with the psi wheel, I rigged it first with paper on the tip of a not so pointy pencil.  I have got it to move/spin here and there and even that took a couple of days from starting to see my first results.  Make a long story short I have finally just put together the psi wheel on a actual pin/needle and now I can get it to move with almost no problem at all.  I mean I just look at it and it goes it the direction I say in my mind (well for the most part the direction I tell it, or it just rocks back and forth and then spins in the direction)
<br />

<br />
My questions is as follows (Trying to ask them as clear as possible)
<br />

<br />
I have read alot about to manipulate energy and the object you have to overcome friction of the surface.  I'm trying to get into rolling/sliding/pushing/pulling, next.
<br />

<br />
How do you overcome friction? (thought process, technique for it, and the steps for the rolling/sliding/pushing/pulling)
<br />

<br />
Do any of you guys/girls get a wierd feeling when you are doing telekinesis, if so then what if you can put it to words ( first time I got the wheel to spin for awhile my upper body turned cold and I felt tension in my stomach/diafram I don't know if it was because I was excited or what but it was a feeling I never felt before, I haven't found that feeling again but the wheel moves and now if I use no hands I can feel the magnetic pull against all of my body.
<br />

<br />
Would also like some tips on meditation for it is something I try to do but don't know if i'm doing it right.
<br />

<br />
Thanx

sorry, I dont know just yet but I'm pretty sure there is an article about this. and there are also other members that could answer this question.

Personaly I don't get that &quot;feeling&quot; whenever I perform telekinesis,
<br />
but again maybe your sensitive to the energy your using or something and that I'm not.

<br />
Here's some tips I find to be usefull
<br />

<br />
&gt; Meditate in a place where there are no distractions
<br />

<br />
&gt; Be sure your in a comfortable position that you will stay in for a decent amount of time
<br />

<br />
&gt; Always time your meditation before you start, an example of 30 mins
<br />

<br />
&gt; Relaxe yourself, try to feel and condition your mind that you are in 
<br />
a deeper level of consiousness.
<br />

<br />
&gt; If you go for visualization then make sure to see it in your mind as clear as possible...
<br />

<br />

<br />
there I hope that helps.

			the one time I think it might have been me moving the psiwheel, my stomach started to hurt really bad, my vision was jacked up (i think from staring at the paper for too long though) and my heart-rate leaped (maybe from excitment)

Does objects really have a problem with friction? There isn't any proof of this. so, don't have friction as a factor.

This is just what I have been reading, I always read when it come to rolling and sliding you got to factor in friction.  So what I'm trying to figure out is how or is it just saying you need more energy to do it?[/quote]

Don't worry over the How to do it, just practice and do it, don't even think about it. It's like running, do you need to know every single thing that happens when you run to run, of course not.
