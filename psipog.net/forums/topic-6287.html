			I started school up a few months ago and my loans cover my bus pass. Friday I got lazy (which now I'm kicking myself for) and didn't put it back in my bookbag. My brother saw it before he went to sleep Friday and my boyfriend saw it before he left for work early Saturday. Between then, I have NOT moved it at all but for some reason it's nowhere in sight. I'm in desperate need of a Remote Viewer to help me out, or I can't get to school. I can't afford to miss a class!
<br />

<br />
Thanks.

			um if you want a good remote viewer assign co-ordinates.
<br />

<br />
Let's see, since I can't do remote viewing I'll try and say check under your bed.

			I would suggest getting up extra early and walking.... but I digress.

Disclaimer: This is my first attempt at RVing.

I'm getting some bookcase... and the pass is hidden under a book.

			I'm a decent RVer, I'll give it a shot.

I see it being close to a piece of furniture, to the lower part, it could be under the piece of furniture or inside it, the furniture has an interior, and it's made out of wood. This furniture could be a bed, bookcase, desk, or table.

That sounds logical. I'm looking right now with no luck, but I still greatly appreciate the help, (and haven't raided all of the furniture yet.)
<br />

<br />
As for coordinates: Baldwin,(town)  Pittsburgh Pennsylvania (US)
<br />

<br />
The pass is dark colored with a big 2 (I think in green?) with a sparklie font that says &quot;November&quot; To give you more of an idea.
