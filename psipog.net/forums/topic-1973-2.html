			Maybe your head thought &quot;this ball is getting big, too big to control&quot; and it started to become a little unstable. Don't know what to say about the breathing thing, but the second i read that post, I want to say &quot;whip that psi! whip it good!&quot;

			I get that too, the breathing thing. The &quot;Magnet&quot; effect becomes stronger for me when im breathing in, and I would use a source for energy, becuase you don't have unlimtited energy, I read in an article (Not related to this site) that a psion can experience a thing called &quot;burnout&quot; (I think thats what its called anyway) if you use too much energy, and you won't be able to use any pis until it comes back agian.

			if you kept gathering energy through breathing, imaginging the air itself has psi everywhere, and sucking it in; that would be a good way of keeping a leveled psi energymeter. Haha! the Psi-o-meter!

			lol maybe that is how Im gathering energy, but to gather energy from other things, I imagine a red line going from my brain to the object, then picture crackling orange energy coming out of the object and swirling around the red line, into my brain. And it seems to work for me.

I like your thinking. Will be sure to try it next time so I stop using my own energy I guess...Thanks for the help.

Then, I was trying to get my dog inside. He went a far ways from the house, over 10 feet, and I was getting kinda mad. So I thought up a psi ball in my stomach. I think I used umm... gold. Yes gold and I was thinking the words &quot;follow, come, entice&quot;, things like that. Anyway, I chucked it at my dog. He came, but slowly. Like a trot. I threw one at him when he was half way to the door, that got him in. I guess it was a psi ball, not a coincidence right? What do ya'll think?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

			a while back. a good while back. i attempted my first psi ball and dureing the &quot;construction&quot; of the ball the space in between my hands got  darker as if someone was standing over me casting their shadow over it ((no one was)) and i felt the balls rim lineing up perfectly with the shadow. so what i guess im asking is, did  i make a psi ball that flared in a weird way? or were my eyes just playing tricks on me?
<br />

<br />
ps. the shadow wasnt over any part of my body but the space between my hands, the light source wasnt set up so it could create the effect then and the shadow was just in between my hands, didnt go past them in any way shape or form, it was like i was holding a black mass of psi.

			I just made a psi ball.  It had to be there, because as i enlarged i could feel  it as it pushed my hands farther apart.  I'm beginning to believe this more easier now.

			I have just started doing this psionic stuff and I have learned how to do the psi ball. The other day I thought it would be neat to form an object other than a sphere. So I kept trying and trying and on my last attempt, I focused extremely hard and it felt like my hands were burning. When I looked down on my hands afterwards, they were bright red and my skin had started to peel on my palms. Anyways the problem was, I still couldn't make the shape  I wanted. If anybody else know how to make different shapes please let me know  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Also me, this is my 3rd day of practicing psi ball. On my first attempt, i felt that my hands are pushing each other like a magnet. And i can see some sparklings of light and on my 3rd attempt on the first day. I can see some bluish snaky smoke. Is that the psi ball? Because me and my nephew, we both are practicing psi ball. And we're giving each other's opinion.
<br />

<br />
I've read some articles that said you must first visualize that you're feel the energy that you're gathering through your body, and then hear it. I'm keep on doing that. But it's hard for me to visualize the feelings. Because i'm visualizing myself standing on the moon and the moon is giving off an air which looks like a fog and it enters my body, forming an energy and i'm letting flow into my body and that's it.
<br />

<br />
I hope i could make visible psi ball when i reach 1 or 2 weeks practice.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> Take care and Blessed be. -Roel

			I think I made my first one on my first or second try today!!  I felt a kind of warmth in my stomach, then when I visualised it coming out and into the space between my hands, they just sprang apart.  My hands were really warm and started tingling, and I could feel them being pushed apart by some kind of force. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
My question is this: have I accidentally made a force ball or is this the normal sensation of a psi ball?  Also, I tried making it again and it worked a second time.  Was this just my brain making a repelling feeling because that's what happened the first time, or did I actually create a second psi ball?

Defintely sounds like one to me. It's possible that the second time it was biofeedback, but probably not. Nice one though. Keep it up. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			okay. I've been attempting to make psiballs for a few days now. I feel a slight repulsion between my hands. owever, when I move them closer together, imagining the psiball 'shrinking' (to densen it), the feeling disappears- until I move my hands apart. I don't really feel any tingling- it just feels a tiny bit like I'm about to get pins and needles.
<br />

<br />
Could you please let me know what you reckon was happening and if I managed to make a psiball?
