			Very nice posts. Good to know more ppl can see them. I was a bit worried about the idea of using negative energy, sound like it is... well, negative. But I dont think anything when doing it (I'm pretty good at it due to a specific &quot;exercise&quot; I've doing across 2 years), so I don't feel it positive or negative. I don't feel anything at all sometimes, others just the warm energy emerging from my hands, sometimes just a kind of pression inside my forehead. One day I managed to spread the pression across my head almost to the back, and with that almost lifted a plastic coup in the air. I still need pratice, but I'm very confident that's indeed possible.

That link contains a history of auras, or &quot;energy fields&quot; as they are known by modern science. It has enough keywords for you to further exend a research into the FACT that the human energy field(s) do indeed exist.
<br />

<br />
The aura and the energy field are one and the same, Roy, and your claim of not believing in either is bred of complete ignorance. You are wrong. Science has proven that you are wrong. 
<br />

<br />
In time, not much time either, you will see proof that everything is permeated in positve, negative, and neutral magnets, which are subatomic in size, perhaps a little bigger, and are a result of the electromagnetic grid that blankets this entire planet. Perhaps they ARE the electromagnetic grid, but I can only speculate at this point.
<br />

<br />
So, take my offer of proof and think whatever you like of it, but someday you will have to eat your ignorant words, like it or not... better stock up on some ketchup.

			I can see something like that when I sort of... look at air. It's like that wavy stuff you see over pavement. I first saw it while staring at the carpet, after I had been trying to see auras. I've been searching the internet to find an (non-psionics) explanation for it, but I haven't had any luck.

			Is it me or Roy's post is absolutely not clear. I will try an answer anyway. 
<br />
I can see waves anytime of the day just by focusing on it. When I do telekinesis they are involved ; they correlate with the movement of the object. They are physical and definitely not only related to psychokinesis. 
<br />

<br />
I don't know what you are refering to as psi. It's not a scientific term. I suppose it refers to energy. But everything is energy so it dosen't seem's a very specific and well shared concept. Colors are seen because of light reflection. If i see white waves, light as to do with it. If you don't think naked eyes can see such waves, well I don't care. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
If flaring is when construct emit light, I learned something, thanks. But it as nothing to do with what I think is electromagnetic waves.

You may think an aura and a human energy field are the same thing, but I do not because of the spiritual connotations surrounding the term &quot;aura&quot;.  I'd like for you to show me some research that show that this energy field reflects light and in this manner it is viewable by the human eye.
<br />

<br />
You can make yourself seem very intelligent and feel better about yourself by labeling me as ignorant all you want.  I'd rather not blindly believe everything I read and justify it with fluke science and then laud it over others in a feeble attempt to present myself as knowing what others are too &quot;ignorant&quot; to know.
<br />

<br />
As you always do, you describe everything in the most general terms as possible without providing any sort of clarification of what you're talking about.  And your claim of &quot;it's only a matter of time before science discovers what I already know&quot; is real weak sauce.
<br />

<br />
So if you think I should stock up on ketchup, then you should stock up on mouthwash, because pretty much everything you say is bullshit.
