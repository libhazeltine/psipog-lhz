			I don't believe this event happened, but let's say it did. How much experience do you have? I haven't really heard of many people who could get close to that level of TPS/TP after years. Be proud of yourself if it was real.
<br />

<br />
   Say you DID actually do something. Can you repeatedly get results like that? It'd be fun to see if you were actually any good. We should set up some stuff one day to test that out.
<br />

<br />
   He probably wasn't going to kill himself. If he was he probably wouldn't say anything. You probably wasted your time, but oh well. The past is the past. Tell him to see a doctor about that. A doctor will help him out more than you can.
<br />

<br />
P.S.
<br />
I say so little with so much. Also, yes.

   I suggest he sees a doctor instead. You should really do the same if you're going to suggest something like that.

			well im a bit skeptical as well, but at the same time i somewhat believe you.
<br />
if you really did do what you said, good job. as for the whole comitting suicide deal, i can relate. however im not seeking attention (as ive never told anyone...) but for me its the result of manic depression (a.k.a bipolar) lucky me got it from my father. as for me, i seem to have too strong of a will to do it, and thats why i started psi and such, to use that will for other things.

			If you belive you can help someone, and your intentions feel right to you, many things can go way beyount your belif. And I don't see a reason for so much skepticism (sp?) about a story. Isn't like he is wanting you to try something or selling you something. I myself got way to much beyound I tought I could get and I'm yet to see where this all will end.

I don't want any online relationships or anything like that. I'm not a sexual predator either. I'm not going to ask where anyone lives or even what thier phone number is. All that I said was something that happened. I'm not going to use that to get an &quot;online relationship&quot; because I'm not interested in that. Besides it's not like my mom would let me anyways. I'm not saying don't be careful online though. I'm just saying that I don't want that kinda stuff.
