			I posted this on my website PsiOnline, and I'll post it here too.
<br />

<br />
For a long time I've wanted a &quot;gooncon&quot; style event for the most prominent psychic sites on the internet.  PsiPog, my place, PSC, etc. Fly everyone out to some location in a conference center or something, or a park, and just have a good old time. 
<br />

<br />
Maybe some live seminars, keynote speakers, FOOD and lots of it, maybe a LAN party or some football or something. You know, lots of fun stuff.  People I've talked to personally seem really interested and would be willing to pay to fly to somewhere for this event. There are no specific dates, but sometime in July might be good.  Just want to spark some interest, I've still got to talk to Sean about this, and see what he thinks.
<br />

<br />
The last poll was replace.  New York was the highest poll option, but it would be much easier for me to plan with a local venue. I've already contacted some people who seem interested in hosting us.

			That sounds like a really great idea.  I'd SO have to come,(If I could convince my mom) but if it's closer to Spokane, airfare will be cheaper. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  Unfortunately, I probably couldn't come if it's in July  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />

			Before we start looking at places to host it, I want to get a GOOD interest first.  If we dont get at least 30 or so people, it would be pointless to do, as most convention places won't give you a room for a tiny group.
<br />

<br />
I've heard the &quot;magic number&quot; at most of these centers is 50.  That's when the discounts start comming.  I'll talk it up with other communities, see if I can get more interest.
<br />

<br />
If anyone who is 18 or older would like to help me plan, that would be great, because 16 year olds usually cannot book convention halls.  PM me if you want to help me out.
<br />

<br />
Also note that although I'll try to respect the outcomes of the poll, it MIGHT be bias towards Detroit because that is the closest to where I live, and if I get stuck planning it out (which isn't a big deal to me), then It will probably be in the Detroit Metro Area. Dont worry, I wont ACTUALLY make you go into the city. Someone would get shot.

Best place you could go for the summer. Not to mention, good climate, attractive ladies, nice beaches... And of course, close to your best pal, Sheep.

			Well, i would like it in New York City, but think about it. We shouldnt have it in a big city such as New York or Las Vegas. There are a lot of people that live there that would try to ruin it... like shoot at us, call us &quot;Devil Worshippers&quot;, start a riot... nothing good. We should have it in a small town, away from others. A place that nobody has heard of except the people who live there. Well... if we do have it in a big city, we should get some protection. Anyone related to a gang member???  
<br />

<br />
All kidding aside, i think most people on here are from New York State or around there (like Vermont or Maryland). We should have it in New York State... but since that isnt an option... i wont vote.

Wow, I have always wondered if we could do this. I would definetly come, but as many youngins have said: they would have to convince their parents and they need the money. I voted Dallas because it's close to me, and Dallas isn't as big time as New York or anything just like Psi_ninja said. I would love to come!

			I vote New York simply because I live there and  could grab a friend and get to the city. Sounds like an awsome idea hopefully we can meet some of the &quot;mysterious&quot; mods. Sounds like a good ol' psychidelic time  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> , oh boy lame joke.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

oh yea, and maybe we can have a real pk party or just like a schedual of events for which you can join in or go to a different event at the convention.
