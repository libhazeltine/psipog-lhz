			Maybe this is possible but actually there is a famous story which recounts a woman creating a person.
<br />

<br />
So like there is this woman, she travels to tibet and talks with some of those holy or shamanistic kind of people there. They tell her about creating entities.
<br />

<br />
She returns home, locks herself in meditation, for some time or continues trying over days and creates a person. An extremely sociable, happy, jolly fat person. When guests come over they think the person is real. Over a period of time the person becomes skinnier and grumpier, and essentially develops a temper. The woman locks herself in meditation and gets rid of him.
<br />

<br />
That's the story, I remember reading it before, but long time ago so I've forgotten the details. But it really is quite interesting and brings up the question of the possibility of creating a conscious.

			Creating an conscious would be very advance. If I had to rate it from a 1-10, I'd say that it is an 8 or 9 on my personal scale. Although, creating an ARTIFICIAL conscious that is more robotic like would be easier. It also depends on how much time you can put into it. One thing I hear is that Psi-energy somehow has part of our genes in them because they are produced by the nervous system, which has our genes. So my theory would be that you could somehow copy partial genes into a programmed construct and somehow give it the knowledge to grow and learn more. But don't take this too serious, I'm just trying to be creative.

			Someone asked to hear more about my wragamuffin? i cant remember who..?
<br />

<br />
Well I'll tell anyway.
<br />

<br />
Its sorta like a monkey/dog/pig. ive made different versions of them, with different purposes. The original was useless. Then I made one that amplifies incoming sendings and outgoing ones. Then i made one that follows me and vamps nons for energy. Finally I made one tonight to guard me from unwanted &quot;things&quot; entering my shield.
<br />

<br />
They've all been sucessful, thanks to Vladimir's generous scanning to help me check  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Basically, I visualise it being built out of play-doh or plastercine. Once thats done I program it with words, while visualising it doing it.
<br />
(say for example, id say &quot;eat fish&quot; and visualise it eating it.)
<br />
I do this a few times and then shell it, and check it one last time, then i send it out to do its job.
<br />

<br />
I hope that helped  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Imaginary friend?  Psi-pet?  Spirit Guide?
<br />

<br />
This actually came up a few nights ago when I was discussing this with my parents.  I was about three years old and awoke from a nightmare (only happened once in my childhood that my parents noticed) crying that a bat/dragon thing was following me and wouldn't leave me alone.
<br />

<br />
In that emotionally charged situation, my mom sat and explained to me all the wonderful friendly things about &quot;Batty&quot; for several minutes.  It became a very solid little imaginary friend, which I'd insist on keeping with me (going back to babysitters' if I'd forgotten it, etc.), and while I didn't have the ability at that age to do much with it, I am tempted to agree that it was possibly a very powerful construct.
<br />

<br />
Aah, evil sentence/paragraph. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I've been developing my current psi-pet for several years.  I decided to do something after a particularly powerful dream about an emerald-green dragon that had been jabbering at me during my migraine-induced dreams for the past several months (whee feverish delusions!).  I woke from it around 2am and immediately started into overload-style meditation (expanding my awareness) to avoid my migraine pain.
<br />

<br />
I tried making a peaceful blue to abate my headache, but it kept switching back to the bright green color the dragon from my dream had been.  I got annoyed and started sending all of this green energy into a dragon-shaped blob over to the side to get rid of it... which it now seems was the first step in creating a psi-pet.  At the time I initially considered it just a bizarre looking psiball, as my only experience had been with those and my very basic shield.
<br />

<br />
My artistic side got the better of me and I sat up and started working on it, visualizing the skeltal structure first and feeling its stiffness and light strength, then moving on to muscles, visualizing and sensing their elasticity and strength, &quot;felt&quot; the wings and tactually visualized the pebbly skin and the membranes of the wing.  Basically, added all the reptilian features I could from all the senses I could incorporate to create what turned out to be a bloody persistant construct of sorts.  As far as the sentience it seemed to aquire... I can only guess it's driven by parts of my idle/subconcious mind or something of that nature.
<br />

<br />
I was surprised when it didn't disappear after about a week, and decided to keep studying and enhancing my understanding/visualization of it.  It certainly made a wonderful distraction during those less interesting classes.  I've added dozens of layers to it in the years since, and never gone more than a week without sitting down to visualize and reinforce it fully.
<br />

<br />
That whole recommendation to practice?  I *definately* support it.  My experiences haven't been from reading some miraculous &quot;secret tip&quot; from one of the authors here, but my consistant interaction with my energies and literally years of practice expanding my awareness.
<br />

<br />
If I haven't come across as too nutty to any of you, I'd be happy to type up the list of bizarre little things I've managed through my psi-pet.  I would personally recommend at least experimenting with a dynamic construct so you can become very familiar with retrieving/maintaining a psi-pet that serves more than one use.  Best of all, they're FUN!
<br />

It's been two years since I've started making psi-balls, and I've never thought of this once. Definitely very interesting. I'll try this when I have time. Maybe today with my psi friends...

			PsiSam mentioned something about creating a conscious. My question is: How the hell would you know whether or not the construct had a conscious? You can make it respond to a given stimulus in a given way, and in theory, you could even make it seem like it was able to make choices by own, free, random will, sure. But how can you ever be sure the construct is *aware* of its existence?

			Bob_Stew: using telepathy, you can find out if it's aware of it's existance.
<br />

<br />
Also, free will is a weird subject. Is there free will? Our actions are based on our thoughts, which are based on our past experiences and current wants/needs. It's all calculated from reason. In that respect, a construct can acquire free will very quickly and very easily. 
<br />

<br />
Also, what makes this intelligence &quot;artificial&quot;? How is it different from &quot;natural&quot; intelligence?

			I would theorize that a psi-pet has just as much freewill as you do, considering it works the same way.  Just as the human brain gathers information about a given subject and behaves accordingly, so does a construct receive information about how to behave.  So yes, freewill is attained by the psi-pet the very moment you give it any direction as to how it should act.
<br />

<br />
As for artificial and natural intelligence, it's all about levels of complexity.  Given enough information, I would imagine a construct?s intelligence would resemble a natural intelligence, thereby negating the distinction between the two.
<br />

<br />
My thoughts, anyway.

Hah, I did almost the same thing.  Except that instead of killing it I decided to make it unable to comprehend turning on me.  I still get paraniod though.  It's good motivation to make sure I'm always shielded.

It sounds a bit scary, to be honest.
<br />

<br />
What exactly are they supposed to do?  It must have taken quite a bit of effort to duplicate your thoughts and memories... unless you were simply &quot;sharing&quot; them...
<br />

<br />
I'm curious about your motivation, procedure, and results, if you would like to share a bit more information.  Interesting idea, but I'm not sure how helpful they would be.
