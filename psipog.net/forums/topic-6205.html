			This is a story my father once told me about following the spiritual path to Godhead.
<br />

<br />
There was once a Princess who wanted to find a man who loved her for who she was and not her riches &amp; jewels. So, one day she started a competition. Each day, she would have any man who wished, chase after her and if the man could catch her, he could marry her. The first day of that race rolled around.
<br />
The first race that took place started with the Princess running &amp; a man chasing after her. After 5 minutes, the Princess took some jewel out of her pocket and tossed them on the ground. Immediately, the man stopped and picked up the jewels. That man lost.
<br />
The next day, a new man chased after the Princess. After 5 minutes of running, the Princess once again threw jewels from her pocket. The man had not stopped. 5 minutes later though, when the Princess through more jewels, the man stopped to pick up all the fallen jewels. He lost.
<br />
The thir day, a new man once again chases the Princess and in 5 minut eintervals, she would throw jewels. This time around, the Princess was still running and no longer had any jewels left in her pockets. The man caught up with the Princess and grabbed her. The man won and the two were soon wed.
<br />
In the end, the man married the Princess, got the girl...AND all of her jewels and riches.
<br />

<br />
Now, translated, here are the characters:
<br />

<br />
Princess-God/Spirit
<br />
Each man that lost-Everday Psions or Wiccans
<br />
The man who won-A man seeking True Godhead
<br />
Jewels/Riches-The gifts that come along the Spiritual path
<br />

<br />
Now, notice how most people will stop at the paranormal gifts we develop (jewels/riches). Although if they do not stop for them or get hung up on them, in they end, they will reach True Godhead (the Princess) and will get all these paranormal gifts with Godhead.
<br />

<br />
So, although things like Psionics are fun to play with, don't get hung up on them. Go further, seek a higher level. For in the end, no matter how much you practice moving the psi-wheeel...it will never amount to being able to move it with a single thought just because you have reached a higher level of conciousness.
<br />
I know this from experience. Before, I would practice more &amp; more to just move fog or air. Now, I have meditated so much (without practicing any Psionics) and just last night I manipulated the steam after my shower. I moved it to the right, to the left, &amp; even spiraled it downwards toward me.
<br />
All that, by just meditating to a new level. I am on the Spiritual Path...are you?

			Thank you for the story TruePsion...... <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I remember a simlar answer when I was a child and I thought about playing with the mind...but when I threw it all away because I thought it all fake I forgotten it.....But when I found this website I tried to remember all that I threw away..I think I remember much of that now. And learn a little more as well.
<br />

<br />
I figure...the reason why they stop running is becaues they fail to understand what better riches are for them.....I guess you need to understand why you should still run...But strenght is always needed.... Love is such a powerful emotion istn't it?   <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
However that is a feeling I fail to see yet to this time...I yearn for it...
<br />

<br />
No I don't think I have finish to the goal, but here is my question. How far did you think I got?...I yet feel more questions I have yet to comperhend...

			I disagree. If you practice enough you'll end up on the spiritual path. Peebrain and me both did. After you get on the spiritual path you have to find the right direction to go in though. You have not yet.

A <span style="font-weight: bold">path</span>, inclines that you are in some process of development, thus; it is not only <span style="font-style: italic">after</span> alot of practice, but as soon as one starts to practice, that one is taking on a new path. You say after alot of practice you'll end up on this path, but where were you before you reached the point of alot of practice being done? Were you not on this path? Every moment, we are on a path. In my eyes everyone is on a spiritual path whether they realise it yet, or not. Life = spiritual. No matter what one does or aims for. Life in total is one giant spiritual path of evolution. Again: In my eyes.
<br />

<br />
If I am honest, I don't think it is a very wise or &quot;spiritual&quot;remark for that matter to judge that someone else is not on the spiritual path, like you say you are. that is rather a rough judgement that I would least except from <span style="font-style: italic">someone on this path after alot of practice.</span>
<br />

<br />
Truth is one, Seers express in many ways&quot;- Swami Satchidananda
<br />
Or, we could translate it this way:
<br />
&quot;Truth is one, paths are many.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Point is, that it is pointless and impossible to say and judge whether or not someone is on (the 'right') spiritual path.

Complete, misinformed, judgment on others is no part of a spiritual path.
<br />
(I highly doubt Peebrain would agree to be on the same path as you. I would take it as an insult  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> )

There is no set path. Only a destination.

Tankdown:

Every path, every moment, every process that we have to deal with in our lives, are the best situations we could ever wish for: they have a perfect timing. We may not be capable of enjoying our current situation all the time, but hey, thats just the nature of the mind. It wants so much, besides our current situation/state. Often our minds don't like what comes to us, and therefore we are no longer capable of enjoying and appreciating our situation. You say you are not so sure that you are happy with your current path. I would advise someone who is unhappy with his current path, to stop worrying about it and start living in the present and appreciate every moment that is given to him/her. Things don't always go the way we want them to go, but these moments are meant for us to grow, evolve, and learn how to become ever-happy and appreciative. So what we picture as bad or sad situations or moments, can very well be the most important situations given to us, once we look back on them in a later stage. We then realise these situations has taught or given us so much. 
<br />

<br />
Try not to judge your situation too soon, learn to enjoy even when sadness rules your life. There is a happiness at our disposal that remains unaffected by good/bad and all other aspects of duality. You just got to find it, or cultivate it yourself.
<br />

<br />
I have noticed you are a bit sad or down or melancholic lately..? If you are interested in breaking free from that negative spiral, then perhaps you'dd like to read a small article on suffering: <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=6080" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6080</a>

			Its just haloween that makes me sad really. I always get headachs and such around this time of year. When I wrote that silly message I was in a REALLY bad mood, head hurting so much could barely stand. My mother says its alliegies, which is weird......The state of Airzona is so werid....seeds drop and all that during this time of year instead of spring. We don't even have day light saving time...we even have national guard from <span style="text-decoration: underline">other</span> states to stop our illegal immergate problem...
<br />

<br />
Its weird because I normaly feel so much better during after haloween. Never really cared why, never really beleived in that stuff. Would be fun if it was real wasnt it?
<br />

<br />
Thank you for the help. But it is hard to get in a happy mood when your in such a sad mood itsnt it? It always takes someone else to make you happy  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

It is kind of tricky to feel happy when you feel down yes. But this will become so much easier after practice and contemplation. For me, it is very hard now not to accept what comes to me and not to enjoy my unhappy moments. It goes automatically because I have done alot of contemplation on life, which changes ones perception to such a degree, that you can no longer see the world as bad and good. It becomes a challenge not to enjoy every moment..
<br />

<br />
And unfortunately, we do believe mostly that it takes others to make us happy. However, this is really not a beneficial assumption and it is not true either in my eyes. We should all learn to be our own source ofr our own happiness instead of giving away that power to other and to outside circumstances and events. If we do that, we are liable and dependent to what happens on the outside. If we stay close ot our own source and draw everything we want from there, we can never be touched by whatever happens outside, you see? We become immortal, in a sense.
