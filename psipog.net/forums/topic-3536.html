			Hey there guys.  
<br />

<br />
So I just ordered the Monroe Institute's &quot;The Gateway Experience&quot;, and was wondering if anyone else had tried it out and had any luck with it?  I have a read a lot of wonderful reviews (including Peebrains) saying that it is easy to OBE with the CD's, but I was j/w about everyones perspective.
<br />

<br />
One question with it though.  I was wondering which &quot;wave&quot; the OBE's start at.  I believe Peebrain said Wave 3, which I understand I have to work the first 2 waves to work up to that, but do I need to use wave 4 for OBE'ing as well?  Anyways, thanks!
<br />
Drew

			I found TGE really helpful, focus 10 is great, it allows you to go from awake to completly relaxed in the count of ten. I believe that you first come out of body in discovery 5 on wave 1, although you dont do any exploring, its just to get used to the idea of floating out. I havent got to that part in wave 3 yet, i am going through waves 1 and 2 again to improve the focus states, i think the next step for me is RVing. oooo and colour healing is good too.
<br />

<br />
You'll proboly find your self wanting to go on to the next part of TGE even after you have come out of body, i know i did <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  but no i dont think you have to continue, but i think OBE's would be a lot easier if you did.
<br />

<br />
Did you actually purchase the whole thing?
<br />

<br />
GOOD LUCK!!!!

			Ya I got the whole thing for the hell of it.  I figured if I didn't like OBE'ing perhaps it would help me RV?  It seems as though it has some RVing stuff in there.
<br />

<br />
But Wave 3 is the actual OBE huh?  And wave 1 is an OBE w/o any exploring?  Sounds like fun.  Its supposed to be here by Monday night or tuesday, so I will let you know how it goes <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I have mixed feelings about TGE (hemi-sync) program.  It worked well for getting me to trance, but I just didn't particularly like their visualizations.  The brainwave altering frequencies seemed to help a lot, and I have used another program called Brainwave Generator (BWgen) which just has those frequencies.
<br />

<br />
I like TGE the most for attempting on OBE because the guy's voice has woke me up once or twice so it has been useful.  Focus 10 is nice for this, although once it did freeze all my muscles so that I couldn't move them for around a full 30 seconds or so, was kinda scary and hurt somewhat.  Other than that, I still like the program...there's always bumps out there anyway, not like that one I can directly attribute to the fault of TGE.
<br />

<br />
Have fun with it, it definately speeds up the process.

			It is here and I have gotten through Advanced Focus 10.  WOW.  Focus 10 is an amazing feeling.  I have a very hard time meditating and reaching that same point on my own, so this is a great tool for me.  Do you think Focus 10 can be used as a meditative state for PK as well??  
<br />

<br />
I can't wait to get through the next &quot;Discovery&quot;, because after that is the first &quot;OBE&quot;.   I will definitely keep you posted on the outcome.  Laterz.

			Thats the thing about TGE you dont have to limit it to OBE's i use focus 10 for PK and focus 12 for other things like Telepathy and Empathy, I use monroe's energy ballon as a shielding method.
<br />
I wasnt able to get out of my body first time i tried disovery 5, i think i rushed through it.
<br />

<br />
What do you think of the resonat tuning?

			I just had the same problem and am here to report about it!  I think I also rushed through the first coupla discovery sessions, because I wasn't able to go OBE with it <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />  I am very upset right now. lol.  but newayz, i was wondering, how do you get your consciousness out of your body anyways? like...you obviously dont move your body to do it, yet i haven't ever done it, so is it like pulling your consciousness' muscles?  OR will it just happen when I have had enough practice of the other sessions??
<br />

<br />
Resonate tuning is good, actually one of my favorite things to do so far.  I dont get a different feel altogether, but I do feel something when I do it.  I dont like how he doesn't guide you into Focus 10 in the later sessions, I think if he did, I would have OBE'd.  
<br />

<br />
Any other suggestions?

			Just imagine yourself floating upwards as he discribes, go through focus 10 and adavanced focus 10 again if you have to, just get used to the feeling of going from awake to relaxed in short periods of time. If you dont get it by your third attempt just move on, learn the other tools, and mabye come back to it later but i doubt you'll want to after you have your first OBE in wave 3 <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Keep trying it, stay positive, believe you can do it, the minute you doubt your abillities will be the minute you fail. Good luck

			So the OBE in wave 3 is easier to attain than the obe in wave1??  If you have aim, I wouldn't mind fleshing this out on there...my aim is on here...

			I decided to move on from wave 1 since I finished it (i finished free flow, which wasn't much of nething).  I did the Intro to Focus 12, and at one point my right leg was scratching an itch &quot;on my right leg&quot; if that makes any sense.  By the time I realized what was going on, it snapped back, didn't hurt, just didn't happen again <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  Although, near the end of the excercise, I was having strong vibrations.  I really, really, really enjoyed focus 12, not because of close OBE'ing, but because I felt amazing and knowledgeable, very smart feeling <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  What did you guys think of Focus 12?

			i think focus 12 is great, it makes your brain feel so big <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> its useful when you really need to think about something important. Later on you will get to communicate with you higher self, or you sub-c whatever you want to call it by using focus. You can ask it any question you like and it will answer it. Its like a libary of wisdom

			Not yet.  The actually training of this CD (Wave 1, 2, and beginning of 3) could take up to 3 months depending on how hard you want to train and how much  you want to take away from the program.  But, it is an excellent tool for preparing for OBE's.  At the end of Wave 3, there is a OBE, with multiple ways of exit that you follow, multiple exits and re-entries.  If you would like to know how to get this cd set, PM me.
