			Well, have you ever thought that psi might be all 'psychological effects'?  I suspect the only <span style="font-style: italic">real</span> part of psi is TK, if any.

I've never really heard anything of the sort caused by psi that wasn't provoked, if you catch what I'm saying.

I think you have misinterpretted my question. I understand that by practicing psionics it is psychological, but by using psi does it change your psychological makeup; does it make you depressed, does it make you jubilant, does it cause euphoria. Things like that.

I said axiety? I thought I typed insomnia....Either way, i did have axiety when I tried to sleep, since I keep seeing images flicker by, but I couldn't say if it was psi related or not. But it's gone so it's not bothering me anymore to continue to figure out if it is or not.

			The images flickering by sounds like hypnagogic images. A natural part of sleep, just one not normally experienced consciously. I doubt it was insomnia related past maybe that you were tired and were starting to fall asleep consciously.

Mad hatter, I'm not a fucking idiot!  You weren't in my head so you can fucking diagnose what it is. Mad Hatter, never fucking assume something without details. I was extremely vague on what I said.

			Just offering my opinion on the topic. I thought that you might not have known the terminology. I was simply stating that what you were describing was one of the common descriptions for hypnagogic imagry. No need to get upset.
