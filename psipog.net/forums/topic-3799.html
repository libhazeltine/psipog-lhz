Sadly, some of the more serious problems are genetic.
<br />

<br />
It'd probably be possible to build a device that charged-up/empowered spirit-beings/ghosts... The person could set the device on the dead one's grave, and then the connection to the old body would lead [due to quantum entanglement] to the &quot;ghost&quot;. Then, the &quot;ghost&quot; would have a certain form of physical power source, which would make that ghost's life easier in the other realm, in the same way as $1000 per month makes physical life allot easier in society.
<br />
^
<br />
In order to build such a thing, a person would need allot of experience with the mechanics of spirit existence.
<br />

<br />
Secondly, &quot;to allow a ghost to materialize&quot;, he or she would need a large measure of artificial [yet usable] ectoplasm, which could be set beside the grave aswel.
<br />

<br />
I dunno if anyone has ever tried this in history...
<br />
Most people are affraid of ghosts and no-body ever attempts partial ressurection, even though I can only guess that [once developed enough] such a practice would be possible.

For my project I used human energies from both 'sexes', I used plant energy, I used energy from the dirt/earth, I used psi, etc. I used allot of things for my project, and I certainly believe that he is &quot;alive&quot;. If I died, for example, he would be stunted [because of our connection issues] but would still exist and progress as best he could.

Everybody dies, but once they are &quot;dead&quot; -- they have no more pain neurves, thus they do not really suffer. Life changes for them, but not all of them is lost.
<br />

<br />
Why is necromancy even possible? Because these people aren't truly dead/gone.
<br />
[ Don't do necromancy! ]
<br />

<br />
I also thing that there is a change that ressurection will be possible someday, once technology gets advanced enough.

			It might actully be possible, but it would require great focus, energy and wllpower. Ever killed a chicken and saw it walk on for a few seconds? those periods would be the easiest ones to do it, as there actually still seems to be life in them then.

It is my best guess that because a &quot;ghost&quot; no longer has physical needs, there is a large life-style change, and that &quot;ghost&quot; begins to focus purely on psi/energy sorts of things in life.
<br />

<br />
But Imagine if she got to meet all of her dead grandperents &amp; relatives, etc? Then she'd be with friends again, and basically be okay.
<br />

<br />
People who have near-death-experiences often ask not to be revived again if they &quot;die&quot;, because they enjoy the freedom and mobility of spirit existence, even though they loose their physical body.
<br />

<br />
A physical body, like a wife, is a burdon &amp; a blessing, from what I've read.

Sounds like necromancing to me... I wouldn't suggest it. O__o It frightens me.

But anyway... what you're trying to do is probably just like healing... but with a construct that'll do it for you? Sounds like it would take too much energy. I'm not sure what too suggest.

			Hey Joshy, I think the simplest, safest, and most ethical thing to do is to OBE and go visit her in the afterlife.
<br />

<br />
As for the subject of bringing back the dead, I'd advise against it. Whether there's a God or not, I think everything happens for a reason. A person dies for a greater good, and if you bring them back, you're taking them away from eternal paradise, or the chance to start over with a clean slate, or whatever you believe.
<br />

<br />
And if the being in question was going to Hell or Hades or whatever, then no one probably loved the person/thing enough to ressurect it anyway.

<br />
As for the subject of bringing back the dead, I'd advise against it. Whether there's a God or not, I think everything happens for a reason. A person dies for a greater good, and if you bring them back, you're taking them away from eternal paradise, or the chance to start over with a clean slate, or whatever you believe.
<br />

<br />
And if the being in question was going to Hell or Hades or whatever, then no one probably loved the person/thing enough to ressurect it anyway.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

In OBE you can visit people that have passed away?!
