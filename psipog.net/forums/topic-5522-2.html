			Look guys, we can't pressure Peebrain to do anything he doesn't want to do.  He chose to open this site so he can close it.  I don't know if he meant to do this, but I see it as a passing of the torch.  He's served us fully for a long time and now it's our turn to pave the path for future generations.  The closing of Psipog doesn't mean stop psionics, it means we've got to venture out and take the responsibility that he has to deal with now...

			I support peebrain 110% BUT i do not belive it would be smart to close the site....yes, its a starting for newbies and THATS THE BEST PART ABOUT IT....the more people who learn these things the better off the world will be...someday we're all going to be dead so we MUST continue to pass on such information and get even more newbies in order to achieve an even higher understanding of this world than we can accomplish in our lifetimes...the children are the future  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

P.S the site should simply be handed to someone else...it's not impossible to find someone else who can do the job

			I strongly suggest against making another community, why go through all the work in building it then trying to gather enough members when we could just use our skills to help another community which would be easier and better all around?

It just doesn't matter how much noise you make!
<br />

<br />

<br />
When Warner Brothels decided to cut down their Angel tv-series it was very popular. People moaned screamed and bitched about it for several years and some are still.
<br />

<br />
They mounted a huge campaign to save their show but when its done its done.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;On the internet. The final episode of psipog. After 6 years, it will all come down to one moment. His purpose will become clear. His fate will become legend. But what if his sould will not survive? The final key to Peebrains saga. the psipogs finale&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
So its over. No need to cry.

			Peebrain shouldn't close it, though, just because he feels that we should be doing more important stuff than teaching newbies. He could give it to someone else. I think the articles are great, even though I probably wouldn't call myself a beginner. The forum is the best, though. There's tons of psipog members, and so a lot of people are on the forums. The other sites don't have forums with more 40 or 50 people.
<br />

<br />
That's my two cents.

			i think your all missing the point. psipog is our window into the teachings of peebrain and other informed individuals. without then it would be like starying out the window, but theres nothing there. as long as people support each other psypog isnt neccesary anymore. personaly i support peebs new site regardless of what it contains because it will the same as psipog, created for a purpouse, maintained with passion and end with more than it started.

			Apparently nobody has been listening in the next board. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Peebrain expressedly said that he would be archiving the articles and Q&amp;A, along with the other portions of the Psipog main site.</span>
<br />

<br />
I know it makes absolutely no sense to follow the first suggestion already given on these boards to any newbie question, but...
<br />
There are a LOT of articles. And they're not going ANYWHERE. Forums are a dime a dozen, and it's not like Psipog is dying tomorrow.
<br />

<br />
So read the articles, find a forum in the links and advertising section, and stop complaining. Seriously, it's not like fifty people saying no is going to change anything. There are, after all, 14,000 people on the Psipog main site. 
<br />

<br />
I'm sorry, I know I'm being a callous bitch by not begging and pleading to retain something that has served it's purpose.
<br />

<br />
I shall apologize in advance for quoting something out of a religious text, but in this case, I think it is apt:
<br />

<br />
&quot;To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heavens.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Psipog has served its purpose, and I can tell you from experience that a forum without an overall Administrator does not work well. 
<br />

<br />
So why be so fearful of change, is it really that terrifying? You may have to find somewhere new. Is that so bad? You may well find that change suits you better than staying ever did. 
<br />

<br />
Face your fears, buck up, and accept the responsibility for your learning. You'll be better off in the long run.

			Makeing posts like these is not going to sway peebs one way or another.  He has set his goals which I think is great.  Is it going to suck with no psipog?  Yes.  You must realize that no one expected psipog to be around for ever.  All communities have to die/close eventually.  Peebrain is honeing his site on what <span style="font-weight: bold">he</span> wants to.  I am with Pantsparty.  I respect Peebrain's wishes.

Someone should ask for all the files on psipog and host it there self. Any takers? like front page, Articles, Name, forum. Everything. It can be the new start of Psipog...
<br />

I would but i dont have the money for it.  And im just a kid and have no web site skills.

Even though I still consider myself a newbie at psionics, I do have all the website skills and resources needed to accomplish this.  I would gladly host PsiPog and maintain it. 
<br />

<br />
And before you ask what these are (lol): PHP - 3 years, MySQL - 3 years, CSS-5 years, JavaScript-2 years, XML-2 years, Ajax-1 year, and of course, xHTML/HTML-6 years. As for the server I have many spare gigabytes of space on my server, and bandwidth isn't even close to its 5 gig limit.
<br />

<br />
Not that I am requesting  to do so <span style="font-size: 2px; line-height: normal">(er... yes I am lol)</span>, just stating that I am willing and capable of doing so.
<br />

<br />

<br />
As to whether or not I want PsiPog to &quot;die&quot;, of course not, though I do respect Peebrains wishes and will not pester, plead, or complain about it.

			I think it would hurt Psipog's authenticity if someone takes it over, using the same name and all. It should be an archived memory. There are plenty of forums around. Psipog is Psipog, and it will be a good memory, and a good place to fill your knowledge with tons of info. Don't destroy it by taking it over. I say, let it be. There is no reason to be so attached to all this. Everything, except the chat and the forum stays. In these times where internet rules the world, I'dd say you have enough alternatives to compensate the loss of inactivity. You got AIM, MSN, tons of other forums.. What would be really lost? if you think about it.. not much. It is just the idea we all have of Psipog to which we are attached. Factually, not that much will change.
