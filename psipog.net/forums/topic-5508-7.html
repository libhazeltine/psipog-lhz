Perhaps in some sense, but I've learned very unique lessons from PsiPog.  Over the next couple days I will be putting PsiPog behind me (emotionally), and I will be ready to focus on my new direction.  Please do not think that I will simply be create yet &quot;another&quot; New Age site.

The thing PsiPog had going for it was the pragmatism.  No spiritual or religious baggage involved.  There was always the recognization that while terms like 'energy' were used, they were merely a way of conceptualizing what was happening.  You cannot be sure that when you're practicing psi that you're really 'channeling the life force from your surroundings', but apparently it gets the job done.  When people talk about &quot;life force&quot; and &quot;psi energy&quot; as if they were concrete concepts, I find it to be a display of the utmost arrogance.  This arrogance is more often than not due to ignorance, self-deception, and/or a negative attitude on the credibility of the scientific community.

You have created PsiPog to prove psi to yourself, i understand, but now it is no longer &quot;machine&quot; to prove thinks to you. Now it is a place for people to learn, understand and teach others. If you don't want to &quot;rule&quot; this site anymore, i understand. Simple Let's someone else to rule it. If this seem to you like stupid idea, then it will look souspicious.

			PSi Ninja, I'm not going to argue with you .
<br />

<br />
Don't insinuate that just because I've been on these forums ( which have not been up for that long) for a short while, that I have not been a member of psipog for longer than that. I first discovered this site more than 3 years ago, thats enough time to care about a place. 
<br />

<br />
I'm not saying you don't have a right to care about it, what I'm saying is that it's not fair to take your emotions out on sean. There is nothing that I said in my post that is not true. We should be greatful that psipog was ever here, and we shouldn't be attacking the person who created it. 
<br />

<br />
I could go on but really if you dont understand the reasons behind seans decision by now&gt; then Im not going to bother with arguing with  you&gt;
<br />

<br />

<br />
so in conclusion&lt; i stick to my first statement of STFU [/quote]

			Sorry, Peebrain. I understand you were upset about what I said.
<br />

<br />
I second _LaG_pl.
<br />

<br />
Don't feel too bad about it; my opinion is clearly not representative on this forum. What I wrote may also have been affected by the fact that I originally thought you were far beyond the stage of proving psionics to yourself.. I guess I would understand you better if I knew everything about the time of the creation of psipog (and the maintaining of it).
<br />

<br />
I believe you are a very good person indeed. I feel bad for leaving you a last impression that I'm not grateful. There is much *apart* from shutting down the psipog community that I love you for doing. Your articles introduced me to psionics.
<br />

<br />
If you read this, peebrain.. Yet again, sorry.

Psi dosen't have a purpose. I don't believe in any new age psi crap. That's just tricking yourself to do psi better. I think that Sean is moving into more philosophical discovery using some &quot;psionic&quot; abilities (OBEs really don't count). I really would just consider meditating. Not like just thinking about nothing. Try expanding your consciousness outwards to encompass everything and so that you become everything. Believe me it's not a waste of time. I may just seem like the yoga shit ass new age people but I used to be very practical and scientific. Now I realize that what Sean is doing is right. I figured this out a while ago though.

			Just thought I'd re-post what I posted in the &quot;say no to psipog closing&quot; topic:
<br />

<br />
	
<br />
I'm not sure I agree with making a thread to pressure peebs to hand over psipog to someone else.
<br />

<br />

<br />
BUT, I'll say this: I VEHEMENTLY disagree with his decision to shut down psipog.
<br />

<br />
I see NO REASON why there is a need to break apart the community if there's someone out there willing to maintain it. Are there other sites? Yes; but all the ones I've seen are filled with fluff, or have something like 100 members. This is the only site that seems to be more than a small community, AND that seems to have it's feet on the ground. I know that what peebs says about him proving it to himself is true...but there's that voice in the back of my head saying &quot;Why doesn't he want the site to go on? Is it because there's something he doesn't want people to find out?&quot;
<br />

<br />
I KNOW that isn't true...... but then, how DO I know? Because I trust him? But people who are honest have lied before....on the other hand, he's never lied before, so why start now? Because I've proved psionics to myself? Kinda...but not really; I've never suceeded(sp?) in flaring my psi-ball, so it could all be in my mind. How about the psi-wheel? I dunno, I'm not the best at the psi-wheel, and haven't been able to do it under a glass; it could have been the wind.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">(please note: I am IN NO WAY saying peebs is lying, nor do I believe that; just that there's that possibility that I can't seem to eliminate from my mind, just as someone new to PK has that &quot;it might be the wind&quot; possibility that they can't eliminate from their mind)</span>
<br />

<br />

<br />
This has severely jarred my belief in Psionics. Lately I haven't been able to feel psi, make a psiball, or even make my psi-wheel budge.
<br />

<br />

<br />
To me, this is MUCH MORE than just losing the forums....it's losing a symbol, a symbol that there IS people out there who have experienced what I've experienced that aren't fluffy nutballs. That I'm NOT going insane. That this is NOT just new-age, fluffy bullshit, and that I don't HAVE to subscribe to the &quot;it's magical&quot; theory(and subsequently that there are rational people out there who believe in this).
<br />

<br />
I'm just not at the point where peebs is(maybe I never will be), and I'm still looking for more proof to myself once and for all that this is real. Taking PsiPog off the net(not necessarily peebs leaving) when there are people who would gladly take care of it is a MAJOR step backwards for me.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
.....now that I've got that out; I think no matter what we say, he won't hand over the reigns(again, a very worrying decision to me). I think we need to find(or make) a new site to agree on, where we can continue to talk about the subject, research it, etc. in a reasonable manner(one of the things that I'll miss about psipog).
<br />

<br />
He's given us time to do something, let's use that time.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
p.s. What's the geiger counter experiment he talks about in the blog? Does someone have a link to what he's talking about?

I'm just not at the point where peebs is(maybe I never will be), and I'm still looking for more proof to myself once and for all that this is real. Taking PsiPog off the net(not necessarily peebs leaving) when there are people who would gladly take care of it is a MAJOR step backwards for me.

.....now that I've got that out; I think no matter what we say, he won't hand over the reigns(again, a very worrying decision to me). I think we need to find(or make) a new site to agree on, where we can continue to talk about the subject, research it, etc. in a reasonable manner(one of the things that I'll miss about psipog).
<br />

<br />
He's given us time to do something, let's use that time.

p.s. What's the geiger counter experiment he talks about in the blog? Does someone have a link to what he's talking about?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">It seems this site is filled with more fluff. Reread Sean's last couple of blogs. He's finding purpose finally in psionics and we should all do the same. The psipog community was his project to prove psi to himself and now that task is complete. Even though we think it's grown to something more, it really hasn't. Psipog stands for psychic students in pursuit of guidance. Is that really want we want it to be? Or a place where we can discuss psi intelligently?

It certainly has become a place to discuss Psi freely, but is that such a bad thing really? Although on the same page you cant say that because commonly people come here asking troubleshooting questions about their psionic abilities. Hence P.S.I.P.O.G.

			To Peebrain, I read your blog entry, and I respect and salute the personal transition you have made.  It is good to have self-realizations of that quality, and it is honorable to describe them openly so that others can share in the realization.

I would also like to say that I agree that OBEs are a worthwhile pursuit.  From within an OBE, psi can be performed with clarity significantly exceeding conventional psi.  The difficulty always seems to be in the consistent triggering of OBEs.  I have a note of caution and a note of advice in this future pursuit.  The note of caution is to avoid the use of hypnosis to trigger OBEs.  Studies of this have typically found that an experience which seems like an OBE but which is triggered by hypnosis is usually not a genuine parapsychological OBE, but is usually just an experience generated inside of the hypnosis.  (After reading about your intention, I added links to four studies discussing this and verification methods to the end of <a href="http://vsociety.net/wiki/Etheric_projection#Parapsychology_articles_about_OBEs" target="_blank" class="postlink">this page</a>.) The word of advice I have is to consider investigating meditative triggering of OBEs.  The traditional methods mostly center around sleep-based approaches, but these are notoriously unreliable, and somewhat passive in their triggering.  I've found that OBEs can be triggered during meditation, but that it is difficult to do so consistently.  However, in theory I would speculate that they should be more consistently triggerable during meditation, and so this is probably the approach which will be more productive in the end.  If you want to discuss this in more detail, I encourage you to drop me a message.  This is an area I've considered investigating in more detail.

To the members of this community, I would like to say that you should try to understand the work that goes into maintaining a large community, and thus understand that it would be difficult for him to maintain two.  You do not, however, have to abandon the community interaction that you have found.  There are a number of other communities on the internet which will support your discussion, interaction, and study.  On behalf of <a href="http://vsociety.net/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Veritas</a>, I'd like to say that any of you are welcome to visit our community to see if it supports what you are looking for.  We have a <a href="http://vsociety.net" target="_blank" class="postlink">wiki</a>, a <a href="http://forums.vsociety.net" target="_blank" class="postlink">forum</a> with 3400 members, a vibrant <a href="http://chat.vsociety.net" target="_blank" class="postlink">chat</a>, a <a href="http://forums.vsociety.net/board/72" target="_blank" class="postlink">variety</a> of <a href="http://vsociety.net/wiki/Psi_articles" target="_blank" class="postlink">articles</a>, and intensive <a href="http://forums.vsociety.net/topic/9001.0" target="_blank" class="postlink">classes</a>.  While our structure is somewhat different than here, our underlying interests are quite similar.
<br />

<br />
Most of us are strong proponents of critical thinking being applied to psi, and most of us support using <a href="http://vsociety.net/wiki/Parapsychology" target="_blank" class="postlink">scientific</a> reasoning and objectivity in our discussion of psi.  There is also an active spiritual aspect to our studies, and many of us have found a comfortable synthesis combining these views.
<br />

<br />
I would also encourage you to use this thread to thank Peebrain for his work in maintaining the site, as I can assure you that this can be a time consuming task which he has undertaken for quite some time.
