			I do it almost every night but lately I have been falling asleep during the meditation which is very upsetting to me because I don't get too far. It sucks, I used to be so good at it. (I stopped over the summer)

			I tried this, did it for 45 minutes (set the alarm for an hour though) and it only seemed like about 10 minutes. Not too bad for my first time. Actually, my first experience with this type of meditation was about a couple of years ago, for an hour. I was able to clear my mind quickly, partly because I've been practicing clearing my mind for my PK practices. I started feeling some insane vibrations. I pretty much almost had an OBE.
<br />

<br />
That would've been cool, but wasn't the aim this time, so I kept myself from having one. It's weird. First, I imagined wind swirling around me, and then I felt like I had the 'spins'. (I don't recommend drinking, but you know when you're really drunk? Yeah. That one.) Anyways, also, after the meditation, I made more progress than ever before on the psi-wheel. I was able to turn it a little over an entire revolution.
<br />

<br />
I'm going to MM much more often now. I also feel very peaceful now, even though it's been about a half-hour since the meditation. Soon, I believe, I will have complete control over my mind, and be the master again. I can't believe I just wrote this much on the subject. I might even rigth an article on PK soon. It's been my 4th day of PK practice, and the only time I didn't get significant results was the 2nd day. It's outta control. This is great fun.

He want's to OBE... permanently. Yeah. Pretty stupid.... I'd slow my heart, but actually <span style="font-style: italic">stopping</span> it? That's going a little too far.

			I don't actually believe that this person who said they did actually did. You would have to have magnificent control over your entire body to do such a thing.  
<br />
If he could only do 15 minutes worth of meditation then he definetly wouldn't be able to stop his heart. 
<br />
To even tell if your heart is going or not is also relatively difficult if you don't know what you are doing. At least for me, I can't really find a good place to feel my pulse. But I'm fat.

			Yeah, 15 minutes really doesn't count as a significant 'round' of meditation. That guy puts it so lightly. I should meditate more... It's cool, but I tend to get uncomfortable sitting in that same position for extended periods of time.

			I just tried this about an hour ago. My goal was thirty minutes, so I set my cell phone alarm. my hands and upper thighs soon got to the &quot;not there&quot; point, but nothing else did. I was laying on my back. I felt nice for this one point near the end, but then my knee started jerking involuntarily and pulled me out of the trance. When I was in the more cognitive state I started to loose control, and started to wonder if I had set my alarm correctly Because &quot;it sure does feel like more than 30 minutes&quot;. Well I fought that off for a long time and then eventually caved in and opened my eyes (they had a hard time focusing) and saw that I was 3 minutes away from 30 minutes  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> .
<br />
It turned out that my phone was not on.
<br />

<br />
When I stood up and started walking around it felt like I was in a haze...It wasn't good nor bad...just different.
<br />

<br />
Pretty awesome! I will be trying this again sometime later this week for 45 minutes.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I haven't met my 5-hour goal yet because I haven't had time to try but I just wanted to comment on something I remembered. While reading about socrates one of the most interesting things I think he did was meditation. Although all accounts about it never say it was meditation, they say he actually went into trances. So deep meditation. And one time he actually did a motionless meditation for 24 hours! Standing. Started in the evening and went all through the night and next day without moving a muscle in such a trance. Cool no?

Can you get close to 5 hours?! My record is 1 hour and 45 minutes. 
<br />
I have a 1 week break coming up soon and I plan to meditate for many hours, maybe even a day.

			If you can actually stop your heart I would suggest you stop, you might not restart it. I was never able to stop my heart but I slowed it down a little to much and it almost knocked me out, not to mention it really hurt my chest. Trust me its not something you want to play around with. I had to learn the hard way.

how do guys manage to focus on anything for that long i only made it 45 minutes. i intend to go for 2 hours eventually.

We can do it for so long because your not focusing on only one thing. Let your mind wander, that's fine. The challenge is keeping your body still, and staying awake. Once you get around 2 hours (at least 2 hours for me), your feelings get a lot different. Your not focusing on keeping your body still because you're so comfortable. It's like you don't <span style="font-style: italic">want</span> to move anywhere. You just want to spend more time in your head and relax. (or you can try to have an OBE from the start which will lead to you having to focus at some point.) Also you know that kinda numb feeling you get after doing it for like 30 min., you get that in your whole body. You really get the feeling of your true self, and your body just being an &quot;organic machine&quot; carrying your true self. That make sense  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  ?....And to you fatman...an entire day is an ambitious goal. It's a lot harder than you may think but I look forward to hearing how it goes. I'll let you know about my progress as well.
