			so throughout my reasearch i find the 12th of august to be a unique date.
<br />
feel free to post your opinions.

August the 12th was the date of the Philadelphia Experiment, according to some testimonies of those involved. This was the famous &quot;project invisibility&quot;, and temporal time and space warping (time travel).
<br />

<br />
The 12th and 13th of August has long history of events. Napoleon had his &quot;mystical&quot; experience on August the 12th, in the Kings Chamber, which even on his death bed, he refused to fully relate, since he felt that people would not believe him anyway
<br />

<br />
Similarly, the magician, scientist, head of the OTO (Ordo Templi Orientis, and founder of the Order of the Silver Star A:A), was inside the Great Pyramid, on August the 12th, when his wife received the book of the law, whose Cipher many UFO contactee's recieve from their &quot;ashtars&quot;. Furthermore, on August the 12, 1923, Aleister Crowley, does his first magickal time travelling experiment, opening a magical time portal to Orion and the &quot;ancient ones&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Then to culminate these two prior events, in 1943, AUGUST THE 12TH, ALEISTER CROWLEY DESIGNED THE MAGICKAL BASIS FOR THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT, which would thus link back to his experiment 20 years prior. He was doing a magickal ritual for the Navel experiment, at the &quot;Magical Ring&quot;, Ashdown Forest, England. On further project &quot;rainbow&quot; and &quot;Phoenix&quot; time travelling experiments, August the 12th was always temporal vector, virtually every year and in a major sense every 20 years, as well as every 10 years for minor harmonics. Then there are nodles inbetween (1999 is on a noodle), 2003 is the big event which forms a pentagramme in time and space. 2012 and the Wave Is Coming...
<br />

<br />
August the 12 and 13th was the time that the Osiris Mysteries were shared and performed, the word Wizard comes from those who held the Staff of Power, which was called the WSR (Wassar). Osiris was the Life Force within creation, his backbone the Djed, or Djedhi, hence the &quot;Force&quot; of the Jedi Knights of Star Wars. Osiris was called SR, or ASR (Ausir), as well as Wassir. The Wasser staffs were electrical conductors of power, hence the Wizzards were Wassirs or Osiris' using WSR Wands for their Hex's (hexagon), in Egyptian Heku. So there is a very ancient lineage of traditions that have their Mysteries imparted on August the 12th and 13th.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I'm sorry. I still don't believe you.
<br />

<br />
But as for what you posted, there's alot of rumors about the Phili-Experiment. Nobody really knows what happened. What is known is that people disappeared, a boat might have traveled across the atlantic from Phili to Norfolk in unbelieveable time, or it may have actually went back in time. There's numerous more, including the bar fight situation and people being found fused to the ship. We'll never know what really happened, because the government wouldn't tell us about anything they fucked up on, let alone anything they succeeded with. Nobody else is going to get &quot;their technology.&quot;

			well, technically you still are having dreams, but you aren't remembering them.  everyone has at least 60 or so dreams a night, but we only remember one, two, or none of them.  quite interesting actually.

i dunno about sixty dreams a night. since REM sleep happens every 60-90minutes its near impossible to have a a dream every minute. i always wake up in the middle when i feel that it is a dream and become semi lucid. and then the dream continues on.

			yeah, it might be about 45.  keep in mind though, a dream that seems like it's 10 minutes long, really only lasted for a few seconds...we discussed it in psychology, unfortunantly i didn't take any notes i can cite.

how does that explain that fact that when people wake up from a dream and check the clock and fall back asleep and 'fall' right back into it? and wake up again to check the clock at a diffrent time lets say at the end of the dream? not sure about the whole seconds thing man.

			there were more dreams in that time period you didn't remember, time it took to fall into the REM stage (it takes more than seconds), a number of answers to the question.  look, i'm not the expert.  if you have qualms with this fact, search google, and take it up with the experts who get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to research this.

			Experiments have shown that if sleepers are awakened as soon as REM starts, they enter REM sleep more rapidly the next time, and their REM is more intense. If the deprivation continues, they go into REM as soon as they fall asleep. It becomes impossible to deprive people of REM sleep without keeping them awake all the time. REM-deprived people can go into REM quickly in shorter naps.

and........i never said that wasn't true.  we were debating the amount of dreams you have a night, not how rapidly you go into REM in different situations.
