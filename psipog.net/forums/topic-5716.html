			Well recently I have sort of had these strange images coming into my head. They are more symbols than anything, and it's spontaneous. So I occasionally have traced them out with my finger when they come into my mind and sometimes strange things happen, so one day I decided to put a bit more energy into the attempts and found it is almost a weird sort of telekinetic-feeling. Tracing different patterns has different results and have often had odd coincidences or otherwise occur when I &quot;traced&quot; the patterns. Usually strong feelings of heat in my palms and have noticed that I have a precognitive state at times where I see things well before they happen. I can see my entire day ahead, whatever. Also my dreams have revealed future events. Perhaps someone has some ideas of what I am referring to. I have been sorta &quot;trained&quot; to use psionics but not to the extents I experience the current activity. I decided I'd ask the experts on this one.

			im not quite sure what you mean by tracing things out with your finger. however... my view on such things as this is as follows..
<br />

<br />
when something either really good or really bad happens to you; that situation is held in your memory for quite some time. and i mean EXTREME situations that will cause you to think A LOT. so this is where i feel the pre-cog comes into play, if something BIG is about to happen it will kick in and you'll have psychic senses for a while. then they pass. 
<br />

<br />
at least thats how it work(ed) for me - i really wanna see another opinion on this as well

			I agree, me too.
<br />

<br />
As for like tracing things out, it's more like hand movements to stimulate &quot;psi&quot; usage and gathering energy. That is about the only way I can explain it.
