I let neveza speak for me because he said exactly what I wanted to. (Mabye being a little more rude, but still getting my point across) If you can't understand what I'm saying mabye you should think about it or re-read it. I don't think what you said was intelligent or logical. (Not that it has to be, but a lot of what you were saying was simply wishful thinking) I also wanted to add more about how you &quot;hovered&quot; and about how fluffy that was, but didn't bother.
<br />

<br />
And to you grogen, my quotes weren't taken out of context. I didn't change any wording or order. I took what I thought was &quot;retarded&quot; and posted that fact.
<br />

Also, the re-directing or misplacing your weight thing has been proven. Many times over. On television.

Well I guess some people just like to believe any &quot;stranger&quot; would say is &quot;fact&quot;. The &quot;fact&quot; that I don't even know you or even this subject leaves me with few grounds to stand on. So the only intellect way to take this is to see some evidence. Which is what I only heard but have not &quot;seen&quot; (although Smith did give some).
<br />

<br />
I agree that it is indeed hard to disagree with fact. But saying all that you know is fact is a little &quot;suck up&quot; to yourself.
<br />

<br />
True I don't know this histroy which is why I didnt side with you. You can blame me for not knowing it. But you can't blame me for not sideing with you.
<br />

<br />
Maybe if you try to speak a little nicer more people would believe in you?

			The siddhis have nothing to do with the Ninja. Once again I'm surprised at the level of ignorance here relating to things like siddhis and possible psionics out of this forum.
<br />

<br />
Some people haven't even made the connection between siddhis and psionics.
<br />

<br />
Nevertheless mystical powers were supposedly common back in ancient times. The Hua Hu Jing (which is chinese) mentions clairvoyance, telekinesis and telepathy. Stories are abound with Buddhist ascetics who flew around in mid-air. One died because he lost his concentration, another flew around to attract attention and stop a war and yet another did so to show off and was thus punished.
<br />

<br />
The point is if you lecture on something such as esoterism, paranormal, occultism, magick or religion for that matter do a lot more research then you already have done. Plus all this stuff about the ninja so far is mostly restating what the previous person said.

I believe more what they say on the History Channel more than what anybody on this board that's probably in their teens that does nothing but read manga say.
<br />

<br />
I'm not trying to make anyone believe anyone. I'm just telling people what it is that is known to be fact and I become very frustrated when they disagree with me without giving me other evidence besides their own word.

Even if I don't agree much to psiready,he has good manners and many others too.And for that ,I respect him.I think he isn't someone who curse everyone who doesn't agree with him. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

Well I'm glade you said where you got the information. I do remember seeing on the histroy channel once about ninjas but I don't remember much. As long as you tell where you got your information I won't care about your buntel assults.

			Exactly. Let me restore this subject towards it's originality. 
<br />

<br />
I have also had a dream in which I learned how to fly and use TK with extreme power. I also tried to use the same technique I learned from the dream in real life as well. But of course, there was no success, but also, not much of a technique. I did feel odd feelings though. As if it was going to work, just like the author of this thread. 
<br />

<br />
What I have to say is though, doesn't this happen a lot though? You know, everyone must have had a similar dream. 
<br />
This dream was actually one of my inspirations to psionics, it is where I began my quest shortly after.

the only thing I've read on here that has anything to naruto is &quot;ninja&quot; and &quot;manga&quot;, manga was briefly mentioned and there was a movie reference in teh ninja post.....  I hate that narutard word!   I have only seen maybe 2 naruto fans on here and only 1 naruto obsessed manga-warped reality thread....   If anyone could possibly give me links to 4 different threads that have naruto fanboys going crazy and mixing it with psionics, then I will take this post back and no longer express any dissent with that word.    
<br />

<br />
it makes me mad ...   partly because it sounds stupid and partly because I haven't seen any fanboys on here
<br />

<br />
and I wouldn't bother telling neveza to calm down he's always like that... so I don't think he's really mad or maybe he is I dunno....   he cusses so much it doesn't really mean anything anymore to me
<br />

<br />
about the ninjas:  I think they did have some paranormal abilities- at least ninjutsu teaches how to direct energy and use a version of cloaking shields by meditating.   but a lot of it is definitely hype and myths.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I think this dream flying idea is pretty neat and the technique posted works well to make me feel lighter although I haven't achieved outright levitation with it.  I do think that would be possible if I practiced more.

			I think that the non-literal visualizations help promot a conscious connection to the task, BUT, the literal process may have to do with inverting gravity polarity in your bodymatter, much like switching the magnetic charge of a fridge magnet from positive to negative.

That's just a suggestion, though. I can't levitate so I couldn't say first-hand. I only levitated once, woke up, and fell, when I was very young. It was basically an un-repeatable &quot;Freak accident&quot; for me.
