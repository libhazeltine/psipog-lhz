			i'm sending you a pm. a bit of a warning though, the method i have to use until i can OBE requires a lot of consentration(well for me anyway, i have a poor attention span and it takes effort to stay focused), and i will slip and go back to my mind.

anyway, according to what happened yesterday, it seems like you cant skip floors to reach someone else. last pm i got from LOTRfool he was on floor 2. 
<br />

<br />
Surly, try the Visualization method, thats the method i use, till i can get the OBE method right anyway, then i'll use that.

			well, instead of doing 5 pm conversations at once, why not just talk about it here?
<br />

<br />
anyway, try not to get distracted or anything, i've never died there, and i would really rather NOT find out what happens if you do. so be careful, if yall see me online you can pm me and i'll go there, and you try to focus on going to me, thats what LOTRfool did anyway, and he's made it there i believe.

			In case he hasn't posted it yet, here's the method he uses to project (If the link doesn't take you straight to it, go under &quot;Advanced Skills&quot; and click on &quot;Astral Projection&quot;). This is from an ebook linked off the PsiPog site.

Lucidess, follow these directions but modify them so that you're focusing on a tower, then let the details get filled in the longer you focus on the concept. Oh, and of course, be prepared to fight.

no, g's with me, he's only gone to the tower on his own once, and that was when he went all berserk on me. if anything there might possibly be someone that looks simlar to what i discribed perhaps. 
<br />

<br />
you must have a lot more free time than me, i only have time for one or two floors at a time before i stop and go on to something else for a while.
