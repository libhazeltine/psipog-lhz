			Some people say that if you feel that &quot;Magnetic Feeling&quot;, it is a psiball.  Well, I don't think it is, because I just held my hands in one place for a long time and the same thing happened.  Also, it does get hot in between your hands because of the heat from your palms.  So I guess you shouldn't beleive you made one until you feel the tinglyness or whatever.
<br />
I seriously can't get any other feeling other than that false pressure, so I am starting to beleive it isn't real.

			Hey there!
<br />

<br />
How long have you been practicing?! It might take some time for your subconscious to associate your method for making a Psiball into ACTION. 
<br />

<br />
It too me quite some time to be able to do ANYTHING psychic, From the very beginning it was like... 4-6 months of practice until I actually had solid evidence that what I was doing was real. So, don't give up just yet.
<br />

<br />
I also have a feeling that it took me so long because I had very little to no resources to help me out. I bet I can get you to move psi around in 1 week if you can specifically tell me what you are doing.

			ok, trust me, the magnetic feeling is a sign of psi, sure, u can get a magnetic feeling from keeping ur arms in the same place, but  if its like how i feel it when i make a psiball, is like holding hard drive magnets close together, is that not a  sign of psi? and i can make it cold, or to be really hot and make my hands red, so u think that its fake if u have results like that? i agree with sheepking that it could be that ur new and ur not getting results yet, but trust me, it gets stronger,,

			Well, I would hope that making a psiball wouldn't take that fucking long.
<br />

<br />
Heat is heat, don't get to wrap up with all the details and just go with it. Make it cold in a hot area to figure it out if you are making one or not.

			I make hot psiballs when my hands are very cold, on cold days. They become warm after some minutes. I can also make cold ones on hot days.

			Yes, there is a feeling that of 'magnetism' when you hold your hands in the same place for a while. Another similar thing is a trick where you push your hands against another persons hands for a short time, and when they move their hands away you can feel a 'ball' in between your hands.
<br />

<br />
But psi balls are VERY different. When I did it (for the first time, about 30 minutes ago!) it was an extreme of the magnetic feeling. There was almost no feeling, except a bit of tingling in my fingers, until I tried to move my hands towards or away from each other: I nearly couldn't. The feeling of magnetism was so strong that I found it hard to move my hands anywhere but around the ball.

			Due to some real life issues, I may need to learn to put up shields fast. What sucks is I have constant AOL because my mind goes crazy. I've been practicing like for 2 weeks, too.

			dude the best way to see if its real is to make a really big psiball and check if you can feel anything, my friend made one in a half a metre diametre, i didnt believe him till i put my hands ito the psiball, i could feel heat 25 centermetres away from his hands, i do not believe that that could have been just a trick, plus i also get the magnetic  feeling if i make a psi ball, and get an object that is long, a screw driver for example, i hold my hand on the handle of the screw driver and move the screw driver around where the psi ball is and i still feel the magnetic feeling, i do not believe that that could be a trick
