			Ever since i have been young i have realized i've had something, but i'm not sure what. i will give you a little back ground about me before i get in depth.
<br />

<br />

<br />
My personallity:
<br />
Well i'm a normal kid. Semi popular, i play hockey for a high school team, i go to parties, drink, used to smoke. Teenage bull shit. I'm not some strange dark person who wears make up, and i'm not some weirdo who sits in his room crying every night to sleep. I've delt with all normal things in my life. nothing too excessive and heavy. No close deaths like close friends, or parents or siblings. i was never raped, molested, or anything that would give me a fucked up mind set. I've experiment with drugs such as weed, alcohol, tobacco, saliva, ritalin, and viciton. No hard drugs to fuck my mind up bad. I never did anything but weed, alcohol and tobacco more than once. Now i currently chew tobacco and drink alcohol. I've had one real loving relationship that lasted 8 months which ended hard since it was my first, but we all know what that's like. My favorite thing is seeing other people happy, i'm not some fraud who will do anything, but if someone else is happy, then i'm happy. I love making people laugh, i am told to be quiet a funny person. I am also creative, i love writing, and drawing especially, as well as reading. 
<br />

<br />
To put everything in a nut shell i am a normal 15 1/2 kid who likes having a good time and not stressing about alot of things.
<br />

<br />
My Body: I am 150 pounds, and i'm six feet tall. Athletic for the most part. I have all my limbs, and no physical or mental problems. and the only thing in my family history is high colesterol, and high sugar.
<br />

<br />
My Mind/Mind Set:  Well i am a stoic person with alot of things. best thing i like to compare my self to is the song &quot;Float on&quot; by modest mouse. No matter what we go through in life, as hard as it may be, and as much as we don't think we'll ake it through, we'll all float on, and make it one way or another whether sooner or later. The only time i am violent is with these reasons 1. in sports 2. if someone fucks with a close person of mine or 3. it has something to do with business. I'm a caring person for people who deserve it, i hate scum bags. it has nothing to do with race, religion, or creed if you're a peice of shit... you're a peice of shit, end of story.
<br />

<br />
My Religion: I am christian, i totally belive in god and jesus. Now i don't care if you disagree becaues you are athiest or whatever that's not the point. I love god, and i am apprciative of everything he has brought into my life, whether good or bad. Why? because i believe it is to make me stronger, or to make me learn something or understand something. I don't believe god gets people back, or causes people problems, he just allows them to happen. One example is one night i promised god i would do school work, and instead i drank heavily and didn't do it. What happened later? Well a bad stomach ache that made me regret it. A normal cause of alcohol, yes. But what did it to for me, it made me believe in god ever stronger.
<br />

<br />
The reason i have told you all this is maybe someone who is very advance in mind abilities can understand me more and give me more advice. Now for what i have to talk about.
<br />

<br />
As i said ever since i was younger i've had an ability to predict out comes. So far they have been small, but it has began ever since i was about 10. It first started when i saw a game show on nickelodeon where people would pick numbers and such. Everytime they would pick, i'd guess their number before they said it. It has been the same with the show &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; I will be able to pick the case the case the person will choose before they say it. I can predict when phone calls will come before my phone rings, and basically small things. However i can't do it whenever i want. I will get a feeling for a split second. and image will pop into my head, i will feel it in my stomach and it will register in my mind and i will say it and it will happen. But i have been able to make things happen with deep in depth thought. The kind that has made my mind tired, head hurt, and my body physically exhausted. I do this mainly when i am in bed. a time when i am in the situation to concentrate very well without much chance of distraction. One example is this. I believe dreams can be very good or bad if you dream about someone you know. Like say you have a really strong dream about someone that's good, like you had sex with them. If it feels real enough if you will most certainly have that in your head and feel different the next time you see them. Same with a bad dream about someone. So on several occasions with my past girlfriend that i wanted to get even closer to. i would rack my mind on thinking of sending a dream, or good ideas about myself so they would dream about it. and it happened 3 times out of maybe 4 or 5. i would see her or talk to her the next day and she'd tell me she dreamt about me. Now i didn't say &quot;ohh really, that was my fault&quot;. When it comes to picking things other people will pick i highly doubt it means i'm good with probability since that requires thought and mathematical skills. The choice would just come into my head. And it wasn't just choosing one out of 3 boxes giving me a good chance to pick it. When i was younger it was 1 out of 9 numbers from that game show, and now its 1 out of say 30 boxes on Deal or No Deal.
<br />

<br />
So that is basically me and my mind and my ability i am first talking about. Now i want to be able to increase this ability and use it. I just saw a thread that first introduced me to Telekenisis. I'd heard about it, but what really attracted me was pyrokenisis which really intrested me. Now since i've never tried anything with this i don't want to just read a quick file about it and jump into it only to get disappointed by not having anything happen.
<br />

<br />
I was first considering learning how to harness my energy and make a psi-ball which seems to be one of the first steping stones to mind abilities. I am really hoping for good advice with this, and almost like a guide to advancing some potential energy/ability i posess.
<br />

okeydokey, from what it sounds like you already have a knack for a type of pk (macropk i think its called....or is it micro:S) which is affecting outcomes.
<br />

<br />
try rolling a dice and see how many times you get the answer right. then try with a deck of cards, and see how many cards you predict etc you get the idea.
<br />

<br />
just to clarify, erm refer to is as PK inducing fire, or something of the sort, as &quot;pyrokinesis, cryokinesis, umbrakinesis&quot; is kinda frowned upon terms...theres a sticky about it in psychokinesis.
<br />

<br />
it could either be PK or a type of precog. erm im putting up an article of precog soon so yeh...

			Hey OldSchoolBeat,
<br />

<br />
There are a lot of references online to how to manipulate Psi and create psiballs. I suggest you start by looking around for some of them. Psipog is a pretty good source. If you want to be successful at training your Abilities, you shouldn't rely on a &quot;teacher&quot; to guide you. In my opinion, the people who get the farthest are those who are self-motivated and those who really have a passion for doing Psi. 
<br />

<br />
Going to clarify something; YOu don't necessarily have to learn to move Psi around, or create Psiballs, in order to do Psychokinesis (Or &quot;Pyrokinesis&quot;). However, you will find that Psi Manipulation is an intruiging endeavor to undertake, along with any other skill.
<br />

<br />
A couple of tips:
<br />
1. Be creative.
<br />
2. Be patient.
<br />
3. Be flexible in the way you practice, as rigidity of your methods will really test your patience (ie. try different methods until one works well and often).
<br />

<br />
Good luck.
