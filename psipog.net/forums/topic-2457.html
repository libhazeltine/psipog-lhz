			Well, I've been trying pk for about 6-7 months but all I do is stop things and not move them. Like if a pencil is about to roll off my desck I react and I stop it but I can't roll it back to me.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Edit: It's like that's the only thing I can do, I can stop a little bigger stuff like....once I stopped a door for like 2 seconds.

			If you can stop a door for 2 seconds then you might want to try this really cool idea I thought of when reading this: Pick up a pencil, throw it over your head and try to stop it as it's falling onto your head. Actually look up to the pencil as its zooming towards your eyes and stop it before it hits them. You might be able to levitate it. Just an idea.

			I think this happens because it is easier for the brain to make something still (like 90% of the things around you) then to make them move.  To stop a pencil or a door, it only needs one solid stop.  To move something, it needs to be continues and keep hitting the object.
<br />

<br />
PS: Psi_mainpulator:  This would most likely not work because he is not going to just have to stop it once.  He would have to repeatedly hit it because of gravity.

			it usually takes a little more than a year to get tk going decently, so you're at a good point right now. yes it is a little frustrating but you can't force psionic skills. you just need to let them happen when they happen. if you are forcing yourself, you won't get as much out of the practice if you were to just relax and take in whatever happens neutrally.

			Uhm, been hovering over this post, but haven't wanted to answer with this in case I annoy anyone.. but oh well; here goes.
<br />

<br />
There's a possibility that this could be what the Psion Guild class this as a form of PK, a sort of ability in itself... <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span>look for their ability charts in the Education Department<span style="font-weight: bold">)</span> being, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">manipulation of 'Momentum/Inertia'.</span> 
<br />

<br />
A lot of people think of the Psion Guild in a *cough* less than positive manner, but when I was first starting out I found some of their information helpful (i.e. above mentioned ability charts). <a href="http://www.psionguild.com" target="_blank" class="postlink">www.psionguild.com</a>
<br />

<br />
Of course, apollo's idea that its easier for your mind to make things still than move them due to 90% of your surroundings being still also - could be true also. Food for thought.
