You could use pyrokinesis to start a spark and blow up the explosives... or something else...

			If you are referring to the official meaning of the words you mentioned, then levitation belongs under the ability we call telekinesis.
<br />

<br />
Invisibilty and blowing things up as you call it, would belong to the term psychokinesis. Telekinesis itself falls under psychokinesis also. You could consider psychokinesis to be the term for every ability that concerns manipulating and changing the world of physical energies (matter). 
<br />

<br />
Telekinesis means only the movement of an object by the power of the mind. Tele(distant) Kinesis(movement).
<br />

<br />
Keep in mind two things though, one: These terms are poly-interpretable, and second: Your post lacked some intelligence and/or depth. Just a tip.

			Ma- do u mean i am lacking detail or what and telekinesis seems like the ability to move things across a surface area or supended items motion, but i am talking about lifting an object and, though not really, defying the laws of gravity

			1) yes levtation is, of course, Tk
<br />

<br />
2) Physically making yourself invisible, very unheard of would be some work of PK i think.  But the &quot;conventional&quot; invisiblitly is more like, being unoticed.  Making a person not notice you, which would be TP.  They'll see you but it would register in their brain
<br />

<br />
3) Depends what your blowing up, but probably all PK

2  this is tough.  i don't see where everyone is getting at the idea of this being psychokinesis, what are you moving???  after some careful consideration, i came up with constructs.  you can make a cloak sheild that makes you harder to see, or less noticable.  although this isn't true invisibility, it is closely related.  and, since a sheild is a large construct, that's how i came up with invisibility being related to constructs.  i also agree with rahmimd in saying this could be TP; i would have to say a mix of TP and constructs.
<br />

<br />
3 psychokinesis.  &quot;pyrokinesis&quot; is the movement of fire that is already present.  when blowing something up using psychokinesis, you are moving the atoms faster and more vigorously (sp?) which causes explosions.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

			well invisibility COULD, theoretically possible but CRAZY hard, would be the movement of light somehow.  Like stopping the light you give off, but you may just be a person shapped black hole i guess.  Idk  But it's possible, if your crazy, INSANE, FLIPPING OFF THE WALL good.  lol
<br />

<br />
I've only ever heard of 'cloaking.'  Which is a kind of TP, where say your at a party, HUGE amount of ppl.  And Bam you see that person that thinks they are your freind but really they annoy you.  You of course dont want to go through your Whole &quot;smile, nod nod&quot; sharade.  So youd decide to cloak.  Turn around or somthing, do the &quot;mundane&quot; hidding thing and COMPLETLY forget about said person.  This makes you less noticable on thier &quot;radar.&quot;
<br />

<br />
not really hard,  you've probably done it before, but w.e you do, dont go &quot;dont see me, dont see me, dont see me&quot;

			question 1. Yes it's realated to psychokinesis.
<br />

question 2. Probably consider telepathic more then psychokinesis.

question 3. Not allowed to talk about such things, consider combat, but yes, psychokinesis.

I can't believe you actually think that you will be able to levitate, blow up things, or go invisible
<br />

<br />
I could fathom levitation, maybe a little bit of exploding...but invisibility?
<br />

<br />
I mean c'mon, humans are special, but you can't do EVERYTHING
<br />

<br />
you have to know your boundries, that's why I become aggravated when someone on the internet will ask about Psychic combat or something totally imbesilic.
<br />

<br />
Sheesh.
<br />

<br />
I know everyone on Psi Pog now will start arguing with me about how it's possible and blah blah blah. Enough practice will make you able blah blah
<br />

<br />
Yea, well, you're only Human after all...
<br />

Now, commence the bitching about &quot;ZOMG YOUR MIND CAN DO ANYTHING YOU FATHOM!!11!&quot;

i have heard of a cloaking sheild, which is mentioned on plenty of other sites (which i'm not allowed to say).  i'm sure it would be easier to use telepathic suggestion, or the method you mentioned, but you can also use a sheild  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Physical invisibilty is impossible. Unless you are harry potter and own an invisiablity cloak. Mental invisibilty is piss if you know how to make a good cloak shield. Why is there such a debate about it? Although certain monks have CLAIMED to have become masters at phsical invisibilty. That is just their word though. 
<br />
If you can levitate an object, then why not a person/yourself? It's common sense. It's just being good enough at pk that's the problem with it. These are easy answers people. Blowing things up I will answer when I have the time.
