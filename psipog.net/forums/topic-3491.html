			I have just recently got back into psionics including PK and im finally getting results with PK. I was always good with pyro, cyro etc.. but now im starting to move the psi wheel at least half way around. I was wondering if you guys have any tips on how to make it fully turn and stay in one direction.

Most definately agreed.  Practice, Practice, Practice.  That's all you will ever need when it comes to psionics.

			(An alternative answer) Try clearing your mind and not thinking about anything, and then just &quot;sooth&quot; it round and round. It detects any thoughts along the lines of &quot;It's moving that way, yay!&quot; OR &quot;I hope it doesn't go the other way&quot;. Also, sort of twisting and fusing your mind with it to make it turn one way helps me. I feel the wheel with my mind.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
(edit) My personal proof that this method works is because using it, I managed to get 50 consecutive turns without stopping, my current record.
<br />

<br />
(double edit) Good luck!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			Thats one of my biggest issues is when I go &quot;yay its moving&quot; and i also think &quot;hope it doesn't stop&quot; which then, obviously, it does.  So are you saying meditation helps clear the mind and avoid those thoughts?

			If you meditated on a clear mind, theoretically, it would put your mind into a habbit. It works especially just before you attempt pk, but don't always do it, unless you become dependent on it.

Meditating will make it easier to do PK because it focus' the mind and clears your thoughts. Doing this before practicing PK will always make it easier but that doesn't mean you become dependant on meditating. Some people seem to have a fixation on addiction around here. 
<br />

<br />
Meditation causes you to become more aware. By becoming more aware you start to see through all your little habbits and dependancies and not need them anymore. Therefore suggesting you can become dependant on meditating doesn't make sense. 
<br />

<br />
Creating a habbit for when you practice PK can be beneficial. Having a routine will tell your subconscious when you wish to practice. When you reach an advanced level you'll find you don't need the routine anymore.

			I think Dakova made a very intelligent post. Also, you'll break a lot of your habits just with practice. I never meditate, I just easily relax focusing on the object. I used to have those self-defeating thoughts like &quot;hope it doesn't stop&quot; and it would, but now I have much better control over my thoughts and are generally more relaxed in my daily life when I want to be. We ought to call it thought aerobics, hehe.

I don't know why you keep getting the wrong idea with my posts. I didn't mean that kind of habit.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> I meant a habit where you need to do meditation before you attempt pk. Some people on the forum have said that they need to meditate before they move the psiwheel. I meant don't overdo meditation because you may need to do pk in a swift situation or you may want to show a friend but you can't sit there doing nothing with your friend staring blankly at you for 20 mins can you?
<br />

<br />
I didn't mean you become addicted to meditation itself. And when I said it puts your mind into a habbit, I meant it will help remind you to have a clear mind more often when doing pk. Sorry if you did know what I meant, but from your post it seemed that you thought of the other type of habbit.

I've already mentioned this in my last post. Meditation will make PK easier to acheive in the beginning but you will reach a level where you can acheive enough focus without it. I'm guessing the somebodys you mention on the forum will be early on in their PK practice.

<br />
I know why you keep getting the wrong ideas with mine. Something to do with not reading them properly. I think its amusing that you suggest this is my fault when in previous posts replying to me you've displayed over and over again that you misunderstand and just don't read half of what I say.

<br />
Yes I know neither did I. I meant purely in the context of being dependant on meditation for PK. I'd have thought this would have been obvious. The addiction comment was sarcasm from our last little discussion concerning psi vamps. I appologise for not making that clear.
