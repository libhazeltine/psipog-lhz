			I'm not sure I agree with making a thread to pressure peebs to hand over psipog to someone else.
<br />

<br />

<br />
BUT, I'll say this: I VEHEMENTLY disagree with his decision to shut down psipog.
<br />

<br />
I see NO REASON why there is a need to break apart the community if there's someone out there willing to maintain it.   Are there other sites?  Yes; but all the ones I've seen are filled with fluff, or have something like 100 members.  This is the only site that seems to be more than a small community, AND that seems to have it's feet on the ground.   I know that what peebs says about him proving it to himself is true...but there's that voice in the back of my head saying &quot;Why doesn't he want the site to go on?  Is it because there's something he doesn't want people to find out?&quot;
<br />

<br />
I KNOW that isn't true......  but then, how DO I know?  Because I trust him?  But people who are honest have lied before....on the other hand, he's never lied before, so why start now?   Because I've proved psionics to myself?   Kinda...but not really; I've never suceeded(sp?) in flaring my psi-ball, so it could all be in my mind.   How about the psi-wheel?  I dunno, I'm not the best at the psi-wheel, and haven't been able to do it under a glass; it could have been the wind.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">(please note: I am IN NO WAY saying peebs is lying, nor do I believe that; just that there's that possibility that I can't seem to eliminate from my mind, just as someone new to PK has that &quot;it might be the wind&quot; possibility that they can't eliminate from their mind)</span>
<br />

<br />

<br />
This has severely jarred my belief in Psionics.   Lately I haven't been able to feel the psi, make a psiball, or even make my psi-wheel budge.
<br />

<br />

<br />
To me, this is MUCH MORE than just losing the forums....it's losing a symbol, a symbol that there IS people out there who have experienced what I've experienced that aren't fluffy nutballs.   That I'm NOT going insane.   That this is NOT just new-age, fluffy bullshit, and that I don't HAVE to subscribe to the &quot;it's magical&quot; theory(and subsequently that there are rational people out there who believe in this).
<br />

<br />
I'm just not at the point where peebs is(maybe I never will be), and I'm still looking for more proof to myself once and for all that this is real.   Taking PsiPog off the net(not necessarily peebs leaving) when there are people who would gladly take care of it is a MAJOR step backwards for me.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
.....now that I've got that out; I think no matter what we say, he won't hand over the reigns(again, a very worrying decision to me).  I think we need to find(or make) a new site to agree on, where we can continue to talk about the subject, research it, etc. in a reasonable manner(one of the things that I'll miss about psipog).
<br />

<br />
He's given us time to do something, let's use that time.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
p.s. What's the geiger counter experiment he talks about in the blog?  Does someone have a link to what he's talking about?

Then you obviously haven't looked very hard. Yep I'm being blunt but there is so much whinging going on, come on guys! Many of the authors and moderators here are mods or administrators at other sites around that are easily found in the links section. Are you going to say that all of the sites run by people that you believe make this place &quot;non-fluffy&quot; are fluffy? How is that meant to work?
<br />

<br />
Look if this is the way it's going to be, that's how it'll be. Leave it alone, let the mods sort out the details of whats happening. All the information that is on the main site currently, will still be here, its not disappearing. If you're worried print a copy out. All these people saying they're no longer able to practice psionics... Come on guys, the will, motivation and belief has to come from YOU. You shouldn't put it on a single person to provide that, it's not fair on them and its not good for you.

just because you want it you get that feeling, the feeling that makes you sad, sad because its not going like planned.
<br />

<br />
I understand what that feeling is like...

To lose the reason to do something is harsh...

I read through his blog cleared my mind thought about it, I agree, I'm with what sean dicides on.

I would hardly call it an &quot;experiment.&quot;  One of Peebrain's friends claimed that he could effect a geiger counter by using psi.  In the end, Peebrain made the counter jump about the same amount one it would if someone sneezed on it.

Be aware, often people dedicate their lives to symbols. To give an example: Think about priests, or other people dedicated to symbols of the church. They get so attached to the bible, or to a statue of Jesus hanging on the cross, or to the church as a building itself... They have forgotten what symbols stand for and what they are meant to do. Symbols merely point out to something higher, something true. Something non-material. For example, Jesus hanging from the cross is pointing out to the sacrifice that human beings can perform for the sake of humanity. Same goes with the church, bible or any non-religional symbols as well. They point out to something, not to theirselves. 
<br />

<br />
Symbols are meant as objects to make you remember, to make you meditate on that what it refers to. Psipog, is not meant for psipog as a site, it is meant for you to learn about that what this symbol refers to. It is meant as a tool for you to develop to that which it refers to..something higher: Your personal development of psychic abilities. But if you get attached to the symbol itself, then you missed the entire point of what that symbol stands for. 
<br />

<br />
Sorry I used the religional example, but I did that because it is the best example when I want to show you what trouble can come from such attachment. Look at all the wars between religions or belief-systems. They are fighting over wether Mohammed or Jesus had the truth, and which one was the liar. Both Mohammed and Jesus are only symbols to something greater. Symbols are meant for you to transcend them. Don't get attached to the symbol itself, because then you are missing the point of its existance.

			Psipog stands for psychic students in pursuit of guidance. That basically means to me a place to turn fluffballs into psions. We've outgrown this and Sean seems to have outgrown psi. For these two reasons Psipog should be shut down. If you talk about symbol rorigon and then say you hate fluffballs you are contradicting yourself. Psipog was supposed to be fluffball center but to many smart people came here and stayed after getting guidance. I think the best course of action would be for someone who has a lot of time on their hands and really cares about the community to start a new website with a different name.

			For all of you trying to convince Sean to keep psipog open: 
<br />
1.) If he doesn't want to keep it open, but you convince him to and he keeps it open just to make YOU happy, then the site will turn in to a pile of crap because he isn't going to put any effort into updating it.
<br />
2.) He was nice enough to warn us early of psipog's closing. Most other sites would just close it when they wanted to, and put up a banner saying, &quot;________ is closed.&quot; and that would be the end of the story. So I think we should just be thankful for the warning and for that fact that it will be archived.
<br />
      As previously mentioned, the articles and Q&amp;A will still be accessable. You'll still be able to look up how to do (insert psionic ability here). And if you have a question about it, you'll have to look through the archived Q&amp;As, which isn't taking place very much right now.... People just come on the forums and go, &quot;I had this really weird thing last night and will someone tell me if it was an OBE??&quot; or something along those lines. I've been coming to psipog for about 5 years now. I didn't come on to the forums until somewhere around April of this year. And I still haven't been on the chat..... This is because I spent my time on the main site and not on the forums/chat. Psipog doesn't and shouldn't revolve around having forums/chat.
<br />
    Remember, this is Sean's website... <span style="font-weight: bold">NOT</span> yours. If he wants to persue something besides Psipog, then get over yourself and fucking let him do what he wants. Besides, a year from now a lot of you are probably just going to remember Sean as the crazy guy with a domo-kun in his avatar, (if you <span style="font-style: italic">even</span> remember him). Or you might be a member of his new site by then and completely have forgotten about Psipog all together.
<br />
      Sorry to be an asshole to all of you but you're making this harder for Sean than it should be.......

			I totally support Peebrain. I've read what he wrote in his journal, about his quest for spirituality, and I absolutely agree with him. He has transcended his previous state of consciousness, he has gone from &quot;Is there something more?&quot; to, &quot;Whoa! What am I going to do with all this more that there was and no one knew about!&quot;
<br />

<br />
I asked Peebrain to keep the site for the newbies in a comment in his journal, BUT, if the static part is being maintained, then everything is going to be fine. Peebrain's manual provides an skeptical look on psionics, a scientifical (as scientifical as it can get), logical, and challenging attitude towards psionics. I wouldn't have believed anything, nor wouldn't have bothered in trying, if not for the down-to-earth, respectful, logic, healthily skeptical style of Peebrain's Beginner's Handbook. So, I don't mind losing the forums or the rest... But I asked Peebrain to let someone else &quot;inherit&quot; the site so the Beginner's Handbook, the article, and his commonsensical point of view of psionics would be available for everyone. If that all is going to be available, then I will have nothing to miss. If it's not going to be available (bandwith costs and all that require money, and Peebrain has a life), I just would like to know so I can get security copies and put them in my &quot;shared&quot; file. 
<br />

<br />
So, I really hope Peebrain goes ahead with his experimentations and studies on spirituality, OBEs and all that stuff. Mankind has become way too cynic, too uncaring, and too nihilistic. It would be great if Peebrain showed some people that we all have something more that flesh and bone... And that it's the same for everyone, everywhere. His new interests are noble and fair, and I'm yearning to see whatever he does next. Because I'm following his achievements, whatever they are.
<br />

<br />
So, I hope Peebrain has a good and beautiful journey in his way to spirituality. I'm going to watch. If he wants to leave Psipog and his handbooks and everything for all the newbies, it'll be great. If not, we'll have to do our homework. But that's what happens with life. Someday you have to walk on your own.
<br />

Good luck to Peebs, and thanks for everything up to this point.
