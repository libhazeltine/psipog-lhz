			&quot;It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step into the Road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no telling where you might be swept of to.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The Road goes ever on and on
<br />
Down from the door where it began.
<br />
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
<br />
And I must follow, if I can,
<br />
Pursuing it with weary feet,
<br />
Until it joins some larger way,
<br />
Where many paths and errands meet.
<br />
And whither then? I cannot say.

			We do not die because we have to die; we die because one day, and not so long ago, our consciousness was forced to deem it necessary. Antonin Artaud (1896 - 1948)
<br />

<br />
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
<br />
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
<br />
It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.
<br />
We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant,
<br />
gorgeous, talented, fabulous?
<br />
Actually, who are you not to be?
<br />
You are a child of God.
<br />
Your playing small does not serve the world.
<br />
There is nothing enlightened about shrinking
<br />
so that other people won't feel insecure around you.
<br />
We are all meant to shine, as children do.
<br />
We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.
<br />
It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone.
<br />
And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously
<br />
give other people permission to do the same.
<br />
As we are liberated from our own fear,
<br />
our presence automatically liberates others.

Shape affects air resistance, so that’s why some objects fall faster than others.  If a pencil and feather were dropped in a vacuum, they would fall at the same rate

How do you truly know that the world is round?  Have you seen it from far enough away?  For all we know, all those astronauts could be lying, or the roundness could be an illusion.
