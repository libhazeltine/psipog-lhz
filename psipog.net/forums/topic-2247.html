			Hi,
<br />
well about 5 days ago  i restarted being interested in tk (its been a year of so). I tried the pinwheel thing but that just moved weither i tried to move it or not...i dont believe the pinwheel &quot;test&quot; works. (i also found a site where a guy uses cups around the pinwheel and fills them full of hot water and the wheel moves)but i want to try to do something else. Ive been trying the psi or psy ball but i dont really feel anything, my hands start feeling warm (just like if i were holding them together) nothing special. could someone help me like where to start?
<br />
Thank You.

			Practice on other things, do you use paper or tinfoil psiwheel?
<br />
Tinfoil on a needle always moves because of air-currents.
<br />

<br />
Try a big paper psiwheel, more resistance and bigger object to focus on.
<br />
The bigger the less movement due to air currents.
<br />

<br />
Good luck practicing!

			It is normal that it will spin in other directions than you want, because your mind is not understanding the directions yet.
<br />
Try focussing on just move, and make sure it has been laying still for a few minutes so you know no wind is making it move.
<br />

<br />
The control of direction will come after practice.

			Psiballs usually feel like pressure or warmth.
<br />
Try holding it in one hand and try to feel with the other hand the difference in the air and in the place where the ball is.
<br />
Or try to focus on the feeling of coldness, or magnetic pressure.

			To notice a psiball i make this.
<br />
Try to program your psiball and say to it that you want that it has to release the ki sealed in the psiball when anyone touches it, also say that the psi has to vibrate when it is released.
<br />
If you make it well you can release your psiball in the air and then to prove if you have make it well try to touch the place where you released it, it will give you like a little shock and you will notice like ants runing on your hand  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />
It's difficult to make others sense that but it's possible hope it helps  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
