Edit: (Apollo) Please don't lock this thread, I saw in another thread you said talking about spirits = life after death = religion, but... it's really interesting, and unless someone starts talking about what exactly spirits are, can't we all just accept they <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> exist?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I agree whether religious or not, the ghosts (or whatever) are still out there.  And it is best to have knowledge of this stuff rather than get screwed in the end.

			im scared of the big words your calling them...like non-tangible lol. giving things unknown words unknown to someone will probably scare them
<br />

<br />
like saying someone has arachnaphobia of spiders they will associate big word= scary thing
<br />

<br />
or saying omnipetence or something big and confusing will cause ppl to think its powerful and ppl will therfore be naturally scared of the more powerful
<br />

<br />
then theres the whole thing where man is afraid of what he has not seen. which is true for all but the bravest

			I have similiar experiences and yeah, they can be quite frightening, but get a grip. I don't think you're crazy but long words? Ghosts? Please tell you're joking, only very bad at it...
<br />

<br />
But to contribute, I think it could be a lot of things. For example, every single night without fail for the past few years when I just turn off my light as I lie in bed, I hear noises. Just things falling and clicking (yeah, stupid). Just tell yourself that's your house settling and it's not so scary all of a sudden. Done.
<br />

<br />
Sometimes, only a handful of times, I've been able to turn up the &quot;volume&quot; of background noise in my head to a considerable amount. If I want to listen to a song I just thought of it, raised the volume and it was EXACTLY as if I were listening to it on my mp3 player or whatever. But if I DIDN'T &quot;select&quot; a song I would start hear fading random spoken words/sentences which would last a few seconds because they're scary as fuck so I'd jolt myself to make my mind more in the physical world.
<br />

<br />
Finally, and this PARTICUARLY freaked me out - I usually go into the apartment ajoined to our garage to study (exam year) and over the last few weeks I've been hearing noises downstairs. Btw, it's fully furnished and livable - tv, bedroom, kitchen, blah blah; just ruling out the wind or rocks from a crappy foundation rolling about out.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, the noises were like whispers, as you've said, and steps as if someone was walking around there. Naturally, I scoured the place several times with a huge butcher knife and not surprisedly, nothing was to be found.
<br />

<br />
So despite the fact the things you described are disturbing, it helps to logically denounce again with regard to demons, ghosts, etc because I believe this is a logical explanation, scientifically or psionically, but we just don't know it yet. I had nightmares most of my childhood and I can safely say this is the best method to defend yourself from normal enviormental noise and an overactive imagination.
<br />

			Here are my thoughts on this:
<br />
It is you. Thoughts require energy. Energy flows along a certain path, when you put all the energy in one path, it increases the outcome. 
<br />

<br />
Let me explain in simpler terms. Everyone gets chills every once in a while. Although, you are making a big deal out of them. So, you are using more energy to make these chills become more than chills. Your body is experiencing powerfuller chills because of it. You are letting this happen. When I get a chill, I can make it strong enough to have tears as well. If you think it as something big, it will be. Think it as something small, it will be. 
<br />

<br />
As for the voices you hear, I cannot really give an explanation. Even though, once you feel the chills, I can almost gurantee that you are almost waiting to hear something. Waiting so hard that you actually do hear something. You want to hear it so badly, that it comes true. Then you may say: &quot;Then how did this all start? I wasn't making a big deal out of this in the first place...&quot; I think it may have been started by an excited state of mind. If you watched a scary movie perhaps or just let an idea in your head reach to other levels.

			Here is my thought on this: It is you. Ghosts would have better things to do in the afterlife than make noises in another room of your house just to scare you. Get a grip and use your head. Every house has &quot;noises&quot; at night. New or old. It's air currents, or the expansion/contraction of joints and stuff when the house heats and cools through the day. There's 1000 better explanations than ghosts. When you die and are able to do and go anywhere you want in the universe(s?), are you going to stick around trying to scare some kid by making noises in other rooms? Don't think so. You aren't the key to some secret plan, you're not any kind of &quot;chosen one&quot;, ghosts are not trying to take over your body. 
<br />

<br />
If you hear whispers, get your head checked.

			In my experience you can ancor ghosts to one spot by simply providing energy. Ghosts manifest by feeding off of energy, so if you leave some in a spot, then it'll leave you alone and go after the available energy source.
<br />

<br />
It's fun though, I've had a ghost in my friend's house moving all around the living room.

			er I didn't really read all the posts because they were getting way off topic and people were getting well very immature. Anyway, I've heard about these before.  Most people refer to them al spectres, and well that's the only name that is so descriptive for them.  Apparently they usually feed off fear and try to steal your energy and they wont do any permanent damnge.  They wont leave you alone until you get rid of them.  I know this sounds super fluffy, but this is very hard to believe as it is. Anyway, I know someone who had them and got rid of them.  Um well I can't help much unless you want me to get rid of them for you.  Idk, pm or w/e unless they're gone.

			It could be your mind, it could be them. For the first, meditation, it helps clearing the mind and you can get a hold of your energy and see if it is you doing it. If it is them, you can try asking your guide for help as to how to deal with them. I don't recommend messing with them unless you know what are you doing.
