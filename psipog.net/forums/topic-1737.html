			well ive started my psi training a little diffrent...
<br />
i started in a traditional way. with the normal energy gathering and psi balls and wasnt havent much luck...
<br />
but then one day i was siting at my desk and there was a plant, i just &quot;felt&quot; the plant suddenly. it was like I felt is essence, its energy, its being. afterwords things just started coming to me. without practice i could instantly make psi balls and other constructs and i just keep geting more and more powerful. all i do is just &quot;feel&quot; essences of things like plants, fire (candle), water. also i dont relly gather energy. i just have this store of energy that i have constantly and the more i use it the more of this &quot;resserve&quot; i get..
<br />
i guess you could call me an elementalist

			I started doing psi stuff a little over a year ago and it just came to me very quickly when I tried the psiwheel.  It was like I could just do it.  Then it started to go away.  I didn't know what to do.  So I started drawing on a source of energy (hand warmers.)<img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> Is that what you are doing drawing power from the plant.

			i personally haven't had the time to do the meditations and such. even if i did it while i went to bed, i wouldn't get much sleep and that would affect my schooling. as for the 'new training', i don't think it's a new training method at all. i think it's simply you jumping up a 'level' in you skill. you see, if you can do some research, there are people called &quot;Star Children&quot;, &quot;Indigo Children&quot;, &quot;Crystal Children&quot;, etc... these people all have a different 'level' of psi abilities. it depends on how 'sensitive' you are, just as you described. yes, this can be learned, but it takes a little time and effort. all in all, you must choose and apply yourself to being a 'better person'.
<br />

<br />
in this, i mean that you have to change your train of thought, and be able to just feel things. don't force yourself to feel things, but it just needs to feel like it's something natural. don't doubt yourself, simply believe it'll happen. here is a link to where you might find some stuff.
<br />

<br />
again, i don't think it's a new form of training, but i think it's a jump in your vibrational level.

there should be sufficient information there. if i hate to rate myself of what i am, i would say a mix between a Star-Seed/Star Child and an Indigo Child, not a complete transition yet, but a fair mix. my abilities in psionics, though i understand it extremely well, are limited because of my time limits and extremely difficult meditaion (it's hard for me to meditate b/c my mind travels too much). check it out guys, i think you'll like it.
