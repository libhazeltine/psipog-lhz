Yes, I'm talking about being able to see the future (I don't know if its happened to you, but its quite simple to do--unwitingly that is.)
<br />

<br />
You think of someone and they call, or walk through the door (And no, not by coinsidence.) You think of a certain food for dinner, and thats what your having.
<br />
^ Thats the kind of thing I'm talking about.

When I do these kinds of things, I can't force it, but when I don't realize I'm doing it, it happens.

			You mean precognition? Psionics is psychic...ism... anyway, I think the best place to post that stuff would be in the clairvoyance forum. At most it should just be a little subsection.

Let me spell it out for you.  Your first post asked why Psipog doesn't have any &quot;psykick&quot; forums.  I find that really funny because on the mainpage where you see Psipog.net Ideas listed, you should also see the multitude of forum sections, such as Clairvoyance, that deal with psychic phenomenon.
<br />

<br />
What did I drink tonight?  Don't offend me, especially when you're a fucking retard.

Thats what I see you overzealous prick.  Unless you want to argue that &quot;seeing the future&quot; can count as viewing objects and events at a distance (which may actually be plausable.) Don't offend me.

			See, you could have very easily just said, &quot;Hey Roy, I didn't know that precognition fell under the blanket term of clairvoyance.  Because of this, I was recommending Psipog should have a forum that deals with precognition because I'm interested in reading about it and discussing it.&quot;  See?  Very lucid, very easy to understand.
<br />

<br />
All you did was ask for &quot;psykick forums&quot; and used precognition as an example for us to understand.  These are psychic forums that deal with all the major areas of extrasensory perception.  I was trying to understand why you would totally bypass all other other forum sections that deal with extrasensory perception and then come here asking why we don't have any forums dealing with extrasensory perception.  Your initial post was confusing, and your follow up post was just as confusing but disrespectful as well.
<br />

<br />
Locked.
