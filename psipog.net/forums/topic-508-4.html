			A while ago a guy who used to live near me told me the weirdest thing had just happened to him. He was just leaving the house to go running, and looked up at the sky which was covered with dark clouds, looking like it could rain any minute. He told me he'd said &quot;oh, can it please not rain for 40 minutes!&quot; Then about 40 minutes later when he returned to the house, it started raining the same moment he opened the door. He told me &quot;maybe I have such powers&quot;. Of course it could be a coincidence, but I have (coincidently) for a long time thought of this guy as psychic. He always seems to know what's going to happen in movies he hasn't seen before, is very good with predicting stocks etc. 
<br />

<br />
Not everything that sounds like fluff is fluff. Controlling the weather definitly sounds like fluff, but it is actually much easier than most people think, at least on smaller scales, and I do believe those who have posted in this thread saying they can do it. I don't think it involves much macro-PK, at least not more than it does micro-PK. I like to think of it of &quot;large scale micro-PK&quot;, and I believe that's exactly what it is. 
<br />

<br />
A simple exercise is to go into a room by yourself, pick a cloud that doesn't look too dense, and try to dissipate it. This has actually also been demonstrated for the media by a canadian called Dr. Rolf Alexander. If you want to read more about this, you can do so <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-buster" target="_blank" class="postlink">here</a>.

I agree with that. I saw the pictures in a book that I was reading. It is possible. I'm not quite sure where micro pk comes in, but I do agree that what looks bad isn't always bad. Making clouds dissipate is not the same as creating a tornado or a hurricane. The guy said that he can 'affect' the weather. He specifically said he needed rain clouds for him to make it rain. This may be micro pk once I think about it. Give the guy a break, just because he might've came on a little strong, doesn't mean he can't do what he says. Why don't you guys go to bed tonight with an idea of what you want the weather to be like tomorrow, dream about it whatever you want to do. Then when you wake up, Go outside and make it happen.

			I think affecting the weather is relatively easy (or maybe I just have SUPER POWERS <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> ) . . . though the hurricance bit escapes me . . . disruption of current weather patterns seems to be easiest. New storms and the like . . . not so easy for me.
<br />

<br />
To the person talking about the weather forcasts . . . &lt;sarcasm&gt;they are the law!!! Never do they ever get it wrong. They should be the benchmark for all weather control tests!!!&lt;/sarcasm&gt;
<br />

<br />
I myself have methods for doing it that don't have much similarity between my PK techniques, but I'm not going to go into that. Let me just say that I have accomplished this feat, weather control, and I do not believe that it is a big deal (others may accomplish the same task with the same relative ease).
<br />

Also I think the first post was treated a bit harshly . . .  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />

			I've been thinking for a bit about this and I remembered something when I was in kindergarten. I don't know why I would do it, but I would repeat the word <span style="font-style: italic">Wind</span>, and wind started to blow, stronger with each repetition of the word. I know this could have all been coincidental, but I would do it a lot. I also tested this earlier today, and I got a breeze in just a few seconds. So weather control could be the same, but on a larger scale.

			Influencing the wether is not that difficult really. I read most of the posts in this topic, and I saw people saying things like: You will need a tremendous ammount of energy in order to affect the wether. 
<br />
That is only correct if you really believe that in order to alter reality, you will have to use your bodies energy. But you should keep in mind, that the wether itself is already energy, and it only needs consciousness to affect its energy. I've had experiences as well with making it storm, and pointing out where the lightning has to strike.. and as a result, lightning strikes exactly there..
<br />

<br />
there is alot of Electromagnetic energy involved with the wether system also, perhaps thats what makes it easy to influence. Plus it is no object that you keep staring at and trying to force to move. With wether control, you just have an intention, you let it go, and you enjoy the outcome. You are not trying to control or will it. At least, that's how it went with me from the beginning on.
<br />

<br />
Please try to keep an open-mind, instead of stating all kinds of theories that utterly oppose the posibility of manifesting something. Don't judge abilities too fast, even if it sounds a little fluffy. Just keep an open-mind and experiment for yourself, before rejecting amazing possibilities. Because if you read everything with a very closed-mind, you will limit yourself in many ways. 
<br />
Now that, would be a pity.

			I found it a little sad how all the first people replying just laughed at the topic starter and basically decided it was fluff. But what is fluff? From my point of view, fluff is when you take a work of fiction and directly apply it to the real world with no relevant experience or empirical evidence to support it with.  Fluff is when someone watch superman and as a result thinks he can fly. That's the worst kind of fluff. Then you have inappropiate naming and seperation of abilities, which basically is the same thing (hydrokinesis etc). 
<br />

<br />
Now, back to the topic. What is &quot;weather control&quot;, fluff or fact? Have you ever wondered why it's always sunny on the national day? I remember reading a study done in a certain small town where the weather always was changing. Yet, on graduation day it was always sunny. It could be bad weather all the days prior to and afterwards, but on graduation day the weather was always good. The same thing happened year after year. Chances are this pattern could be found around the world. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;OK, but then we're talking about the collective work of many minds. This guy claimed to control the weather all by himself,&quot; you may be thinking. This has actually also been studied scientifically. If you don't believe me, look up Ted Owens aka &quot;the PK man&quot;.

			I agree with Psi_On. It is useless and disrespectfull to judge other people in advantage just because you can't believe that they can do what they claim they can. You can soon enough tell who is the fulffy kid screaming for attention and who is not. And if you can't tell for sure, then don't judge, or at least, don't pre-judge if it has to do with something you haven't got any relevant personal experience with. Because if you do prejudge around alot, you close down many opportunities for you to grow.

I dont think that your hypothosis holds itself up, quite frankly. Ive been to rained out 4th of July celebrations and other occasions that have been cancelled or put off due to weather. I cant comprehend how the combined &quot;faith&quot; of a massive grouping of people would produce passive weather changes.

			@Woody:

<br />
The same way you can move your psi-wheel with the help of faith. There really is no difference, though you are guiding the process consciously, and a mass of people don't.
<br />

<br />
Have you done more research about his hypothesis? or are you judging only with the help of your own memory of that day in which it wasn't sunny? What Psi_On said about it being nice wetter at big day's can probably hold up. In fact we cannot really proof wether it is done by the people. And yes, it has rained alot on national day's in the Netherlands too. In fact, it rains almost every year. But that may as well be because the collective consciousness of my country has started to interpretate that day with rain :p. 
<br />

<br />
So if it isnt sunny, it doesn't mean it isn't influenced by human consciousness. In fact, I am very sure that it does. If I consider what one human being can do to the wether system, then I am sure a crowd's influence on the wether is even stronger, albeit done unconsiously.

I don't think I can make this a generalization covering the globe as a whole, but in my experience I believe this has happened. And the study I was referring to does somewhat back it up. I also believe that as MartialArtist was saying, if people are used to see rain on the national day, their expectations may influence the weather negatively. So it can go both ways I guess. 
<br />

<br />
A concept I believe to be related to this, is the collective consciousness. The idea that people are connected to and share a consciousness together isn't that far fetched. A few years ago scientists set up random number generators around the globe as part of an ongoing experiment to study how crowds could unknowingly affect these, especially during peak emotional events. At the september 11 incident, all the RNGs around the world went off simultanously just before it happened, so basically the RNGs predicted it before it happened. So given that what happened was the collective consciousness causing a global physical effect, is it too far fetched to think that the same thing can happen to the weather on days associated with a peak emotional event, if one person alone can affect the weather?

			Yesterday it was raining all morning and I concentrated a bit and focused on sending energy to the sky and changing the cloud patterns to make it sunny. The sun came out within an hour or so. Then with hardly any clouds I focused again for some snow. Later that night it began to snow really hard. It snowed again really hard today and it is expected to snow off and on until Monday. I may started all of this, because I never once looked at the forcast for the weather before trying any of this. I will keep trying and see what I come up with.

Okay, now I will sound like I am making this up, but a couple of years ago, I discovered an easy large-scale skill. Changing the weather. Firstly, I created a link with myself and the sky. I sent up a piller of psi energy to act as a comunication pillar. I sent up commands in a similar way to programming a construct to tell the weather what to do. It is easy, but it requires patience. The conditions have to be right. i.e. rainclouds for rain. Making wind and making the sun come out is easy.

Wow, you are either stupid or a fraud. Maybe if you did some reaserch into the background of &quot;weather control&quot;, you would know that it is basically impossible to control the weather. I have done it many times before, which I'm not proud of. Let me put this into a better explanation, when you try to control the weather, you may get results but MORE than you asked for. Also, manipulating the weather also causes what we like to call &quot;uh ohs.&quot; Just don't come back posting &quot;uh oh I accidentally caused a thunderstorm that has striken an innocent man.&quot; And you can't think you can control the weather all because precipitation happened an hour later after you attempt. The weather is so random, why do you think predicting why and where hurricanes, tornadoes, and other occurenceswill happen? Meterologists can set times but they can't be perfect.

Maybe weather manipulation works like telepathic suggestion would. You can't fully control it, but maybe you can cause it to do certain effects. Eh who knows, but please don't call people stupid just because they think they can do something. Who knows, they may actually be doing it.
