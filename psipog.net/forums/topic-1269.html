			I realize that most of the time on the forums, there's been a lot of questions about this whole 'talking to your subconscious' article. From what I've noticed, a lot of people think that it's mostly just talking to yourself. Basically, this thread exists as a place where people can put down thier experiences, when they talk to thier subconscious, to perhaps clear up some of the confusion. Please move this if it belongs in general, wasn't too sure where to put it <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I'll start off:
<br />

<br />
I notice that when talking to your subconscious, you usually get the answers even before you can finish the question - there's no 'thinking' before you get an answer. If I were to talk to myself:
<br />

<br />
'How are you?'
<br />
'Fine.'
<br />
'What do you think about so and so?'
<br />
'Blablabla...'
<br />

<br />
Try it, especially with difficult questions. From my experiences, there's usually a pause before you answer, because you yourself are thinking of an answer. When I ask my subconscious questions on the other hand, the answer is usually 
<br />
a) NOT in words.
<br />
b) Near instant.
<br />

<br />
Please add <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Yeah, I have had some experience with this.  It is weird, however, that is was my sub-consious that first contacted me.  It is not in words, and when I try to phrase it into words, I have to think about it for a minute.  Also, I used to talk to my sub-consious alot, but then it seemed to be stealing my telekinetic abilities, so I don't as often.  Kind of weird, I don't know for sure if I am talking to my sub-consious or what.

Do you guys ask your sub-c YES or NO questions or do you actually talk to it? I've tried it for several times but I had no success so far.Perhaps you have any tips?

			Seems to be a constant so far <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> Eg if you ask your subconscious what it thinks of a close friend, you may feel affection, but not words like 'oh, he/she is cool'

			well i guess the stuff u do is real, i must say. I still oppose the idea of a subconscious however. But with my theory the effect is the same thing, so ya watever. 
<br />

<br />
i think talking with ur subconscious would bring about honesty with urself and mindfulness.

I don't know &quot;why.&quot;  Like I said, maybe I am not talking to my subconsious.  Maybe it is a spirit or something, but I don't really believe spirits are real.

			Talking to my subconscious is near instant, but I make sense out of most of the things. Helps alot in problem solving, like a machine spitting out answers.

Your subconscious controls your TK abilities, so it actually has it and hasn't really &quot;stolen&quot; it from you. It just lets you use it  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> .

			Yeah, it talks in words sometimes too, like earlier today i kept getting answers to my own mental rhetorical questions..  i did not find this amusing, lol.  I said to stop and it did though.  
<br />

<br />
Ok, anyways, i have found a good way to talk to it.  A little known thing is that the imagination *is* the subconscious.  My technique is to create the answers it gives me to questions as vividly as i can.  Mostely i do this when workinng out an issue.  I have found the subcon is less like a person, and more like a computer.  and the imagination is the web browser.  and the people i see are like programs, and i can reprogram them (very useful).  so, i can search, and then it creates the symbols in 3-d.  If i give it enough power, it can turn into something else entirely.. really do whatever i want with it.  If you want to ask it questions, just make a program designed to do it.  
<br />

<br />
Anyways, people make it out to be much harder than it is.  If it wants to tell you something, it will.. one way or another.  A friend explained to me why it seems to have consciousness, and she said its because of cell consciousness.  The way i understand it, its basically those cells sending the brain messages.  Its very smiliar to the pain reflex.  Pain says there is something wrong, send help.  however, other messages can be sent too.  My friend has done amazing things with this concept, she had part of her finger chopped off, and with her imagination, she told the cells to grow it back.. and they did.  
<br />

<br />
I could go on forever, but i think its best to learn on your own.

So maybe I was using up too much energy talking to it so there wasn't enough left for psychokinesis?
