			here's what i dont get about phasing,
<br />
if your phasing, then wouldnt air particles get caught in ur arm and possibly cause a stroke???  how does it push the air particles out while keeping the hand particles intact? this stuff just messes with my head,,,
<br />

<br />

<br />
btw, im only 14, so if im wrong, the too bad

			To understand this, first off, understand that nothing ever touches anything else. If I lay my hand on a desk, the atoms in the desk repel the atoms in my hand, creating a tiny, atom-wide space between my firmly pressed hand and the desk at any time.
<br />

<br />
Have you ever wondered why the atoms in your hand don't just go around the atoms in the desk? This is why, I believe.
<br />

<br />
Now, theoretically, if you eliminated the apposing forces, you could simply pass your arm through the desk, and the atoms would go around each other.
<br />

<br />
That's the psuedo-scientific, *logical* version. But if we take in account the astral dimension...
<br />

<br />
Imagine two balls, which are three dimensional. Now imagine that they each &quot;phase&quot; into each other. Now, they are still, individually, three dimensional but the space between them is now four-dimensional, since there IS a space, but not in 3d-space visibly.
<br />

<br />
The most logical way of explaining it is that the particles that are phasing into each other become astral instead of physical momentarily, and this also relates with teleportation.
<br />

<br />
Is this what's really happening? I have no idea. But those are two possibilities.

			My friend is reading a book about quantum theory and stuff like that.  It touches on the subject of phasing and stuff, he says it's really cool.  Well who knows how phasing works really.  Objects are held together by intermolecular forces, bonds, electronegativity and all that fancy stuff that I'd rather not go into since I hated chemistry <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  But yar, I suppose that theory would be pretty shnazzy.  4D explanation is pretty rad

It's questionable whether anyone considers Phasing a psionic thing <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.  It's really just one of those things that causes people to have a passing interest (or in the case of the new people) or a ridiculous obsession.
<br />

<br />
Your skepticism on the subject, though, is well noted, for I have a great deal of skepticism on such a thing.

			A breakthrough:
<br />

<br />
Ive got the hang of phasing now, i realise it only happens when im in distress. Like earlier, i was throwing a tantrum because of my IBS (IBS causes uncontrollable stomach spasms, which are unbearably painful), and i was throwing myself around (just about the only the thing that works), and i went to go throw myself on a sofa, jumped towards it, and went straight through it, hit the flagstones and dislocated my knee (doctors appointment in 3 hours). There was no pain whilst phasing, apart from the dislocated knee after hitting the flagstones, and the uncontrollable stomach spasms. So im convinced that phasing isnt as dangerous as Rainsong says it is.
<br />

<br />
Ignore my terrible grammar, im still in a lot of pain.

			Yeah, it would have really hurt, its probably a sorta good thing that i commando rolled/jumped onto it, leading with my side, otherwise my face would be embedded in the flagstones. Well, even though i dislocated my knee  (the doctor was a miracle worker, he snapped it back into position, and gave me a variation of morphine) i did get two good things out of it.
<br />
#1: Ive been trying to prove psionics to my parents for quite a while, i showed them my spoons, and even showed them that i could me a soda can without using physical force, but when they saw me dive through the sofa, i think they believe in it now.
<br />
#2: I phased once again, and now i have a feel for it, i will practice phasing when i actually want to.

			I thought of 2 fun (or kinda scary) ways to use phasing.  Someone trys to shoot you, you phase the bullet right through you!  You could also fuse things to your hands like Wolverine.

DON'T TRY ANY OF THESE! (only use the bullet one if you ARE being shot at)

			I fucked my camera when i tried to make a magnetic PsiBall, but i will make a video of phasing when i get a new camera, within the next 2 months. As for the matric style bullet dodging, and phasing, you would have to have incredibly fast reactions, like faster than a bullet.

			He didn't. The couch is still in him <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />. He said he phased through the couch, which leads me to believe that he phased through the front and exited the back, then hitting his knee.

			Eh I'm confused to. If the couch was up against a wall (I'm assuming) and flagstones would be outside. Then he must've phased through the couch and the wall hitting his knee. Getting up and walking from outside to in, or walking back through the couch. That's what I got. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />
