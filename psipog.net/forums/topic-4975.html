			hey everyone...
<br />

<br />
Well ive been trying Pyrokinesis for a few days and ive noticed some things..that I can get the flame to follow me here and there but not all the time..
<br />

<br />
I just tried to move a small piece of paper that was in a tiny ball and i think i got it to twitch just a little bit...but here is the thing..
<br />

<br />
People tell you to visualize it moving, and what not and i have, and i can feel the energy in my mind and palms and i tell myself im connecting with the object at hand and i visualize what i want it to do..I get soo much enegry going through me that my hands/arms begin to shake and my mind feels some pressure..Now when i let go of it all my mind hurts...I'm not frustrated at all..I'm just curious why my mind hurts after i stop for a few seconds?
<br />

<br />
Also any tips on how i can better myself at moving a small skinny needle?  people say try a psi-wheel but i dont have the material to makei it..
<br />

<br />
Now if there ever is a timei get frustrated do i just get up and walk around and calm myself?  And how do i just LET IT HAPPEN-when referring to moving an object?
<br />

<br />
Thank you
<br />

<br />

			I will try to help with the tk part of your question.   What your asking is very hard to explain.  You Just do it and let it happen.  Ok, on to the real help! 
<br />

<br />
There is really no evidence that psi energy has to do with telekinesis.  That being said, you dont have to move it with energy flowing through you.  Also, I dont and you dont have to visualize it moving.  
<br />

<br />
The just do it method and let it happen which are pretty similar have to do with knowing that the psiwheel will move.  What I do is focus on the object and ask my sub c to move the object.  I just know that the psiwheel (or whatever you are trying to do) will spin etc etc.   Then I just sit back and &quot;let it happen&quot; or I just do it buy nudging it with my awareness. (thanks to Iolair for that method)
<br />

<br />
To calm down, try meditation by focusing on your breathing or whatever relaxes you.
<br />

<br />
Good Luck,
<br />
