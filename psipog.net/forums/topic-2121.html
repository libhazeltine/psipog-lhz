			i've had a few clairvoyant dreams of my own. my advise is: first learn the see/hear the difference between what is reall and what is not, second try to control it, meditate and see if you can summon it by will. if not just keep practising, and third for later on try and change it what you see or hear. what i have learned is that most preconigtions are nothing more then possibility's of things that could happen. meaning you can also change things by saying something simpel or performing some action towards that person, changing the outcome, however just remember that somethings are meant to be that way, so learn what is and what is not.
<br />

<br />
You could get someone to teach you how to do all these things and perhaps even more, but i believe the best way is to teach yourself, through experimenting and practicing without causing anybody harm.

hello, im Joe. it appears you have precognition:
<br />
i can teach you how to control the short term ones with ease (i.e. the rest of your day) im going to write an article about how to eventually. the long term one (months ahead of the event itself) im cant control - yet!
<br />

<br />
the only prerequisites are:
<br />
open-mindedness <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
being able to open the &quot;third eye&quot;
<br />
and finally, you need to be able to have good concentration.
<br />

<br />
Just PM me if you would like to learn how to control them!!!
<br />

<br />
- that goes for anyone else who is interested in this!
<br />

Perhaps what you are referring to is the admonition in the Bible to not ask other 'spiritual beings' for advice about things?  The prohibitions in the Bible are related to asking other gods or the dead about things.  Psionic effects in and of themselves do not request help from either group.  Some people who practice psionics do use techniques along those lines, but that is not a requirement for psionics.  
<br />

<br />
Precog is indeed a psionic skill and as such does not require religious beliefs or conflict with the Judeo-Christian belief system.
<br />

<br />
I hope this is helpful,

PS  I hope this doesn't go over the line in regards to discussing religious issues.  If you want to discuss the religious aspects of this post, please PM me rather than tempt Peebrain or others to lock this thread.

i dont think its satanic... but there is a sorta unwritten rule book. one thing being not to tamper with the future... i have never done this myself, as i dont know what could happen. it could just alter/create a new path for someone, or it could create a paradox.

			In medieval times and such, knowledge of future events through unconventional means was believed to ONLY come from the devil.
<br />
I don't think the Bible specifically says precognition is satanic, other than the whole &quot;om-fug don't do magick lol1111one!&quot;.
<br />
Anyway, some people are born with the skill, and even most &quot;normal&quot;  people experience precognition at least once in their lives. They can't possibly be born under satan's rule, now can they?
