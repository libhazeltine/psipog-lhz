if your mind only creates situations of violence, you will not get far
<br />
and i feel this is much a problem here, there are some very strange motivations around
<br />

<br />
yes, defense is marvelous, but why would you ever provoke someone to attack you, why would you ever create a situation where you can be attacked in the first place?
<br />

<br />
if you think of a worthy use of your skills, you will become much stronger

			Psions are becoming more numerous. With the rise of the Psion, the potential for bad/evil/rotten Psion becomes more prevailant. We need to learn to protect ourselves.
<br />

<br />
Also, how often have we provocated someone without realizing it, or mearly in jest. Even the tiniest thing can set off some minds. Violence is a part of the world, like it or not, and human nature dictates that our minds dwell on it, and figure ways to protect ourselves.
<br />

Do you not believe that Defense is a worthy use of psi?

<br />
there are plenty of non psionic means of defense
<br />
i have never been randomly attacked by a man jumping out of the bushes
<br />
there is always cause for an attack, and if you understand your self enough to be able to successfully produce psionic effects, then you should understand how to controll that self and not provoke an attack, defense is completely unnecasary
<br />

<br />
if we have a greater strength, a power that is capable to do much beyond our knowledge, why do we not apply it to problems that are beyond our current knowledge to solve?

			Because since the problems are beyond our knowledge, and we don't know about them.

<br />
Also, mistakes will happen, and attacks will happen. Defensive Psi is one way of defense. What does it matter what we use to defend ourselves? Psi is a part of us, like my right arm is a part of me. So why use my arm to defend, where as a well placed ping could distract my adversary?

<br />
distraction is much different than inflicting damage
<br />
so yes, that is more than a worthy use
<br />

<br />
however, wouldnt everything be done once a situation is presented to avoid it?
<br />
if someone came up and told me to give them my money, instead of saying, no fight me, i would simply hand over my money and tell them to enjoy
<br />
there are many ways to avoid conflict, those who develop their powers for defensive means will create a situation for themselves to test these powers

			I finally see what you're talking about. You're saying that to use defense, you must be in some type of battle/conflict/whatever. 
<br />

<br />
In that case, let me rephrase. Instead of Defense, lets assume I meant Conflict Avoidance.
