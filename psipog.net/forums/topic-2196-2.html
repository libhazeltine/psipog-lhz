			it is not necessarily forbidden.  If you talk about ghosts and you say nothing about them being dead people (say they are astral plane things, etc) then that is not against the rules.  Just anything that suggests what happens after death is against the rules.

I'm unsure of the &quot;Astral Plain&quot;, but from what it sounds, it's similar to my &quot;Two Dimensions&quot; theory.

and balmung. when you talked about disturbing our physical world, what about poltergeist? I always considered ghost and poltergeist under the same supernatural category. but i don't know too much about poltergeists, so for all i know they actually could be two different things. is this true or am i just going in the wrong direction?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
Ghosts manifestations can be clasified in two different ways:
<br />
1st Visual manifestations:When you can see a ghost or ghostly things. But they doesn't make anykind of physical thing.
<br />
2nd Poltergeists: In poltergeists we can't see the ghost. we only can see things moving around the house without any explanation. They say that poltergeists are produced by a ghost but to move things ghosts need a physical &quot;allie&quot; normally a teenager that is who really moves the thing with unconscious powered tk. At least this is what I deducted from my studies.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			well, when i say they have an OBE, that doesn't mean it needs to be intentional. Maybe at the last second of their life they have such an intense emotin (anger, hate, revenge, longing to not die) that it gives them an OBE and then *poof GHOST. So this could happen to someone who was killed in war.
<br />
or at least that's what this theory is trying to say.

			I have a different theory than most. You know how energy can never be destroyed? Well when we die, where does our energy go? does it just float around like a ghost or does it disperse and go to different beings? You decide.

hey that's a good theory. though i was just thinking why do we think only certain areas of the world are infested w/ ghosts? i guess maybe certain energies could be stronger than others and show different traits than others.

			Well, i've read that quartz chrystals will emit an electromagnetic feild if put under pressure, so maybe those areas that are infested with ghosts have a great amount of quartz chrystals emitting a magnetic field and it's keeping our energy inside that area, or before they died, the ghosts left an imprint of some sort in the electromagnetic field and when they died, that imprint activated and viola you have yourself a ghost.
