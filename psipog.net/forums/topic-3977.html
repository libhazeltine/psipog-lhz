It would be a lot more convincing if you were to face the camera, and show your whole body (including your head). Seems to me like the Criss Angel levitation trick that he reveals, judging by your legs being together and your back facing the camera.
<br />

<br />
Also, if you can levitate your body, surely you can levitate something smaller? Like a psiwheel? I would love to see a video of you doing this.
<br />

<br />
At the moment, it just seems like a trick to me, without more evidence (after all, you would have to be a <span style="font-style: italic">very</span> skilled psion to levitate yourself), so if you can show yourself levitating something else, that would be great. If it is real, well done!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Alright dude, it's bad filming, if you want to prove us you can levitate, then where something shorter then those pants for one. Have the camera on your full body, in the front to see if you are not on your toes, and being in pure light.

<br />
I don't buy it. Seems total bullshit.

By the way, the music is shit, fucking terrible.

			Fake-ass David Blaine takeoff.  You lift up on the ball of your left foot while leaving your right foot flat.  It looks like you're levitating because of the camera angle (which doesn't show you rising on the ball of your left foot).
<br />

<br />
If you're going to do hack magic, please indicate that you are doing so rather than trying to pass it off as real.

			It was pretty damn obvious you were a magician because no non-magician would think of levitating a firggin card would they? The first thing a magician would do is levitate a card. Cards are associated with magicians and the levitating was just stupidly obvious. First thing, you looked like a weird ballerina just before you did it and it really looked fake. Could have been anything, including just stepping onto one foot.
<br />
 I wouldn't suggest doing this again to try and fool us because we won't take kindly to it. If you dare say afterwards something along thses lines: &quot;Ha, I fooled you, it was fake you idiots&quot; we will kill you psionicly. If you didn't notice this isn't a magician site. If you want to post tricks, post them somewhere else. Make your own site and post links ot them, clearly stating beforehand that it is a trick. Saying you can do something when really you can't like levitating without saying it's a trick is just stupid and if done in real life, or on tv, is kind of like fraud. 
<br />
But on a lighter note, well done on being a crap illusionist. If you can do tricks like chris angel and levitate off the ground, I would be impressed.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Oh and hello; havn't met you before.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

i couldnt agree more with the above posts, especially genjo's post, if you hadnt noticed, this site is for the real thing. Dont try a trick unless it actually looks authentic, not that criss angle shit. If you try one on again, you will get the same reaction, and in the video, it looks like your standing on your tip toes, and slightly odd you stood right infront of a box (the way criss angel does his trick), But now ive pulled my angry face, welcome to psipogbb.net

Dude, if you're a budding magician, then say you are.  I don't believe that you were testing to see how gullible we were.  I think it's a safe assumption that, given some of the past posts in this forum, we're pretty good at telling what's flagrantly fake and what is (or could be) genuine.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps if you said something like, &quot;hey guys, i'm studying to be a magician, I'm trying to do this levitation illusion, can you guys tell me how real or fake it looks.  thanks,&quot; it would have been received a bit better.
