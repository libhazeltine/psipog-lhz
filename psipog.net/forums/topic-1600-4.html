I really would like to here some good reasons why you don't want it getting out or at least something to counter what I am saying. There are only a few reasons you should be allowed to practice psionics with in my mind and they include for research of some kind, for some kind of goal only psionics can reach for you personally, or to reveal.

			BFIGHTER, you make no sense, nor does your sig.
<br />

<br />
Where is the path of logic, there is none.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
-------------------
<br />

<br />
If you show a single person how to do psi,
<br />
they will be amazed, and probably want to pick it up.
<br />
If you try to show more people, the effect is less,
<br />
As there are others around, and the obvious psychology,
<br />
of being near somebody else gives a different 'mindset' towards things.
<br />

<br />
Peer pressure much?
<br />

<br />
If you show it to a large group of people, 
<br />
there will be many disbelievers.
<br />
The larger the groups, the more disbelievers,
<br />
and you should all know mob psychology.
<br />
One person will say something, it will spark,
<br />
and spread to the rest of the group.
<br />
I just didn't explain it before.
<br />
And you saw all the conspiracy stories that popped up shortly after 9/11
<br />
(which, my opinion, stands with the Loose Change movie, thanks)

			I actually recently confided to a friend about psionics, except I did not introduce it full-frontally. When we were speaking about religions, I told him I didn't believe in my religion that much (Buddhism, only because of family), I believed in psionics to be the cause of all wierd things. He asked me what psionis was, and I just slowly introduced all the different things that you can do with psi. He now is practicing par this website's guides and some of my advice. 
<br />

<br />
As for revealing, as someone mentioned, I think it would work better if you told it to maybe 3 people over the course of one year, and from there it would spread, as soon as they achieved results and gained  confidence, as opposed to a wide-spread via the media, where that would just bring a large wave of people going WTF and possibly become manipulated into thinking it's evil. You never know. Some people just LIVE by the god damn media.

			I have been saying zero media attention to small revealing sessions with complete strangers forever; finally you guys picked it up. You need to have proof though. It never really takes hold in a person without proof. Except for me; I started without proof from someone who told me.

			You know, I'm one of these &quot;revealer&quot; types, to an extent. So far, I've got at least a dozen, maybe two dozen, people into Psi, simply by telling them of what CAN be done, not telling them what <span style="font-weight: bold">I</span> can do. And I've done it all on a one-to-one basis. So I think that's one of the best methods.
<br />

<br />
Also, it actually IS harder to get a girlfriend when everyone knows you dabble in Psi. I've had many girls consider dating me, and then change their mind irreparably when I tell them I'm a Psi. My current girlfriend doesn't mind, though, and she actually thinks it's cool (I love her for it too).
<br />

<br />
But just slowly open peoples' minds to Psi, one at a time. Don't push them into learning it, because that'll turn them off. But I have no doubt that if every one of us convinces people to accept those who practice psi one at a time, we can change the world.
<br />

<br />
Look at my sig. &quot;Mens Operor Quisquam.&quot; Translated from Latin, it loosely means &quot;the mind can do anything.&quot; and that first word, <span style="font-style: italic">Mens</span> sounds awfully like &quot;men&quot;, in reference to lots of people. So if we all put our minds to it, we can pull it off. But we all need to do our bit. One person can't convert six billion to a new ideology. But sixty million can, easy.

Revealing Psi to other people is NO BIG DEAL at all. When I was in high school I showed a bunch of people it, they simply thought it was cool, talked about it a little bit.... And FORGOT ABOUT IT.

Seriously, very few people care about Psionics. Very few people really care about anything. Some people will find Psi interesting, Others will focus their attentions on sports, while others... Well, they will sit down and play video games.

Sorry sgt psion but your method is a proven dud. Like sheepking said they just forget. ALL of my recruits did the same thing (One was successful but she has problems now). You need to manipulate them into wanting to learn more. I told two of my friends about psi one day and said they could learn at this website. They were like &quot;woah! i am gonna lift a car soon!&quot; After that day they never talked about psionics again. Never. Also about getting a gf who accepts psi, don't try. Just hide it like you do normally. People won't accept psi like that. They only accept it when they are revealed to by revealers who know what they are doing.

			What is this stuff about &quot;Recruiting&quot;? That's a terrible term for showing another person Psi. As far as I know, Psi is not a &quot;team&quot;, a &quot;cult&quot;, or an &quot;army&quot;. There is no recruiting. I merely SHOWED people psi stuff; What doesn't work about that? If they where interested, they would have wanted to practice.
<br />

<br />
And about getting a girlfriend who is interested in Psi. It is important that you do not search for that quality alone; There are many things that play into someone accepting your psi abilities. If you find a girl who likes/loves you, she will accept you. That has always been how it is for me.

Do you not think this has happened to me too?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

One of my girlfriends, in our break up, used it against me. It seriously didn't matter, and it still doesn't.

<br />
If you want to &quot;reveal&quot; psi, do it at your own risk. If you have some screwed up view that you have to show everyone in the world that psi exists, GROW UP. Fact of the matter is; Some people will be interested, some people will not. Some people will hate you for it, some people will love you, and others will ask who the fuck you are.
