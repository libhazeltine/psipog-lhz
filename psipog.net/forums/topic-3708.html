			<span style="color: red">You fail to realize that science cannot prove everything. We use only about eight percent of our brains. Imagine what we can do with the rest? The brain, as you know, is the center of your nervous system, correct? Psionics is controlled by your nervous system. Therefore, using other, unexplored parts, of your brain, can cause other reactions in your nervous system. Psionics is one of them. The brain also controls your six (yeah, six) senses. Psi, Taste, touch, hearing, smelling, seeing. So, since Seeing and Psi are connected by your nervous system, they can be used together. You Visualize many aspects of psionics; Ie. Psi-balls, and even draining energy. Therefore, these two work together to reach a common goal. They are both part of your nervous system; They can both function together. If Psionics is one aspect of the brain many unexplore, how can science prove what is truly comprehensible with the human body? It cannot. Therefore, science cannot disprove psionics. 
<br />
regardless, they have already proved it. ;D</span>

			Myth: You only use 8/10/11/12/other bullshit amount of your brain. You actually use all of your brain.
<br />
You seem sure of yourself that psionics uses the nervous system. If it does, then you should show some proof, or sources, yes?
<br />

<br />
If you wish to ask me for sources for the fact that the 10% Myth is bullshit, then please view these links: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/10percnt.htm" target="_blank" class="postlink">[Link1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain#Popular_misconceptions" target="_blank" class="postlink">[Link2]</a>

			Science CAN prove everything, but you need to understand the science first, it takes time, it doesn't just happen under a year(it could), look at quantum physics, I think it's been known for almost 20 years, and scientists are still researching to figure it out, especially since it contridicts some known Laws.

ESP is known as the Sixth sense not psi.

			depends...
<br />
maybe it can proove everything
<br />
but in our times, it cannot, simply because we don't have the needed tools
<br />

<br />
what's a magnetic field?
<br />
space with magnetic forces...
<br />
but how does it work?
<br />
aliens fly to the object and pull it...... sure...
<br />

<br />
maybe they already know about THAT one...
<br />
but there were times where people laughed about the idea of a flashlight...
<br />

<br />
So as far as i'm concerned, PSI just means &quot;not <span style="font-weight: bold">yet</span> known, therefore you cannot explain it <span style="font-weight: bold">yet</span>&quot;

There are indeed topics for which the scientific method is unsuited.  Psionics is not one of these.  Physics is the science most directly concerned with how and under what conditions psychokinesis works.  Engineering, which is basically &quot;applied Physics&quot;, also is concerned with this.  Biology and Psychology are also heavily involved, when studying the how's and why's, because there are biological organisms involved....usually human, but not always:  telepathy/empathy in rabbits has been recorded, and pk in chickens, also.
<br />

<br />
Which part are you missing?  The fact that psionic activity _is_ already under scientific investigation, and has been for several decades?  Or the concept of what science actually is?

			its also important to note that you're making a seperate point, you aren't saying that science can't prove anything, instead you're offering an explanation for psychic phenomenon based on your understanding of the nervous system - while yes I agree theres plenty of our brains that we don't understand I fail to see the relevance?

And i believe psipog itself says Psionics is created through the nervous system. (Created is a bad word, i'm just not in a thinking mood lately)
<br />

<br />
Yeah. ESP. I call it psi. ESP backwards is almost PSI... <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

Yes. I do know that science has been recearching it. I thought i put that in there...

			Wait, wait. We do NOT USE all of our brains in the sense you would think. Our body uses them for things but we do not control them. If we could control them I believe we would have a lot more control over psionic abilities.
