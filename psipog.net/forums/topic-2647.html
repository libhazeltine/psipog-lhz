Short-Term Precognitive Control:
<br />
Lesson Two
<br />

<br />
Assuming that the clock exercise has worked for you, were now going to go a little further into precognitive control. This article covers how to ?pre-enact? the situation, like in long-term precognitive events.
<br />

<br />
Right, so now were going to learn how to do the more advanced version of the clock exercise.
<br />

<br />
Secondary Clock Exercise
<br />

<br />
Ok when you connect with the clock, I want you to supercharge your third eye. Send as much energy into it as possible, and whilst remaining in a meditative like state, I want you to be completely calm?if it helps, send the energy through your spine and brain, as the belief in psionics is that psi energy is a byproduct of these clusters of the nervous system.
<br />

<br />
Right, here?s an example of how this exercise worked for me. My friend and I were going to a live gig. He said that he would pick me up later on, but wasn?t specific about what time.
<br />

<br />
I went to the clock, supercharged my third eye and remained completely calm. I envisioned my friend picking me up, then I looked at the clock and the time was exactly 7:23. On the dot. So I snapped out of this precognition at roughly 7:11. I ?tarted? myself up a bit, looking rather decent. I checked the clock at 7:22 then looked outside the window. At exactly 7:23, my friend pulled up in the driveway. In the exact location I envisioned.
<br />

<br />
The key to this exercise is to try and see it how it will happen, if that makes sense. It?s like remembering, but ahead of time instead of looking back. As you have tapped into precognitive abilities, the event should actually unravel itself. Like in the initial clock exercise, you can tell which time is significant and which is your imagination. It?s just like this.
<br />

<br />
Bare in mind that this is a rather hard technique to pull off, and requires a lot of practice before you get it right! So don?t worry if you don?t get it 100% accurate first time. Eventually your brain naturally learns what is true and what is imagination, I don?t know how!
<br />

<br />
So to summarise, you need to remember the time, then look deeper into it, and picture the event. It will unfold itself.
<br />

<br />
So What Now?
<br />

<br />
Well if you have successfully come this far, then I salute you!
<br />

<br />
My advice is to tinker with these abilities. Find your own path; develop your own techniques and philosophies. My articles are here in order to give you a rough guide on how to start out on precognitive control. Maybe you could try and figure out how to consciously control Long-Term precognition. Well as im making this into an article, I will include a few more practices:
<br />

<br />
Precognition On Inanimate Objects
<br />

<br />
Just like with the clock exercise, charge your third eye, reprogram it to look ahead, and then connect with the object. What should happen is that you will see everything in fast-forward until the object is interacted with. Well this is what happens for me.
<br />

<br />
Here?s an example. I was sitting with food on my tray and then did the exercise: I saw that in 8 minutes I would get shouted at, then have to run and leave my food on the side. My mum instead of cleaning it would shout at me about it, gives me a small lecture then id have to wash up.
<br />

<br />
It happened. Yay.
<br />

<br />
Retro-cognition
<br />

<br />
This is the ability to look back. Its exactly the same as looking forward, but you need to program the eye to look backwards in order to seek the information you want.
<br />

<br />
Experimental
<br />

<br />
This is completely contrapuntal to what I said in my previous article. But I?m curious.
<br />
What would happen if you could clearly see the event, but you altered what would happen in the event. 
<br />

<br />
Say I saw myself sitting in a field. This is the event. Now I alter it.
<br />
I make a psi-ball and send it there in that time period. So when I actually sit there in the field I will feel the presence of psi in the area? Psionic time travel?
<br />

<br />
Or say I saw someone gets his or her leg broken. That is what?s supposed to happen. As opposed to altering the event in real life, I alter it in the vision. Would this alter what really happens?
<br />

<br />
My next article will cover natural precognition, which is precognition but without all this fuss about charging etc?.its embeds itself as one of your senses!
<br />

<br />
And it will cover what I call ?true precognition? as well as aiding you with more exercises!
<br />

<br />
I hope this helps everyone towards precognitive control. Thanks for sparing your time, it?s much appreciated.
<br />
 
<br />
Love
<br />
 
<br />
