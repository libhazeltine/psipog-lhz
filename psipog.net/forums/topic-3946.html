			Whenever I practice telepathy lately I've started feeling very light headed and dizzy, has this happened to anyone else? I have had fairly poor health for most of my life, and get faint very easily, so this isn't particularily unusual for me. It's just that I've been practicing for a long time and this has never happened to me.  My question is do you think it would be safe for me to continue practicing?

 Safe? Probably. Just don't push it too much. If you get dizzy, get a headache or feel lightheaded, stop and take a break.

			I'm new to this whole thing, but I've experienced the light headed feeling several times.
<br />

<br />
I think it happens to me when I focus too hard. When meditating if I focus too much on visualization or affirmations, the muscles in my face begin tingling, and quickly start to tense. Lips and cheeks are the worst. But my entire head tingles.
<br />

<br />
I just have to relax and try to be more aware of my focus level. Maybe your experience was similar.

			The problem arrises from focusing too hard, and concentrating on points on your body too much.
<br />

<br />
If you feel that &quot;Pushing&quot; feeling in your forehead, you are not relaxing enough. I don't know what causes it, other than that, though.

			Being dizzy and light-headed can also occur from a drop in blood sugar or potassium levels.  It is known that both of those levels drop with psionic use and intense concentration.  Whether the drop related to psionics is simply due to the level of concentration or something else is uncertain as far as I know.
<br />

<br />
Either way, a glass of orange juice (it has both potassium and sugar in it) would be better to have next to you when practicing than a glass of water.  And yes, when you feel poorly after practicing, taking a break is a good idea.
<br />

<br />
The body goes through various cycles.  Perhaps you are at a lower energy level than you have been in the past, and therefore you are feeling the effects of practice more than 'normal'.

			I'll try the Orange Juice thing. I've been drinking mostly water the last few weeks with very little in terms of nutrition. I need to better tend my body.
<br />

<br />
As far as energy level, hard to say. I recently began taking a medication that's been very useful in short bursts, dealing with ADD and Depression. Overall I feel much better than I have in years, but I'm still learning to deal with my mind going 400mph! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I'll try the OJ and more consistant exercize. Thanks for the help all <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
P.S. do you have any links discussing the sugar/potassium relationship to psionic focus? I'm curious to read more about the biological aspect.

hahaha, I think that's a character from the movie, &quot;the virgin suicides&quot; I couldn't tell you the actor, since I can't even remember the girl in the movies name, I think it was cynthia or sylvia, or something like that. I just decided that I should probablly have a reasonably femanine picture since it might be diffacult to tell whether I was male or female by my name.... not that it matters that much. SO I just pulled a random picture from my computer (I don't even know who saved it there) She is pretty, though, isn't she?
<br />

<br />
More importantly, though thanks for the help everyone, I think I'll start drinking orange juice, especially when I practice. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			This was delayed a bit longer than I hoped...
<br />

<br />
Generally, research on the biological effects of psi are hard to find.
<br />

<br />
I learned of how potassium and blood sugar drop with concentration and psionic use from Rainsong/RainTurtle.  She has helped with some studies demonstrating a change in potassium and blood sugar levels following psionic activities.
<br />

<br />
This phenomenon has been mentioned elsewhere, though I am tracking down only one reference at this point.  On page 97 in the book <span style="font-weight: bold">Psi Trek</span> by Laile E. Bartlett (1981, ISBN 0-07-003915-1), the author references Bevy Jaegers saying &quot;Using ESP depletes the body sugar; we need to bring your balance back up.&quot;
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Some interesting bits:</span>
<br />
In one of the links below, you can read how stress affects blood sugar.  Since potassium, as an electrolyte, is involved in this process, it is possible that the relationship is causal.  It is a very easy electrolyte to test, which is likely why it was tested in the experiment Rain assisted in.  Blood sugar is also involved in the balancing of potassium, so it is likely that the fact that both are depleted in psionic use is? well, an 'obvious' correlation.  However, if only one was used, that would tell us very specific information on what is going on in the body.  With both being used, that allows us to see that the body using/creating/manipulating psi acts in a somewhat similar manner as to when it performs other activities, such as exercise or concentration.  Now, pretty much any activity in the body requires electrolytes, so the question on the studies is how much psionic use affects it in relationship to other activities.
<br />

<br />
Following are some informational links on blood sugar, including how stress affects blood sugar ?

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Another interesting correlation:</span>
<br />
As I was tracking down specific information on what potassium does in the body, I noticed an interesting correlation (perhaps it is also one of those 'obvious' ones).  Now, I am assuming that potassium and blood sugar is indeed affected by psionic use.  As I mentioned above, potassium is one of the body?s many electrolytes.  Electrolytes are:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody"> e?lec?tro?lyte n. 
<br />
A chemical compound that ionizes when dissolved or molten to produce an electrically conductive medium. 
<br />
Physiology. Any of various ions, such as sodium, potassium, or chloride, required by cells to regulate the electric charge and flow of water molecules across the cell membrane.
<br />
</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />
I find it interesting that psionic use has been shown to effect electrolyte balance (read: ionizing of substances).  It has also been shown to affect Geiger counters, which also measure ions.  I?m not sure what this correlation shows, but I?d thought I?d share my observation.
<br />

<br />
Jael
<br />

<br />
Ps.  This has been a good reminder for me to mention in my original post where I have information, or qualify that information as being undocumented.
