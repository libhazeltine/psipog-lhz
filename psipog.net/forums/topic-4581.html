			The X Scale is a system that me and a few other psions from MPW13 (Me, Genjo, Miri) helped to create. One day we were charging up wondering, &quot;I wonder how powerful I am&quot;. Someone had the bright idea to say &quot;You are 15x an average psion.&quot; That is how this all began...
<br />

<br />
The original scales were faulty, as were based on an &quot;average psion&quot; which there is really no concrete basis of what an average psion is.
<br />

<br />
Then, over time I had the bright idea to organize the effort of figuring out psi-related power levels and putting it into a more concrete theory.
<br />

<br />
The way that the X scale of psi power works is this: You take a Non/Null (someone with none to near-no psi/psi abilities), scan them, and then use that to judge how many times more a psion is than that. It really is that easy. The method I personally use involves no complex math or psi-judgements, I just have scanned the Null, and that is in my brain/subc to some extent. Then when I scan someone who would like to know their psi-energy level, I simply scan, and wait for a number. It seems as though the subc does all the work. Another way if you are more advanced is to do the estimating yourself I would assume, as you would have the non in your memory and could work off that. It is just a simple way of saying you have 20x (20 times) the amount of psi a non does.
<br />

<br />
Another note as well is that YOU MUST make sure that the non you are using has a very low psi level, i.e. near to none. If you do not, the results of your scans of others will be skewed thus making this a less than uniform design across the board for all people.
<br />

<br />
Now we will talk about bases and peaks. A base psi-energy level is when the psion is resting, and hasn't done much energy work for the day. A peak is when the psion charges their body, and gets to the point of a little bit of strain, that is the psions peak. To go above the point of small amounts of strain can (and will according to the research) induce burn-outs, temporary loss of psionic abilities, and permanent loss of certain psionic abilities, all of which I am sure you dont want.
<br />

<br />
The best way to go about testing your energy level, is to have someone ELSE test you. To test yourself seems more faulty and prone to error than someone else testing you. Using the proven system, there is a 5-10x of variation while trying to hit your peak, but while the base there is a 1-3x variation of error.
<br />

<br />
Ok, so here are the rules for your charging practices:
<br />

<br />
-You can not use outside energies, as this will skew your personal results.
<br />
-You can not put the energy you generate into a construct of any kind while charging, as this will take the energy out of your body and thus allow you to charge further (one psion I know hit an extreme number just by putting all the energy into a dense field around himself, yet it was inaccurate, because it was no longer HIS level, but his constructs energy level).
<br />
-ALWAYS quit charging when you feel the slightest hint of strain on your: energy system, physical body, or your mind. VERY IMPORTANT that you do this, or else you will hurt yourself.
<br />

<br />
So you ask, what are the benefits of this practice and these scales?
<br />

<br />
1) Your base level and peak level will begin to rise due to the flexing of your psionic muscle.
<br />
2) Because of Reason 1, your manipulation will be easier, more efficient, and denser. It will also help the speed of manipulation.
<br />
3) It lets you know where you stand ENERGY level wise. Psi-energy levels and SKILL are two completely different things altogether. So if you have a low energy level, dont fret.
<br />

<br />
Also, manipulation is a whole helluva lot easier while at your peak. Psiballs are denser and quicker to make than ever before.
<br />

<br />
This is a very fun, competitive way to get your psionic abilities better, faster. And the scale works great too. As I said, it has little error when used correctly. It is fun to have competitions between psionic friends to see who has the highest peak, etc. But, do not strain yourself in order to &quot;win&quot;. There is severe consequences for that, which will show up, if not immediately, at least the following morning.
<br />

<br />
If you do happen to experience burnout or any other negative symptoms, do not use psi for the rest of that day, get a good nights rest, and check yourself the next day. It can take up to 4 days to recover 100% from a burnout.
<br />

<br />
A general scale looks like this:
<br />
Non/Null: 0x-2x
<br />
Beginning psion: 2x-5x
<br />
Above that, there really is no classification, as no one is &quot;advanced&quot; or &quot;master&quot; or any of that BS. This is (again I will say this) ONLY for energy level testing and NOT skill level. So dont get caught up worrying and being pissed if your level is low.
<br />

<br />
These scales can also be used to measure psiball/construct/shield/field strength, currently I am conducting research to figure out what levels basics of each of those are.  Will report those findings when done with that testing.
<br />

<br />
P.S. Changes happen. Every psion has a base and a peak, and both can change with practice. If a psion is out of practice, then his/her base/peak will be lower. If a psion is tired/sick, his/her base/peak may be lower. This system is not perfect, but rather a general averaging.
<br />

<br />
*Research was conducted over a one month time period and over 12 test subjects were used. This includes over 5 different scanners for each session and the charging participants. This information has been meticulously arranged.*  <a href="http://s2.zeroforums.com/index.php?mforum=mod13" target="_blank" class="postlink">MPW13 FORUMS</a>

			It's impractical. Most of the people here, including the original poster, are within decimal levels of standard &quot;posters.&quot; Human energy field levels are distributed along a bell curve, just like any other human characteristic.
<br />

<br />
I tend not to buy that the &quot;average&quot; energy user will be five times as charged as a non...seeing as nons can have very large or very small fields (see the bell curve comment, above). I don't think you've properly grasped the concept of multiplication - 20x an average field size is very large, you know.

			Well I have found your scanning of my energy to be a bit faulty Elliptic.  But this isn't a bash fest, and no, my energy level isn't near most of the standard posters, it is more.  But this isn't for debate.  The Scale works.  It has been tested repeatedly, even by people who hadn't heard what mine or others level was, and they got the same result.  Perhaps try it before bashing it. Or rather, try it before bashing me.  
<br />

<br />
I know my &quot;X&quot; level, and I know my skill level, and one far outweighs the other (which means skill is not nearly as good...).  But regardless, I think everyone should give it a shot...it is fun anyways to charge to see how high you can get.  
<br />

<br />
Hope everyone here has fun with it.

			It's been tested by you, genjo, and miri. Miri! 
<br />

<br />
As for my scanning of your field to be faulty - not as such. You have a somewhat large field, but I have seen larger. I have seen smaller, too. I have also <span style="font-style: italic">had</span> larger. It's not difficult to artificially inflate field size or density - not particularly healthy to do so for long periods of time, but hardly a difficult application.
<br />

<br />
Whether or not you're doing that I don't know, and I don't particularly care. I have a coworker whose field takes up the whole of the pharmacy, but she's only about 3 times a normal field.
<br />

<br />
Say we're to assume the average field diameter is 5 feet...that would mean that 2x is 10 feet...20x would be 100 feet in diameter. That's quite large.
<br />

<br />
The problem lies in the mathematics: it is an acceptable statistical assumption that all human characteristics are naturally occurring along a bellcurve. Energy level is a human characteristic, and it is assumed to be likewise. Since I'm assuming you want to measure natural base-levels, without charging, I have to say that your research seems to go contrary to accepted scientific understandings.
<br />

<br />
I'm putting my money on the behavioral scientists with this one - if it's not following a bellcurve, it's probably wrong.

			And yet another issue is that you're taking the low end of the bell curve to start with. A field of &quot;near to none&quot; is fairly rare - nons still produce energy, and nothing about working with that energy causes you to boost production (unless you're working with it outside your field for long periods of time, at which point you start to compensate to maintain homeostasis).
<br />

<br />
So you're starting with the very bottom of the bellcurve, and you're then saying that the &quot;average&quot; is, say, 5x? That's somewhat silly to believe, I think.
<br />

<br />
I'm not saying the comparative level system is bad - comparative registers are best, since there's no quantitative register. I'm just saying you might want to rethink your numbers.

			Well, the field size has no correlation to energy level, as people control their field size, even if subconsciously, to a certain extent.  A person with a low psilevel can still have a large field of energy, given that they know that they can extend it, or that they do it subconsciously.  
<br />

<br />
Everyone has a different base without charging, some are higher, some are lower, etc.  But regardless, whatever you choose to believe is your opinion and choice <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  I just know that it has been tested, and it works.  It was tested thoroughly and extensively with a lot of people.  But oh well, I didn't think everyone would like it.  If that was my goal, I would never post at all!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
The &quot;average' is 5x-20x, there is no one set average.  The bases go up with practice, i.e. manipulating and flexing psionic muscles.
<br />

<br />
And who said anything about using a non's energy????  We are simply using a non as a base because of the low energy level, to make it more uniform and less fluctuation across the board.  That is all.  The charging practices describes a way to find your peak, and that is also a way to raise both peak/base, as the findings would suggest...

This is my problem. The &quot;average&quot; field size should be 1 times the average field size. There is nothing that makes people who are psionically active produce any more energy than people who aren't unless they are training themselves for such.

You did, when you suggested a non with the lowest possible energy level to be the ideal comparative base.
<br />

<br />
Because this really should follow a bellcurve, if you find a &quot;maximum&quot; to match your &quot;minimum,&quot; I can show you what &quot;average&quot; should be. It's incorrect to say the average psion has 5 times the energy of an average person, though, which is what you're saying.

			Not really though.  Honestly, the results of scanning psions revealed that their base was, typically, in the 5x-20x range, normally between 5x and 12x.  When you use psi, you flex your muscle.  It enhances you, regardless if you are trying to or not.

			OMG POWA LEVELS N' SHIT!
<br />

<br />
Seriously,  you can't place psionic skill on a scale. There are too many variables. What is &quot;good&quot; to some people (or 20x or whatever the hell you're using), maybe be &quot;suck&quot; to others. For example, I haven't practiced any PK in years, but does that mean I should be &quot;knocked down a few points&quot; because of it? No, it doesn't.
<br />

<br />
As far as technique is concerned, scanning and then guessing someone's skill level is not exactly the brightest thing to do. Good psychics will intentionally make themselves look less than they are so they do not attract any attention to themselves.
<br />

<br />
I just dont see any use for such a scale, and I doubt I ever will.

			Well Stony, obviously you didn't read the article very closely.  It specifically says this is ONLY related to psi level, not skill level of anything.  Thus not practicing PK has no influence on psi level.  Not manipulating does seem to have an effect though.  It is only related to psi level, not skill with psi or anything else.  Take a moment and read the article please <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Hard to say. Fields don't tend to just &quot;end&quot; right away, they tend to gradate off, so there's that. But I'm not sure &quot;5&quot; is a hard, fast rule.

As far as psi being a muscle...it's not. But the body has a tendency to maintain homeostasis. If you regularly drain yourself of psi energy, your body will begin to produce more in order to compensate. The result is a higher base energy production, until such time as that overdrive is overproducing, at which point the body will undercompensate until enough is used, and then return to an average state.
