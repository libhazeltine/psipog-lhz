			I've changed the forum to Clairvoyance.  Good luck on your mission to fix the community's perception of remote viewing.  I'm probably partially to blame because I don't really care that much about &quot;correct RV&quot;.  I do what works, and my personal methods for receiving images works for me.  Whatever the label is.  Either way, if the RV dudes (being JoeT and Elliptic) think something should change, fair enough <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  As long as you guys agree on what needs to be changed, and it's reasonable, I probably won't have any issues with it.
<br />

<br />
To be fair though, McMoneagle defines RV as:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Remote viewing is the ability to produce information that is correct about a place, event, person, object, or concept which is located somewhere else in time/space, and which is completely blind to the remote viewer and others taking part in the process of collecting the information.&quot;
<br />

<br />
That's <span style="font-style: italic">slightly</span> different than the definition provided in this thread.  Although I would agree, that 95% of the community is not doing correct RV.
<br />

Yeah, McMoneagle uses a slightly different definition there, designed to be broad. It's kind of what Joe does.

<br />
Most RVers tend to quickly pass through the earlier Stages of CRV protocol because the information is less useful or precise. Some skip it - I'm notorious for using a revised CRV protocol about which I am writing a book.
<br />

<br />
As for &quot;Stage V,&quot; I don't know where you get conscious astral projection from it? In CRV, Stage V is one where subconscious emanant descriptors about aesthetic impact regarding the site are recorded without the actual signal line information itself being decoded.
<br />

<br />
And Stage VI involved modelling the site in three dimensions using the data received from the signal line. No RV stage in CRV protocol involves &quot;conscious astral projection&quot; as such. Now, you may be speaking of another Protocol, and if so, I'd like to know which one, so I can read up on it while working on my book.

			Hello Peebrain,

<br />
Thanks buddy, I appreciate it. Joe M's method is slightly different from other protocol methods although not completely different. The back bone of his methods (which is RV`do) is CRV only with a costumed touch.

Take care.

say i give you a set o' coords. nothing else. does this count as &quot;proper&quot; RVing? or does it not.

you say we are doing it incorrectly. thats a rather large generalization. when i do it, i see things in my minds eye, review the target several times over, then try to put it together as best as i can.... is that incorrect?

You're still not correct. Coordinates <span style="font-style: italic">alone</span> do not a remote viewing session make. You still have to follow protocol after the coordinates are given. If you just use the coordinates, then &quot;close your eyes and see in your mind's eye,&quot; then you are not remote viewing. You're doing a much more valid form of clairvoyance, but it's still not remote viewing because you're omitting the protocol and the structure.

<br />
First of all, AOL is not &quot;adding things to the picture that are not there.&quot; Oneta's guide really demonizes AOL incorrectly. In fact, analytical overlay is a common and often necessary part of many protocols. Forcing AOL out is difficult - it's better to note it properly, as AOL can hold hidden information about the target site that's not outwardly manifested in the ideograms and contents.
<br />

<br />
Secondly, on &quot;we're all different, so try what works...&quot; - this fundamentally defeats the concept of RV. The point of RV is that it is standardized so that everyone is doing the same thing. That thing works. Everyone doing it the same way means it's easier to find what's going wrong with the session. Further, it allows people to rely on a standardized system that is scrutable. &quot;Do what works&quot; is not remote viewing, unless you're using a protocol, and it works.

			I use Coordinate Remote Viewing. However I'm currently working on a protocol, detailed in the book I'm writing, which details a revised version of CRV, which I'm either going to end up calling fCRV (Fundamental CRV), Pragmatic RV, or Simplified RV. Not sure which yet.

			Alright first off, Its cool you have your ideas of what RV is and isn't, and it is backed by official government yadda yadda. But when you actually go as far as to say my representation of AOL is incorrect, first take into consideration I'm not the only one who wrote that, so let's not let personal vendettas, if any exists, get in the way of things. Secondly, you are implying I am making a bad thing out of AOL, when I was just in a recent argument with someone that said I didn't mention how bad AOL is and that it should be avoided at all costs. So when the whole community comes together and decides what it is you all want, then I'll consider it.

I didn't say your views on it are incorrect, I said your guide demonizes it, which it does. The guide includes a chapter on how to avoid AOL, and as a result I can only infer that this implies it's something to be avoided. There's no personal vendetta, either - why would I attack your views? I <span style="font-style: italic">taught</span> you remote viewing. Or do we forget so soon?

I don't get a personal record of all your logs sent to me. But I don't need the whole community to come together and decide what is right. Neither do I need you to consider what I am saying. Your opinions don't change facts. The facts are that AOL needs to be controlled, but not stopped completely, and that there are proper channels and proper times for AOL to be recorded in CRV protocol, while at the same time, it is not something to be absolutely halted.
<br />

<br />
While it's nice that you want us all to make a consensus before you'll consider the ideas, it really doesn't affect me one way or another. Still, I hope there are no hard feelings.

			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
This topic was debated in the past <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=1158" target="_blank" class="postlink">found here</a>. Oneta and I exchanged our views on the subject (AOL) and we moved on with our life?s. However, the fact remains that  remote viewers who follow any government made protocol or recognized protocol knows that he or she should avoid AOL. For our members who have absolutely no idea what Analytical Overlay is, allow me to educate you.
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">i. Analytic Overlay (AOL): Conscious subjective interpretation of signal line
<br />
data, which may or may not be relevant to the site.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
When a viewer in remote viewing, the viewer is constantly receiving information based on the target site that he or she is viewing. While the information is being passed through the signal line and brought to the viewer, your brain can easily prejudge that information flowing in to be something that it's not. For example:
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Textures:</span></span> Hard, rough, metallic, wet
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Colors:</span></span> White, Red, Blue, black, gray, brown, flashing lights
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">
<br />
Smells:</span></span> Cold, pungent, 
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Tastes:</span></span> Cold, non-eatable 
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Temperatures:</span></span> Cold, warm
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sounds:</span></span> echoes, whirls, flashing sounds, high, loud
<br />

<br />
Just by looking at my example, has your mind thought of what the target is? I'm sure you've all gone through ideas that the target may or may not be. However, in a remote viewing session it is crucial that you avoid thinking like that. You're mind is receiving information based on the target site and while this information is passing through, your mind is coming up with ideas on what the target might me. That's called Analytic Overlay (AOL). 
<br />

<br />
It is crucial to your session that no viewer follows his/her AOL's. They should be avoided at all cost and NOT followed. I'm a technical remote viewer, when I'm in the middle of a session and my brain starts coming up with ideas on what the target might be, I jot down the AOL in it's proper location and drop my pen indicating that I'm dropping the idea and moving on. 
<br />

<br />
I hope that helped all members who wasn't sure on what AOL's are. Your understanding on AOL's is very important if you plan on working with remote viewing. Please take what Elliptic and I have to offer seriously, we have years of experience and we're trying to help you. If your understanding on Analytic Overlay (AOL) is still bad, feel free to ask any questions regarding the issue.
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />
