			Hello, today my school had a Pep Rally.They invited students up and asked them questions for a game. Ok so they ask one person what animal they would be and why? The first thing that popped into my mind was a dolphin, because i like to swim. About five seconds later the girl said the same exact thing!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> Was this a coinsidence or a premonition?

The exact same thing happens to me but only when the other person is aligned with the right corner of my forehead.(weird huh?) In fifth grade I walked pass this boy and all of the sudden I saw these exact words in my head &quot;Johnny ate a booger and it tastes like sugar&quot;. and like 3 seconds later he said it.
