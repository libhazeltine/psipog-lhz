			Yesterday I was talking with someone who said I have very strong shields...I said &quot;What?  I dont even shield!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Today, I had someone else probe me and said these shields would be like &quot;cracking diamonds by hand&quot;...
<br />

<br />
My question is, what is the best method for getting rid of these?
<br />

<br />
Thanks guys!

			Take them down, or have someone bust them. The latter probably isn't possible here, due to the restrictions on combative actions.
<br />

<br />
Why would you <span style="font-style: italic">want</span> to take them down, though? Taking down my natural shields was pretty uncomfortable, and while it was really cool and exciting at the time, sometimes I wish I didn't have to manually shield anymore. It's not like my natural shields made me mindblind anyways.

			Ya but thats the problem.  Mine DO make me mindblind.  I can't sense psiballs or constructs (others, not my own...).  The guy who probed my shields also sent VERY strong psiballs hurled at me and they just bounced off and I didn't feel them.  
<br />

<br />
And I'm pretty sure they can't be busted.  I wont talk specifically about it, but every 'attack' he tried just bounced back.  You can try if you want <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
But how do I take them down though?  ...  Or what would be an easy effective way to take them down temporarily?  Like, when I want to?

			I would deprogram and dissolve them.
<br />

<br />
Sending psiballs at someone does not constitute attacking them. The shield's ability to resist psiballs does not actually reflect the shield's strength very much at all - most shields can resist a thrown or even a fired psiball - otherwise, what would be the point?
<br />

<br />
As for being unbreakable, at the very worst I'd use a radionic box to dissipate them over time. Nothing is unbreakable or unbreachable.

			The psiballs werent the attack.

Any suggestion on how to do those techniques?

			Given the nature of the crowd you run with, I'm not sure I'd consider any attack significant enough to shatter elementary shields - even natural ones.
<br />

<br />
I can't make suggestions as to how in accordance with local custom and law. Contact me on IM.

			Wow.
<br />

<br />
You don't want someone to break them.  If you can weaken them yourself over time it is much advisable.
<br />

<br />
Having natural shields broken is a <span style="font-weight: bold">very</span> uncomfortable process.
<br />

<br />
I'm not one to know how to break shields, but try to sense others psi activities, and if that fails, you oculd have someone <span style="font-weight: bold">strong</span> attack you.

			Nah, I don't want them broken, I dont think I ever said that.  I want to know how to bring them down myself, either temporarily (as in when I want/need them down) or if that isn't possible, permanently.  I dont think 'the group i run with' has anything to do with strength.  I bet you couldn't anything to it either <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  But regardless, any suggestions?

			When it comes to shields I'm not good, but...why not reprogram them to allow you to sense other people's constructs?  That way you wouldn't have to take them down and they would continue to protect you from everything else which, I presume, is something you actually want?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			With natural shields, taking them down oneself can be extremely difficult.  Again, I'm not the best one to know how to deal with this.  Shields can be deprogrammed, with the knowledge to do so.
<br />

<br />
Also, if you have enough control over your natural shielding you can reprogram them to allow certain things.
