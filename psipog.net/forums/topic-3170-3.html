			That brings up an interesting question...
<br />

<br />
Is anyone here fairly good at PK/Pyro-PK??  Here is the question I have for you then...try to light a cigarette.  I figure it is possible, but I was just wondering how hard that may be for someone who is fairly good, that way I could know how long it may take me ... thanks...

actully im pretty sure if you made a spark in a room full of PURE oxygen that room would explode.the reason y the earths atmospher is mostly made of nitrogen.

			Pyromatt, I'm afraid I have to disagree with you Look up the Apollo missions, Don't remember which one it was but at that time they were using pure oxygen in the space craft and there was an electrical spark or something else sparked and there was an explosion within the space craft. Pure oxygen is highly explosive and flammable. Reason why it does not occur down here is because nitrogen keeps it from exploding until a certain temperature of roughly 3600 degrees fairenheit there abouts. Just think about hydrogen and hellium, both of which is also highly explosive, all you have to do with those have a balloon filled with either one, or oxygen for that matter, tied off and put on a 10 foot pole away from you and a small fire underneth and you will see an explosion.

			I used to practice Pyro-Pk months ago without guidelines from anyone or any site. The most noticable result I got was when I barely re-lite a burnt match with pure concentration, I saw with my own eyes the faint ember growing from inside the charcoaled match head, it died down instantly as I lost my concentration <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> . 
<br />

<br />
Kinda got tired in it and lost enthusiasm eventually, until one year later I found PsiPog and moved on to Pk on solid objects. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

On earth agree majority of the time oxygen will not burn but Look at one of the apollo mission's they used pure oxygen at the time and there was a major explosion, and the result of it was just a little spark in the air. 
<br />
The only reason why we don't have oxygen burning down here is for 2 reasons, Nitrogen helps keep the explosive capabilities down which inturns increases the amount of heat that's needed to cause oxygen to explode/become into fireball.

however, another good pyro method that does work though requires enormous amounts of practice, take a small fire for example neighbor burning something in his/her trash barrel, when the fire starts dying down a bit. It is frequently seperate flames by that point, what I do is I merge the flames together to make one big flame and then I connect with the fire and dim my mind. Vision doesn't go dark but the best way I can describe it, it's like your shutting down your brain functions so that there is no thought but as you dim visualize the fire die'ing and then lose that visualization as you dim your mind and if you are connected the fire will go out. I've been practicing by using that method and it works quite well, happens to be my own-haven't seen anybody else having anything similiar.

			oxygen might be slightly pressurized but still dam combustable, however the thing with helium is that it expands so rapidly under heat that any container that it's in will explode in all directions from the pressure, by it self not flammable no but sorry if I didn't clarify that earlier.
