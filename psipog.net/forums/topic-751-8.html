			Well, I got to the topic a little late, but... only 14 of us girls?? Wow, that's surprising. I was actually wondering myself how many guys compared to girls there were here. I thought of it because I realized that with many screen names/avatars, it's usually not easy to tell if it's a guy or girl.
<br />

<br />
Someone should ask Peebs to make male/female the next poll on the PsiPog main page so we get a more accurate count. Like you said earlier, a lot of people just might not have looked at this thread, but the main page poll usually gets a couple hundred votes. We've already done one one age groups; I wanna see if there are really this few of us girls on PsiPog.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I think it was through more witchcraft type sites that I stumbled upon PsiPog. That could be why there are less of us here. That's pretty hott that there are so many guys into energy manipulation and PK and stuff, lol.
<br />

<br />
BTW: There are two people greater than Chuck Norris, Vin Diesel, and Mr. T combined. Luke Skywalker and Orlando Bloom. Yea, the one is fictional, you could argue that, but they could both definately steal this ultimate avatar. Luke Skywalker has the power of The Force and Orlando Bloom's intriguing eyes and sexy body could overpower anyone, any day.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			The girls might even reach over my estimate! No! I can't be wrong!
<br />
And to shortpower24:
<br />
#1- I didn't expect you to be a female.
<br />
#2- I don't think the 74 males on this site want to hear your liking for Orlando Bloom. (the 14 females might though, but we win.)

			Obi-wan Kenobi (from the original 3 Star-Wars movies, not the prequels, dammit) totally owns Luke Skywalker. Since Mr. T, Vin Diesel, and Chuck Norris all totally Own Obi-Wan, then logically, they all own Luke as well.
<br />

<br />
As for Orlando Bloom, here's a piece of trivia about Vin Diesel:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Vin Diesel was the first person cast as Aragorn in The Lord of the Rings. He was fired for eating the hobbits between takes and making Orlando Bloom his bitch.&quot;
<br />

<br />
James Bond is better than Orlando Bloom, and anyone who's played his games knows that he can't take a bullet.

Chuck Norris likes to knit sweaters in his free time. By knit, I mean kick, and by sweaters, I mean babies.

			How far is this Chuck Norris stuff going to go? I understand he is a great Karate guy (don't you dare correct me I don't know the exact style) but it is really getting annoying to me and every popular conversation topic goes away eventually. You must understand that I have been hearing it for days and days and it has really worn itself out.

Ur right, well move on from chuck norris and go to someone more worthy. Mr.T. Mr.T wont listen to me, but he wants to kick ass. And whose ass is more fun to kick than that of Diesel and Norris. through this i manipulate him to my ends, once he has finished with the doomed duo the thunderbirds will conveniantly arrive, lured by moi to their deaths. Seeing those crappy bird people Mr.T will open a whole crate load of whoop ass and as he is soundly beating the shit out of them, i shall take the AvataR from the ruins of the afore mentioned castle.

Yeah, but even with the AvataR, you're no match for me and my Sword of Slaying Everything +&#8734;. Besides, if you took the AvataR, don't you think Mr. T would see your increase in power, then deside to pity you to death just to remove a threat to him?

I see you fail to comprehend the depth of the power of the AvataR, it is all, it is one, it was, it will be. It grants everything and anything and through it one is nigh on unstoppable - (except by the likes of chuck norris, mr.t, and vin diesel 2 of which have already been dealt with.) Ill get Mr. T on my side by using the AvataR to become his bro, and we all no Mr.T dont let no bady get the shit awn with his homies. We shall be a posse, and you with ur pathetic bread knife of piddling + butter stand no chance.
