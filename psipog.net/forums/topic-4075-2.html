My theory is that you are tricking your subconscious into changing the amount of pigment in your eyes (Blue = less pigment, black = more), which is usually genetically controlled, but hey, if our skins can do it when we suntan, why can't our eyes? It's just never been done before.
<br />

<br />
I would be VERY surprised if anyone DID manage to turn their eyes red, since I don't think we can different kinds of melanin... I suppose we might, though, you never know.

			eeh not particularily sure. I spent 15 once trying to change my eye color, but the orange stuff in those pics started showing up. The orange stuff doesn't make me feel to good so I think I am going to stop trying.
<br />

<br />
edit//I don't find it too special actually. It's extremily difficult to make it change drastically. Ie blue to brown. I have only been able to make it go from blue to green which is so sutle anyway that I can't tell the difference between actual change and my eyes playing tricks on me.

1. Well, think about it? What controls eye colour? Scientists have discovered that it's the amount of melanin in the eyes, as I stated above. Evidently, this technique meddles with that somehow. Therefore, it is impossible to get a colour that humans can't already have (like a colour in the ultraviolet range, for instance). I've never heard of a human with red irises, so I don't think the red eyes thing is possible. Violet, maybe, since I've heard of this woman who was born with violet eyes (can't remember her name, though).
<br />

<br />
2. Side effects probably aren't very serious, most likely the melanin being removed is discharged in your urine. That's my theory anyway. As to where the melanin came from if you're darkening your eyes, probably the same place that it comes from when you suntan.
<br />

<br />
3. It's scientifically possible. We just don't know if it's possible to do it with our minds. You could probably do it with the right chemicals, if you could make a chemical that dissolves melanin (or makes more of it). Of course, that would have the side effect of making you extremely pale, but a lot of people with blue eyes are pale already, and this will only enhance the effect. Besides, you could always suntan after the procedure is done.

My eyes naturally change color, so I'm sure it's possible to move this unconscious function to the conscious mind.  Other than the &quot;whoa cool&quot;-factor, is there any purpose of this?  Screwing up my eyes permanently because I just wanted to change their color to be cool doesn't sound that wonderful.
<br />

<br />
Remember, no one knows how something like this works.  We DON'T know the sideeffects, and we DON'T know how bad you could hurt yourself.  Be responsible, and be aware of what you're doing.  You might permanently damage your body/eyes.  Be smart.

			Well, this sounds like post-hypnotic suggestion to me. I suppose that could result in what ShadowWolf called DMILS. My question is, If you can change your eye color, what are you going to change next?

After they change it should last a good month or so if you don't do anything else with it but if you keep doing the technique it should stay for a while. And mine turned into a mixture soo.... my guess is yours would too

I'm kind of sorry for posting this seeing as it created some tension. i just posted it because i have been asked how to change the color before.  and i figured if i wrote a little article i could just direct those who were interested towards it.
