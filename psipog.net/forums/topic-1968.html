			I've read the Art of Programming, but I'm having a hard time understanding how to program xD I know to have the idea for the construct before making it, but how exactly do you add this idea to the contrcut as you are making it. Do you just add the imagine or intent in with the psi?

			it would be intention. you intend for this construct to do this. Then you make it.
<br />

<br />
its like building a guitar. You intend for the guitar to play music. But there are details you delve into before you even start. The dimensions that you need for the fret board to match up to their designated notes. How the tuning pegs should work. How many frets you want. Th point is, is you intend for the guitar to be a guitar and operate as one should before you build it. You dont build the body and then go &quot;hmmm i think ill make a guitar.&quot; That wouldnt make sense. Same goes for sheilds.

			Ciaran, let's take a psiball for example in some easy steps to making it... Cold.
<br />

<br />
1. Prepare yourself: Know what you are about to do. As The Musician stated, you do not build a guitar first without knowing you are going to build it.
<br />
2. Begin gathering/moving energy: Generally you will want to form it into a Sphere (if you are making a psiball), and between your hands if you're not going to do it anywhere else.
<br />
3. Shape the Energy: Move it into the form of a sphere. 
<br />
4. Begin programming the energy: Now, Shelling is really an optional step here. You want to put in the intent for it to &quot;Stick togethor, or Hold its shape/form&quot;. The first thing you want to do is give it a &quot;definetness&quot; Make it last. Generally keep adding psi when you are doing this step.
<br />
5. Begin programming the feel: Recall a time when you've felt something really cold, remember that feeling and implant it, along with psi into the psiball. Keep doing so, and know that you want the thing to get colder.
<br />
6. Chill out.
<br />

<br />
Little step by step for you. It definetly takes practice, and you will find the groove of Programming in time. Good luck.
