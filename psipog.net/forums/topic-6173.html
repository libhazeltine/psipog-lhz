			Seeing its getting closer to haloween I thought it would be nice to hear some scary stories from people. Just simply write your own story and tell us. Your story don't have to be long as mine (could just be a paragraph or even a senetne if you can make it fit). My story is not complete, just something I been working on during my spare time (I day dream a lot). If you don't want to tell me and everyone else a story ( <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> ) then could you lest say a scary event you had? Like maybe even from a OBE?
<br />

<br />
Here is part of my story
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red">***Part 1***</span>
<br />

<br />
Where am I.....why is everything so dark...My body...I can't move it.......what happen to me...how did I get here......let me remember.......think....come on think!... 
<br />

<br />
Its was a normal day likes any other. But this time I visited my mother's house to see how she was doing. Ever since father died she has been upset. We talk on and on about father....she loved him...even if he was a monster... I can't forgive father for what he did to me...Personally I felt glade he was gone....but felt sad at the same time........ 
<br />

<br />
I remember getting into my car......but then I heard something....in my head. &quot;Do not ask for whom the bell tolls....it tolls for thee...&quot; I freak out a little...I saw something in my rear view mirror...but it disappears quickly....I don't remember what it was....I remember my mother asking me what was wrong....told her nothing and stoke off the shivers......I started to back up in my car and onto the highway home...there was a car...and a truck..a tire blow out...noise...I was hit! 
<br />

<br />
So am I dead.....have I reach into Dante's inferno? I never been a good believer...am I to rot here in this cold darkness?....Wait...what was that...I felt something...move...... 
<br />

<br />
*In the darkness you feel the presence of a creature moving around the darkness, it has no limps or face. It wanders around the darkness coming closer to you. You feel it...searching...looking for you.* 
<br />

<br />
I remember this thing...I saw it in my rear view mirror! 
<br />

<br />
*You see the creature fly toward you, it has no define body...dark colors flow as its skin, it seems to shimmer with a dark and reddish glow in the darkness* 
<br />

<br />
GET AWAY!! GET AWAY FROM ME!! 
<br />

<br />
*The creature fly's right into your body, you are overwhelm with a darkness depressing feeling in your heart. It spreads outward into your chest, you can no longer breath...you feel the darkness fills your whole body...then it comes up to your head...you feel....chaos...you don't know how to explain it, but everywhere your thoughts gone to, there was destruction. You felt pain...but it wasn't your body, your thoughts...they feel like there in pain. You wanted it to stop......but then you feel a shock of energy flow through out from your chest. The creature fly's from your body and goes into the distance.....you laid in the darkness for what seem to be hours...shocked to feel what you just did* 
<br />

<br />
*You wake up in bed, your head is in pain and your most of your body is as well. You look around and see that you are in a hospital. You couldn't be happier...but you were also scared. You look out the window and see dark clouds over a full moon. You also see get well flowers on the mantel.* 
<br />

<br />
I hear little noise....it must be late at night......... 
<br />

<br />
*You start to feel....happy...so happy.......happy....enough...to kill.....* 
<br />

<br />
What am I am thinking!? This isn't me.... 
<br />

<br />
*Must harvest....must harvest....must harvest...* 
<br />

<br />
Get out of my head!!...........? what's that noise.... 
<br />

<br />
*You turn your head and see a dark figure behind the curtain, you think for a while and you believe its your neighbor. You see the lights by him go out...and then a yell* 
<br />

<br />
*Help! STOP! STOP! PAIN! STOP! HELP! PLEASE! MERCY!...Why..* 
<br />

<br />
*You hear cutting in the other room* 
<br />

<br />
....Have I just escape death to experience it again... 
<br />

<br />
*Harvest...harvest....cut and harvest...* 
<br />

<br />
Why....am I am feeling these emotions...why am I am feeling this way...........why..... 
<br />

<br />
*You sit there feeling fear and happiest while you hear screams behind the curtain, you think of getting up, but you can't move your legs...death...is once again upon you...* 
<br />
<span style="color: red">***To be Continue***</span>
<br />

<br />
Could you tell me how you think?.........yes I know my spelling and grammar sucks sometimes.....most of the time...........don't rub it in  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			Tank: Well, I don't understand the whole I/You subject switch, but there's probably a reason for it. If it's in a CYOA style, then I'd suggest putting all of the narration in 'You', and if it's otherwise, clarify it within the narration.
<br />

<br />
Beyond that, I really like this idea, of sharing spooky stories. I'll add one I wroter a few years ago that I really like...
<br />

<br />
~
<br />
          She was successful, rich and powerful. I never knew anything about her, not even her name, but she knew everything about me. She knew who I was, where I worked and lived, and my route home each day. She had some sort of animosity towards me, some hatred, but that was all I knew. I went naïvely about my day, never thinking of it until that fateful afternoon...
<br />

<br />
                I was walking home one warm spring day, when I got the oddest feeling. I sensed something nearby, but I couldn’t feel it. I shrugged off the feeling, and entered my apartment, never realizing I was being followed until I heard a click. I spun around, and she was standing in the doorway, aiming a gun at my head. I rushed toward her and wrestled her to the ground. Breathing hard, I rested a minute, and for too long. I never saw it coming, not the fist that connected with my temple. Suddenly, everything went black. I came to a few minutes later. She had disappeared. 
<br />

<br />
                I went on with my regular life for a month or so, when I had been invited to a party with a staff member at the firm where I worked. On Friday night, I drove over to my colleague’s house, not expecting more than a fun night with relaxation. I never expected what was to come.
<br />

<br />
                The room was dimly lit, loud with music and laughter. I danced for a few hours, and finally sat down to have a break and a drink. Suddenly, the lights went out. A scream startled the crowd. When the lights came back on, it parted like the Red Sea, revealing none but her and her cronies. They advanced across the path laid before them. When I saw them coming toward me, I knew I had to find a way out. I ran through the door, jumping into my car with them on my heels. It was pouring rain, with thunder louder than I’d ever heard before.  They dashed into their own car as I sped out of the driveway, and on to the street. They were going to catch me! I never knew that that sheet I picked up off my boss’s floor would lead to this. They drove up beside my car, cutting me off, and with them parked across the road along the cliff edge, there was nothing I could do. They came to my car and opened the door, dragging me out. They then shoved me into then drivers’ seat of the black car that was their own. Holding me at gunpoint as I drove them to my office, they questioned me about that sheet. When I told them I didn’t remember anything, the leader glared at me.
<br />

<br />
                &quot;We have ways to find out the truth.&quot; She said. In my fear, my hands slipped on the steering wheel, and the car slid. I tried to stop it, but I just couldn’t. I lost control of the car; it crashed through the guard rail and sailed over the cliff. The fall to the bottom was a wild ride that destroyed the car. Amazingly, the woman didn’t get a scratch. As I took my last dying breath, she checked my pulse and closed my eyes. She turned and walked away.
<br />

<br />
~Epilogue~
<br />

<br />
Karien Cortra died on October 17, 2008. Even with all of the strange events surrounding her death, all hoped it was nothing more than an accident. Years of investigation were put into the cause of her death, but it was never really solved. Investigators could not find all the pieces. All evidence pointed to her death being an accident, all save two things: A single set of footprints leading away from the crash site, and a typed note lying on the rubble that read simply:<span style="font-style: italic"> You will never be safe. 
<br />
Signed, The Immortal.</span>

			Sorry for the confuseion, I tend to think of myself in the third person when something happens to me. I never said I was good at this <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Infact this is like one of the few rare times that I do. Glade you like the idea.
