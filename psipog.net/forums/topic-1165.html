			Some people say when you are attempting TK you need to (in your mind) visualize the object moving in any which way. Others say this isn't the right way to do this. Can someone give me a descriptive answer on how they do it, and please only comment if you are fluent with it. I am still working on the pencil so. At this point I can only make a psiwheel budge, moving maybe a mm, though so far it seems to go in the direction I intend it to, but I've only done this a limited number of times, so I am not sure if it is coincidence or not.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Also, Criss Angel, fake or real...?
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your help,
<br />

<br />
One more thing....Any good TK books?

			Criss Angel is a real magician.  In fact, he sells some of his methods in DVD form, and is also coming out with a book.  He's a magician.  Magic.  Illusion.  Trick.

			What method works for you is very personal. Some use visualisations, others don't. Visualizing the movement can be very helpfull, but it is not necessary. What counts eventually, is the intention. You see, you already know what your intention is right? You want to spin it left or right, it is as simple as that. So the intention is already there the second you make up your mind what you want to do. Intentions are very subtle energies, therefore it takes some practice to become aware of them and work with them. But working with intentions is IMO really the best way of communicating with your subconscious mind. 
<br />

<br />
Your subconscious mind does not communicate in words or imgaes by nature. Allthough images and visualisations work, the essence of what you want to do... the essence of every visualisation, is an intention. You always have an intention. So try to hold the basic concept of this intention in your mind, rather then focussing on the visualisation. This may be a little tricky at first.. think about it.. You must become aware of the intention itself. Become aware of the basic form of your intention, and hold that one in your mind and feel it as good as possible. This is a very strong way of letting your subconsicous know what you want it to do, because the intention includes the whole package of what you want, instead of showing it an moving image/visualisation, you send to him the core of your intention, which includes the whole story in one package so to say. This way you are speaking the language of your subconscious mind, instead of  forcing him to translate our language(which consists of mental conceptions, images etc.)
<br />

<br />
This is perhaps a very uncommon method, but it sure works if you become good at it. It works not only for tk. You will have alot of benefits in life if you can work with pure intentions, rather than mental construct of your intention.

			I personally use the &quot;just do it&quot; approach to TK, and use no visualization whatsoever. Although that is quite obscure and not very descriptive, It is the easiest way to explain it. Also, it is imperitive that you experiment with multiple TK techniques to see which you are most successful at.
<br />

<br />
-Don't know of any Good TK books sorry.
<br />
-Best of luck to you with TK!

			I myself am still learning various techniques, but My guess would be that what works for one will not work for others, remember, this is YOUR mind you are trying to use.

as for chris angel, he may not be an actual magician in the classical sense, but the man is extremly talented with illusions, and should still be credited for it

			Martial artist is correct. Everybodys method is very unique to the person performing. All that matters is that it works for you.
