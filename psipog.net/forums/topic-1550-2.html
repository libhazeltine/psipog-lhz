			Now then, I took a look at the gallery in the CUFORT page, and the Tinely Park pictures dont seem like a alien craft at all, it seems like a normal airplane since they have lights on to make sure other crafts dont crash into them at night, this is also why more large and tall power lines have them as does large buildings like sky scrapers.
<br />

<br />
Granted it may have been a UFO to you, reminding everyone UFO is Unidentified Flying Object, given the fact you didnt know what it was... Is it a Alien Craft? I dont know, most likely not.
<br />

<br />
There are plenty of UFO's out there, but most of them are normal things that we just cant verify, and this is where I dont bite into most of the hype, people see a few stray lights in the sky and cry out &quot;Alien!&quot;. Untill an alien craft is verified in its fullness and not just some lights in the sky i'll stay to not believe the pictures, besides I dont sit well in beleiving in Flying Saucers...an idea spawned from early 1900's movies about aliens.  I do however believe alien crafts would be streamline but have a more pointed look, not a flying dish that spins.

Maybe originated in WH40k.. but perfected by blizzard in SC... Best RTS computer game ever.. hands down.. And that's why there is protoss orbiting the planet and not Tau.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

			I've seen a few UFOs, but more importantly, I've had close encounters of the third kind. More than once.

Aliens are real. As to what they look like, I can't say, because though the ones I came into contact with could physically affect the environment, they were invisible to my sight..... Wow.... does that sound crazy as shit er what?!

No less true for it, though.

			First off, telepathy doesn't rely on language at all, since you can communicate telepathically with people all over the world. It's also unproven that telepathy is caused by the brain, so brain structure and physiology don't matter either. (On a side note, I have played a telepathy game with a mentally retarded person, and they were actually pretty good.)
<br />

<br />
Now, I do believe in alien civizations, but I have something to say about most UFOs: flying saucers are actually made by the militaries of the earth. They are aerodynamic devices, for the most part, that use the coanda effect to lift themselves. Some other types are made of giant coils of wire that somehow levitate. It's bizarre but I've seen a scale model of a coil like that which ran off of house current. Aliens probably have vehicles too, but they would be way better than man-craft (funny word, eh?).

			So what does telepathy rely on, if not language? Emotions, images? An alien could be so different that neither of those would work really well. At least not untill we would learn how to communicate with them.

Actually, I think we would try to observe them, assuming that we were more technologically developed than them. I mean, to be able to study a new culture and a new species without having to intefere with them at all. That would be quite interesting.

In my years of doing research on the topic, meeting with witnesses and abductees, as well as reading ridiculous amounts of material, I have learned that 90% of all cases where an entity was involved had telepathy involved.  Often times described in different ways by different individuals, however to us, on this forum, it would be quite clear what it was.
<br />

<br />
Telepathy is always, always used when and if some sort of physical contact is about to take place between an abductee and an entity. 
<br />

<br />
Now whether or not you believe that they actually exist is a different story, and I am not trying to persuade anyone of believing one way or the other.
