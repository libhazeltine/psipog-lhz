			Okay, so it's Chakra here. I changed my name to reflect my new artistic realization (I am sorry for whatever implications this may cause). I thought that maybe a brief summary of how my pk started might help others and inspire  <img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
I started my freshman year of high school. I was into the paranormal. I used to practice NI's technique during my bio class, with a bit of a twist and would move paper during class time....when I should've been listening. Even though that doesn't matter because I got an A.....maybe a B if I can remember. But that's trivial.
<br />

<br />
Then I didn't practice much until I turned 18. I learned to bend metal after intense meditation on the heart chakra and moving the energy through basic psi manipulation.
<br />

<br />
Now I am 19 and practice pk about an hour a day. I shifted my technique to projecting psi, similar to Apollo's technique, from what I've heard. It works beautifully and I have been able to move pens and pencils with it. Most of my videos though, I am useing my old technique/NI's with a twist.
<br />

<br />
If anyone is interested I will gladly write out a more thorough technique.
<br />

<br />
I hope this helps people know me better, or at least my roots that are oriented in pk. At best inspire some...
<br />

<br />
Any comments?
<br />

<br />
P.S. Sorry if this is boreing to read, I would've put more zest into it and made it more thorough if it wasn't 12 30 am. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			Yeah, sure...I think it'd be beneficial to all people out there!
<br />
Btw, I hope that the technique would help me get past whatever obstacle that's hindering me... <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Thanks...

			For rolling things, what I do now is sit with my spine erect and use my head just as a way of guiding the energy. When I move my head down it pulls the pencil towards me and when I move my head up it pushes the said object away.
<br />

<br />
My hands are over the object and while doing this I try to feel out the object rolling as though it was in my hands. I suppose you could think of it like emanating psi. Trying to shift your consciousness to the pen or pencil helps.
<br />

<br />
I hope that helps!
