			I found a link to this site the other day and I'm glad I did.  Months ago I saw a show on TV where this guy did a bunch of tricks.  Real or not, one thing he did was fold a piece of paper and put it on a pin and cover it with a glass.  Suggested viewers try it, so I did.  I tried it for weeks........nothing.  Found this site last night and the psiwheel minus the glass.  WOW.  Within moments it had moved and slowly spun.  I don't know if it was removing the glass that also removed some mental thingy or the rest from trying.  I've been trying to roll a toothpick with no luck, but a tiny scrap of tissue suddered a couple times when I tried to move it today.
<br />

<br />
Some people seem to ask what other thought and what not so I'll answer before you ask.  I read a NI's articles and found them useful.  I get much better spin when I imagine the giddy feeling of success.
<br />

<br />
Along with my story I have the ritual question.  I spent a lot of time during the day trying to move that tiny scrap of tissue.  About noonish I really started to feel sick, kinda like being car-sick but not exactly.  This seemed centered just over my stomach rather than in it.  I stopped and it sort of went away, but when I got home from work I started playing with the wheel and the feeling returned.  Am I pushing too hard to fast or is it probably badly prepared cafe. food?  If it's me letting my excitement get the better of my judgement I guess I can pull back, but I'm just SOOO riding a wave right now.

			Maybe so mate, try and give it a rest for a day, especially if your new to this. Ensure you eat something and drink water or orange juice, PK burns energy, like anything else. Don't push yourself too hard <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

And welcome.
