			Heya people, i was trying to move a pencil using the psychokinesis without big results. Tired of seeing that pencil standing still something strange happened, i just had a talk with my subconscious! And i discovered he can be really dumb sometimes, here how it beginned.
<br />

<br />
(thinking to myself) ME &quot;Ooh come on move you f*king pencil!&quot;
<br />

<br />
(suddently) &quot;Man i'm tyred of this&quot;
<br />

<br />
ME &quot;... what's this, it'wasn't me thinking..&quot;
<br />

<br />
SC &quot;yes it was you, your inner yourself&quot;
<br />

<br />
ME &quot;... ... the subconscious?&quot;
<br />

<br />
SC &quot;Bingo man, bingo!&quot;
<br />

<br />
ME &quot;Cool! Now listen, if you are real tell me why the pencil is not moving&quot;
<br />

<br />
SC &quot;What the f*ck, u really think u can move things with your mind?Are you kidding?&quot;
<br />

<br />
ME &quot;Wait a minute you really think you don't believe in the Psychokinesis?&quot;
<br />

<br />
SC &quot;I don't know&quot;
<br />

<br />
ME &quot;Well then listen to me, if you don't know believe in me when i teel you that it is possible! We already moved that psywell last year, remember?&quot;
<br />

<br />
SC &quot;Yeah i remember&quot;
<br />

<br />
ME &quot;So trust me if i tell you that we can move this pencil. Are you with me?&quot;
<br />

<br />
SC &quot;Right on man, but i really don't remember how to move that&quot;
<br />

<br />
ME &quot;Don't worry, pratice will take care of that&quot;
<br />

<br />
SC &quot;Ok, let's try it!&quot;
<br />

<br />
What to say, the answers came out of my head by theyr own, it wasn't me thinking, it was like someone else was talking from my inside.
<br />

<br />
It was strange but fun and usefull, now i know that i can talk to my subconscious and correct him when he is wrong ( yeah i know it should be the opposite, but hey! No one is perfect!)!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

i think your concious mind is always talking to your subconcious and all you have to do is listen hard. when i listen hard enough its more like a drillion little emotions or feelings rather than words.
<br />

<br />
this gets me thinking about how people who ae deaf and can't speak think. when your just in a state of being without thinking outloud i think you'll notice that you dont think in words but in feelings. Its so hard to explain but its just sensations. or it is for me anyways

I've noticed that in me, I think, for the most part, in smileys. In emotions, which is what a smiley basically represents. It's just my being used to smileys to relate to emotions.

			Mine tends to go to &quot;right&quot; then to &quot;left&quot; then back to &quot;right&quot; then &quot;right&quot; again. And then to &quot;left&quot; again, and ending up at &quot;down&quot; but with a side trip to &quot;back&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Then I come to a smart emotional answer. This is pretty much how I think about things.

Read the two articles on psi pog. It's not really difficult, and I'm far from an expert. Just LISTEN. It's speaking to you anyway, but you take no notice. Ask yourself a question and wait for an answer; a feeling, a sound, an image. That's pretty much how everyone starts.

			I've been trying this for a bit, and discovered he has a better vocabulary than me! <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> He also speaks a lot clearer than I think, so that's convenient, and also one of the ways I know it's there.
