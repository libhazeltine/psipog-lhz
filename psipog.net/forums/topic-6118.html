			We all know (or should know) that particles are waves and waves are particles. And if you know a smattering of physics, or even had experience playing with waves in water, you will know that waves can interact with each other, reinforcing crests and troughs, or cancelling each other out, based on frequency and amplitude. Scientists have developed resonance in water to an art: they can draw letters using sophiticated wave generators.

So it hit me like a brick. Psychic energy could be utilized in the same manner.
<br />

Say you wanted to scan someone telepathically, but you don't want the other person to know about it (regular scanning techniques, at least mine, involve extending your own presence to wherever you want to get information about, and as most sensitives will tell you, this is quite obvious). All people give off their thoughts, even when shielded there is still a backround vibration that contains information. By focusing a certain way, almost like tuning a radio, one can pick up this information passively, as far as I've seen, mostly inconspicuously.
<br />

<br />
As another test to this, I took it to a completely different field, TK. I haven't done telekinesis in about a year, and I was never terrific at it. From a completely cold start, I focused on resonating with the psi wheel. Bam. Instant results. And it was way easier than 'trying to move it.' 
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure if this idea is utterly novel or groundbreaking, but it seems to hold water, and it has countless applications. Tell me what you think.

Right about the particles. Right about the PK. It's been proven in THOUSANDS of tests that resonating with the object/objects, will produce better results than forcing it to move. I just finished reading about it in the Holographic Universe. They gave many examples of hundreds of people doing hundreds of tests in controlled experiments, run by very respective people, and yes it was proven a long time ago. I can get you the examples and specific names if you'd like.

			Very, very interesting.  In fact, I have theorized that you may be able to pick up thoughts as if they were electronic frequencies.  We all (should) know that neurons and chemicals in the brain are what causes thought.  We (or some of us) also know that electricity travels as a longitudinal wave, more specifically, sound travels as a longitudinal wave.  If our thoughts are (basically, there are other variables) electricity, which travels in the same manner as sound broadcasted from a radio station, why can't we just &quot;tune&quot; into these thoughts as if (the brain) was a radio broadcaster, and the thoughts were music?  I'm sure there are outlying theories that debunk mine, but I still believe it is something to think about.

			I think I heard this over a dozen times before, and thought of it myself about 3 or more years ago. The only real big problem I keep coming up with that there was things that can block waves (as reflecting or absorbing). In electromangtic is easy to block off, but of cource we don't exactly know what psi is exactly do we?

I don't think its bad, but I don't think or feel right that its its right at all.
