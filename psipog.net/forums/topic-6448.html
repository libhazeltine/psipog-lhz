			The other day, at school, a very old friend of mine came up to me, I was on Psipog as usual...
<br />
He had also caught my brother on there in the past, and he laughed to see me believing in things like this as well as my brother. He and I were talking, and I eventually showed him some TK videos. He was intrigued. But he asked me something, something I didn't know the answer to. This is why I am here. The question he asked was: &quot;Why does it take so long to be able to do TK?&quot; 
<br />

<br />
I was shocked, I never really thought about it. The only explanation I came up with was the mind takes time to believe in it or it takes time for the mind to actual start doing something with your belief. But my explanation just doesn't suit me. Does anyone else know why it takes time to do TK?

			I think there are many reasons why it's so long.
<br />

<br />
First, you have to learn to believe.
<br />
Second, it's your subconscious who learn and it seem's that there is no manual for him. 
<br />
Third, your conscious thoughts, techniques and moments of discouragement can hidder the process.
<br />
Forth, your brain need time to develop the nervous system properly for the job.
<br />

<br />
Five, some of us are more naturaly talented for it.
<br />

<br />
Six, well...I don't know but there is probably a six and a seven and so on.

			Why does it take a baby so learn to learn to walk? Muscles have to strengthen, you have to become more coordinated and learn balance....TK is something like walking that you have to learn slowly and once it clicks it feels natural..

			Would two weeks be consider long?
<br />

<br />
Simple answer is, don't use it, lose it. Or lose most, like muscles basically. Treat it as rehabilitation for those that can't walk for years because of accidents.

			well you have to pretty much learn EVERYTHING don't you?
<br />

<br />
When your in your early years of life you learn to speak and walk wich are the most basic of things to do. PK is just another skill that you have to take time to learn. Maybe sometime in the deep future it'll come as naturaly as breathing but i doubt i'll live to see this

			Also, you're effectively ignoring reality. Or at least your perception of it. Really, that's what convincing yourself it's possible is. Kind of how dividing is the same as multiplying the reciprocal. Obviously, as those who've tried to ignore someone talking to you, (or at you), you need to do more than tell yourself said person isn't there.

			Psychokinesis is a new art, something humans have never set foot on before, many people have never heard of it, or only find it to be something in movies. So it takes so long because we are attempting to do something the human race has not yet evolved into doing. So we have to force out minds to see that we can do this, and that it is real, despite all doubts.
<br />

<br />
What we are doing is really only the beginning, I know there is much, much more out there we have to learn about all this, and it will take a looonnnggg ass time, because we don't know it's there, we have to discover it.

			Well <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ,this is just a detailed reply of BELIEVING in something.I don't know if someone has already posted this.My reply is that :-
<br />

<br />
When a baby is born and grows into the age limit 5-10,he is innocent and really BELIVES most of the things said by his trusted ones like his parents.So,when he asks his parents about  things such as ghosts,myths or legends (here,its about tk) the most probable answer from his parents to that question would be &quot;Son,its all FAKE.Don't believe it.These are made for other purposes&quot;Thus the child believes it.This answer will be in his mind for a LONG LONG time until he realizes the truth.I am not saying that his parents are absolutely wrong, but why they replied in such a way?Because they too were children sometime  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  .This belief in the child's  mind throbs and becomes an anti-force that prevents him from believing and doing tk.
<br />

<br />
We all were (or are) children sometime.So,this belief is in our minds too.And it takes time to overcome this belief.NI in his blog says that everyone needs to have a FLEXIBLE belief system.This is why he said this.
<br />

<br />
And somefatguy,
<br />
please ask your old friend if he belives in god ?If he does,ask him to try forgetting God.And if does not,ask him to try beliving in God.After having a personal practical experience,he will be satisfied why it takes so LONG.
<br />

<br />
Well,thats all I can say about it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Considering how much little time I needed to make it, I think it just the time it takes for you to learn to project your energy and to make it do what you want it to do. Why it was fast to me? I always dreamed about it since I saw something like that (probably from a movie) and always felt how it was like. I always dream about levitation too, but I didn't got enough courage to try it as hard as I did with TK  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
