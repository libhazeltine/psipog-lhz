			I agree with you, Apollo. Our mind perceives weight, barriers, and size as a limit to our ability. However, one can learn to dispel or overcome these notions. 
<br />

<br />
Imagine that from a young age that you grew up in an environment in which you were taught about meditation and psi-energy. Would your mindset of the world around you be very different? Of course! As human beings, we find it much easier to learn things, than to unlearn and overcome them. Many people spend their entire lives battling things such as stress, fear, and anxieties. 
<br />

<br />
I imagine most people's psi training is progressive. Once you first start up on the psi-wheel, it will be difficult because it's an entirely new concept. Once you get the hang of it and you progress onto other objects, you will get more and more comfortable as you move heavier and larger objects. While yes, you cannot go from the psi-wheel to a boulder, but I'm sure once you master a few objects; you will become more comfortable and confident in moving other objects. As with all things, you will progress from a novice to a master.

			one problem with your theory of if someone grows up with psi is this:
<br />

<br />
If the person ever pushed/picked up anything in their life then they would know what weight is.  They would see that pushing a light object is easier than pushing a heavy object.  Yes, they would understand that weight has no effect to tk but they would know that it is harder to move heavy things.  When they go on to try something new, that knowledge will popup and will effect them.

			While that is very true, one who grows with a background in psi, will be more familiar with it and would have an easier time overcoming their perception of weight. 
<br />

<br />
However, what I'm trying to get to is that psi is a progressive learning in which you get better and better and you get faster at adapting to new situations as you get more experience.
<br />

<br />
The best example I can think of is of someone who plays fighting or strategy games (Street Fighter, Starcraft, etc). When they first start, they are inexperienced and when they are approached by an unknown strategy, they're stumped. When one gains experience, confidence, and comfort in their skills, then they have an easier time to adapt to a new situation that they have not experienced before. The best players who have mastered these games can recognize and analyze an opponent strategy immensely faster than a novice player. 
<br />

<br />
With their experience comes the ability to adapt faster to new situations, which I believe is possible with psi as well.

			i thought that we have limits in tk but what Apollo and Vileru said mean that we dont have limits and it maybe right but if that true then first step we need is just move the psi wheel to believe in tk then the next step we need is that we try by all costs and all ways to remove from our minds the idea of size and weight so we will be experts in tk and can move anything in the world .
<br />

<br />
back to the main questions :
<br />

<br />
1. why do you want to have telekinesis?
<br />

<br />
ofcours it is cool and i believed that we can do telekinesis before i do it or maybe it was my desire that make me think so and i like that stuffs , looking forward to levitate myself and fly <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
2. and do you think we have limits? move a car? a person? or just little things? 
<br />

<br />
i realy dont know i dont have enough informations to say we have limits or not but my personal thoughts i think we have limits and they are temporary you can remove that limits by practice and when you become better and passed that limits you will go to the next higher temporary limits and every new higher limits will be harder to pass .

My support for what i have said is the story of Neveza.  He never started on the psiwheel and yet can move trashcans.  That shows something there!

			yea i thought about that too that there are fumos people with tk and they can do strong tk can bend spoons and do other stuff better then psi wheel , my idea is that they done that before they practice or they practiced first then reached to that level .
<br />

<br />
but there is other idea is that some people are strong by natural and other people are weak by natural . so that is confusing .
<br />

<br />
edit: by the way some other stuff happen to us like when you get very angry then say shut up or other thing then in the same time the electristy cut off that happened to me like 5 or 4 times so i tell myself did i done that or it was coincedant , and i say it happened to me alot it cant be coincedant then i say i only move the psi wheel how i can make the electristy cut off . 
<br />

<br />
so i still dont know if we have limits or we dont .

One day, there will have to be ethical limits imposed on psionics when people are able to murder with psi, or push the earth out of orbit etc, but hopefully by then we will all be living in a far more spiritual society.
