No on travis......I wear a dark brown tanktop but only because its one of my only cloths. I have some more cloths on because its cold now. I don't really have that much muscle, I guess if you count my size I could be strong.

I'm 6 foot 5......so your a little off. I do indeed have BDU boots. But no strips...where you get that? I have run down shoes....never was big on shoes no sure if they can be skater. To be prefectly honest I think your starting to descreb my buff up white tanktop guy on my Grand theif auto on my xbox.  Which makes sense which that is the really thing I was playing when you gave this silly prediction.

I give you some credit. But to be honest that could have been more coindence. I don't think your good because your short of hitting other things...I do think I should ask you incase I like to know some videogame cheat codes. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
