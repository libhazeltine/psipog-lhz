			Some gov't aggency came up with something that was showing some really good results in helping ADD.  It was a Biofeedback Helmet that you plug into a PS2 and then you have a choice of a few different games such as ATV Off-Road Fury.  What it does is train your mind to pay attention.  When your not paying full attention to the game you have less contol of the car or what not.  I didn't get a chance to play with it though....the other game, Wild Divine was way cooler.

Strange experience:
<br />

<br />
yesterday when i woke up, I decided i'll go back to my bed and try out some MM.  So I did so.  And all of a sudden the wind from my fan felt like it intesified and it kinda got cold.  It was a indescribable feeling but i tried to hold on it for as long as possible.  So after it passed, I meditated for a lil longer and looked over at my clock and a hour passed by if what felt like 10 mins!!
<br />

<br />
cool stuff

			Yes if you do this on a regular base. You see, after this meditation, you feel a lightness and a clearness within, unlike normal. You have much more control over your mind and its thoughts. Because the mind has become serene, you can communicate with your subconscious mind better.

			Ok nice, continue to meditate like this every day if you can. Everytime you will be able to go deeper because your mind gets clearer at each try. Eventually you will be able to dive inwards so to say with a totally one-pointed mind, and you will experience the Depths of your Self.

			It's nice to see this thread back up and running. I kinda did some Motionless Meditation last night, but I was aiming for an OBE really. But Peebrain's technique is almost the same.

			I think motionless meditation is cool, because everything that you experience is in some way yourself, taken the presumption that you can only experience subjectively which i think is elemental. So motionless meditation lets you experience yourself better not being distracted that much from &quot;outside&quot; influences. 
<br />

<br />
Becoming used to this practice i think you can focus your mind on anything you want, making you capable of diving through your mind 
<br />
and see every part of it which is in the end yourself.
<br />

<br />
I think it's amazing what you can learn through meditation and how it
<br />
can alter your general awareness and way of thinking too. For me i can
<br />
say meditation led me to seeing more clearly in every way. I could maybe go on forever, but i prefer just saying it short. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Wow i completely forgot about this thread. Well my goal when I first heard of this was 2 hours and I did it my 2nd time (1st time i quit after about an hour). But you decribed it great Martial when you said you don't even WANT to stop after that...you just feel like laying there forever..(I'm on my back..my legs fall asleep any other way)If my mom didn't open my door and hit my foot i think I would've went all night!.....well mabye not all night lol. It's great to test your will power...I like the feeling of not being able to feel your body..like you visualize your limbs in any position, and it really feels like they're there, even though you haven't moved at all...awesome....next one=5 hours minumum i'll let you know how it goes...hopefully I'll OBE
<br />

<br />
P.S I read something someone said about the half lotus position, and FYI it's not regular cross legged position...its your left foot on top of your right thigh, and your right foot UNDER your left thigh..the only change in the full lotus is the right foot comes from underneath to rest ON TOP of your left thigh...almost same thing but much easier

			Ok nice, let me know how your 5-hour meditation goes.
<br />

<br />
About the postures, here is the padm&#257;sanam posture (or full lotus):
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://www.shamballa.nl/padmasana.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Here is the Ardha padm&#257;sanam (or half lotus):
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://www.omcentrum.cz/cesky/joga_108/sv_sarasvati/ardha_padmasana.jpg" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Here is the cross-legged posture:
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://www.lavida.com.au/upload/product_img/BC1003.jpg" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Note that the Padm&#257;sanam (english: Padmasana) posture is sometimes referred to as Cross-legged Lotus or names like: &quot;The cross-legged Padmasana.&quot; That is of course because you do in fact cross your legs in full lotus posture as well as in the ordinairy cross-legged position.
