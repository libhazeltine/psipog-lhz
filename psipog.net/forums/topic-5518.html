			Well for some reason i was thinking that children have more phenomenon than adults, so i decided to talk to this kid about his dreams. Well for one he said hes had dreams where hes lucid and he said that he once had a dream where his father killed some geese, and the next day thats exactly what happend just like in his dream. The boy was like about 5 or 6 years old. 
<br />

<br />
 Ive been thinking that the dream about the geese being killed wasnt a dream, that he got it from astral projection, everyone astral projects at night and ppl say that ppl can get sight of future and past, so i think that if someone gets a precog dream its from astral projection. Oh and that makes me think of dejavu, i think dejavu is a moment that u have seen from a dream and its very familiar.

			Your saying that when you astral project you can see the future (maybe the past) of the area your in?

			ooookay? so is this like an informative guess or what? deja vu is just that to see again. dunno where you have seen it from, but you have seen it before. and ususally the situation turns out diffrently than what youve seen before. so it must be a glitch in the matrix.

A friend of my mom's has a little boy, and one day the boy came up to her and put his ear on her stomache and said &quot;Mom, theres a baby in there&quot;..and of course the mom was like &quot;Yeah, sure there is...blah blah blah&quot;...Then the next day the boy comes up adn says the same thing &quot;mom, theres a baby in there&quot;  and his mom said &quot;No, theres no baby in there&quot; and the boy said &quot;Yes there is...its a baby girl, a baby sarah&quot;...and the mom said &quot;You mean your cousin sarah&quot;, and the boy said &quot;No mommy, this is a differant baby&quot;
