			A few days ago, I was working at my new job. A farm.
<br />

<br />
Needless to say, it was rather hot out, and the work added to my feeling of being hot. I was standing at this big huge bucket thinger watering some horses and I was really needing a breaze. Well, I got one. It may have been coincidance, it may have not been. But I decided to test that out.
<br />

<br />
When the air was calm again, I concentrated on moving more air towards me from the direction the wind had come from. After a short while, I began to feel a breaze again. I focused on stopping it, and the moving air slowed to a stop. I didnt really use any visualisation, just concentration. Unless you count visualising and willing the air to move, or not move, where I wanted.
<br />

<br />
I continued to practice it. Even trying it up in the oh so hot haylofts where there was no air movement at all. I managed to get a breaze even up there, in the barn, up in a hay loft. I don't know if I brought it in from a nearby window, or from one of the huge sliding doors on the ground level, but I managed to get a tiny breaze while up there. I did this multiple times, stopping what I was doing every so often and making a breaze to help cool me down a bit.
<br />

<br />
Yesterday when I was working, it rained part of the time I was working. It was heavy for a while, but as I was going to go out of the barn to dump a wheelbarrow of manure in a manure pile, the rain lightened up. It was still raining, but it wasn't too bad anymore. When I went back inside it got heavy again. And light again when I went to go back out. After I went back in, it didnt get heavy again right away, but it did eventually.
<br />

<br />
Figuring that this meant I wasn't only limited to wind, I decided to test this too. I stood at the entrance to the barn and focused. I focused on the rain drops, trying to focus on all of them and visualise them being smaller, and being less in number. Sure enough, the rain began to gradually get less and less until it was a light rain again. Someone saw me standing there and I had to go back to work. I tried to get it to rain heavy again while I was doing my work, but I couldnt. The rain eventually became a sprinkle, and while I was still working, like a half hour to an hour later, it stopped altogether.
<br />

<br />
I could 'feel' what I was doing in both of these. Feel myself kinda pull the air for a breaze and kinda stop it to make it stop. And I could feel myself exert something on the rain and the sky as well when I made the rain lighten up. Though when these things happened before I tested them out for the first times, I actually couldnt feel anything out of the ordinary.
<br />

<br />
When I did the breaze, I could feel myself exerting some sort of force on the wind, in the direction I wanted it to go. When it comes to lightening the rain, I could feel myself exert an upward force into the sky, if you will. I was unsuccessful in making it rain heavier again.

			thats really cool, you should keep practicing that but be careful how much you practice and how big of an area because changing the weather her may mean starting a drought in africa. though probally not that drastic. you should look up something called the elijah factor its about people who can manipulate the weather i have stopped the rain once after meditating outside it is a strange feeling.

			yea. far shot. 
<br />

<br />
next time imagine or visualize or lets pretend whattever that the wind is coming from the OPPOSITE direction than it is on the forecast. then it would be you manipulating it.
<br />

<br />
i can also tell you when rain is going to end.. any day. when it makes more and more bubbles when it hits the water.

			i can move air too and make it strong when it is only slight movement of air or no movement and sometimes i can make that air last for long time more then 20 seconds or maybe less <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> , before i did not thought i could do it but i realy find it easy to be done , maybe you need more information , i tried to move the air when i read <a href="http://www.uyta.com" target="_blank">www.uyta.com</a> it is good site and have other opint of view and i experienced it before and believe it is good site and good forum.

			I know I know. This topic is waaaay old. You know me and my periods of inactivity.
<br />

<br />
Well anyway, I'd just like to say that although I havn't done anymore practice on the rain, I can say, with confidance, that I can influence the wind move in the opposite direction it came from.
<br />

<br />
When I attempt this, I concentrate on a 'force', if you will, outside my body. Concentrate on making one anyway, I sort of feel myself get a &quot;hold&quot; of the wind press against this &quot;hold&quot; to try to send it the other way. Eventually, the wind gradually slows down as you gradually succeed in moving it with that &quot;hold&quot; or &quot;grip&quot; you've got on it. Eventually, if you keep up the force against it, it'll begin to blow in the other direction.
<br />

<br />
Not only do you get that result, but usually the wind picks up with a gust rather than gradually. Even if you fail to get it to go the other way, it'll come back with a gust that you can definately feel. Or at least thats what has happened to me.
<br />

<br />
Try it out sometime. If you're sceptic, don't disprove it to me. Test it yourself.
