			It's a pretty good book.  In fact, I wrote a review of it on that amazon.com page a while ago ( <a href="http://tinyurl.com/qtwnf" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/qtwnf</a> ).

Cool Idea, but Where is the Correct Skepticism?, June 26, 2004

Ok, the book is really great, first of all. It has just countless paranormal experiences and explains them using the &quot;holographic universe&quot; point of view. Great idea, awesome analogy, and amazing stories...
<br />

<br />
One story in particular just blew my mind. On page 150 (soft cover), it talks about this guy, Sai Baba. The book claims Sai Baba could actually create any object he wanted and it would flow from his hands. It spent 4 pages on stuff Sai Baba has done, and how it's been confirmed. This intrigued me so much, I did a simple Google on &quot;Sai Baba&quot;. After maybe 5 minutes of research, I found a website that had videos of Sai Baba producing random objects, and the videos were SOLID PROOF that Sai Baba is a fake. Not only a magician, but a terriable magician!
<br />

<br />
The book presented his knowledge with such enthusiasm that I believed it. Only after some basic research did I realize it wasn't true. It seems like the author didn't set his skepticism level high enough, and just took ANY paranormal story he could get his hands on, and printed it in his own &quot;hologram&quot; perspective to try and prove his point. I feel very cheated! What other stories in the book are completely false, I wonder?
<br />

<br />
Overall: awesome idea of reality, and mind blowing, but c'mon! How hard is it to do some basic research?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

			Just did a quick search on him, and he's got quite the following.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Anyway, that is interested and does make me a bit skeptical about the book, however I'm more interested in the ideas than the actual (or otherwise) &quot;magic&quot; described in it.
