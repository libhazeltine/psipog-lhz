			<span style="color: orange"></span>I am kind of confused about why you'd want to obe instead because lucid dreams allow you to hear things and also I've heard about people seeing things in the phisical world. so if someone could clear things up for me <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> that would be great.

			OOBE's are generally described as more &quot;real&quot; then lucid dreams. Some people think that lucid dreams are another version of the OOBE, and some people discount OOBE's as lucid dreams. The line between them is very blurry. OOBE's tend to be a more powerful experience though, because the feeling of leaving your body is rather powerful. 
<br />

<br />
Also, many people would dispute that you actually see the real world with OOBE's. Experimenters with OOBEs claim to be able to do it, but even then it is very unreliable and subjective. For example, Monroe describes going out of body and visiting a friend’s house, where he said he witnessed his friend’s wife &quot;dealing oversized playing cards onto the table.&quot; Naturally that seems odd. He asked them what they were doing at that time, and it turned out she was sorting the mail. 
<br />

<br />
In lucid dreams, you can control the environment, even though it is usually not very concrete and changes whenever you look away. Dreams are very likely to change without warning or reason. OOBEs are not.

			Lucid dreams are (to the best of my knowledge) accepted to be real by science. OBEs aren't. OBEs might not be real (which is what I believe).

As to DanialH's post. I will personally gut anybody who argues with him--in this thread. There is already a thread for arguing about that. It is here:

			madhatter: I'm in salem <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />, i've been to newport before, but I can't really imagine being so close to the cost year round. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
anyway, I won't argue with danielH, but I will note that it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">very</span> differnt experiencing an OBE and experiencing a lucid dream. wether the obe is real or not it is pretty awsome when it happens.
