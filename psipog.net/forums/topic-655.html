			Hmmmm she hasn't mentioned chakras, the threefold law, &quot;pure of heart blah blah blah...&quot; or anything like that...

She even said that she believes anyone can learn.

			well I know sylvia is fake, but I think she believes herself to be real, and... most of the time she gets people's descriptions right, on the other hand, she is also very arrogant, and she seems to have a chronic sore throat, she needs to get that checked.
<br />

<br />
Honestly, I really don't blame all the fake psychics for using it to get rich, after all, it's like the biggest cash cow in the history of history.

			The telepath sounds pretty knowledgeable and seems to be real in my perspective. There are very few cases where public psychics are authentic, and she seems like one to me, to an extent.
<br />

<br />
The only thing that is questionable for me is the whole...mosquitos don't listen, bees are interesting...stuff. That part gives me the impression of a little over-dramatism, but at least she doesn't dramatize as much as a certain someone. Sylvia Browne is not only an awful psychic, but also an awful writer. I've read one of her books (Life on the Other Side: A Psychic's Tour of the Afterlife) and I can summarize it as this: The first half of the book was a combination of idiocy and horrible fluff that literally made me feel ill. The second half of the book consisted of <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">huge</span></span> amounts of diarrhea in the form of words.

			I think its probably possible....

Reason 1: Its telepathy. ALL ANIMALS HAVE A BRAIN! Telepathy is communication through thoughts....
<br />

<br />
Reason 2: I have heard from different sources like its just like flipping a switch, going to the right channel or something in your mind so you can hear them.

I remember reading something along those lines. Just read an animal's thoughts like you would a person.

It could be useful. Telepathically call your dog over, instead of using English, for example. Of course, if I tried it with one of my dogs, they'd probably still ignore me and not move.

			are animals capable of speech? I mean physically, not mentally. I.E. Can an animal make all the sounds we can?

<br />
umm... I think that animals think in feelings, not language (except the few words we train them to.)
