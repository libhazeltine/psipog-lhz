Where did you see that? It's funny because calling me not fat is an insult to me. So I am actually kind of insulted with you calling me not fat.

I am pretty short, but I am not definite of my height...give or take 5 feet. You don't have to be sorry, you didn't know, how could you? How would you know that someone would be insulted calling them not fat? I accepted my fatness so much that I like it and appreciate it is all. Many other fat people get insulted about it, but if you admit you are fat, what can others say? Sorry to be even more perplexing but, I do get insulted when people call me fat with feeling and anger. I can feel their insult with the fat, people who know me just call me fat happily and jokingly with a nice tone. There is this one ass at my school who has called me names before and he is the only person I have met in years to make me so angry. He doesn't even know my name!

			They have a ritual of going outside at 2:00 am in the middle of the winter in their underwear and pouring cold buckets of water on their head.

<br />
I shall be witnessing (helping out) at a ritual about the same which will include the buckets of water and pouring them over their head (although its not winter) in about a week.
<br />

<br />
This ritual lasts for about a week and they do meditations the whole time.

You won't believe how many things go on that no one knows about. Do a little looking and you will find many types of Buddhists in most places.
<br />

<br />
The type of Buddhism that I referring to that does this ritual is a Japanese buddhism called Tendai. The mikkyo buddhists do rituals such as these. 
<br />
Mikkyo is a esoteric buddism.
<br />

<br />
The ritual I will be helping out is actually going to include priests from all over America.

			Is there anything written down about buddhism and psychic phenomena like telekensis, levitation, etc? I know supposedly hindu yogis can become invisible when you've attained certain levels of the mind, i think. I know in china and japan they talk a lot about chi/ki.

			That's a good question. I have not come across much info on buddhism and extraordinairy phenomena. I get the impression that Buddhism is all about universal love, rather than that it focusses on the attainments (powers) one can get on it's path of dedication. So for that, you can better search into hinduism and Yoga. But this is getting kind of religious, so you'll just have to use google a bit more then.

			Well i did hear of one thing on the internet about chi and telepathic suggestion. I think it was written either by sun tzu or lao tse i think. It talked about how chi could be used to make men think that there was nothing there on the battlefield. On the present point i'm trying to look for the article but no success yet.

MA</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">NO! AHHH!!! Buddhism is not about universal love; at its core. Universal love is a religious control factor like the ten commandments. Buddhist monks meditate to reach enlightenment, a higher state of consciousness, complete understanding. I hate those stories about buddhist monks who can do crazy shit while meditating. That's not the point of meditating. Also buddhism is not a religion. If you take away it's control factors like universal love and shit that are just there to keep soceity in check you do not get a religion. Universal love is helpful but not a core of buddhism.  
<br />

<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if buddhist monks could do that. I believe you can heal almost any illness with meditation. Like cancer that your body does not recogonize as cancer. You could find some way to make your body realize these cells are bad and tell your immune system to kill them.

			For the sake of not spredding half truths.  Buddhism IS a religion, take away it's life after death, it's enlightenment, and a few other obvious religious factors and it's a highly respectable philosophy.  And Compasion(unconditional love) is a buddhist factor.

			Niushirra, Universal love is not a rule meant to control people. It is an experience in those higher states of consicousness. That is why I said that that is their goal. They dont focus on skills like levitation. They focus on enlightenment, oneness of all: Universal love.
