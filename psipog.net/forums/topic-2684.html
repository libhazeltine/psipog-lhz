			I've never really given up.... just stopped for a while to work on other skills.  If I DO have a bad day for TK, I just tell myself that the only reason was because I had an &quot;off&quot; day.

I find that using foil is bad because it reacts with the heat in your hands. Try paper not foil. It is not PK or TK if you move it on a psiwheel.

			I was irritated by the Pin-wheel as a response to it, I decided to end it 
<br />
all,so I wadded up paper into a ball. 
<br />

<br />
Put it in my right hand. Forced as much energy as I could to make it levitate. 
<br />

<br />
Eventually, My hand became extremly numb, I couldn't feel it...I just dragged it around for a bit. 
<br />

<br />
Next few days, I could slide objects after that.

			i find that in my experience with psi, the time were your just about to give up, is the time that results start to show. be very mindful about what happens when you start to feel like giving up.

			there have been some frustrating times with pk.  but i believe whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  same with pk.  whenever you're in a slump or make a mistake, you gain knowledge and should have more drive to accomplish the task.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />   there have been times when i couldn't spin my psi-wheel and i would just give it a rest for a day.  the next day i told myself i could do it, i've done it hundreds of times before.  that gave me the confidence not to give up.  sure as shit, the next time i tried, i could spin it just as well as before.  if you give up on something that no one truly knows about, that's just one step back from finding out more on that thing.  you never know, maybe if someone that quit would have never quitted, they might have been able to move a chair.  it's possible; we don't know everything about psionics.  as long as we all keep pressing on, we will keep getting closer to understanding psionics.  that's the goal we should be aiming for  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.

I actually did give up. But since I read what Ahmed wrote, I think I'm gonna restart. I wont give up this time though. Is it better to do it with or with out needle?

			I never really got to that stage, probably becasue I didn't have enough time to get to it, but I have had a few moments afterwards an recentely when I couldn't move it. Can be frustarting, and makes me just think, what if I am imagining this?? Like just now for example, it won't budge. But 10 mins ago it was spinning away happily like there wasn't a care in the wolrd. I really don't get why it does that.
