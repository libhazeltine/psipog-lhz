As far as evil spirits and the such... I believe they exist but I think there are certain conditions by which they can effect people. I believe that for evil things to effect you, you have to be afraid/looking for them. Like in meliak's post, he said as soon as his anxiety went away the thing did too. I have felt the same type of anxiety and can easily imagin something behind me or in my room, but as soon as I get rid of it, nothing ever happens. There is no monster standing there, its all in my imgination. Not to say that it always is peoples imaginations, but I think they play off it if that makes sense. I think that if you are fearless of them, then they wont bother you. Don't worry about evil things and you wont be bothered.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

well its not really spirits and whatnot controlling me...its pure anger but I learned to keep myself calm a long time ago and sometimes I dont relize that im about to kill someone until my sort of alarm system kicks in where my reflexs wont work unless i allow them to....

			Well, i got a lot of interesting replies to my post. More than I expected. I did not wish to put my opinions or ideas regarding my experiences because i did not wish to subjugate my post repliees in any way. So now i'll mention my own personal theories on my experiences and evil entities in general.

Not to use this post as a key referral point or anything. It's just the first one that caught my eye, and then i went on to read other posts having to do with the end of the mayan calender, etc.
<br />

<br />
I personally believe that something big is going to go down in the first half of the 21st century. Something monumental, like right out of a science fiction movie or horror film, or some other crap like that. And I believe that the end of the mayan calender is a clue to the beginning of the monumental occurance in question. There's also another movement. The 11:11 gateway movement. These people believe that the numbers 11:11 and their significance are embedded into our cellular memory banks (a common part of everyone's genetics or whatever). They believe that a dual reality (the conscious and subconscious mind, the physical waking world, and astral plane, etc) is merging into one single greater reality, and that we and all things around us are going through the process of becoming &quot;one&quot; whatever that means.
<br />

<br />
They believe the final 11:11 gate will open on November 11, 2011.
<br />

<br />
This date is very close to the mayan calender's ending date of december 21, 2012. Perhaps one or another of these are slightly in error, but both are still very close together.
<br />

<br />
I personally am not sure what to believe, but I ever since i first read up on this stuff (not too long after my first encounter with the shadow beings) I've been obsessed with it. Almost unwillingly obsessed. When I read about those types of things (mayans and their calender, egyptians, 11:11 nutbars, etc), something just feels &quot;accurate&quot; regarding those things, in my mind. I dunno how else to describe it.
<br />

<br />
When i focus on the bigger picture of the way people are acting today, and the way history has been unfolding for the past few decades, it's almost like I can &quot;sense&quot; the change in everyone's being. They're thinking differently than they used to. More people are thinking in more radical ways, sometimes to the point of absurdity. Many times to that point. To me, I see these changes in a way more associable with the way a gradual &quot;mass shift&quot; in all human consciousness might look, viewed from a particular point.
<br />

<br />
I don't know anything regarding such, for sure. All I DO know, is that I've got a really strong feeling regarding the whole 2011-2012 bit.

I would be asleep each time, and then sort of &quot;semi&quot; wake up. Like, my conscious, waking mind seemed to be at around 90% capacity, with a little bit of confusion in the back of my mind, but calm regardless.
<br />

<br />
One time of those two, I didn't even open my eyes, I just became aware of my five senses again (could feel my body lying on bed, smell what the pillow smelled like, hear clock tickin, etc) And I heard a voice, that seemed to be right by my ear (but not in my head) and it said &quot;soooon. Sooonnn the 12 years will be complete, and we will have it&quot; Not sure about last lines. The &quot;soon&quot; and &quot;12 years will be complete&quot; im positive of.
<br />
This voice sounded extremely menacing, deep and booming and non human sounding.
<br />

<br />
The second time I remember, it was the same voice. It sounded like it was coming from over by a shelf in my room. I woke up, and had my eyes closed, but I could see the room I was in through my eyelids. I think it may have been a mental copy, because when I looked around, it seemed to take an extra split second for the scene to alter the position correctly, and the visuals seemed not quite like when my eyes are open. More washed out looking.
<br />

<br />
The voice said &quot;Foooocuuuusss... Foooccuuss... Yesss.. Foocusss.. *evil maniacal laughter* yesssss. YESSSSS.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Well after hearing that I realized I wasn't opening my eyelids because I couldn't. It seemed like I was being held there like that. I struggled, and instinctively concentrated on my midsection, in the solar plexus. I'm not sure what mental process I went through to do this, but I felt a huge welling of energy form there and I sort of &quot;burst&quot; awake. I was sweating, it was fucked. Especially considering prior similar life experiences.

I think someone has a little overactive imagination. Yeah how many times do you hear that on movies?

fuck I'm just going to say it: I don't believe you.

I have no proof against or in favor of what you said so I'm not judging you...just displaying my point.
<br />

<br />
In other circumstances (like when no one replies) I'd try and write this message and then add &quot;IF its true....&quot; simply because setting all reason aside you might actually be telling the truth. But you've got enough help &quot;if its true&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
As for the whole precognition thing with all the 2012 stuff. Been there heard that. Yeah just like the world collapsed in June 2005. That was proof that precognition can be very unaccurate and the far future isn't determined yet (in my theory).....branches of what it could be are but anyway the hell with it. I just said it straight: I don't believe you. end of story for me.

The board rules say : be a healthy sceptic (or something like that) and that's just what i'm being here.

It may be from an unknown force though, as I am certain by even 2011 you and everyone alike will KNOW the Earth is in some serious trouble.

Its really weird because this also strikes me as accurate.... First let me say that one of my specialties is a prediction of the close future (I unwillingly predict what happens within a half an hour and i am correct about 8/10 times)
<br />

<br />
and when i think about the ending of the world in 2011-2012 i feel like i feel when i predict whats gonna happen in the next ten minutes...it kinda freaks me out because I feel so accurate about it
<br />

<br />
Lets just hope that the 20% inaccuracy of me is gonna happen in 2011-2012

it is also kinda scary because i graduate high school in 2011 (that would suck to go through learning and then *BANG* &quot;bye-bye world!&quot;!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> )

			Reading all these opinions and what not has really been interesting to say the least, definetly gives an array of thoughts, but i'll toss in my two cents just for hoots and hollars (boy, when has that been used in a forum, eh?).
<br />

<br />
The world ending in 2011-2012? I have no real opinion either way, it is very possible with todays modern tensions between countries and the readily available weapons of mass destruction almost every developed county has, nuclear ICBMs and the likes, now is someone stupid enough to fire one and trigger a domino effect that will throw the earth into nuclear winter? Sad to say its likely, when this will happen? I dont know.
<br />

<br />
I do beleive big change is coming, but this is not in context to a sort of worldwide thing, rebels are becoming ever the popular things and I myself have been described as a rebel, which honestly I take as a compliment given to me rebel is one of the most beautiful words in the english language, though im sure I trailed off with this whole segmant given it has little to do with the main topic.
<br />

<br />
All in all I will side with the imagination thing since its easy to scare yourself silly and get the feelings of something behind you just by thinking it, imagination is a very powerful tool of the human mind, but it can trick you. The year thing though, I dont know, I have an odd feeling when I read all this and saw the numbers, but I have no idea what it means if its positive or negative, i'll have to dig a bit deeper on all these 'theories' then throw my hat into the ring on precognitive skills.

From my personal reading experience, the Mayans did not see an &quot;end to the world&quot; in 2012, but an &quot;end to the world as we know it&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
IE: physical world destruction, but higher spiritual consciousness.

And I do infact think something big will happen, but I don't think &quot;it&quot; will happen to everyone.

			Notwithstanding that 'end of the world' stuff has come about before several times in history and caused mass hysteria among the population (for example, at the dawn of 1000 A.D), I really think there's nothing to worry about. You see, if the world is set to end, there's probably not exactly much we can do to stop it. So sit back and enjoy the ride! Otherwise...voices like that, especially 'evil manaical laughter' as you suggested, is unlike any credible experience I have ever heard of. If it continues, I'd suggest consulting a psychotherapist or a neurologist.

			i agree with you, people act like the old saying &quot;when in worry or in doubt, run in circle scream and shout&quot; will keep the world from ending...personally i think we will destroy it from some big experiment or something....
