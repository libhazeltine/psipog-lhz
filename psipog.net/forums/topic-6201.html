			Hey all
<br />

<br />
When i'm practising telekinesis and i'm focusing on my desired object, i go into a state where i see different colours everywhere (red, blue green, yellow mainly) and i feel like i'm comnig out of my body. I also feel immense energy outside my body, and everything becomes hazy. I tried to keep it up for longer than i usually do (a few seconds) yesterday, and it became even more colourful and i felt like i was really leaving my body and getting up, but when i blinked i was still on the chair. 
<br />

<br />
This could be the beginnings of an OBE, but i thought it might be some kind of trance. 
<br />

<br />
Help/replies appreciated
<br />

			I recognise the state you describe. I stay in it for long periods of time. Indeed, when practicing telekinesis one easily slips into that state in which everything becomes hazy and colours start to appear. I have never OBE'd from this state though. I recognise the lightness and transparentness you describe, though it never brought me an OBE this way. But then again, I never tried it from that state, I just enjoy the peace and tranquility. Im pretty sure that that from this state it should be much easier to OBE than normal, but then you should try it with that intention.

			Thanks for the info guys
<br />

<br />
but what is the point of it? Is it simply a state to relax in, or does it affect your PK ability? What exactly does the state do, and what does it induce?

			I think it enhances every ability a little bit, because, in my experience, I become much more unattached to the result of my actions. Therefore, succes becomes reality much easier and without struggle. It is just a peaceful state of mind which you should enjoy for the time it lasts, so you can prolonge its presence. It develops your aura vision much faster also. 
<br />

So it is a state to realx in yes, and I believe it enhances your pk ability as well.
