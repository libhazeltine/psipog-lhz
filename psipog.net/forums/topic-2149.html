			Well what exactly is it telling you? If it's just random thoughts and things your just not keeping focus' and need to clear your mind better and more, then keep that focus, but it could be verified much easier if you gave us some specifics and examples of what it &quot;says&quot;.

			No no shadow, he is just talking to himself, using his concsious mind.
<br />

<br />
My advice is: Stop. Put on some quiet music, really quiet, so you really have to really focus to hear it. Listen to the music for a while, you'll notice, that your conscious mind is totally silent.
<br />

<br />
Try to stay in that state.

This is actually a quite normal problem. Just don't identify yourself with your thoughts. You are the one observing your thoughts. Don't try to force that voice away, just aknowledge it and accept the fact that it's there. It will fade away if you continue rv-ing for a while without trying to fight it, and without identifying yourself with it.

You're just looking at your thoughts more objectively than other people do. : P IMO, there's no need to worry, as long as you feel that *you* are the one in full control of your actions.
