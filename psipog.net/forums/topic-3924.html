			Finally, you've posted the information I've been anticipating ! It'll take me a couple weeks to build up the money to buy my own Geiger Counter, but this is going to be awesome.
<br />

<br />
Any affect on the Geiger counter when using Psi-balls or Psi?

			hmmm... alpha, beta, or gamma radiation...
<br />

<br />
i've done a bit of reading on those types of radiation:
<br />
in order to get a reading from alpha particles, the geiger counter would have to be really close, as even paper can stop it. beta radiation and gamma are hazardous to human health, but can be long range (especially gamma). alpha radiation from humans is possible, but not the two latter because it's harmful to our cells.
<br />

<br />
the geiger counter works by converting radioactive energy into electrical energy. perhaps when you focused on the counter, you energized the molecules in the counter, therefore creating an electrical current and simulated radiation, when you were agitating the molecules in the counter.
<br />

<br />
that's a theory.

			That is interesting about the &quot;new&quot; radiation. Perhaps if the tests to find out about the other radiations were repeated on a psychokinetic, it could be recorded and eventually recognised. *gets excited*
<br />
The chances are though, that someone has already done this on the other side of the earth. Patent it(if you can?) and call it the peebrain radiation, you know, because it comes from the brain....and ...pee....? Not sure where the pee fits in.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

It's not like i'm trying to get famous easy it just sounds cool.

Anyways that's an incredible experiment peebrain.  Can't wait to hear more about this.

			Hmmm, congratulations! peebrain. you might have made an important discovery in the world of psionics! The fact that telekinetically moving psiwheels yields results in geiger counters imply 2 things:
<br />

<br />
1) Psi energy (or at least TK energy) is an electromagnetic wave. (which explains why TK can be done even when blocked by other objects e.g. glass or plastic)
<br />
2) Psi (TK) energy can ionize molecules (which explains the reading in the Geiger counter)
<br />

<br />
I suggest you test the electrical charge of the psiwheel after you've done TK on it, using an electroscope <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroscope" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroscope</a> It may further prove the nature of the psi energy, or it may reveal even mysterious aspects of it. (I have no knowledge yet in advanced modern physics, i'm only at college level)

			I forgot to add that , in this case, psi can also be an ionizing particle radiation. Which, as the name suggest, is a particle.

			Very neat results. The only thing that I think could be a problem is that your PK/psi could have been affecting the instruments by making them give that result (after all, it was what you were going after) as opposed to the instruments actually measuring your PK/psi. So hopefully, the instruments were measuring without being influenced electronically by PK.
<br />

<br />
With the recent release of X-Men 3, I can't help but imagine a future PsiPog where everyone is a psion of a certain level or class number based on their measured abilities. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

I thought of that too, but I just realised, wouldn't that prove it just as well? I mean, it's pk isn't it? All the same, just one of them picks up the radiation, and the other is an imposter of the radiation.

I think proof of its existence (by the method Peebrain used) isn't as significant as an absolute way to detect and measure it. There are tons of skeptical explanations for the readings of his instruments. Hopefully, with more experimentation, he will be able to get it down to an exact (or approximate, at least) science.

			There is still a lot about this reaction that is mysterious and confusing.  We can safely say that the reaction is caused by some manner of mental activity as the reactions seem TTI (timed to intent).  There are many discrepancies in the tests that make it hard to figure out what exactly is going on.  However there are a couple things to keep in mind.
<br />

<br />
First, even though geiger counter probes are designed to be receptive to a specific type of particle interaction, that doesn't mean &quot;other&quot; forms of energy classified or not can't cause the same reaction on the probe sensor.  My instrument is much older than Peebrain's (*giggle) and is also analogue where as his is digital.  Mine is also over 10 times more sensitive.  But mine doesn't have an RS-232 interface....   Needless to say, mine seemed much more receptive to &quot;influence&quot; than his even when the same individual cascaded it with &quot;influence&quot;.  There are generally two things to consider with the conditions of the reaction.  One, that the reaction is somehow causing fundamental particles to be shed as radiation causing detection on the device; or two, that the energy in the reaction is producing a by-product energy that is somehow detected by the probe.
<br />

<br />
There are many more factors that make this test less and less &quot;scientific&quot; but for the most part, we seem to be causing a reaction that may indicate a framework to explain what is going on.  ^__^
<br />

<br />
-till next time
