			I am currently in high school.   Today I had to do the mile run and was exhausted after it(I'm not very atheltic).  Over the last few weeks we have been practicing in gym.  After the first practice, I felt like my hands were intaking and outputing energy, like breathing.  After that we had another practice and the run.  After both, I could have sworn I saw pieces of glitter or something else shiny in the air, but no one else saw it.  After bot, I regained my energy almost immediately.  Do you think this is some kind of auto correcting shield?
<br />

<br />
P.S. I also had a cup of gatorade but I dnt think it works that well or that fast.

			I think it might have been your imagination, or (just a guess) something aura-related, but I doubt you have an auto-replenishing shield that randomly expelled and intook energy from you running.

			Especially if you do not run often, it's likely that you were not properly hydrated or breathing correctly, and the pulsing in your hands was simply your rapid heartbeat.  I've experienced it a few times after a really strenuous gymnastic exercise, and the little flecks of light are also a common product of increased bloodflow to the brain.  Try doing a round-off (or a cartwheel if you've never tried one before) and look around, I'm pretty sure you'll see the little sparkles again.
<br />

<br />
And the gatorade is quite likely helpful in that situation, as high-school gym classes usually do not encourage students to get the proper amount of water prior to exercising, and most do not drink much between classes.

Oh, and if you are really interested in playing around with your biological energies, you can use a focus to store the psychic suggestion of feeling rested, or something like a labradorite crystal to prevent leeching (most people leech from others around them unconciously, which may be why it's easier for a non-athlete to run with others) if you are comfortable working with crystal focuses.  Concentrating and willing yourself to forget that you are tired, basically...
<br />

<br />
I'm too lazy to explain storing energy right now.  *sighs*  Just took three AP exams.
