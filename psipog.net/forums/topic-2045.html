			hmmm... this is a really good video, until about 20min in.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
They explain alot of things with great accuracy and knowledge, then go into the Muslim faith and say that you are infact, no one with the creator; he is seperate.
<br />

<br />
I was going to say this video should be viewed by every Gr. 8 student, but I wouldnt say that after the last 4min of the video.
<br />

<br />
I will say though, that because of the accuracy in this film I find myself asking a question as to the last 4min's validity; however, I do not feel the last part is accurate.
<br />

<br />
I find it interesting though, that the video appears to be produced in America, and they provide all this quality information, but at the end go to another faith's conclusion of the universe. Not that one must stick to your faith if you find a new truth for yourself, but I just find it interesting.......

			Well they obviously havn't thought on it enough, religion was the only way the could reprasent the incombrehenable to us but i would say humans are here because of a perfection made on the otherside and a consiquence of needing balance, the otherside coming first therefore first choice. he choice to be the best to us and we are the best to him.

			hmmm...  Well the nature of duality is everpresent, and that is pretty much where this video leaves you. 
<br />

<br />
I can agree that religion may be the only way to end that video, especially for the masses.
<br />

<br />
The video drops a lot of paradigm bombs, and &quot;You are God&quot; at the end may have pushed the video's credability over the edge (for the layman).
<br />

<br />
I think that the truth about the trancesdance of duality would still have been a better way to end this film. 
<br />

<br />
If the paradigm shifting content of this film keeps it out of American schools, thats understandable.
<br />

<br />
The conclusion they give you at the end will DEFINITELY keep this film out of American schools. 
<br />

<br />
Ugh, I hate American politics - so much <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Watch out for 'false saviours' in the years to come. They will be present. This videos potrayl is a perfect example.

			That's a very interesting and insightful video, but leaves out another possibility that I think is equally valid to the whole Allah thing at the end.
<br />

<br />
It goes beyond the brain into the soul, then it asks &quot;what is the source of the information that the soul perceives?&quot; and goes into the whole religion thing. But what if the world of matter <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> real (the video focuses on the <span style="font-style: italic">what if it isn't</span> idea) in which case the grand source of all the data that the soul perceives could in fact be physical matter.
<br />

<br />
Interestingly, there are tons of directions that video could have gone with all of it's information, such as the soul being it's own source of information, but I guess they wanted to take the easy way out. They could at least of raised the question &quot;Then who created Allah?&quot; or something like that.

			The movie takes 7 and a half minutes to tell me something I know from watching The Matrix. 
<br />

<br />
The movie repeats itself over and over and then claims that because we percieve with our minds that reality isn't really real. That is outright delusion and insanity. 
<br />

<br />
Anyone who watches this movie is now dumber for having watched it.

Poorly said my friend. This is a very concious, quick little film that can provide very valuable insight to many people. 
<br />

<br />
I am glad that you walked away from &quot;The Matrix&quot; knowing the huge underlying secret to our perceptual reality; but not everyone has been so gifted as you.
<br />

<br />
This movie clearly explains many fundamental aspects of a paradigm shift in thinking. I would say cut the last 4min and everyone needs to see this film (or one like it) now.

			Sadly, I didn't learn anything new from that video either.  I figured that out (except for the Allah part) when I was 6 and spent too much time thinking, particularly on the subject of &quot;am I dreaming right now?&quot;

			I agree with only_love... Kief, you should just stop posting or something.

I have not yet developed an opinion on the video, though it does support the thoeries involved in Wave genetics, and I certainly believe that Wave Genetics will soon replace crude older methods of genetic engineering.
