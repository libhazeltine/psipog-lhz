I know it doesn't.. but when you're emotionally fragile like her and you start smoking and become dependant on it and then you get unstable umm yea you should stop.

How about <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> stop trying to interfere with her life and let her make her own decisions. It's not your place to. If she can't then let her mom. Her moms doing what she thinks is best. Mabye if she couldn't control her drug addiction she needed to be institutionalized.

Read all this whole topic again...

This isn't about her drug problem.. and that didn't cause it.  She was depressed then decided to try smoking and I bugged her to stop and then I just left it at that, I would ignore her and she would feel guilty all the time.  Besides I care about her so I should probably help...yay lets control her minor addiction with a heavy dose of drugs! hell yea, meds... uh that isn't called helping...

You couldnt have got my message ANY more wrong then you just did. I simply wanted to know what made some people think why it donest hurt you thats all. If I wanted to tell people how to live there life I would have told it to them up front. But I don't do that, its not my way.

But its not like we all make bad decisions even with help.
