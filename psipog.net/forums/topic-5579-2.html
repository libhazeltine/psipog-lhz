			if this is possible it goes against science... that or your stealing matter from somewhere else.. you cant &quot;create&quot; matter... the amount of matter thats been in the universe since the begginning will always stay at that amount

			To be technically correct, the amount of ENERGY in the universe will stay constant. However, matter can be created/destroyed. Ever hear of E=MC^2? Basically it states that matter is energy, and thus can be converted to different types of energy, and different types of energy can be converted to matter. However, the amount of energy involved in such things is massive. It only took two nuclear explosions to level Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the blasts burned shadows into the ground. I don't see anyone channeling that much energy with their mind. I'd put it right up there with bending light with PK to achieve invisibility.

			Why would you want to create matter from just energy anyway? If you want to form objects, why not just use PK to pull individual particles from the air/surrounding objects together to form something? It should still look the same at the macroscopic level. Sure, it still takes a huge amount of energy but still not quite as much as creating matter.
<br />

<br />
After reading some of the posts in the thread, I'm starting to wonder how much energy can be controlled by the human mind, I mean, if you master the art of channeling energy from the different planes and such, wouldn't you be able to practically form matter, become invisible, or make fire? Perhaps if the whole human race practices psionics, we'd evolve to have more energy controlling capacity, and make these things do-able, just think of the power. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

i think that would be nobody on psipog..and  by the way, why do you care what technique was used? does that matter? just because that person did something amazing with it doesnt mean you will, because you still will have to practice..no technique is better then another..

This makes me think of the movie Accepted...one guy goes to college &quot;to blow stuff up.&quot; I suppose it's possible if you try a looooong time. I'm not going to say no to the possibility because it's never been proven wrong.

You just gotta train Psychokinesis enough that you can heat things up to the point where they combust, simple as that, no materialization involved. Notice how he trained on things like a pineapple (sorry, forgot the other things), which has a lot of water in it, just heat it up until it becomes steam, expands, and explodes. He blew up the car by igniting the gas tank, which probably had a lot of fumes.
<br />

<br />
If you were to create an explosion from nothing but energy, that'd take 100 times as much training to make a decent sized one.
