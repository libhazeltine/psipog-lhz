			I was wondering because I'm pretty into Quantum Physics (but yet I don't have hardly any education in Physics itself) and I was wondering if there are careers in relation to Quantum Physics. What type of education would I need to get to the educational level of Quantum Physics and are the jobs in studying Physics (Quantum in particular) high paying? Also what colleges would be good for science majors particularly Physics or Chemistry, maybe even Chemical engineering? I was thinking of attending Stonybrook in Long Island, because it's only about 60 miles away from me.
<br />

<br />
By the way I'm 17 yrs old and I'm questioning myself as to what major I would want to take in college which is only a year away, because I'm a junior now.

			Yeah it can be a career.  Pretty much anything can now a days.

			Well, I can't tell you specific college names since I never looked into going to college here or in the states but I can give you some helpful adivce.  If you want to go into quantum physics, I would say to go to a science-focused university instead of a college.  The experimental facilities are better, the libraries and research resources are better, the staff are better qualified, etc., etc.  And if you want a good career in quantum physics, you want a degree in it, basically a Ph.D.  So why bother to get a diploma when you can get your undergrad right away and get set on that path?  I don't mean to tell you what to do but it's something to think about.
<br />

<br />
As for when you'll learn about quantum physics, you start in about grade 12 chem I believe.  You'll learn to basics of electrons' quantum nature, the way they pop in and out of existence at random points making orbitals, etc.  1st year chem goes into some depth about it too and it's not until 1nd year uni that you can get into a physics course that touches on quantum physics.  It's usually not until the 3rd or 4th year courses that there are classes devoted to quantum physics though.  So you're expected to go through the motions and learn about newtonian physics before you move on to quantum theory.
<br />

<br />
As for careers, assuming no progress is being made in the field there's always quantum physicists dying and needing to be replaced.  Of course that's not the case and every solution in such fields brings about 5 new questions so the field is expanding and requires more people to keep the discoveries coming.  The challenge isn't so must getting a job as it is getting the education necessary for a career.  If you know your stuff and have demonstrated it, you'll be recognized for it and opportunities will come.

			the field of quantum physics is an evolution of the &quot;physics science&quot; as a whole (ie: newton's laws, einsein's, etc) so, to study QP (quantum...) you must study physics, that way you'll be able to work with it from a &quot;scientific professional&quot; point of view.
<br />
so i'd say, go into a physics career!, preferably at some nice Univ.
