In the clinic they have what I would classify a bed, without covers or anything. I was laying down and was thinking to myself why not try to Astral Project, the best way to do it is if you wake up and then go back to sleep. So I thought to myself &quot;I will have an OBE, I will have an OBE.&quot; and said a prayer I do not remember anymore of being awake.
<br />

<br />
I then felt as if I was getting up but my entire school was rearranged and was completely concious or at least it felt like I was. I then thought of something happening and it actually did, problem was the outcome was totally different then what I had expected.
<br />

<br />
I started to actually wake up I thought to myslef wake up, and it was like a reset button I woke up but the school yet again was rearranged. I started to get nervous and tryed to physically wake up, I did I could most definetly tell the difference between &quot;real physical&quot; and &quot;dream state.&quot; When I woke up though I had a horrible head ache which I did not goto sleep with. I am not sure what to classify this as, it may have just been a Lucid Dream which is what I am thinking it is, or it may have been Astral Projection.
<br />

<br />
Last year the same thing happend when I went to the clinic I was not even trying to I woke up headed to all of my classes and then &quot;physically&quot; woke up to the bell ring, I was like what in the hell is going on.
<br />

<br />
I just would like someone maybe to have a rough classification of what that is, it would be greatly apreciated. Thanks</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

			Thanks for pointing that out <span style="font-weight: bold">FinallyEffingJoined</span>. Yes from what I can remember I knew that I was &quot;dreaming&quot; or doing something of that sort, and wanted out because it was very uncomrfotable.
<br />

<br />
I remember trying to wake up &quot;physically&quot; although just waking up again in a dream like state and having everything re-arranged. It was odd.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for all the quick replies!

			I am going to start to try Astral Projecting again, although need some &quot;guidance.&quot; From what I hear ther are different types of projections. Such as AP (Astral Projection), RTP (Real Time Projection), VRP (Virtual Reality Projection).
<br />

<br />
My question is on the subject of the variations of projecting is when the average person projects what are they projecting too? Is it Real Time? Or is it just a figment of their imagination that feels real. For example if I were to see someone cooking in my house when I project does that mean in real time they are cooking?
<br />

<br />
Thanks in advance.
