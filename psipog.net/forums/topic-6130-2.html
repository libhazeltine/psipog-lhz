			yah that landing was almost like he was surfing, he should have like, fallen or something, make it look somewhat realistic, instead of looking like your slidding across a piece of ice.

			Yeah, if you landed on a bunch of rocks like that, your be doing a little more than just going &quot;ow&quot; over and over.  And why does he have a trail when he flies?????  I mean, he doesn't have jet engines!  lol

			I love this, and I'm keeping an archive of the HD episodes that I'm torrenting, but anyway, here's my what I gathered as their powers:
<br />

<br />
 - Hiro - Bend space time continuum (Time travel + teleportation)
<br />
 - Peter (Younger guy) Patrelli - Almost like Rogue from xMen in his power, he adapts to those around him. I have a feeling he'll meet up with the cheerleader and get a fatal wound but heal it.
<br />
 - Nathan Patrelli - Fly
<br />
 - Claire (cheerleader) - Spontaneous Cellular regeneration, but only when their healing would be unimpeded 
<br />
 - Matt Parkman (the cop) - Telepathic Reading
<br />
 - Sylar (The 'villain') - Psychokinesis
<br />
 - Niki - Split personality
<br />
 - DL (Niki's husband who's on run from cops) - Phasing
<br />
 - Micah (Niki's son) - Clairvoyance. He KNOWS that his father didn't do anything, he knows how to set up all this stuff like his computer. He knows when his father's around 
<br />
 - Isaac - Precog when taking hallucinogens, in his paintings
<br />
 - Claire Bennet's father, Mr Bennet (I can't remember his first name). While I don't think HE has any powers, the black guy that's always with him, I think: has the ability to telepathic scan and make telepathic alterations. &quot;Clean him out&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Did anyone notice Isaac's painting of the eclipse in the first or second episode? We should pay more attention to the paintings in the background, as they might help understand the plot.
<br />

<br />
I also noticed that Hiro's accent died off when he came from the future to talk to Peter. Peter must have gotten hurt, because they emphasized that he had a scar on his face, one that really changed his appearance.

<br />
Yeah... I was thinking that too, that he'll obviously come across an injury which will result in a scar - possibly on his face, because let's face it, that's the only way someone would &quot;look different.&quot;  And he probably gets it before meeting Hiro, because otherwise he wouldn't comment on it, right?
<br />

<br />
Also, I'd like to mention that the eclipse painting's been in pretty much every episode where his apartment's been seen (I think).
<br />

<br />
I'd like to also state that the show is called HEROES, not HERO'S.  Saying &quot;HERO'S&quot; is saying that something belongs to a hero.  That's not it.  It's referring to them all as heroes.
<br />

<br />
Now for the reason why I really wanted to post in this thread - do any of you think that somehow psi abilities MAY be needed, and that at some point someone may have to take on a real-life superhero identity, using psi in order to protect others?
<br />

<br />
...Do you think anyone <span style="font-style: italic">should?</span>
<br />

<br />
I mean, 'cuz I've been thinking, if someone can actually move more than simply small objects... then they really should be trying to use their powers for the good of humanity.
<br />

<br />
(Last note, I love Hiro, the &quot;Japanese Guy&quot; as most of you refer to him - besides Peter, he's the only one who's actually excited about his abilities, though he is notably MORE excited than Peter is, being a geek to begin with.  As a geek, I can't help but think Hiro is great.  Also considering he has what can be considered the greatest powers.  Screw coming back to life, time travel can save people OTHERS who have died!)

Possibly.  He just doesn't seem to have that mastered that yet.

			Yes, he can teleport without traveling through time. Remember (if you saw the episode) when he was in the bar with his friend, and when his friend got up to get some drinks he teleported into the women's room and got booted out? Maybe he wasn't teleporting and I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure he was.
<br />
(And yeah, he has the best power, in my opinion.)
<br />

<br />
I don't think Syler has necessarily psychokinesis... I thought it was more of a mind control. She would've let go of the gun, though he may have been moving her hand with psychokinesis... I guess moving other people's limbs is out of our reach for now <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. Though seeing his other range of powers, I don't think it's guarunteed to be Psychokinesis, seeing his invulnerability/tissue regeneration (whatever) and he flew away I believe? If he had teleported he probably could have gone back in time or something crazy so I don't think they'll give that power to him.

			Yeah, now I think about it, I do remember
<br />

<br />

<br />
But Sylar lifts the bodies in the air then pins them to a wall with an object (knives, chair).
<br />

<br />
Maybe, since he's after all the research, and he's killing people and taking their brain (thus their DNA and mutant powers), he's able to integrate powers into himself, which explains why he wants to get the cheerleader, 'cause then he'll be invincible.
<br />

<br />
I think that all he has right now is psychokinesis. He stopped the bullets, moved the FBI chick's hand and flew, all characteristic of PK.
<br />

<br />
Going on that theory, I predict that Peter's gonna have a showdown with him and all his powers, but he'll have them too, so it'll be an even match.

I don't think just Peter will.  Teamwork is best, right?  As far as I've seen, Peter doesn't have quite the same strength as the others when he copies abilities.  He levitated but didn't fly, he finished Isaac's painting and drew doodles, and he didn't actually do much when Future Hiro met him, besides being able to stay at normal pace.
<br />

<br />
Nobody answered my question, though... do you think it might become necessary at some point for someone to use psi to protect others?  Do you think a person would have the right (or ability) to &quot;play superhero&quot;?

			Eventually, yes, but for the most part, psi isn't strong enough to prevent anything yet, other than maybe precog. That's just my opinion though.

And you are right about peter's weakness when it comes to it. Notice that the picture of the dead cheerleader (that HE drew, brain cut off, bleeding picture)  was of a totally different style and skill level.

Most of that, I'm sure, was due to his skill level with art.  I mean, he drew a picture in stick figures before.

			Well tonights episode was a good one. I cant stop looking at the cheerleader or the blonde hair'd mother though..man..are they very good looking lmao.  I'm anxious to see what the cheerleaders dead is going to do now that he knows someone is looking for his &quot;daughter&quot;. The previews for next week's episode looks even better, cant wait for it.
