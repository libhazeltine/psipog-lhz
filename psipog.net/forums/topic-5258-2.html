			I'm halfway kidding when I say this, but the apocalypse is going to happen in 2012 or 2014, I think. A lot of psychics and prophets think so too. The bible says something about the apocalypse happening when some building in israel is torn down or something like that, and a lot of buildings are getting blown up over in israel right now. Although that strays into religion, which is banned here. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />    And no offense, maxus, but there are people better than you that have tried to have visions of 2012 and 2014 or around those times and can't, or have had visions of destruction and chaos.

No offense taken......

I would also like to know how you came to the conclusion that they're better than me, i mean you have absolutely no idea who i am. If you had known me for several years before making that statement, you will see that im not the average Pyrotechnician/Psionic Dude Guy Person Man/A Rat Lover.......and most of all, the best Blast Billiards player to ever walk the face of the Earth. No offense. I also don't intend to have visions, i don't have visions, i have feelings, these feelings are indescribeable, the best way outlet for these feelings are drawings, i have hundreds. I accurately predicted the day my friend was diagnosed with Renal Cancer, the day some buildings in my school burnt down, the hour that the Columbia Shuttle crashed........I don't really want to predict the fucking future, but it goes ahead and happens anyway. Hell, i didn't really want to have that NDE when i made an explosive out of a Co2 cannister. Or that dream that my dad would have that brain hemerage, but there you go, it went ahead and happened anyway. I didn't even want to become 'Psionical', i came here one day trying to find answers for these abnormal things, and got caught up with all the other stuff i realised that people were capable of. *Deep Breath*, thats better.

doesn't sound like much compared to statements made by people who go to bed every night and have several dreams and visions about the future of mankind, including the apocalypse.

			There is always some cosmic sense of malaise, there is always some foreboding notion of disaster, there is always an imminent threat of apocalypse, there is always an ancient prophecy trying to determine the future....
<br />

<br />
And yet, somehow, we're still here.  Furthermore, you don't need to be psychic or &quot;in-tune&quot; to understand that bad stuff is happening.  Constitutional rights here in America are dwindling under a corrupt and incompetent administration.  Israel and Hezbollah are bombing the everloving shit out of each other, and many innocent people are dying in the crossfire.  Whether you accept global warming as fact or not, I think we can pretty much agree that we're not doing ourselves or this giant rock we live on any favors by wanton pollution of the sky, land, and oceans.  People are burned out and overstimulated.  The development of humanity is now judged on the speed of microprocessors rather than strides in international diplomacy.
<br />

You want something to be worried about ?  Be worried about all that stuff.
