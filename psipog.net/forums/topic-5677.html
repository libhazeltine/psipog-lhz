			I used to be a true believer of psi ever since me and my friends got telepathy to work, but now I'm starting to give up on psi.  I've made psi-balls and made psi-wheels spin, but I really think I'm wasting my time here.  It almost seems like when a psi-ball flares, you are simply visualizing the light a little too well.  Do people on here just say that they scared their cat with a psi-ball or made a pencil float to feel better about themselves?  I know I'm about to get a ton of people yelling at me, but I don't see any other explanation for telekinesis.  Every time I post on this site, there's always someone here to ridicule me, tell me I'm doing it wrong, or tell me that I will never understand how to do whatever it is I'm trying to do.  When I make a psi-ball, sure, I can feel it.  It feels warm and strong and everything, but that could easily be my mind creating a visualization for me.  Whenever I mention something like this, everyone says that I will never progress in psionics because of my disbelief in it.  Doesn't everyone have to question it at some point?

			Well, about the riduculing and things like that. I have said it before and I'll say it again.  Psipog has alot of the people who either are asshole skeptics, or people who think they're completly better than you. That's why I spend most of my time on other forums.  I will admit though, without psipog, I would have never gotten started, so the actual site, is freakin amazing!!! 
<br />

<br />
My advice to you would be to explore other psionic sites.  
<br />

<br />
Ex- Psilinks, Gonzos new advance psionics site (recommended), psiworld, and places like that!
<br />

<br />
Good luck!,
<br />
Brandon

			You say you got telepathy to work.  If that is true, why give up on psi?  I can understand your frustration with telekinesis but that is no reason to give up on every aspect of psi, is it...?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			The telepathy thing was really signifigant, and I'll never give up on that.  It's just really annoying when people here are like &quot;One time, I flared a psi ball near my teacher's face while he was reading a book and he fell out of his chair!!&quot;  I mean, they have to be made up, but still... <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />

			heh, cool. regarding the warm psiball &amp; mirror thing.
<br />

<br />
Also, I would recommend taking a break from psionics for a week or two and trust me, when you come back, it'll be easier. I did that and it worked for general psionics and I did that for lucid dreaming, although the break was an accident, I just didn't have time to try to do lucid dreaming. But I could get lucid after I had a break for 1 1/2 weeks.
