			When I create a psi ball (I usually take about 1-4 mins) sometimes I see either grey or white tiny...nearlly microscopic sparks, I'm wondering, is this my imagination, or am I flaring...does anyone else see these? (doesnt take long to start seeing em either) 
<br />

<br />
Sorry for posting another one of these topics &quot;am I making a psi ball&quot; I looked for this specific ? but didn't find it.

			It's hard to distiniguish when all you're seeing is the little dots. When you are in the dark, or even in the light, you may see these tiny dots of light just because eyes mess up sometimes <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />... Or when you are focusing inbetween objects.

That's why I say, Successful flairs should occure if the psiball emits a destinctive color...bright persumally, if it's hard to see, or doesn't exactly match where the ball should be, then it's a false ball.

			wads flaring anyway....sry....new here, new to the terms yall use
<br />

<br />
those dots ya see are the &quot;psi&quot; as yall call it. u might wanna take a trip to clairvoyance forums for furthur details on training your clairvoyance, but yea, those are the energy that your third eye (sixth chakra) picks up.
<br />

<br />
if anything is confusing, let me know

			Flaring is making a Psiball visible. Clairvoyance has nothing to do with physically seeing psiball's. And I don't buy the stuff on the Chakras...
<br />

<br />
Be careful what you claim to be a visible Psiball. If a camera won't pick it up... It's not visible.

			Alright I'm bumping this topic so I can say that yesterday I made a psiball, trying to flare it, and I got a lot of little gray dots between my fingers. I wasn't really going for a color and I just got a lot of little white/gray fast moving dots. They were 1/2 to 1/4 the size of snowflakes. Is that normal? When I looked away and looked back, they were still there. When I looked somewhere else and watched out of the side of my eye, they were still there between my fingers but nowhere else in my vision. They kind of looked like static on a tv screen. Is that normal? Is it a real flare? My other flares are usually a wisp of the color they're supposed to be. But I didn't really program this one to be a color.

			Sounds like you're almost there. Your auric sight might be developing, as auric sight enables you to see psi, but only a couple of inches and beyond of your peripheral vision. You cannot see auras by directly focusing on them, you kind of gaze at them, using a little of your peripheral (side) vision, since that is the point where your third eye is able to upload information to where optical information is processed.
