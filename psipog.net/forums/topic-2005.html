			I was wandering through my local Wal-mart, and I noticed those &quot;Missing Persons&quot; posters that they've always got by the exit.

It would have unforseen benefits. Firstly, it would recover missing people. This would give the families unprecedented joy. Second, if it works, then it would probably end up on the news, so if we speak out about our method of finding these people (RV) then people would be more likely to take Psi seriously. They'll think &quot;The US army used it in the 80s, and missing people are being found by it now, so it MUST be good for something!&quot;

Anybody thought of this before, or have any ideas regarding it?

			Hello sgtpsion,
<br />

<br />
Around two months ago I was asked to help my local police department with finding a missing child lost in the woods. One of my best friends father is the chief of police at the local police department. I received a phone call late at night by my friend's father asking me to come down to the police department and remote view this lost child. I agreed. 
<br />

<br />
When I first walked into the office, I was greeted by my friends father and he told me the situation that they were in. He explained that a child was missing since 4:30pm and that they have not found him yet. The child was  last seen in the woods with his family camping in the woods. I told him that I would give it a shot and sat down in a room where it was quite. 
<br />

<br />
The session took around 30 minutes (I wanted to find the child fast). The pressure started to get to me. I knew if I blew this session, I would not only be made fun of but my respect from my friends and their families would be lost. I tried to brush it aside as best as I could.
<br />

<br />
I handed in my session and told everyone that the kid is no longer in the woods. I viewed him by a small yellow building by a busy street. Within 20 minutes, the child was found right were I viewed him. The child left the woods and walked near a Turkey Hill store. 
<br />

<br />
Their have been many remote viewers/psychics asked and used by the police departments to find missing people. I was lucky enough to have to opportunity to help out. Only a few people knew about the session due to my friends father not wanting anyone to know that he asked a psychic to help out. I really didn't mind either. The last thing I wanted was to gain attention from people wanting to learn how to remote view. I really don't have the time to have that type of attention. I believe I told a few friends and my family members. A pat on the back and a &quot;good job&quot; is enough for me <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />
- JoeT

Id love to be in this &quot;bunch of remote viewers&quot;  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

Should really consider starting some kinda group to help Missing persons families or something.

			Ever see those posters around your neighborhood showing lost animals and often offering around $100 rewards? 
<br />

<br />
Yeah, it'd be lame profiting off a skill to gain a few bucks, but people do that all the time. A good portion of our society goes to a university, earns a degree in a skill, and then proceeds to profit off of it.
<br />

<br />
Psionics requires a good amount of training and practice to reach a certain level. Just like how a lawyer has to go through law school or a doctor has to go through med school, psionics isn't an ability that a majority of society has or can gain in a short amount of time.
<br />

<br />
I'd find it interesting if psionics became an actual profession in the future and you could earn a degree or qualification, just like any other profession that requires a certain skill and certain knowledge.

			Really think you should go along with the idea..
<br />
No idea how it would work though..
<br />

<br />
Give the remote viewers the data sheets one time..
<br />
Maybe a few days later you collect all the data? I dunno  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />
Itd be cool though

			I think we should all get one or two missing persons from our area, make a list of the people, give the list to the participating viewers, then collect all the results, come to what you want to put then submit the findings to each area.......we can compare results of the findings and take on more if our percentages are high <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
