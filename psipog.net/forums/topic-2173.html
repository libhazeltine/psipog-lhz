			Last night I attempted an OBE and fell into Sleep Paralysis. 
<br />

<br />
What is it? Your body is completely asleep but your mind is fully awake. You can't move at all, and you normally have hallucenations.
<br />

<br />
The above is exactly what happened to me, and it was a very, VERY scary experience for me. I was lying in my bed, and I couldn't move for about 2-3 minutes, and it looked like someone was in the corner staring at me. 
<br />

<br />
What could have caused this? Has anyone else experienced this?
<br />

			Welcome fellow explosmateer.
<br />

<br />
Sleep paralysis is a totally normal and natural thing. Many have experienced it and they all say the same thing. They can't move, they hallucinate and are really scared.
<br />

<br />
I myself have never had the misfortune to experience sleep paralysis, but i've read alot about it. It's basically that your brain and concsius wakes up, but your spine-brain (which controls movement and nerves) is still asleep. You may or may not be able to open your eyes, but you are fully perceptive, just that your muscles don't fully work yet.

			I've tryed, but i'm not really into it for two different reasons, first of all, i happen to live with people with really weak hearts and it would not be nice at all if i manage to scare them to death and the second reason is, i've practised telepathy on an astral body and it made me pass out, hit my head on the desk and lie there bleeding for 10 minutes out cold.
<br />

<br />
So OBE is not my preferable field. I'm more into PK and Telepathy.

			What I know from the sleep paralysis is that is a methode of protection. When you go to sleep your corpse paralyses to avoid movements in dreams cause if we dream that we are walking our subconscious would tell our legs to walk. And for that the corpse is paralysed, its only a methode of protection, nothing to worry about
<br />
I experienced this a lot when i'm trying to have OBE's I only experienced 2 or 3 in all my life, but think that when you're paralysed you're near to reach an OBE. At first it's scary but there is nothing to worry about  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Yeah i had a really scary experinece with this, i was attempting an OBE and i lay still for about 45 minutes and then i started to hear sounds, this freaked me out (even though it had happend before) and i tried to roll over but found my self paralysed. then i saw a giant eye on my cieling just staring down at me, this went on for about 5 minutes. it was a really scary experience but i knew that i was only an illusion and didnt let it put me off OBEing.
<br />

<br />
As balmung205 said, theres nothing to worry about. these illusions cant hurt you in any way and only last a few minutes.

			at least the thing in the corner staring at you didn't leap at you, wrap itself around your body, and cause intense pain unlike anything else you would ever experience.

			I have had this happen to me multiple times, and every time it was scary.  But, the first time I tried to do an OBE, before I even read any methods to, I did it in a really wierd method too.  I was in my basement, my room at the time.  Every thing ended up getting darker and darker and it was turning into like a black void, but these disturbing images kept on appearing in my head, and they wouldn't go away, I had my mind cleared and every thing.  I kept on going and it kept on getting darker, and the images were coming at a faster rate, I decided to stop because I started to get too scared at one point.

			It occured again the other night, but after a minute or two, it felt like my body began to float up, so I think I may have almost entered an OBE.
<br />

<br />
I got pretty scared though and woke up. It was still neat to know I'm getting there. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Thanks for all the posts by the way. Your information is very helpful   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			i experienced sleep paralysis more then 10 times and about 5 times they were realy paining me little and about 3 times are painfull for me .
<br />
first i thought they were obe's but some people told me they are sleep paralysis and i read about sleep paraplysis and they say about 15% from population are experienced at least 1 time sleep paralysis and sleep paralysis happen when someone sleep on his back and it dont happen if he slept on his sides .
<br />

<br />
if you want to read my painfull experience about sleep paralysis here it is:
<br />

<br />
1 one : i was sleep then i wake up and felt that i need to close my eyes so i closed them and when i just closed them and lay down i saw strange colors then all my body was shaking like getting shocks then i heard voice and every time he say its words again his voice become bad more and more so i could not handle that scary thing so i told him to shut up then everything become normal and i wake up.
<br />

<br />
2 time : same thing wake up from my sleep and felt that i need to close my eyes then i saw strange yellow colors then i said omg again that scary thing then i felt electricty go through my body and every where it go through i feel more heat in it then that feeling gone after while and i saw ghost behind my legs then that ghost come so close to me and i felt that it want to go through me so i said some words to protect me after that i wake up before it go inside me.
<br />

<br />
3 time : i only heard voice of someone name then i felt that all my body like painning me as low blood in it ( i dont know how to explain that but it was like when you put your arm or leg on wronge position then it hurt you because low blood flow in it ).
<br />

<br />
the others times are paining me little just under my chest .

			MM but the pain stays when you awake at morning ore it has gone. Pain at chest is normal when you experience something in dreams that makes you stressed (I remembered that i feel the same pain when i dream that i fall from a cliff for example, then i wake up and i feel a great pain in my chest)
<br />
So pain in the chest its just for stress it goes away in seconds so its not really dangerous.
<br />
I think that you get that cause you're really afraid from OBE's and your subconscious make you to feel that (well this is my opinion)
