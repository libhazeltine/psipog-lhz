			Okay so last night I had a dream that I could remember, and I kept waking up and whenever I went back to sleep the dream continued. The dream was that I had full use of every type of psychic power. I could tell what people were thinking, could see through other's eyes, could move objects around without touching them whenever I wanted to, and ect. Now today I for the first time ever have moved my psi-wheel! This seems pretty cool to me.

Psh. Third eye? Utter BS.

Dreams such as these can help build the comfort with the idea of psionics necessary to actually do psionics.

			Felix, the chakras are a thing many believe in, I do and I've focused on the third eye and it helped me on many occasions. Please don't say its BS without having any evidence.

and psionics isnt BS? think about it, keep an open mind here... after all, if you say &quot;im psychic&quot; to someone, chances are youll get pointed and laughed at. i dont beleive in the third eye, but it works. like most theories in physics, they are THEORIES, but they work. nobody knows if this is their theory in work, or just chance.

anyways, try to get back into this dream. iv had this weird thing that im gonna post up, where i learn stuff from my dreams... try to recreate what you saw.

Reality is not the same as utility. I find the concept and location of the &quot;third eye&quot; to be useful - I just have found no indication of it actually existing, and I've been working with energy for six years now.
