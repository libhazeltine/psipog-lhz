			Do I have to use my hands to move the paper balanced at the tip of an unfolded paper clip? It is under glass.
<br />

<br />
Quite frankly, I feel more comfortable NOT using my hands and doing the following technique:
<br />

<br />
1. I sit cross legged on the floor with my set up in front of me on an upside down crate.
<br />

<br />
2. I relax and clear my mind.
<br />

<br />
3. To make the connection between the paper and I, I imagine everything in my sight, except the paper, fades to white while I and the paper become blue. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Question 1:</span> <span style="font-style: italic">Is this an effective way to make a connection with the piece of paper?</span>
<br />

<br />
4. I attempt to gracefully feel it with my mind. 
<br />

<br />
5. In my thoughts, I ask it politely to spin for me, sometimes requesting it to do so in a certain direction. I do <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> use my hands.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Question 2:</span> <span style="font-style: italic">Is this an effective way to make the paper spin?</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">* * * * * * * MY CURRENT RESULTS * * * * * * *</span>
<br />

<br />
So far it has not noticeably moved, but it feels like it is getting ready to.
<br />

<br />
I would highly appreciate answers to my questions and any additional advice one could offer.
<br />

			Well since i use my hands i cannot give very proper advice to the subject. But your connection method seems solid, and your thinking. Just keep practicing.

I don't know. I only have slid paper and moved metallic objects.

			Hands are not required when doing telekinesis.  Some people use them and some others do not.  Here are the answers i can give to your questions:
<br />

<br />
1)  Everyone has different ways of making their connection.  I have heard of the one you use before.  It is a good way because you are emphisizing you and the psiwheel.  By emphisizing that, you make a connection between just you and your psiwheel.
<br />

<br />
2)  That is how a lot of people spin the psiwheel.  By asking it to move.  You cannot just ask it though.  Try to also expect it to move.  Expect it to follow your orders and spin.

			2)  try &quot;pushing&quot; energy out from a source (ie: solar plexus, thrid eye, hands, crown, ect) wherever  you feel comfortable.  try to push your energy into the object and make it move.  it also helps to visualize the object moving while you do this.  just asking it alone to move isn't going to do much.  also, read NI's article/thread on psychokinesis, that should help you out.
<br />

<br />
also, first practice moving the paper without the glass covering it.  the glass acts as a mental barrier.  once you get the object to move without the glass, then you can cover it.  once you actually move it, you will believe that you can always move it which will make it easier to move the object under the glass.

force bubbles?  never heard of them  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  what i meant by pushing was projecting energy but simmulating the sensation of physical force.  project the energy, but give it impact.  this is my method for psychokinesis, so it may not work for everyone.  (pm for further information)
<br />

<br />
constructs, in my experience, don't work as well when performing psychokinesis.  i think they work better with mental abilities, or for combat, rather than physical abilities. (unless you wanted a &quot;tracking&quot; construct)  i hope this helped clarify a bit.
