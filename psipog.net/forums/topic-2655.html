			There is no article here on it, mostly because it ties a lot into religious belief.
<br />

<br />
Auric Vision is seeing the magnetic fields around a persons body, but visible in color, atleast I believe thats what the scientific belief is.
<br />

<br />
Others its seeing the energy around a person, supposedly different colors mean different things, also from my person experience it allows you to see PsiBalls as well. All in all i'd say it seeing Psi visibly, though without flaring.
<br />

<br />
How to spark it? I dont know truely, to me its been innate as has Remote Viewing, I just clear my mind and focus, I know the intent at first and well my mind does the rest. There was an article, but I cant remember where, it requires a dark room and a mirror. You look at yourself in the mirror whilst keeping a clear mind, then when you see slightly color around you you try to expand it and bring it out.
<br />

<br />
Sorry if that isnt as helpful as you wanted.

Believe it or not, it's actually a good technique. It's one of the less-fluffy articles on that site. It's pretty straightforward. If you're looking for Higher Vision (I call aura vision that because it lets you see psiballs too), that's the article to use.

			A fluffy site whose articles are mostly taken from other sites and said to be their own. The whole concept of the &quot;wingmakers&quot; is utter fluff, so dont read into at the slightest bit.

Just search Yahoo or Google for Wingmakers, you'll find their site.

Yeah, that's the one. The site as a whole IS really fluffy, but some of the stuff in that article's pretty valid. I think that article's an exception to the fluff, probably ripped off someone else, although I haven't been able to find it anywhere else. If anyone does, let me know!

			lol. the article was TOO LONG to keep my attention. 
<br />

<br />
it seemed too confident. what i mean is...it sounded as if that was the definitive answer. you know?
<br />

<br />
it sounded too scientific for it to be actual fact, since i had the impression that auras weren't scientifically proven...... so im skeptical. it just seemed as if the author had taken physics 101 and decided that electromagnetism and other stuff sounded like a real nice answer to what auras really were.
<br />

<br />
btw, not seeing the religious side to auras. you guys talkin about how it might be the soul? or spirit?

			Well, if you ignore all the theory in the article, and cut straight to the techniques and stuff, it just kinda &quot;turns itself on&quot;. At least, it did with me.
<br />

<br />
It could be construed as anything from bioelectromagnetism to actual light to part of the soul/spirit/whatever. Personally, I don't care what it is. I know it's an energy field of some sort, and I can I work with it. 
<br />

<br />
It's comparable to gravity. Ten thousand years ago, who cared what held them on the ground? It kept them there and that's all that mattered back then!

			well, keeping in mind what everyone said about the site being fluffy, i went to just read that single article.
<br />

<br />
if you skip the scientific stuff and just do the exercises they tell you to do, it's really easy.
<br />
after doing the exercises, i can do them and keep them in the position they're supposed to be in, placed in like 2 seconds. (go, and you'll see what i mean)
<br />
when i started the exercises, it would take me like 2 minutes to just catch the right spot. then that would just be for a moment, too.
<br />

<br />
and then i realized that i've always had aura vision, i just stopped when i was about 8. which reinforces that children have most of this stuff going for them already.
<br />

<br />
anyways, just check out the article.
<br />
it woke up my aura vision...i think. ^_^
<br />

<br />
AND...btw...what's aura vision good for? like besides looking at ppl and figuring out how they feel by the pretty colours above their heads.

<br />
i have another question: not bothering with all the controversy about aura vision (are they just afterimages? etc.), does aura vision screw up your eyes? like not with psi or anything, but like the mechanics of ur eyes. how your eye muscles are supposed to work and everything. cuz aura vision deals a lot with focusing and unfocusing your eyes for extended periods of time...which i find makes my eyes (and the back of my brain) hurt a bit the next day.
<br />

<br />
cuz i dont have glasses yet. and i plan to keep it that way. <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

<br />
No but seriously i dont understand why this topic is still active... Just like the mention of &quot;spirits,&quot; being an indirect reference to the afterlife/god/religion, then so would auras. Not to mention that some of this stuff about aura vision follows the same foundational beleifs as &quot;chi/ki/qi&quot; which, too is aganst the rules. I mean, im not advocating a lock, im just saying that its discussions like this aura thread that should be let go as far as the &quot;religious&quot; rule goes. It just seems like that the moderater/admin has final say on what is &quot;law&quot;, which is just mearly his interpretation on the subject.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I think that auras would just be our psi leaking out of us... AND

You just named off all the functions of aura vision. (you forgot that this vision helps you see psi better too) What else did you think it would be good for? Also, you make it sound so useless. I would rather see if some hostile construct was lunging at me, than have an &quot;indescribable&quot; feeling, followed by fatigue, or whatever else the construct is programed for.
<br />

<br />

<br />
BTW thats a pretty damned fluffy site. Worse than that one that called weather control, &quot;Atmokenesis.&quot; *grabs his cross, hoping to flee back all of the flames for using an &quot;invalid term.&quot;* Dun dun dun!!!!!!

			i can't remember the arguments. I think they have to do with souls which some may think indirectly talks about religion.

Honestly, I can't remember why I believe it doesn't necessarily link to religion. (i know its really stupid to say that, but whatever.) But I can see what you're saying arch.
