			I don't know but I try to OBE EVERY night. I've been dabling since before last may but I've really been doing it a lot since Christmas, not to mention the summer. I've only actually done it once but I was awoken right after I did it. I don't think it was a dream because I remeber floating and everything looked like mud :p. One other time I got to the stage where I leave but I couldn't breathe and I was just stuck but for these past few months I haven''t even been able to get to the stage where I leave. My method is pretty simple. I lay in my room, it's usually dim. And I just lay there. Possibly even for an hour and try and let my body fall asleep which seems like a good idea to me. I try to keep my eyes open but I usually fall asleep. Also, when my body gets to the point where it;s about asleep I'll jerk. I'll unintentionally through my arms over my head or kick my legs. Then I'm wide awake again and I just roll over and say screw it and go to sleep. I try other methods like sending myself to a body above me or pulling myself out through my third eye but that doesn't even get close to working. I also try doing it when I wake up or when someone wakes me up so that I'm extremly tired but I normally fall back asleep. I try holding my arm up but that keeps me awake. I'm worried that i may just not be able to do it. Any suggestions?

			Not much I can add due to my utter lack of experience with OBE's but I will say this.
<br />

<br />
If you did it once you can do it again, keep at it and stay determined. The jerking thing, well just try to work through it and continue, maybe its a sign of closing in on things, I'm unsure. But as per usual, my advice is keep trying, sorry i'm not that much of a help on this.

			That's what I always figured. Maybe it's me trying to leave. Because I work with energy manipulation so I kind of have a feel for moving myself on the inside. Almost like trying to raise my blood and bones without moving my skin. It sometimes happens when I do this. I usually only do this after a while when my body's almost numb from not moving for so long.

			Well different techniques work best for different peoplemy main bit of advice would be to not worry about it. Stress is a major block to all psionics (at least in my experience) so just relax and more or less let go of your body. If you tink it would help something I do sometimes is lay down after turning on quiet repetitive music (like a drum beat) focus on the sound of the drum beat untill that fully fills your mind and then push even that out of your mind, and as I said before let your body go.

			I just thought that I should mention that sometimes I start to hear wierd noises. Usually very sharp quick noises. Like a sword leaving a sheath. Other sharp variations also. Sometimes even a popping noise like when you're in a plane. What exactly is this?

			Well, I've been trying still and the only one I've had was on Mothers Day. I missed a lot of sleep and dosed off at her house in a chair and kinda got the sensation of walking out but not actually controling what I was doing. Kinda popped right back in after that. So I'm pretty sure now that I can do it after several succeses, but the funny thing is all of them were accidental and the one that I was TRYING to induce really screwed up because I couldn't leave and just kinda got paralysed. So, any techniques... Anything at all?

			1) Perhaps try some exit techniques once you've been laying for a while.
<br />

<br />
2) Ensure you have the proper mind state. Basically, you're normally thinking &quot;blah blah blah blah blah&quot; when you lay in bed. You can consciously not think of anything, which is sort of like &quot;...&quot;; you're not thinking of anything, but you're thinking about not thinking of anything. You need to be not thinking about not thinking about anything, which is analogous to &quot;&quot; going on in your head; absolutely nothing, not even white space. This is the correct mental state for OBE. If you can hold this long enough and often enough, eventually you will get an OBE.
<br />

<br />
3) Those noises are called &quot;hypnogogic imagery&quot; and are purely constructions of your subconscious. They are not real and cannot harm you.
<br />

<br />
Hope that helped a little bit.

			in my opinion astral travelling is not a skill like playing games, driving a car.
<br />
Its like your own being - be here and now while you are awake to transform the mind( till it wont be any obstacle ) and to see clarity everyday.Then obe happens.
<br />
...If its just a technique go to astral like playing football or driving car so every of you would be there when you want.But its not! And you cant go...as you see by yourself.

			Hmmm, newe question. The other night something wierd happened. I was practicing like normal and drifted off to sleep but I woke up vibrating violently which I was hoping was a sign that  I would OBE. But then it felt like I was two people (like usual) But the second body felt like it was spinning in every which directing while still in me. I also heard the common whispers and saw lines but it was quite awkrard. Maybe just a failed attempt?
