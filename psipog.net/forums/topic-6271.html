			Last night I tried to AP again, errr not much luck. But something did happen in the middle of the night.
<br />

<br />
Last night when I caught myself waking up. My body gone num at a instant. It also shot to me that it was sleep paralize. But soon after my body gone num, and I saw a flash of my body, and then saw myself standing in the middle of a 4 way road looking at something. Its body was dark and...waterly, like it was shimmering like a living shadow I only seen one other time before in a after trance. But this shadow had a hole in his face,...err not a blackish hole. A hole that you could see to the other side. Sort of like a cartoon...on his face. This ghost stand at the intersecation some yards away.
<br />

<br />
I was FREAK out, it look at me while I look at it.....well through his holeish..face. This ghost was a bit of distance away from me but I could see it as if was standing at me. It look at me like it didnt get bothered, turn and walk down the road.
<br />

<br />
After the flash was over and the paralize disappear, in a instant I fell asleep. I woke up and fell asleep during this so fast I didnt even realize it untill the sun came up.
<br />

<br />
Giving this flash some thought and looking onto myself I figure that the reason why I couldnt see his face is because I was so afired. I know in this dream I couldnt give rational thought. So I did some meditation and told myself not to be afired next time.
<br />

<br />
The road that the ghost toke goes to a morom church. But its also the shortest road I know to the graveyard.
<br />

<br />
I also did a few spirital meditations I thought up to streghten and forcus.
<br />

<br />
I like to hear some of your comments on this? I been thinking of visiting the graveyard during the day after haloween but never did it. Now the church is in my mind and the graveyard.
<br />

<br />
Just PM if you think its about the church because its agasint the rules. Also I don't think its the church....just going by my gut,

			i wrote about this in another guys post about sleep paralasys. when your in your rapid eye movement stage of sleep and you open your eyes your body is still technicly asleep so it is still dreaming. your dreaming with your eyes open.
<br />

<br />
i remember my grandmother always tells us stories of when she went to her great grandmothers barial when she was young. she talks of an ugly looking monster in the cemetary staring at her. she even drew it and it looks like a slim barney looking this with no face at all. it kinda creeps me out

			Well I knew it was sleep paralise like you said. But when I gone through them I never had a brief flash like that. I remember seeing the edge of my bed quickly, which then I saw a flash of my face and then on the street infront of the house.
<br />

<br />
This thing was scary to look at, I seen something like it before but through something different. It was like a blob in human form, and that hole in the face just made it more scary.
<br />

<br />
I know I was really scare when I saw it...but I can't help but wonder if I should go find it again. I kind of want to go to that graveyard in hopes of seeing it.
<br />

<br />
Honestly...I think it mite wanted something from me.
<br />

<br />
But then again this could still all have been a dream.

			yes if your eyes open up while you are dreaming you see the real world and your brain confuses it with the dream and creates monsters and stuff kinda like hallucination

			The wouldnt really explain the &quot;jumping&quot; out feeling. And that quick flash of my body and the wall, and the road. Like moving near sonic speed or something... <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
But ya I still think it could have been a dream.
