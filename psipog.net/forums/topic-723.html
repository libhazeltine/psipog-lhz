			I was trying one just for the hell of it the other day at the mall while I was walking around, but I'm realy a beginner (havent realy started shields yet but have mastered psi balls). I did get a tingly psi feeling all over my body, but it was hard to tell if people were noticing me, untill I went into a shoe store to look at sneakers, the girl behind the desk just stood there looking bored while I walked in and started browsing. Usualy they at least ask if you need help. Perhaps she was just uninterested in her job XD
<br />

<br />
On the other hand thinking back, while I was making it, the concentration involved probably made me look mentaly retarded. (I just relax when I manipulate psi, so my face was blank and my eyes more or less unfocused, I was walking slow and wierd probably).

			At one time, I had a psionic cloaking shield up most of the day, and I had a number of problems with people that I would practice with until I would take it down (too numerous to mention).  Although it was a bit amusing how most people couldn't find a way to &quot;locate&quot; me psionically, having one up all of the time was awkward for practice.

			I do cloaking shields the most often (not 100% sure if they work, but it seems they do).
<br />

<br />
Generally in school if I'm in a bad mood (or I just want a laugh) I'll try to make one and go about my normal activities. People handing back test papers can't seem to find me, I call people and they look around to see who did it, and (best of all) no one check to see if I'm wearing my ID tag  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  
<br />

<br />
I don't know if I'm really doing it, but it's funny either way.

			During passing period, i was working on a cloaking shield, trying to make myself appear to be just another person in the crowd. My friends were going  to their next class and i walked right into their path a good 20 feet away from them, and i just stared at them. They even looked right at me, but they didnt know it was me until they were right next to me.  it freaked them out.

			Cloaking shields are one of my favourite psi tricks to play. I have &quot;disappeared&quot; on the (public transport) bus, and even walked right up to a line of people literally staring me right in the face and making them all scream when I took the thing down. I'm not sure if I'm hedging or going completely invisible though. Probably a combination of the two every now and again.

			No, it's more of a disguise, or a camoflauge. It works somewhat like &quot;Somebody Else's Problem Field&quot; from the Douglas Adam's books. They can see you, but they don't notcie you, so you can sneak up on them, or sneak past them.

			No. Nobody can turn physically invisible. (at least no one has yet). That is a parfect example of the concept Eldibs. Its like the 'SEP' field from the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series. I myself have had little experience with cloaking shields, but I think I remember trying one and nobody noticed me.

I replied to this saying that I have been stuying the same effect with light in science class. When a crest and a trough of equal magnitude in waves of light meet, they cancel eachother out, and you see nothing. I suggested that this might not only be a good technique for making a shield that keeps out sound or makes you soundless, but also a great technique for a cloaking shield!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> I'm not sure how difficult this would be, but I would love to give it a try. I'll let you know what happens.

			Doing the same thing as for a &quot;silencing sheild&quot; would effectively make a big black spot of no light where you should be. While making you invisible, but still highely noticable.You would have to bend, or refract the light around you.Causing no light waves to hit you. Try typing philedelphia project into google

			I posted in the other topic, but first you wo9uld have to find some way to program a construct to bend light (another thing that I have heard of people trying, but no follow-up reports on).

			I had a neat idea for another type of cloaking shield, is just make someone else think your someone different. How? Well I thought about getting a shield to emulate someone else's psi-sig. Interesting thought, I might try to see if it works. Basically if sucessful people won't know it's you when you pass them by. I haven't tried that one yet, but I've been working on it. 
<br />

<br />
Another method for cloaking I use is diminished sensitivity. People basically pick up on you by sensing your &quot;awareness&quot; so if you turn your &quot;awareness&quot; down you could actually be undected. The technique? Feel like your pulling your awareness inside your head, feel it close around you and make sure it's not out too much. I did this several times to people. That's a fun technique.

			I'm a bit of a beginner at psi work (been nearly 2 years but i don't practice much.) and i'm interested in cloaking shields, i've tried them before but didn't get much sucess with it, can any of you explain to me exactly how to make one of these? Just send me a PM or send it to my yahoo.
