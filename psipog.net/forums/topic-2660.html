			alrighty... this is a 2 step process cause it is a lot of theoretical knowledge i've dug up. some, made by myself after extensive study into reiki and psi, some from plain old human nature study.
<br />

<br />
first one is about symbols and how we interpret them, plus their uses for psi...
<br />

<br />
as anyone knows, symbols can be powerful objects.  the cross for christians for instance. what this technique intails is the use of symbols to trigger or maybe (if we are lucky) amplify our psi abilities.
<br />

<br />
yeah,yeah sounds washable. it's a theory, and a sound one too however.
<br />

<br />
picture this... the chinese symbol for peace. in their language, it is a perposeful symbol representing serenity and peace (duh!).
<br />

<br />
set it on an angle, and it turnes into a swastica.
<br />

<br />
long speech short, symbols portray different meanings.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">alright. to the good stuff...</span>
<br />

<br />
my technique entails how we interpret symbols and what it has to do with psi. first, get some paper and a pencil.
<br />

<br />
then, get into a meditative state, or get comfortable if you don't know how to meditate.
<br />

<br />
once you are ready, picture the feeling of embarassment or anger, and repeat the word anger in your mind. if any definite shape appears, immediately draw it upon the paper.
<br />

<br />
repeat with the other feelings of peace, confusion and relief.
<br />

<br />
for those of you who cannot imagine well, here are some example feelings.
<br />

<br />
anger: embarrasing moments.
<br />
peace: your special private place.
<br />
confusion: a pile of really puzziling homework or an unsolvable problem.
<br />
Relief: soothing water after burning yourself. once you finish one symbol, clear your mind, have a glass of water, and do another.
<br />

<br />

<br />
the corrisponding symbols you wrote down for &quot;Anger, Peace, Confusion, and Relief,&quot; represent the common attributes that we use in psi.
<br />

<br />
Anger: Power.
<br />
Peace: Spirit.
<br />
Confusion: Mind.
<br />
Relief: Body.
<br />

<br />
because we made these symbols ourselves, they are relatively easy to remember. 
<br />

<br />
the main idea around these symbols are that they may help a psion in the use of their techniques. for instance, 
<br />

<br />
TK: paint your symbols of power and body on the pinwheel before attempting to spin it. (never tried it but it's a theory)
<br />

<br />
Empathy/Telepathy: Spirit and Mind. colour them in mid air on the person (in your mind.) (some effect for me at least.)
<br />

<br />
because they are symbols you made to represent certain aspects of yourself, they may have some role to play in psi manipulation.
<br />

<br />
as this technique is mostly theoretical, i haven't had the experience to say it's true or not. anyone wishing to give some feedback after trying it, please do so. it'd be awesome if this worked.not only would it personalize our techniques, it would add a bit of flair to them. what's wrong with that eh?
<br />

<br />
and, for the record, yes i have made my own symbols. i may post them eventually, if popular vote demands it.
<br />

<br />
stay tuned for my next technique.

			interesting read, i have done this before actually.
<br />

<br />
but it was with a pencil as opposed to colours. some colors represent emotion to certain people, i.e yellow can represent happiness( if you like the summer) or it can represent danger (a bee, black and yellow, various road signs)
<br />

<br />
i used this on the psi wheel, but to be honest it didnt have much effect...
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">but</span>
<br />

<br />
it did help me connect with the object, as it was something personal <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			ya i think the same way. 
<br />
this symbols concept is like buddhist mantras; constant repition of a certain phrase to the point where the person has made the mantra true. the name i usually give this is 'pretending'; belief in a lie and then it becomes true in reality
<br />

<br />
whoa ok........so this is kinda going into a direction i didnt reallly want it to go in so let's back up.
<br />

<br />
going along w/ what you said about the pinwheel. i remember reading somewhere that someone, before starting pinwheel practice, would write power on the pinwheel and after a while, he began to be able to spin it. i believe that not only w/ the practice was he able to accomplish this, but also because he associated the word power. this in eventually gave him the power he needed to spin the pinwheel. 
<br />

<br />
so...what im sayin is that w/ the assocaition of the word he was able to convince himself that he had the power needed to spin it. 
<br />

<br />
eh....ok that was a really crappy explanation and i repeated myself a few times.
<br />

<br />
whatev. lol

			That is.. SO COOL! Such a great idea, i'm going to try this right now!
<br />
However it seems like this would be a mental crutch unfortunately -.- or would it?
<br />
I guess whatever works right? because I am getting kinda lost on totally depending on my own mind to do things, other than using some sort of method or &quot;spell&quot;.. ya know. This is what I came up with, but i'll do this for about a week straight to see if anything changes, then I will try other steps out.
