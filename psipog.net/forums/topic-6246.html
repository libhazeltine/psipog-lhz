			Yeah i've thought long and hard about this but i think its just too overwhelming to not be the way i want 100% of the time

<br />
The only thing i'm going to be ingesting is protein and other kind of supliments because i want to keep atleast some muscle definition.

			I would not recommend trying it. I can tell you this from personal experience. I've tried going for a while without food, for reasons I won't go into. Wikipedia states that after a couple days, the hunger pains go away... mine went away in about 36 hours. &quot;Well, if the hunger pains go away, then what's the downside?&quot; Well, how about the fact that going without nutrition will make you dizzy and weak. To me, it felt like I had gone for too long without sleep. I was weak and could think of nothing but food, I felt like a battery that had lost its charge. Then there's the whole organ damage part. Go too long without nutrition and you will have permanent damage done to your body.
<br />

<br />
Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there's no way someone could sustain themselves on psi only. If you wish to try it, go for it. But don't just stop eating suddenly, do it gradually, slowly. It's safer that way. And if you're doing this to lose weight, then don't do it at all, there are better ways to lose weight... like PROPER diet and exercise. Hell, with the right metabolism, you can do it with just exercise *raises hand.* Go to the gym every now and then, maybe get out and jog for 20 minutes a day. The weight will come off, either that, or the fat weight will be replaced with muscle weight, and your stamina will go up. And finally, if it's a half-assed suicide attempt... then just don't. It's not worth it. There are much better solutions to your problem. And trust me, you're not the only one with problems.

I wont be nice and consoling with you. You're an idiot.  Psi does not sustain you. You need food, and that's all there is to it.  Eating just protein is also not the smartest.  You will get severe vitamin deficiencies that can really give you trouble.  Things like lost eyesight, hair loss, no blood clotting, dizzyness, and what's the other one? Oh yeah, death.

If you want to destroy yourself and watch your body begin to digest its own tissues in a pathetic attempt to feed the heart, lungs, liver, and brain, then be my guest.  If you'd like to live and not be a fucking moron, then give up this anorexic bullshit and start using your brain.

I will not show pity for you when you starve to death, either.

			Umm, I support you all the way, just know when the limit is.  Also from what I've heard, those who fast will have more sensitive taste buds (obviously) so don't put to much salt, sugar, or anything like that on your food because well we got used to it and you wont be.
<br />

<br />
Fasting is fine so I don't see what's wrong with it.  40days go for unless you feel like your gonna die  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> .

			Depending on your metabolism, a month may be long enough to receive permanent organ damage. You need more than just vitamins and minerals, you need energy for your body to run as well. Ever wonder why it's recommended that you get so much food from the breads/grains group? Because carbohydrates are an excellent source of energy. I highly recommend that you keep eating. If we were meant to live without food we wouldn't have been made with/evolved with/&lt;insert whatever you believe&gt; hunger and the desire to eat.

			Before you go risking damage to your body perusing esoteric interests, consider this: 
<br />

<br />
The people that do go without food or very little food generally have some kind of training, or at least an idea that has been tried by other people beforehand. That is, if those people are even authentic. Even if they are, have you ever seen the way they look? It doesn't look healthy. Why not try simply augmenting your body with psi, if you're eager to try using it as an energy source. Try improving what you're already working with, instead of cutting out something that it is very doubtful you can go without. 
<br />

<br />
Just some food for thought.

			I would suggest doing your method without starving first. That way you can see what it will be like. I assume you're going to gather lots and lots of psi to try and sustain yourself.
<br />
 Just to tell you though, my idea of what psi is, is that it's an electrical charge made by the nervous system when potassium and calcium (i think calcium) mix back and forth. The charge holds data which is the signal. The signal is how programming works. Research psi first because I don't think psi is the energy you should be using my friend. With psi you will think you're fine because the signals you are making for the psi are going back to you and making you think you're fine. Check out the nervous system on google and you'll see why psi might not be right for this...
<br />

<br />
Of course, if you have a different opinion/belief on what psi is then it's your decision. That was my advise. Don't discard and waste it. And if you do it, good luck. Try not to die. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
