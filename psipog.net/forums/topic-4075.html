			I've gotten a few messages on how to change eye color so i decided to write this little article in hopes of helping all of you.
<br />

<br />
First of all you should make sure this is what you want because it's not so wise to stop halfway. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Ok so here's my technique
<br />

<br />
Step 1: try to do it before bed, lay down on your bed and relax and calm yourself. focus on the nothingness of your closed eyes. 
<br />

<br />
Step 2: once relaxed visualize your body. see it with it's eyes closed. have the visual body open it's eyes and watch closly the color on it's eye change from your color to whatever color you want. be precise with the exact shade of color that you want it. focus for a while and watch the eye slowly change into that color. 
<br />

<br />
Step 3: have the visual body of yourself walk &quot;into&quot; you and become part of you. then open u'r eyes (not really) and see in front of you a mirror. in the mirror see the desired color. 
<br />

<br />
Step 4: slowly bring yourself back to conciousness. reflect on what you did. you can tell when you did it right because you can just feel it. 
<br />

<br />
do that for about a month. and when you actually look into the mirror see yourself with that color eye, even if it hasn't changed yet. just say to yourself &quot;wow look at the cool new color of my eyes.&quot; i used to even go up to my friends and say &quot;wow look how much my eyes have changed&quot; of course they would say they haven't but i would trick myself into thinking that it was really working. 
<br />

<br />
after about a month of no change it will dramatically start to change and in about a week you'll have the color. i think it's like a mind trigger. after tricking yourself for so long, u'r mind is like &quot;HOLY CRAP MY EYES REALLY ARE (insert color)&quot; 
<br />

<br />
that's basically all i did. hope it helps any of you who want to change your eye color.
<br />

<br />
I changed my eyes from a brown that was almost like a black to a bright gold. it was nice but i didn't keep it up so now i have moderatly light brown eyes. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

			This is DMILS and I do believe not fluff. DMILS = Dirent Mental Influence over Living Systems. For the record, eye color is apart of your bodies living system, I havent played with DMILS much since if I screw up...Well I gotta' live with my body, after all.

eeh. I tried this in less then A minute so I don't think there is any real difference besides the ires's changing size. However I didn't know the outlines of the eyes would change and I have never actually noticed the orange in the past.
