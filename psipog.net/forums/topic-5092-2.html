			Platinum is a very rare element,  so locating enough raw material would probably be harder that just paying someone to make a custom lighter. So now you say, hey why not just built the material.  Well consider this I'm not a full fledged scientist, i don't have any degrees, but my common since would produce this example, please read below.

<br />
When The hydrogen bomb was created it was, and still is one of, if not the, most powerful weapons to exist in our world.  It works by fusing hydrogen atoms into helium.  look at this demonstration <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXbC3hZNAlg" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXbC3hZNAlg</a> .
<br />

<br />
That's the power of the H-bomb.  by fusing Hydrogen the smallest lightest element together to form Helium the second smallest this is the amount of power that was released.  Now consider if you tried to fuse enough hydrogen to form platinum.  you'd take out the f--king state if not more, that's if you could pull it off, I'd doubt : 1) it's possible, and 2) you'd get past the first hydrogen atom breaking.
<br />

<br />
So how about just condensing energy into a atom?  well, you'd still need to produce enough energy equal to at the very least one of those H-bombs (i say this, knowing you'd need much, much, much more, but i don't have a approximate number) the body is incapable of producing that much energy.  And that's for one atom, a lighter is formed of billions upon billions of atoms.  not impossible, just far beyond highly improbable just get the girl or guy something else,  if they are your friend they will be happy you got them anything.

Damn, you did your homework. Im not gonna argue, anyways i found a lighter wit a pentagram on it, so im good. Im still curious though...

			You'd be better off finding a magic lamp, and even then, the genie still couldn't do it. Just buy a zippo.
