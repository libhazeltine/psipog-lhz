			that's what happens to me. If you want to remember your dreams, keep a notebook by your bed and when you wake up, right down everything you remember before it fades away. Not only will you have all your dream written down to read over, this helps you to remember more of your dreams more often and eventually you won't need a notebook.

			That kinda sounds like me.  One of my friends can do something called &quot;Visioning&quot; and its kind of pre-cog I guess.  When I practice, I get deja vu feelings all the time, one time I even knew what was going to happen.  But if you want to remember your dreams, yeah I'd go with the notebook thinggy

			People say deja vu is when they have done something before and remember doing it or something similair to that. For me it's when I haven't done something before or experienced it in any way but remember it somehow if that makes sense.

<br />
Can someone clear this up because I have never been able to understand this?

			Lots of people dont remember their dreams. And yes, i would definately say that, though not all the time... i have deja vu because somehow it actually happened before, if that makes sense. Its like this: I wake up one day, and go through a normal day. One year later, i have that exact day again, but i dont remember that day as it was just a casual day. I feel like its all happened to me before, but i cant remember it actually did.

			I have had a few precogs awake. I have never ever remembered a precog dream before in my whole life. Somehow I remember every other dream or atleast that I had one. It doesn't make sense. Why would I only not remember the precog dreams?
