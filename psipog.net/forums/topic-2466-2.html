I'm only going to get the 360 because Halo3 will not come out for the Xbox.
<br />

<br />
and there's no chance in hell my computer can support it.

Besides, 4 player co-op? That's just awesome <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

I buy relatively few games, I leave that up to my brother. So I'll let him whine to get a PS3.

			Ps3 will not relate to the ps3 users. They are coming out with games that are different from the ones you are used to playing on the ps2. I would die laughing if the ps3 had 1 or 2 good games and then a shitload of JRPGs.

			But so does PS3 with RE5, Devil May Cry, Killzone, etc. 
<br />

<br />
Resident evil 5 is coming to the 360. Devil May Cry will be awesome too, but whats so great about killzone? That game was one of the worst FPSs that i have ever played.

			I'm going to get a PS3 when it arrives.  Its just my style, but i prefer the type of games and amount of RPG's that the Playstation consoles have put out.  I know a lot of people get ticked off when another Final Fantasy comes out but I drool over it, lol.  
<br />

<br />
Now Xbox 360 is pretty neat, and I love the connectivity with Xbox live.  You can play a game, like King Kong, and you get a message that your buddy is now online.  Hit the Xbox live button ont he controller, send him a message via your headset, and within minutes have an online game set up.  Its great.  Xbox has some great multiplayer games, but in my opinion lacks games that are fun to play solo.  Sure Halo 2 is fun for awhile, but quickly loses single player or even co-op appeal.  I don't own an Xbox 360, and I hope they fix that problem with the new generation of Xbox games, but I'm going to wait till PS3 comes out before I buy one. ( I play them plenty often though, I have an inexpensive gaming center here where I live, Ebash rules!!)
<br />

<br />
And I actually am happy that the release date ha sbeen delayed.  More time to fix whatever bugs they find as far as im concerned.  Sure you have to wait but it will eb worth it in the end.  Also, I think that Xbox did rush the release of 360 a little bit.  Now PS3 has had plenty of time to learn from their mistakes, and maybe tweak a few final things, like online capability.  Though not much can be done in such a short time, you don't knwow hat they are capable of unless your actually in the business yourself.
<br />

<br />
And as for Wii, not interested.  I'm sorry but even if it is innovative, I don't really care.  Nintendo has been notoriuos for putting out pretty crappy and/or childish games.  (Super Marios Smash Brothers was good though)  And I HATE Mario!!!  Let him die already!!  Reminds me of a flash animation called &quot;The Decline of Video Games&quot;  in which there was an entire sectin of video games devoted just to him, doing everything you can think of.  Even the RPG's look childish.  All the Zelda games look way to weird, and the sound tracks and sound efects just sound way too cartoony for my taste.  (The newest Zelda game does look pretty badass though.)
<br />

<br />
All in all, I favor the PS3, adn not just because I've been with Sony ever since I outgrew my Sega and Atari.  I know I like Xbox 360, but I'll wait till PS3's release.  I'll probably end up buying both in the long run though, lol, I'm getting into game and simulation programming so I'll want both consoles to play aroudn with my self-made stuff.

			I have an Xbox 360.  I can't get into the discussion as far as hardware is concerned, all I can relate is my subjective experience of the system as formed through playing it.
<br />

<br />
1) The graphics are absolutely outstanding.  I started with an old atari system when I was a kid and I still can't fathom how much better the graphics are with each successive console generation.  The only downside to the 360 as far as graphics are concerned is you aren't getting your money's worth unless you have a Hi-Def television.  The difference in quality between playing 360 on a SDTV and an HDTV are immense.
<br />

<br />
2) There is pretty much zero loading time.  I never played the original Xbox so I can't comment on how much loading time that console required on average, but I do know that PS2 had horrendous loading times that were often required.  
<br />

<br />
3) Certain game titles can only be found on Xbox consoles.  Halo...need I say more?
<br />

<br />
With all said and done, I'm going to buy a PS3 as well, even if the only game I buy for it is Tekken 6.  My praise for the Tekken game series can only be summed up in a four-volume book series, so I won't even go into it here.

Halo is on the PC too though. I know that isn't  console, but just saying that you can play halo for ?20 instead of buying an xbox/xbox 360. I know what your thinking about how much better the graphics would be blah blah blah. I don't really care about the graphics.

			ok. It can be laggy, but it can be laggy on the xbox too. Games on the ps2 like battlefield were definetely laggy when I played them. Was just stating that you can buy it on the pc cheaper too, and for being that much cheaper, I think a little lagg is allowed.

Hence <span style="font-weight: bold">PS2</span>.  A little laggy?  When i played Halo 1, i could not have it on the highest setting of graphics and instead of buying new computers (which cost more than $60) to keep up with the games that improve every month, why not just buy 1 $200-$300 consol and be able to play the games without any lag and great graphics.  I have played a butt load of games on the PS2, PSP, GBA, PC, XBOX, XBOX 360, and the Atari (fun) and i would have to say that the 360 is a lot better than all of them.

Wrong wrong wrong.... I have owned TWO xbox 360s already apollo. THEY SUCK. THEY ARE FUCKING HORRIBLE THINGS that should never, EVER, have been created.
<br />

<br />
They are defective, heavy, and consume MASSIVE amounts of power (horrible on your power bill). They will stop reading your games/dvds, or sometimes bypass thatdefect altogether and just melt the fucking things. Games also freeze. All this due to the hardware of the console, not the software of the game. 
<br />

<br />
Bottom line: Xbox 360 is a huge peice of shit and I recommend NOT buying it to anyone and everyone.
<br />

<br />
Edit: Ps3 will be awesome, but the will the price be right?
<br />

<br />
Wii will be the best of all three in my opinion, because of the new Smash Brothers game coming out for it. 
<br />

<br />
My friends and I are all HARDCORE Smash Brothers fanatics, and three of us (me included) are pretty sure we're among the best players of Smash Brothers Melee for the GC on the face of the planet. We sent #4 (fourth best of us) into a tournament once, and he came out 1st place... And every other group of smash bros players ever to face us walked home hanging their heads in shame... WE ARE THE BEST THERE IS MUAHAHAHA. lol.
<br />

Wii all the way yo.

			I would have to say that me getting an Xbox would be for only one reason. This is Halo. Halo is one of the best war game I have ever played. Although, this is probably only one reason why I would get an Xbox, and to my standards, it wouldn't be worth the money.
