			Actually, PSI is different than Chi/Qi/Ki.
<br />

<br />
I'm a Chi Kung(Qigong) student and a PSI practitioner, and they are very different. They're related- they tend to follow the same natural paths, both energy... etc, but they aren't the same.
<br />

<br />
For one, with Qi, you can't actually make a 'ball' with it- only the FEELING OF a ball. 
<br />

<br />
You can't just make Qi fly around like you can a PSI ball.
<br />

<br />
You can't program Qi other than for healing or hurting- those are the two things it can do, plain and simple.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I hate the people that say it's the same, because it's NOT- PSI is more versatile, but in terms of healing, Qi is MUCH better for most injuries.

			Nevertheless, it is still the same, just different names when it is used for different purposes. Energy is energy. On a superficial level they might look different, but on their most fundamental level, all forms of energy are the same. It is this universal energy, this one energy that acts in different ways and different structure which we use for different purposes and therefore we call it different names. We call it electricity, heat, matter, radiation depending on what it is used for, how it is tructured etc. We give it different names, like we give ice a different name then water, yet fundamentally they are the same. Qi or chi is a term used in different traditions than Psi is. We call it psi on these western on-line forums when we manipulate matter or make a energy-ball. We call it chi when we are in China and make slow movements and focus the energy to heal. We call it Prana when we are in India and practice focussed breathing excersices. It remains energy. I also belief that it is not beneficial if the concept of energy consist out of so many different things in your mind. If you picture energy differently each time it acts different, there exists alot of duality in the mind, if you bring it down to oneness and picture energy as one giant ocean of some sort of information or substance, that is used for different purposes, yet remains that ocean of information/substance, you decrease the duality in your mind, and there fore the disturbance and illusion. Hence: manipulating anything whatsoever becomes easier.
<br />

<br />
This is, of course, my opinion.
<br />

Let's hope you don't hate me now, cause that would disturb you <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			If you look at it like that, yeah, you can consider it the same... yet it is different. Chi is less versatile overall, and it feels different than PSI in my experience. I think they ARE different, even though they come from the same place. Chi is more of a martial energy, and PSI is more a general-purpose energy IMO.

Why hate people? I only hate people that hate people. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

But I think we can agree to disagree for now, I might be wrong, but I might be right.

			You people can't prove it's the same or not the same,so shut the fuck up on whether or not they are the same or not! Jesus fucking christ.

<br />
Most of the energy based ideas that's not related to psi is all religious and belief, so this might intrude to the out come of working with chi or ki...or whatever fuck the others are.

Chi, Qi, Ki, Psi, Prana, Mana, The Force, whatever you want to call it, it's pretty much all the same on that primal level that Martial Artist spoke of earlier.

			I believe this would be the simplest explanation:
<br />

<br />
Psi is the simplest form of energy (or at least some believe) and in this example will be likened to that of water. A person manipulates Qi in his body and this becomes the equivalent of turning the &quot;water&quot; into ice. Once finished it turns back to water and continues on its course. 
<br />

<br />
Even if the use is different the essense remains the same. I think this is where the confusion lies. I believe MA had the right &quot;opinion&quot; (lol), I just thought I'd simplify it for anyone who didn't bother reading it or didn't get it.

Not quite- because Qi is a bit more flowing than ice is. Let's try something else, shall we?
<br />

<br />
PSI is like a remote controlled car. You can control it's every move, even without touching it. it can do alot of things- flip, roll, climb... very easy.
<br />

<br />
Qi is like a hotwheels car... not gonna move on it's own, but when you send it through the launcher, it moves very strongly- but in the same way each time. It can jump, but if it flips or rolls, it's over. Not as versatile, but more powerful in it's limited uses.
<br />

<br />
Let's see if I butchered that explaination enough to hurt some brains.

well said my friend! i agree with your post.
<br />

<br />
we all have different names trying to describe the subtle energy that surrounds us. india, south america, china, japan, egypt, north america, we all are striving to describe the same thing, but our perceptions are different and thus we have different descriptions.
<br />

<br />
as MA has said, bring your mind to the oneness-all-that-is concept, and borders are shattered!
