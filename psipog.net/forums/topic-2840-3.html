			Erm... PK to change an element.... I'm gonna call impossible on that ne for a few resons. Now, most people get tired or get headaches from spinning a psiwheel... this spinning takes very little energy on a purely mechanical 
<br />
POV. Now, imagine the strong binding force of nuclear particles... this force is what holds atoms together, and it takes vast amounts of energy to over come this force. The human body could not ever create that much energy (in a purely biomedical Physics POV) Hence, it would be impossible, and..... if you get a headache from spinning a piece of paper, I can't imagine what you would do trying to match the force of nuclear energy, but it would most probably result in death. Oh, and, changing the atom would create nuclear energy.... hence, you would probably die of radiation as well.

Don't really believe in alchemy myself, each to their own. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Would be cool if it worked though, hah.

I totally forgot about St. Germain.  Indeed, he was a very skilled alchemist (though whether reference to his diamonds was just a description of a sort of radiance he had about him or actual gems I'm unsure of), though I don't know how many people would really know who he was.

			Ernest Rutherford did convert nitrogen into oxygen, making him the world's first &quot;true alchemist.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
As far as using psi to convert the atomic structure of compounds, homunculi, and Full Metal Alchemist goes... well, we may just have to keep dreaming.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

<br />
actually, Lightbringer is correct, believe it or not, lead into gold is a metaphor, and refers to transforming the &quot;crude lead&quot; of the human spirit, into the &quot;purest gold&quot; of divinity, what is called the philosopher's stone, the Sage's stone, the Sage's Jewel, the stone that's not a stone, that is the goal of alchemy, transformation of the human spirit. There is, however, practical alchemy, and it is basically chemistry + alchemical philosophy. 
<br />

<br />
and... you can turn lead into gold, or just about anything, by nuclear means, in fact you can even combine elements to make new ones, my source is... my former geology teacher... he also has a degree in physics, and chemistry... so he's really smart... yeah... and thankfully, he explained to me why radiometric dating, is NOT a load of crap, a big step in removing the garbage that the creationists put in my subconscious.

Yes, but it takes a LOT of heat and pressure. That's why we're having so many problems getting fusion working; we can't find a way to make the fusion generator output more energy than was put in. That's why all our nuclear plants use fission instead of fusion, and incidentally why cold fusion is generally considered pseudoscience.
<br />

<br />
Also, fusing iron into gold would be kind of difficult, since Gold has an atomic number of 79, which would mean that you would need to combine iron with iodine in order to get gold. Obtaining the materials probably wouldn't be too difficult, but actually performing the fusion would require technology that humanity currently doesn't have (it would take a LOT more heat and pressure than simple hydrogen fusion, which we CAN do).

			Yes, we can do hydrogen fusion, but we can only sustain them for a fraction of a second. We do not have any structure that can contain this fusion.

The only use for it currently is in bombs. And we know how useful THOSE are.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

Actually, there's a fusion plant down in the States that actually managed to get about 65% of the energy they put into the reactor back... We can sustain the reaction, but only with large amounts of energy.
