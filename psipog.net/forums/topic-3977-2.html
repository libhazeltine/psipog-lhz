Dude, if you're a budding magician, then say you are.  I don't believe that you were testing to see how gullible we were.  I think it's a safe assumption that, given some of the past posts in this forum, we're pretty good at telling what's flagrantly fake and what is (or could be) genuine.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps if you said something like, &quot;hey guys, i'm studying to be a magician, I'm trying to do this levitation illusion, can you guys tell me how real or fake it looks.  thanks,&quot; it would have been received a bit better.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
And putting it in the general discussion area woulda probably been better. =/

			Personally, i cant see anyone here being skilled enough to levitate themsleves. Actually, i dont see anyone in the world levitating anytime soon. I think that as a society, were going to have to preactice on our free time and not be able to dedicate enough time and exploration into psionics for at least a decade or two. I mean, someone other than uri geller, who is still controversial, has to come forward and be authentic. So until then, im not expecting anything.

			Have you researched spoon bending? I would like to know how he is fake...
<br />
I have read a blog of his on how he first bended a spoon. Spoon bending party, he was skeptic too. Then he looked down thinking it wasn't gonna work and it was bent. Then he did it more. I agree that many of his videos seem fake and he does apply physical force, but that's what you do. You make it mallable first, then you bend it with minimal pressure. Unless you can make it bend under the wieght of gravity. 
<br />
And anyways, there are many other psions out there who could step forward at any time. For all we know, they could be being tested as we type.
