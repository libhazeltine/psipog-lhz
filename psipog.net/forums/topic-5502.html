			Ok. I took a Benadrel (can't spell it) when I went to bed last night. When I woke up I ate some cereal and when to sleep some more. Here's where it gets wierd. The only important parts of the dream that I remember is: I was looking at two trees (oh ya recently I have been trying to OBE in real life). Then I got in a good mood (in the dream). I tried to multiply the mood using force but then all the sudden I starting feeling vibrations. Then my eyes rolled in the back of my head. This happened three times throughout the dream. Then next thing I remember is feeling my arm in the air. I looked and there was my arm laying on me and I couldn't move it. Instead I moved whatever was in the air that I couldn't see but could feel. I wanted it to go up. So my brain sent the impulse to make it go up as if it was my phsyical arm. It made all of these sporadic movements but did go in the general direction I wanted it to go. Then I tried to make it go down. Same thing happened. It goes everywhere left, right, even a little bit back up but still goes down mainly. I'm not sure if I was dreaming or not but I have never had an OBE and don't know what it's like to move during one. Then in the dream the next seen was my computer crashing (I hope I didn't precog)! That has nothing to do with the other stuff.
<br />

<br />
What I really want to know is: Did I OBE for real? (by the way I know that the tree scene was a dream I want to know if the hand thing was a dream) and what the fu** was with the tree scene?
<br />

<br />
*edit* These weren't all one dream. My mom kept waking me up and I kept falling asleep if that helps any
<br />
Another thing, I have never felt vibrations in real life when I try to OBE. That was the first time and only in the dream
