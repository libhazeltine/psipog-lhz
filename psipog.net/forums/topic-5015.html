			Ok I started with the spiral thing in my hand. I can't say I feel the motion of the spiral as a definite shape, or a solid touch, but my hands do seem to get cold.
<br />

<br />
I then tried doing psiballs, my hands get cold and then I experianced small ammount of tingling, just one or two here and there every now and then when I was doing the psiball technique. The tingling was similar to that when you touch a television just after it's been turned off, but more less of the feeling and just here and there.
<br />

<br />
My hands weren't being pushed out, but they began to stiffen, as did my fingers, and I began to feel my arms getting heavier the longer I kept my hands up. I couldn't feel a sold shape, but my hands seemd to place around something and stiffen as I have said.
<br />

<br />
I'm unsure if I have actually made one or not so some comments on this would be good.
<br />

<br />
One thing I did though with my longest psiball that I likely focused most on was throw it at my little brother who was sleeping. I was quite close to him and his eue twitched and he moved his head as though something were annoying him, I tried this a few more times, but nothing happened.

			This is a close call.  The hands were heavy and stiffened most likely because you were holding them up against gravity for so long.  Same with the tingly feeling, although this could also be a psiball.  I would try again and see if I got different results if I were you.
<br />

<br />
Good luck!
<br />

			sounds as you didnt make one but you seem really close. Almost everyone encounters a push or a pull. For me my hands pull together then push apart once the psi ball is created. Keep practing
