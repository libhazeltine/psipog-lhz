People have taken and carbon dated a turtle (alive) from the sea and the dating said he was millons of years old.

People have burying and object (bone, shell, and other things) in their back yard then sent to be carbon dated after a few years in ground and they came out to be like 600,00 years old.

Ever think those people could be lying?  These people claim they send something to the lab then they claim &quot;The lab told me it was X years old!&quot;.  Those very action show that they know shit-all about science in general.  Any lab will test the same sample multiple times so that they can get enough data that they are 95% confident in their true value, mean and standard deviation.  They don't the object is X years old once they've done their tests and plotted the data.  They say it's the &quot;true value&quot; +/- 2x the standard deviation divided by the root of the number of measurments made.  It's not a solid number, it's a description of a statistical bell curve that encompasses 95% of the tested results.
<br />

<br />
The only way I can see a lab actually putting out such a ridiculous result would be if the customer refused to pay for extensive enough testing and only got one sample.  There would then be an off chance that you would get a crazy number.  Even then, the intention of fishing for an innaccurate result is obvious on the part of the customer so we go back to creationists who are willing to lie through statistics to forward their viewpoints.

			I understand where your coming from. I see that you all are ferm belivers of evolution.  Like i said before im not Anit evolution I think we do evolve.  But theres no way we started as like tad pools swiming around.  Do evolutionist have any proof that and animal/human being can have major evolutions?

Creation has some proof.  The bible isnt not just a book many people consider it a text book becuse so many of the things in there are proven by sience.

There's no such thing as a &quot;major evolution&quot;.  We're talking tiny changes over millions of years.

Yes a thousand year old book that many seientist think is practly a text book it is so acurat on events that they have sientificly proven.
<br />

<br />
Also what i ment by major evolution is that if we evoleved to what we are now then if the world is as old as sientist say then some time we had to have shot up and evoled very fast. So if we evolving at the rate we are now this world is umm no number is big enough to be that.

			umm I would add to the argument if it wasn't for the fact that relegion isnt allowed on these forums. It doesn't take a genius to notice that that is exactly what your talking about. I'm suprised this thread wasn't banned earlier actually  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> you've all kept it on topic for a very long time, I'm impressed.

Evolution is a relegion.

			The bible is by no means a textbook.  I'm sure historians have studied it and found that there is some accurate chronological order to it, since of course it was being added to and rewritten as time passed.  If you're going to try and tell me that scientists regard the bible as a textbook, and maintain a straight face while doing so, then I'd suggest you provide some support for your statements.  Maybe a link to a website or two concerning this type of research or study.
<br />

<br />
As Johnny said, evolution occurs in baby steps, and I'm pretty sure that 6 million years is enough time to evolve into what we are today.
<br />

<br />
Evolution isn't a religion, nor is it even close to being like religion since one of them founded upon empirical evidence and logic, while the other is founded upon assumptions and personal realities.  I'll let you figure out which is which.

You're just playing with semantics.  Evolution is not a &quot;superhuman agency&quot; in the way that the conception of God is a &quot;superhuman agency.&quot;  Secondly, I've never read anything where evolutions claims &quot;why&quot; we are here in the grand sense of the universe as religion does.  Evolution is used to explain how complex organisms like ourselves and other organisms developed from simpler organisms.  Religion is used to explain everything that a religious person can possibly apply religion to.  Since a religious person's conception of God is all-knowing and all-powerful and all-influencing, then any questions as to &quot;why&quot; are quickly answered with &quot;because God.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Your simple comparisons between evolution and religion, based on wordplay, negates the vast differences in the bodies of literature that pertain to each.
