			I've been cruising the forums for a while now, and I've noticed a lot of threads like, &quot;Psychokinesis: real or fake?&quot; and &quot;Otherkin real or fake?&quot;
<br />

<br />
These threads tend to get locked pretty quick. So I was thinking, why don't we just not make threads that are solely for the purpose of debating the legitimacy of something we can't prove or disprove in completeness?

			If PK was fake, then how does all those statistics on dice rolling, end up the way they are considering that for a 100 rolls of a 6 number dice that each number should come up 17 times other then 2 numbers only being 16 times by the laws of averages. There have been multiple document cases where the manipulated number has only come up less then 10 times and or more then 25 times on a 100 roll test. 
<br />

<br />
Also, how about the fact that there are also studies shown that there will be a certain numbers of 1 and 0 on a floppy disk and the psion is suppose to alter the number of those two numbers and then when the floppy disk is put back in that it's frequently have a completely different amount of 1's and 0's then was origionally recorded. Also on the same series of tests, there are also correlation shown of the pattern is altered. 
<br />

<br />
Just a little food for thought for those of you that wish to say that PK doesn't exist. If it doesn't exist, how is it that there are whole communities dedicated to the discussion of this, and capable of abnormal movements of objects that the laws of physics do not and can not account for.

I'd like it if you guys didn't simulate a debate, as it can turn to a flame-war on a dime. Instead, can we just discuss it?

Delusion? As in you want it to be real so much that you blow on the psiwheel but it doesn't register in your mind. So in effect you see the psiwheel moving but not that you've blown on it (pretty far fetched I know)

			again, as i have said in past threads, how is it an illusion if i put the pencil down in one place and pick it up in another.  Fine, wind.  What about a hole-puncher?  It would be pretty hard to blow on that and have it move.

			hmm i can't spin the psi-wheel, or should i say, i can't spin it very well? today i made some progres...
<br />
it became a bit faster and a bit slower and faster... windows were closed and i've held my breath...
<br />
and even if i blow, it wouldn't only rotate but also whip up and down on the sides...
<br />

<br />
now what could move it? heat?
<br />
the way the psi-wheel is built, heat would never make it spin around 360 degrees...

<br />
and if it's under a glass?
<br />
the wind wouldn't do it...
<br />
and the heat wouldn't spin it around 360 degrees...
<br />
what could be the reason for the never ending rotation?
<br />
random quanta fluctuations?

It wouldn't have to be exclusive to blowing on a psi wheel. That was just an example. You could move anything with your hand and convince yourself that you hadn't touched it (if you were delusional enough) Like I said its a far fetched theory. I just said it because &quot;normal&quot; people think we're all delusional.
