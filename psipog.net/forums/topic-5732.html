			Yeah, My friend told me about this one guy who said that he was hired by the gov. to use RVing to do random things, and did this study on &quot;Proof Positive.&quot;  I just wanna see the stuff the government came up with.  Do you know of anyplace that has some sort of official write up?

Last time I checked the government no longer did research on remote viewing, unless of course you know something I don't or you're privy to classified information.

			it was the CIA who did the research on RVing and yes they had many great results but will never admit it as always.
<br />

<br />
hard to beleive that during the cold war that the USA used psionics against the russian's. but soon as the Soviet Union collapsed their was no reason left for the unit so funding was cut and the unit shut down.

			The United States did extensive research and devopment into RV from the 70s up to 1995. The people who did it was a clandestine and classified unit known under many names: PROJECT GRILL FLAME, PROJECT SUN STREAK, PROJECT CENTER LANE, and lastly as PROJECT STARGATE. It was run by US Army Intelligence for a good number of years, until the CIA took it over, as it was a very effective and efficient means of spying on the US's enemies, namely the Soviet Union. 
<br />

<br />
It became public afterr a major by the name of Ed Dames left the unit, refined the process of CRV, named it TRV, started up a company known as PSI-Tech, and announced the unit's existance to the world. The CIA and an independent research firm (hired by the CIA) did an extensive investigation into the unit, and determined that it was useful and real, but not of merit to the United States Government. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">[EDIT: It's widely speculated that the US Government still has a top-secret RV program, but there's no publicly-availible evidence to back this up. It would all be classified, if it existed. I wouldn't doubt that it exists, but that they're keeping tight-lipped about it. Given how well STARGATE did, it seems logical that they keep a secret program, but nobody knows about it because the government wants to stay in.]</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">I'd speculate that it was determined as such so that the government in power would get re-elected, and not get deposed for supporting and funding psis such as were in the unit. But that's my opinion.</span>
<br />

<br />
Most of the information regarding the unit has been declassified, and many of the ex-members of the unit (such as Jow McMoneagle, Lyn Buchanan, and David Morehouse) have written books based on their experience in the unit, and Joe and Lyn have both set up RV-based companies, after seeing how well PSI-Tech did. 
<br />

<br />
BTW, PSI-Tech sells videotapes that teach you how to remote view using a refined method called Technical Remote Viewing (TRV). I don't know how good they are, because I don't want to shell out the $500 to buy the entire set. It's like, 12 videos, but I still can't muster the cash.
<br />

<br />
Any more questions?

			Well, not a single website, but you can refer him to the following:
<br />

<br />
1. <span style="font-style: italic">Remote Viewing Secrets</span> by Jow McMoneagle
<br />
2. <span style="font-style: italic">The Seventh Sense</span> by Lyn Buchanan
<br />
3. PSI-Tech (<a href="http://www.remoteviewing.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.remoteviewing.com/</a>)
<br />
4. <span style="font-style: italic">Psychic Warrior</span> by David Morehouse (Fairly autobiographical, but reads like a novel, hence why it's at the end of the list.)
<br />

<br />
You could also google &quot;Project STARGATE&quot;, and that'll give you some results. There's also a link to <span style="font-style: italic">PJ's Remote Viewing Firedocs</span> on the PsiPog links page.
<br />

<br />
Glad to be able to help.
