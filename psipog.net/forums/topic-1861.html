			For both options:
<br />

<br />
A) Doing bio-pk risks making a mistake and screwing things up more than they already area, really get a medical professional to fix your eyes (if this is applicaple, depends on what problem you have), lot less risk there. If it was so easy to do we'd hear about succesful bio-pk miracles more.
<br />
B) If you've read some of Rainsong's stuff you can damage nerves and other stuff by feeding too much energy through them, its probably not a good idea to have a pocket of energy that close to your eyes for long periods of time.

I trust myself in &quot;Bio-PK&quot; then doctors with their fancy tools that have pontiental of damaging and knowing &quot;Hey, he fucked me up and I can't do shit about it!&quot; then &quot;Hey, I fucked myself up, Damn, why doesn't this surprise me?&quot;.

			While I'll agree with you that there possibly could be some risk associated with attempting BioPK on yourself, the first arguement you used was quite felacious. Just because something hasn't been heard of &quot;more&quot; doesn't mean it's not as credible.
<br />

<br />
Secondly, focusing on &quot;improving&quot; your eye sight and focusing on your eyes, in my opinion, will not grant a negative affect on your eye sight. It seems to me that whenever I focus on doing &quot;good&quot; in my body, with out focusing large quantities of &quot;psi&quot; in specific locations, I seem to never have adverse affects. The intention to &quot;heal/help/repair&quot; always seem to get the job done.
<br />

<br />
Another kind of &quot;quick question&quot; I'm going to throw in here... Who here has actually hurt themself doing Psi?

well stop making dense energy for &quot;bio-PK&quot; since I don't think it's necessary.

			If you do Bio-PK with a broad intention, then it's unlikely you would harm yourself.  As Sheep said, if you hold the intention, &quot;I want my eyes to safely heal so my vision becomes clear and percise&quot;, then you are sending a safe message to your body.  Your body hears your thoughts - express what you want, and let your body find a way.
<br />

<br />
However, let's say you read about how the eye works, and you learn that bad vision is caused by imperfect sphere shaped eyeballs.  So you send the message, &quot;I want my eyeball to flatten on the left side&quot;, reasoning that it will fix your vision.  Well, that's where Bio-PK becomes dangerous - because you've just told your eyeball to flatten on a side based on your research.  Don't try and interrupt your body's processes - instead, tell your body which process it should use.  The process of healing is already programmed in your body - you don't need to tell your body how to heal - just tell it to HEAL.  It will choose the pre-programmed process that accomplishes your goals.  The body understands.
