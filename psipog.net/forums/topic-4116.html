			Well, i decided to try to &quot;see&quot; subway trains and judge how far they are before my stop. I live in NYC, so thats what i travel on. So far, i can see it for a split second in my mind, but feel its distance. What kind of clairvoyance is that? Like, I can time its arrival to the station. I freak my firends out alot, like ill say &quot;Its 2 stations away&quot; or &quot;200 meters...150....100....50....here&quot; and boom there it comes. Its really new, but for the past 2 months, i like it.

			Haha I had a similar experience to that. I was really little, my dad was driving back from some camp thing, and I said &quot;ok starting from this telephone pole, it will be.. 143 telephone poles before we reach our home town&quot; and weird enough I was exactly right. I tried it other times in my own amazement but I wasn't as accurate anymore. It might have been a fluke.. I donno. My dad freaked out lol.

			The ability is called intuition. I practice it on a deck of cards ocassionally. Whats funny though is that although my guesses are somtimes wrong I won't accept them, and I migtht drop a card and have it be it. It's pretty fun.

			lol that would be hilarious. Although I can't figure out a way in order to do this without people thinking its a trick. I've seen some incredible things done with cards and I really doubt magically dropping the card your thinking of is going to impress anybody. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> Anybody know methods of proving this trick?

			Well, i know how to card count and keep a stack while shuffling, so its pretty simple to set up. False shuffles, etc. Just memorize alot.

			I don't want to cheat to be right. I want to prove that I couldn't have done this without the use of intuition. I don't know how it would be done though because it is probably really easy to fake.

			I always thought it was a form of remote viewing....I used it at a water park by looking to how many tubes would pass before a certain person would come up and I was mostly right. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			I guess maybe i've had similar experiences too. When I drive and someone in front is driving under the speed limit (i HATE that) I just think ok what should i do? should i change lanes or stay? 
<br />

<br />
well all of a sudden ill get this burst of imformation that tells me what that person is planning on doing, like making a right or left up ahead or just stay put. 
<br />

<br />
So now i make my decisions off of that cause i just think, oh this guy is goin into the left lane, i'm just gonna wait until he moves and then i'll just speed up when he's gone. 
<br />

<br />
know what i mean?

			I've done somthing similar to that as well. Except I would predict if cars were coming from the other direction. I don't try to do anything to fancy though because I am jsut learning to drive. Dont be so mean to people who drive slow. There might be a reason <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> .

			ok. you're right there probably is some reason. i dont mind if they go the speed limit. heck, it's the law. 
<br />

<br />
if they've got their blinkers on, its ok. that tells me there might be a heavy load or some sort of mechanical problem and they don't want to push the car passed its limits. other than that, there's really no good excuse to be driving under. ya they may be old, (oh i love that southpark episode with the old people drivers) but that doesn't mean you can't at least go the speed limit.
