			Umm... pyrokinesis is on the list of allowed terms.  What exactly are you getting upset over?  I don't know who came up with &quot;psychokinetic heating&quot;.  My first post clearly says any *kinesis terms NOT inside of my post aren't allowed.

The point is: we have higher standards.  We demand more from the community.  We challenge people to do some intelligent research.  We want to teach people to be more critical and scientific about their psychic phenomenon.  And I'm not alone!  The moderators aren't pissed about having to go around and close threads with stupid terms.  If it were up to some moderators, they would just delete the thread, or ban the user immediately.  And there are communities that do just that.
<br />

<br />
PsiPog is not a place where 13 year olds can come and post their latest and greatest psi theories with 2 weeks experience.  PsiPog is not a place where people can say whatever they want and expect everyone to immediately accept everything they say as fact.  We demand more from the community because we demand more from ourselves.  We have high standards for the community, and we're anal about stuff like this, because we have high standards for ourselves.
<br />

<br />
The average psychic community is riddled with people who want to feel special without doing anything, and just want to skate by with the feeling of authority without earning it.  They take advantage of the fact that most psychic communities are very lovey dovey and &quot;understanding&quot;.  Well, at PsiPog, we think that's bullshit.  People should be accountable for their actions.  People should be accountable for their ideas.  If you post something, you better be prepared to back it up.  You better be prepared to deal with the skeptical mindset.

End rant.

			nice rant actually!  I am just saying that a couple terms (that are not already allowed) should be allowed such as &quot;chronokinesis&quot; and maybe some others.  You have Biokinesis on there and that is one that I thought would not be accepted <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.  The reason people ask for help on &quot;geokinesis&quot; (using that as an example) is because, as we all should know, they use different techniques.  Even if you dont know this, why do you think there is a whole article separate called &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;?  They use different techniques.  I am certainly NOT saying that we should allow &quot;geokinesis&quot; because I think that is horrible, but certainly &quot;chronokinesis&quot; (because that is a completely different technique), &quot;Electrokinesis&quot; (because technically, that is electricity and not TK (mind over <span style="font-weight: bold">matter</span>)), and maybe some others.  Ones <span style="font-style: italic">like</span> &quot;geokinesis&quot; <span style="font-style: italic">are</span> moving matter so that basically <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> PK.  Do you get my point of what I am trying to say?

			Sean, was that directed to me? my post was directed towards the following:
<br />

<br />
 &quot;I say stop with the arguments and let some call it pyro, cryo, hydro or what ever the heck they want....Some people have been using those terms longer than some of you have been alive. Stop focusing on terms this IS NOT an exact science. You show your own stupidity every time you put down something that has existed longer than psipog. If you absolutely don't like how someone says something, get over it. psychokenetic heating or whatever the heck you call is possibly the worst name for that skill I've ever heard!!! A lot of us would appreciate if you would get off our backs for WORDS. It shows an immaturity that isn't needed when it comes to potentially deadly powers.&quot;
<br />

<br />
oh and powers, you said:
<br />

<br />
&quot;and if we really have to watch what we say...the cursing level of some is not good And a lot of those who do it are as young as my little brother. That IS NOT acceptable in my view and SHOULD be delt with before terms...There is no need for it in a place were people are to come to learn. 
<br />

<br />
I say put a profanity block...if anyone uses it their reply/thread should be taken out.&quot;
<br />

<br />
well, Profanity has 100% nothing to do with any of the rules, and has the same amount of nothing to do with learning, and as for the kinesises, it is not sensible to differentiate the type of matter you move, I.E. moving dirt is the same as moving chicken feathers, paper, and monkey tails.

			Again, pyrokinesis, cryokinesis, electrokinesis, and chronokinesis should be allowed.  They are not manipulating matter (except for pyro and cryo).  There are different techniques for it all.  Biokinesis is on the list, why arent the above?  Geokinesis, yeah, you are moving dirt.  Obviously, that is regular pk (moving matter with your mind).   But others are not.

			whiteraven...Profanity is against the rules in schools, WHY?   
<br />

<br />
Because it pushes buttons and gets people steamed.  Maybe I'm to old fashioned for this, but I do know that it's hard to be nice to some one when they tell you that your ideas are *bullshit* (sorry sean I know you use it) when your being honest and trying to share your findings with others...people know what's fluff and what's not...there's no point in people posting things like that when they don't understand or can't comprehend something.  It's rude and there is something in the rules about being... 
<br />
1. Be <span style="font-weight: bold">Nice </span>
<br />
2. Be Involved 
<br />
3. Be Honest 
<br />
4. Be <span style="font-weight: bold">Intelligent</span> 
<br />
5. Be <span style="font-weight: bold">Fair </span>
<br />
6. Be <span style="font-weight: bold">Understanding </span>
<br />
7. Be Willing to Work
<br />

<br />
Yeah, I think if anything should be stopped it should be the profanity.

uh...  &quot;Nice&quot; I really never understood it, for some assclown reason it's considered more polite to say &quot;sex&quot; or &quot;screw&quot; instead of &quot;fuck&quot; I DO NOT understand why this is so because they all mean the same thing, &quot;screw&quot; is used the same way as &quot;fuck&quot;, but &quot;fuck&quot; is considered more vulgar. WHY?! it makes no goddamn sense!!! 
<br />
&quot;Intelligent&quot; 
<br />

<br />
You can be intelligent and use curse words, hell, all of eldibs articles on his site have cursing, and almost all of them are intelligent
<br />

<br />
&quot;Fair&quot; 
<br />

<br />
If a judge curses constantly it in no way inhibits justice from being carried out.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Understanding&quot; 
<br />

<br />
you can swear and be understanding, take note:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Your girlfriend fucked someone else, that's awful, dump that bitch.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Your girlfriend had sex with someone else, that's awful, dump her.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Note that these two sentences are exactly the same aside from the cursing, they are the same, sentence 2 is in no way more sympathetic.

There are parents who may accept their childs want to study psi, but the second they decide to see what their child is doing and sees cursing everywhere they're going to stop the child from comeing here.

This is not a dating cite so who's gonna be talking about screwing anyone.  F#$* has no place here. niether does B*%ch  or any other words that deal with sex and name calling.
<br />

<br />
Who cares what the heck eldibs puts on his cite...I for one don't intend to visit any &quot;informational&quot; cite filled with cursing and other profanities.  And I doubt many others will enjoy that type of learning.  
<br />

<br />
oh and the reason F@#! is a curse word is because it's german and because of injustice and tyranny you had to be approved by a higher official before you could have sex...thus F@#! is now a very rude way to say it...

I personally never felt bad about swearing.  I try to stay away from &quot;fuck&quot; on the site, but I use words like &quot;hell&quot;, &quot;shit&quot;, &quot;crap&quot;, &quot;bullshit&quot;, &quot;horseshit&quot;... probably a few others I'm forgetting.  I think excessive swearing is bad, but I also think a well placed swear word can drive your meaning across better.

I swear here.  It's used to express my shock.  I suppose the reason it doesn't bother me is because I never really understood why swearing was such a big deal in the first place.  Words are harmless.  Ideas are much more dangerous.  Excessive swearing bothers me only because it shows a lack of creativity and is hard to read - not because it offends me.  I don't know of any kid who wasn't allowed to visit PsiPog because of the swearing (that doesn't mean it hasn't happened... I just don't know of any).

The term &quot;fuck&quot; is not german, by the way.  I forget which king it was, but he liked to have sex outside of his marriage.  Well, once the peasants heard of this they believed that they should have the right.  So, in order to get the right to have sex outside of marriage, they would have to have the kings approval.  Another requirement for doing so was a note on the door to the bedroom/or house that read &quot;Fornication Under Kings Consent&quot;.  See the connection?
