			i think your problem is your trying to bend it with your mind...you just put lots of energy into the spoon/fork until it gets soft then just bend it with your hands. also theres an article about it on psionline....

			You've seen mercury right? The metallic liquid element? Well imagine the fork or spoon is slowly turning into mercury, its sloshy and metallic, soft but still liquidy and easier to morph.
<br />

<br />
Hope that helps.

			you can make it bend without using your hands.  make it soft enough that gravity bends it.  As for techniques, i dont know what I do so i cant help you.

			I've bent spoons for people in my family and friends. It's all about chakras/feeling and visualization similar to ShadowWolf's. It's funny this was posted. I have a meeting with a manager coming up. He wants to see my spoon bending. My goal(s) right now include revealing psychic phenomena to the world under SCIENTIFIC conditions. That and getting my PhD, lol.

			I tried spoon bending a while ago and havn't thought about it for ages. I mananged to make it slightly soft but not as much as i would like. And just to get this straight: 
<br />
To bend it is like putting energy into a psi ball because i tried spoon bending before i knew about psi balls? And then you just visualize it becoming like mercury? If it is that then its easier than i thought. lol i was doing it completely wrong. I did that technique where you just leave it for ages and let it bend itself using your subconcious after you put some energy into it.

			btw, why isn't there a forum specifically for spoon bending yet? There maybe should be. Peebs if your reading this then could you make one, or if not then possibly for the future, non-temporary forums. Not really sure if this topic should be in &quot;techniques&quot;. Then again it is a technique, but all phsychic abilities are, so...
