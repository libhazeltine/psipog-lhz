			Ever notice how older people are better at PK?  Not saying young psions cant do it, but most of the more accomplished 'pkers' on Psipog are older(JoeT, NI, Anne, Peebrain).  Why is this?  Just more time practacing?  Less scater brain?  Dont give it up on a whim?

			yeah the practice thing is probably one of the biggest differences. Also scatter brain is probably less prominent in the elders. I am 16 and when I am practicing PK I seem to drift off and break concentration a lot.

			What do you mean by older? I'm 10 years older than most on this channel, and I just believe in myself &quot;I can&quot; <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Can't say that I'm best in every part of things, but in few of 'em I really am better than on the other ones. Telepathy seemed for me to work &quot;out-of-the-box&quot;, so at first try I played for shapes and colors, I received perfectly what other one was sending [though, she wasn't too good at it herself, first time for both of us], and so did she.
<br />

<br />
Point of my post is, if &quot;junior&quot; psions just are going through normal youngster stuff, and don't know yet what to believe in, it might be their &quot;mental barrier&quot;, and when they receive some [more] experience during their life, they will start to see things in different ways [so everything isn't their parents fault, and life doesn't suck <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />].
<br />

<br />
It's all about your own attitude, if you go in to things like &quot;Yeah, right.. that can't be true&quot;, then your sub-c believes in you, and you may not [maybe ever] succeed in it [maybe you will, depends how you change your opinions.. well you get it when you grow up, if you don't yet]. So, before you start to see things as an &quot;adult&quot;, just keep on practicing, it will really help you afterwards. Your opinions might change even too radically and you might become a &quot;hard&quot; skeptic, which doesn't believe in any stuff which you haven't seen. [Used to work on my own parents, but mom had a strike of lightning when she was young, and after that she usually knows when phone is going to ring, and even knows who is caller before answering, so I think that &quot;broke&quot; my own mental barrier.. EDIT: oh, and she also knew when I was in trouble and called me, and stuff like that, maybe it's moms sense, maybe it's something telepathical, don't know, and maybe I won't ever, but this story works great to unblock most of barriers in your mind]

			I believe it's because they're minds are more mature and because they have seen a lot of things in their life.. as for the ones who don't pick it up fast, it's because they don't think it's possible even if they see it, they may think it's  a trick, or they may be afraid of change, causing a mental block

			Ah, I saw this pic of this one girl that got hit in the back.  Sweeeet scar, It looked like a crazy lighting tatoo.  lol  besides the whole, 'not choosing to have it' part, it was cool.  I always thought those, &quot;hit on the head and gained psychic abilities&quot; were all bull.  Guess not, I'll take your word for it.  lol

			I was little bit skeptic about those thingys too, but once when I was visiting my mom, and we discussed some chitchat. She wondered &quot;Hmm.. I think my sister is going to ring me soon&quot;, after few seconds phone started to ring.. And guess who was on the other side of the line.. Her sister.. Well, that isn't only case when she has told something similiar.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
