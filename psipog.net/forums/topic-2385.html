SECRETS OF REMOTE VIEWING REVEALED AT WEEKEND INTENSIVE
<br />
*************************************
<br />

<br />
The World's Most Famous Teacher Shows You How To Tap Into Its Awesome Power
<br />

<br />

<br />
Dear E-News Reader,
<br />

<br />
I wanted you to be amongst the first to know about is our exciting new 2-day REMOTE VIEWING INTENSIVE - 15th &amp; 16th July at the University London Union, Central London.
<br />

<br />
Remote Viewing (RV) is a scientific method of learning to 'see' things in the universe beyond the reach of your five senses.
<br />

<br />

<br />
For more information about the weekend or to book your place: <a href="http://www.wddty.co.uk/thefield/noflash/remoteviewing.asp" target="_blank">http://www.wddty.co.uk/thefield/noflash/remoteviewing.asp</a>   
<br />

<br />

<br />
We are thrilled to announce that Paul H Smith, arguably one of the world's top remote viewing trainer, is coming over exclusively from the USA to teach this Intensive in the UK.
<br />

<br />
Unlike many other RV courses, this intensive weekend offers a highly skilled-based training instructor personally taught by the originators of RV - the legendary psychic Ingo Swann &amp; renowned physicist Hal Puthoff. 
<br />

<br />
Paul Smith served for seven years in the CIA's STARGATE programme and taught Remote-Viewing operators to mentally travel across countries and enter facilities that were protected by metal Faraday cages and armed with EM flytrap field generators.
<br />

<br />
All of these phenomena indicate that something not limited by Einstein's theory of relativity and Maxwell's EM field equations is acting as the carrier for RV.
<br />

<br />
As Paul says, &quot;You don't have to be psychic to learn and use remote viewing.  We all have the inner mental power - we just don't know we possess it.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
For more information about Paul Smith or to book your place: <a href="http://www.wddty.co.uk/thefield/noflash/remoteviewing.asp" target="_blank">http://www.wddty.co.uk/thefield/noflash/remoteviewing.asp</a> 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Our ability to develop this inner knowledge is usually crowded out by our busy, distracted waking consciousness.  But with an experienced teacher like Paul, and the right, positive attitude, you too can learn to become a remote viewer and access your own incredible mental powers.
<br />

<br />
You'll be learning how to get into the state, how to distinguish between 'signal' (your accurate, remote-viewed sense impressions) and 'noise' (your conscious mind's analytical overlay, which is usually wrong). 
<br />

<br />
Unlike most 'remote viewing' workshops, this is a true intensive: with loads of specific work over the two days.  You'll come away with the tools to make non-local contact with targets hundreds, or even thousands of miles away.  
<br />

<br />
Due to the nature of the training, there will be a strict limit on numbers, and as you might expect from an event of this calibre, demand is already proving high - so early booking is essential.
<br />

So check it out if you are interested. Lynne McTaggart is the author of the book: <span style="font-style: italic">The field</span>. Which is about quantum mechanics and Zero-point energy (field). You may want to read that book.

Ahh well, heh maybe I can peek in on it and see the people...Wonder if the experienced RVers will notice my presense if I do*shrugs*.
