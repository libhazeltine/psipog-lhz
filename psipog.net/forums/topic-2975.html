			I'm not sure about you guys, but I have a kind of funny story i'd like to share, feel free to post any you have. Well, when I was first trying the psiwheel about a year ago, I got pretty good at turning it clockwise. I tried turning it counter-clockwise... and couldn't. Looks like I built a mental block or something, and it's an arse to turn it counter-clockwise now. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			Psychokinesis is not nice to me, it goes and does whatever it wants and goes the way I don't want it to.  But PK is so addictive that I quickly forgave it...

			During class, about 5 days ago, i was bored as fuck.  I was in spanish class, and the teacher was lecturing about finals.  i turned on her tape recorder and music started playing.  I'm sure that made her class more interesting.  she came over and was like &quot;how the fuck is this button pushed down?&quot;  I laughed my ass off all of the way home.

			Once during a math class I was having trouble with the last question, so I decided to try to scan someone I thought knew the answer. The lights started to dim and flicker like crazy and people started to laugh because of that. It was pretty funny. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> Unfortunately I couldn't make out the answer (it was pretty complicated).

			This one was unexpected: I had my bit of psiwheel(no tack, just the paper) in front of me, and in front of the keyboard. At the time I was talking on the forums, and then when I looked down at the paper, it wasn't there, it was BEHIND the keyboard! So it had somehow moved from inbetween me and the keyboard to inbetween the monitor and the keyboard. I was like wtf? It was really funny though. No fans, no AC. I couldn't think of any other way of it getting there.

			Here's a funny story that I tell sometimes...
<br />

<br />
Back in my college days, I worked part-time in this office where I basically helped out the secretaries there.  Usually they didn't have any work for me, so I would sit alone in the copier room.  I used that time to practice PK.
<br />

<br />
So one day, I had like a 4 hour shift, and practiced PK the entire time... playing with the pinwheel, and thinking about how it could work, and what's going on.  Finally my shift was over, and I went downstairs to go to my next class.  I was walking towards the door, when I thought, &quot;Screw the pinwheel, I should just try moving big things!&quot;  Seeing the door ahead of me, I walked up to it while focusing on opening the door.  To my surprise, the door actually opened!  For about an entire second I was freaking out... until I realized that it was a motion sensor door <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
