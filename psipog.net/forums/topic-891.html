			Yeah it tastes a little like mashed potatoes.  With a little sour cream on the top. I often take this for desert if there is no real food. I often burn my mouth though, remember to let it cool down first, or else you'll have blisters all over your tongue.

Ps. Is it 3 o clock in the mornin' over there? Or what..<img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />
Ps2. No but seriously, it could be possible, but then it would only be your mind telling you it tastes like something. I find this a funny suggestion though <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> .

Doubt there's any nutritional value though. About the same taste and nutritonal value as McDonalds.

Ive never tried it, but great idea! lol... I dont think it would actually satisfy hunger, rather fool the mind into thinking you are full hehe.

			I've done something like this before! I made a psi-strawberry! Didn't have alot of texture but it still tasted (vaguley) of strawberries. Eh, what do you expect for a auto-programming construct left alone for 5 minutes? I still needed a real strawberry to do it though, so it kind of defeats its own purpose. IF you don't believe me, track down Kundalini and ask him, I sent it to him when we were practicing.

Oh yeah and then when you die from hunger, you can ask yourself why because you didn't know you were hungry huh? I believe that programming it a taste could possible work mentally, but you would not fool yourself into thinking you weren't hungry. It would probably just be for fun or something...

Yeah, but you don't have to eat the strawberry, so you can use the same strawberry to make multiple strawberry-flavored constructs.
<br />

<br />
You could possibly use the edible psi as a flavoring. Find out what's for lunch at school the next day, and carry some flavored psi-balls to mix with your lunch, to enhance the flavor (or to give it some flavor, depending on how good your school's food is).

			A construct is just an extended separation of willpower from the self.  When you ?make? a construct you are actualizing your intent into an action, that action can be whatever you want.
<br />

<br />
Normally you would 'see' the construct, what you are actually seeing is an interpretation of the conceptual manifestation of the intent, this will be interpreted in a personal way and will thus appear different to different people, unless the creator of the construct has visualized the construct and has included the intent of the look of the construct.
<br />

<br />
You can also taste the flavoural interpretation of the conceptual manafestation, this would again taste different to other people becuase deffereent people would have different flavours for different idea.  However the creator could manefest an idea of the flavour of the construct at the same time, thus giving you the desired flavour.

<br />
In short, what he's saying is that the construct isn't really there, it's just your mind performing the desired actions, and sending you information via your senses instead of actually feeling or seeing the construct. That makes a little bit of sense, but isn't necessarily true.  It's possible that there really isn't any psi in the psi ball, but it's possible there is.
<br />

<br />
Next time, Orthas, I recommend you use phrases like &quot;In my opinion,&quot; &quot;this is what I think,&quot; and &quot;it's possible that,&quot; instead of automatically assuming your theory is true. And try to be more clear cut with your next post. All the $6 words in the world won't help if they can't read your post.
