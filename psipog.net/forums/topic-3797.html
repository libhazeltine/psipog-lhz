			Alright, I'm not sure if this goes under constructs or psiballs, so feel free to move it.

Anyway, my friend and I have been sending programmed psiballs to eachother from... basically across the country. I tend to get what he sends me, and we were freaking eachother out for a while because I picked up on so many details, and it was only our first one. So we've done this for a day or two... but when I send them to him... they're like... my sub-thoughts and not what I sent him.
<br />

<br />
Such as, I sent him a ball with something in it... but he picked up the flower on my dresser and my craving for tea instead. Although amusing it's rather annoying...
<br />

Any help would be great.

It sounds to me like you and your friend have a psionic/energy link. This can be good or bad, depending on how compatable the two of you are.

			And you still didn't answer it randywm.....
<br />
btw, I'm not answering it because I don't know and I'm not that experienced in sending contructs. It may just be the programming. Try rephrasing what you are telling it.

If you send energy into someone else, then you must be controlling that energy, thus you are connected to that energy, thus your energy is a connection to you, thus your sending energy into the other person made you connect to them.
<br />

<br />
Dispell their energy if you want to break the connection, amoung other things... Or you may be able to completely assimilate/digest it.
<br />

<br />
If your friend is of the opposite sex, or if your friend is quite a useful/good person, I would guess that your body would naturally want their energy more.
<br />

<br />
But... if you learn how to digest it all, then the other person will not be in control of it anymore. This can sometimes cure a romantic &quot;crush&quot;, I am guessing. [When you assimilate and digest their energy, instead of just leaving it inside of you and connecting/linking with the energy source]

<br />

<br />
Sam E 5:  alright 
<br />
 Sam E 5:  I got it! 
<br />
 Sam E 5:  I'm going to my room 
<br />
 Sam E 5:  and I'm going to find an object 
<br />
 Sam E 5:  and I'm going to send the info to you 
<br />
 Sam E 5:  and you figure out what it is 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  sounds good
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  /:o)
<br />
 Sam E 5:  alright 
<br />
 Sam E 5:  brb 
<br />
 Sam E 5:  okay 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  smooth
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  metalic
<br />
 Sam E 5:  I made the energy into it 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  curling iron
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  lol
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  something like that
<br />
 Sam E 5:  on the right track 
<br />
 Sam E 5:  Whats the shape? 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  cylindrical
<br />
 Sam E 5:  is there something odd about the curling iron? 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  yes
<br />
 Sam E 5:  lol 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  that it doesnt have the heating part, or that ahm...
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  hinged part
<br />
 Sam E 5:  okay 
<br />
 Sam E 5:  what does it have? 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  pen
<br />
 Sam E 5:  no 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  brush
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  no
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  im not sure
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  :o|
<br />
 Sam E 5:  it's hard 
<br />
 Sam E 5:  maybe I didn't stress the ends enough 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  key?
<br />
 Sam E 5:  YES! 
<br />
 Sam E 5:  lol 
<br />
 Sam E 5:  a very large key 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  silver?
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  lol
<br />
 Sam E 5:  no I didn't add the color 
<br />
 Sam E 5:  I wasn't focusing on sight 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  what colour was it though?
<br />
 Sam E 5:  a rough ruddy blackish metal 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  hmm
<br />
 Sam E 5:  I'm rather curious, how did you feel it? 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  i reached out and grabbed it
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  i saw it first
<br />
 Sam E 5:  you saw it? 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  got the impression of smooth metalic cylnder and such
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  well, seeing without seeing
<br />
 Sam E 5:  oh 
<br />
 Sam E 5:  hmmm 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  then i felt after you said ends
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  i felt the ends
<br />
 Sam E 5:  I'm glad I finally got something to work 
<br />
 SiSokOgotai:  :o)
<br />

<br />
He was finally able to pick something up from me... which is good. Maybe I just need more practice and focus. IF there's an energy connection that we accidentally made, we'll make an attempt to cut it later. Thanks for everyones help, though I'm still open to any suggestions or advice.
