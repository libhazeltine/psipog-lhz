			I love the thought of being able to use psi/manipulate energy.  I can create a Psi Ball or what I think to be one.
<br />

<br />
So what is constructs and programming I keep hearing about?  I am also interested in these, PsiPets and how they are achieved. 
<br />

<br />
Pretty much my goals of psi are to:
<br />

<br />
1.) Be able to create a psi ball effectively and know it is one.
<br />
2.) Be able to see PsiBalls
<br />
3.) Find out what programming and constructs are and how to use them.
<br />
4.) Create Shields
<br />
5.) Create PsiPets
<br />

<br />
About how long would it take me to achieve this?  Also if anyone can shed some light I would appriciate it.

			A construct is a blob of psi which has been programmed. Technically a Psi ball has been programmed, you programmed it to stay in the shape of a ball, Right? That's just an example of a wayyy simple construct.
<br />
Constructs can be used for absolutely LOADS. From intercepting telepathic messages to doing your laundry. (Just kiddin'  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> )
<br />

<br />
To create a psi pet you just have to program it what you want it to look like, how long it stays around, how it survives etc etc.

			So is it pretty much just being creative, Think of what you want in every aspect possible and gather psi and form it that way?
<br />

<br />
Like a ball is usually what everyone starts with, but it would be just as easy to make a cube if thats what I wanted? If so cool, and the possibilites are endless.

Yup, be as creative as you like <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. Although some constructs may be harder than others.

Exactly! They ARE endless, That's what makes it so awesome.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
