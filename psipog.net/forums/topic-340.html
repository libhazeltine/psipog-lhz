			Would it be possible to RV in space, because I was reading this one article and some said that he/she RV'ed in Russian Donut Shop(though he had never been to Russia or Donut shop). I was just wondering.

			Possible yes, but to what you'd see in space is just a black abyss with white dots (stars). If your talking about RVing to other planets and even moons and what not, well hrmm not much to see (also a very hard thing to verify if your actually seeing it) but i'd say it most likely is possible.

			Would you be able to RV while being in outer space? Probably.
<br />

<br />
Can you RV an object in Outer Space? I think you can; But you'd have a pretty hard time finding out if you're accurate if you are just going for &quot;something out there&quot; like an alien planet or something.
<br />

<br />
However, a friend could say, find a detailed picture of mars on the internet and use that for you to &quot;RV&quot;.

  Theres allot of things about mars that arent widely known, luckily, my fathers adicted to that kind of stuff, one day I was looking through some of his old videos and I saw a documentary made by NASA about the making and the mission of some probe to mars (forgot its name), well to make a long story short, theres this formation on its surface that clearly looks like a face, theres a line right through the middle that devides it, on the left it looks like a person, on the right side its some animal (they stated lion). I havent double checked the info though.
<br />
  It should be possible to RV to and from space, but the biggest problem is that you'd need at least either the person checking the info or the RVer, because if you'd use a picure rather than the actual place you could be RV'ing the picture itself.

			As far as i know, the &quot;mars face&quot; was product of a complex &quot;hill&quot; and it's shadows, a few months later, they took another pic of it and it was a normal hill, because the lighting was different, and so the shadows casted... <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

And no, i can't RV to outer space...

			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
You can indeed remote view outer space. There are no limits that we know of  with remote viewing. Now although you can remote view outer space, Like SunTzu said it would be near to impossible to confirm your results. You'll get no feedback. However, If you were to get a group of remote viewers and all view the same target (In this example space) and you all came up with similar results, you would have more of a confirmation. 
<br />

<br />
Gambent,
<br />

<br />
If your interested in a remote viewing session based on Mars please go to the following link:
