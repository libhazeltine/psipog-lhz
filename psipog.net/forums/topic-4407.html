			Since you can get control over anything (if you're skilled enough with LD) in your dreams, couldn't you train PK while sleeping? You could &quot;mimic&quot; the feeling you get when you do Macro-PK, create visual illusions and &quot;increase&quot; the effects. This should be quite easy (as once as you LD).
<br />

<br />
We all say we can't do incredible stuff with Psychokinesis because the training would last more than a life time, right? Then why can't you try it while you sleep? It would be easier, it would be funny, and it would not take your time  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> Maybe this is the key for increasing your psionic abilities without losing precious time.
<br />

<br />
Another fact is that the &quot;perception of time&quot; in dreams is all messed up. Some people (rumors, that is... i cannot say for sure) say they spent days, weeks, months in a dream. There was some guy (i can't remember the name) who said he once spent a year in a dream. Well, I think a year is too much... but anyways, if you could do it on purpose, you could slow down your &quot;perception&quot; and maybe spend a day training.
<br />

<br />
But yeah maybe you're wondering... if I can do anything while dreaming, how could it be useful? How could I know whether I'm progessing or not? Well, here's the point.
<br />
Suppose you're having a nightmare, and after you wake up you cannot go back to sleep because you are afraid. Afraid of what? You usually can't tell for sure. Or maybe you're dreaming with your former girlfriend... and when you wake up it sounds you're still with her? Or you get cut (in the dream) and wake up still &quot;feeling&quot; it. Ever felt sleep paralysis ? (although this is most related to OBEs, i think)
<br />

<br />
What I'm trying to say is that we can alter our dream environment to &quot;fake&quot; a specific feeling... waking up with that feeling, and bang! First, You just slid a pencil! (wow) Second, if you ever had a lucid dream.... it really LOOKS REAL. Third, It'll help you to overcome your stubborn mind (&quot;it can't be real&quot;, &quot;you won't do it&quot;, &quot;it'll be useless&quot;). PLUS, it won't take your time! And everyone knows we feel much better after a lucid dream!
<br />

<br />
Of course... it'll take some skill in lucid dreaming, but agree with me, LDing is easier than PKing  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> (using the right techniques of course).
<br />

<br />
For short:
<br />

<br />
1- Get into a Lucid Dream
<br />
2- Stabilize your dream. Try to make it more realistic. But maintain your control. Put stability and control under a balance
<br />
3- Create a connection with an object (DON'T SKIP ANY STEP! DO IT AS YOU WOULD DO PK!). Try to create a strong connection with an object. YOU WON'T BE VISUALIZING. This time... you'll be SEEING the connection. Enter the object, feel it, touch it, be one with it. (you can make you and the object blue and everything else white, for instance). You'll be completely concentrated on what you're doing. Nothing else will matter (this is easily done in a dream).
<br />
4- Move it!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> But don't get carried away (I mean, don't spin a psiwheel at lightspeed xD). Do it with conscience. Speed up until you reach your real life limit... and expand it a little. Then go further.
<br />
5- Don't forget to focus. And observe every feeling you get. Register each detail.
<br />
6- Write down everything you experienced as soon as you wake up. Make drawings, if necessary.
<br />
7- Try to &quot;mimic&quot; the feelings, when doing Psychokinesis (awake).
<br />

<br />
The main goal is to wake up thinking &quot;whoa I REALLY DID IT, and it was like THIS and THAT&quot;. You'll see what your mind thinks of it. 
<br />

<br />
(just a personal example. I had this girlfriend, who left me without saying a word. And I dreamt with her. But when I woke up I was all happy and peaceful, and it shocked me... how could I be that happy? I don't even like her anymore. *BEEP* wrong answer. I don't like her way of acting... i don't like what she has done to me... but deep inside, i still like the way she treated me when we were together. This &quot;answer&quot; from my mind was kinda surprising.)
<br />

<br />
I haven't tested this yet, but I already had some LDs, so it'll be no problem  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> . I'll share my experiences.
<br />

<br />
And please...don't forget to comment!

			I can't do lucid dreaming, because I fall asleep too fast but I was trying to improve my doing TK by telling myself that I would figure it out in my sleep.  I did this every night. 
<br />

<br />
So I had this dream on how to make stuff materialize instead.
<br />

<br />
In my dream I pictured something so clearly in my mind that it was like I was actually seeing it.  Then in front of me from a ball of yellowish light the image that I was visualizing appeared small then grew to life size and materialized.  It became real.
<br />

<br />
I woke up right after that so I remember it super clear.
<br />

<br />
It reminds me of that guy who invented the sewing machine because of something that he dreamed.  
<br />

<br />
So now part of my daily practice includes trying to visualize stuff in techni-color.  Just in case there's something to it.

			This is a very good idea. I spent most of the day trying to move things and it worked but I could try something bigger(something bigger is something very small lol). I think I've dreamt of my ex-girlfriend. I was happy when I woke up but I had no real reason to be happy lol.

			This is a very interesting idea you have. I tried something like it myself a couple of years ago with hypnosis. I'll fill you in on my experiences.
<br />

<br />
I learned a technique for hypnosis a few years back. It started out as just some fun with my friends, making them think their sock was a gas mask and that sort of thing. I got the idea of time dilation (that's what I heard it called once) from somewhere I can't even remember. I think it was researching psionics or maybe speed readin. Anyhow I thought that maybe since in a dream you can experience a very large amount in a relatively short amount of actual time then maybe with hypnosis that amount of time could be put to some use. It was based on the fact that your subconscious stores more information than your conscious mind can use. So if you were to skim over a book while not really reading it your subconcsious mind will keep some of that information. 
<br />

<br />
Based on this I had my friend Skim over a book without reading any of the actual words. (I cannot be hypnotized) I then put him under fully and instructed him that he would have a dream that lasted a week in the next five minutes. During which he would study the book in depth. It worked to some extent. What was more amazing is how freaked out he was when he woke up, thinking that an extra week had passed. 
<br />

<br />
It did not work quite as I had hoped. Most of the book was very vague to him, however there was one part that was somewhat remarkable. The first chapter and introduction, which he actually read prior to the hypnosis, he had memorized word for word. 
<br />

<br />
I still believe the theory is sound but that was the end of my experimentation with it. If you know anyone who is good at hypnosis and you can be hypnotized that my be worth exploring. 
<br />

<br />
You might also try self hypnosis to this effect. One thing I must caution you towards, if you have something to do the next day early in the morning, don't tell yourself to experience twelve hours while you sleep. Trust me you'll end up sleeping right through your alarm.

Wow, loved it! I'm interested in self-hypnosis, what technique did you use?
<br />

<br />
Come to think of it... we can link various psionic abilities to help with this. First, making a <span style="color: blue">psi construct</span> to induce <span style="color: blue">lucid dreaming</span>. Second, do <span style="color: blue">self-hypnosis </span> to make you dream and 'create' the dream scene. And then, train <span style="color: blue"> psychokinesis </span> while dreaming. Sounds difficult to do, but pretty useful.

			Well teaching hypnosis is not something that would fit into a forum post. It would even be a _very_ long article. There are alot of good books out on the subject. That's how I learned. There's a small percentage of people that can be hypnotised deeply though. My friend just happened to be in that percentage. If you're not you can work on it with self hypnosis. It takes some daily practice but I got pretty good at it. I used the self hypnosis kit. It sounds lame but it comes with a book and a kit. Their technique works pretty well. It takes some patience but it's worth it. 
<br />

<br />
                                           &gt;IMPORTANT&lt;
<br />
You need to approach this with caution. It is possible to mess up yourself or someone else. There can be unforseen effects of any suggestions. think things through before you say them. Your subconscious mind might interpret things differently than you might think.

I had one LD where I could move things with my mind easily but i wasn't that interest at that time. I closed a refrigerator door: First, i approached my hand and tried it... and both my hands and the refrigerator door started to glow blue. Then I closed it as if it was the simplest thing ever (in the dream of course =P)
