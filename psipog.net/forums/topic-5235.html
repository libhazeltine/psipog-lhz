			Hi everyone,
<br />

<br />
I hate introductions - I've never been any good at them at all. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> So let's get this out of the way now.
<br />

<br />
I'm 19 years old and from New Brunswick, Canada. I've been interested in psychic phenomena, witchcraft and the occult for as long as I can remember.....I put about 40% blame on too much Disney, He-Man and Ninja Turtles. 
<br />

<br />
The other 60% comes from being one of those unfortunate children who naturally had “weird abilities”. I could see things others could not (spirit entities, auras), and was remarkably perceptive for a kid my age. I could tell what others were thinking and feeling, etc etc. I mostly dealt with “seeing” the spirit world, however. I was continuously frightened, and sometimes even made ill, by mean little shadow people. After years of being scared half to death, not being able to be alone in a room anywhere, and being told I had an over-active imagination, I eventually shut off my abilities. How? I have no clue. But every few years, my abilities resurface and cause trouble again.
<br />

<br />
About six years ago, I was introduced to Wicca by a friend of mine. I had always been interested in witchcraft, so I decided to explore it further, and this led me to meet other people interested in psychism and magick. No one has really been able to help me with my abilities, however. Most of them can’t control their own, and those that claimed to have been more experienced really weren’t. My empathy and precognitive skills did develop some through the use of Tarot and such, but for the most part, I’m stuck in the same rut as before.
<br />

<br />
I actually found out about psionics a few years ago, through the Psion Guild, but because of life problems I didn’t get to delve into it very deeply. Things have quieted down for me, though, and I feel I am now prepared, mentally and emotionally, to reclaim my abilities and put them to good use.
<br />

<br />
And…..that’s about it for now. Congrats and apologies to those brave souls who’ve read through to this point lol I look forward to getting to know you all and sharing in some interesting discussions.
<br />

<br />
Peace,
<br />

<br />
Meadow

To help battle fluff and general lack of caring, I've modified the forums to restrict how many posts everyone can make. The current restriction is set to <span style="font-weight: bold">5 posts per hour</span>, which I think is fair. I am hoping this will encourage people to think more wisely about how they use their posts. I'll probably be adjusting the restriction to either more or less (most likely less), depending on how this goes.
<br />

If you notice any bugs, please PM me with what you did, and what you expected to happen.

			I used to have  8, but now i have 5, maybe all the members that joined before a particular date, got 5. All the newbies get 8 *Scowl*, but this thread isn't to talk about posting restrictions.

And sorry about that, DanielH. When I say &quot;spirit entities&quot; I did not mean departed humans. But, yes, I get the picture.
