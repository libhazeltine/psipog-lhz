Forty-six and two.  It's a Tool song referring to reaching a Christ-consciousness through enhanced genetics.  46 chromosomes plus two.  Don't be such an elitist, Mattz.

How did I come off being elitist? I'm saying information's hard to find. And then trying to make it hard to find it.

Great point, either archive the forums our get people to copy and paste all of the important things to Psipog, which will be archived. Seriously, there is a lot of good information floating around in this forum.

			I honestly don't understand why everyone is so upset about this PsiPog thing, I think that Sean has made a fantastic personal decision, but it doesn't really affect anyone else (except the influence his decision will make on people, such as the creation of his new site).
<br />

<br />
I've been watching so many threads about people who are going to stab themselves in the heart because they can't live without Pog. Tell me, what makes PsiPog so great? I'll tell you: The site's content, the help from the staff, and the PEOPLE.
<br />

<br />
Well let's address these three things:
<br />

<br />
1.) The site's content is ALL still there and is going to ALWAYS be there - it's being A-R-C-H-I-V-E-D.
<br />

<br />
2.) The staff. Well, as far as I know, the staff isn't going anywhere. You can find JoeT, SheepKing, Xict, Float, and others at <a href="http://www.upconline.net" target="_blank" class="postlink">UPC</a>. You can find Apollo at <a href="http://www.psilinks.co.nr/" target="_blank" class="postlink">PsiLinks</a>. You can find Stony at <a href="http://zhkyrl.brinkster.net/psionline/" target="_blank" class="postlink">PsiOnline</a>. I don't know all the staff and where they currently are, and where they will go, but that's a basic idea. The list goes on.
<br />

<br />
3.) The people. Well as far as I know, Sean isn't about to send some highly advanced biological weapon to somehow kill everyone who knows about PsiPog. You'll all still be around. There is nothing great about these forums, there is nothing great about ANY forum. Forums can't be great, they can only be bad. Bad forums just work like crap and have bad topic sections - there are a lot of forums that aren't bad. The only great thing about these forums is the way Sean set it up, like the inability to spam post. That was an awesome idea... But still, that doesn't make the forum, that is just to prevent spamming because PsiPog is a big place. YOU make the forums, not PsiPog.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Oh, and let me say something dangerious here: Maybe there are even places that are BETTER than PsiPog <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />  To some extent, it's a matter of opinion.
<br />

<br />
I'd recommend going to <a href="http://www.upconline.net" target="_blank" class="postlink">UPC</a>, <a href="http://vsociety.net/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Veritas</a>, or <a href="http://www.psiscape.net" target="_blank" class="postlink">Psi Scape</a>. That's just a short list of three good sites, with great content, great forums, great staff, great teaching and help. And none of them are out to kill newbies.
<br />

<br />
I know that a bunch of people have already gone to <a href="http://www.upconline.net" target="_blank" class="postlink">UPC</a> because of the familiar staff and memberbase, along with the strong level of content and activity.
<br />

<br />
You guys made PsiPog, never forget that. I think Sean would say, and has said, the same thing. Sure, he worked his butt off with a rediculous amount of hours and stress to make it possible for you guys, but the people make the site. The people become the staff, the people become the authors, the people make up the discussion, etc.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
~Hech
<br />

<br />
P.S. I never noticed that feature where you could only post a certain amount of times in an hour. Great idea...I love how it says &quot;Be Intelligent&quot; too <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> Great features, I never noticed these things before.
