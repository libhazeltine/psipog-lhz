			<span style="color: blue">Swords of psi.... too many people want to go posing saying, &quot;Look I have a psi-sword!&quot; Well, I have decided that since in is inevitable that this will happen, why not give them a practical use in training?</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">What is a construct?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: red">Something you make with psi for a specific purpose (even if its only purpose is to be a box).</span>
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">What is a psi-sword then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: red">Thats right! A construct! </span>
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">What happens to most constructs if you swing them about?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: red">They fall apart.(I haven't really done this but once [and then only to back up this idea]) </span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: blue">So then, a good psi-sword (or construct) would be one which could hold together. </span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">How is this done? </span>
<br />
<span style="color: green">Shelling. </span>
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">So then, what skills do we learn from making psi-swords?</span> 
<br />
<span style="color: green">We learn how to manipulate psi into a set shape, and we learn how to shell these constructs very strongly.</span> 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">What do we learn from tossing a psi ball?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: orange">The same thing.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: blue">Swords (when used simply as a more tactile form of practice) are just as useful to make as a psiball meant for throwing (or psiball paintball as it may be). </span>

			I'd say don't encourage them... But at least it happened in an intelligent, grammatical, and easy to read and understand post, instead of some (underexaggeration) of the people that are anime lovers and want to make psi-swords and fight with them.

If they insist on such amusements, it's often a good idea to point out how long it takes to fashion a material sword.  Have them spend an hour or so folding the construct and &quot;hammering&quot; it into shape, by which I mean pulsing more energy into the psi-sword and concentrating on the concept of it being flat and hard.  If they expect any kind of tactile response from their psi-blade, it's going to require a bit more concentration than idle amusement would normally entice.
<br />

<br />
Games can be fun, though, if the individual is seriously motivated.
<br />

<br />
Oh, and if you do find someone who over-enthusiastically requests to spar with you, ask to examine their psi-blade.  If you can't sense it easily, then it's unlikely they made it &quot;correctly&quot; (by whatever means they rely on) or that your awareness of it will be thorough enough to have anything more than a battle of imaginations...
<br />

<br />
Not that I have anything against that, but that's not exactly psionic training and isn't relevant here.
<br />

<br />
I have never been struck with one myself, but I imagine you could cause some degree of injury with it if you were a talented psychokineticist.

			Being an Anime lover myself I hesitate to say anything about this but now that I think of it if two people we're to make 'Psi-swords- and have a way to see them, either throught Aura-vision or flaring then it could be used as a 'free' practical way to practice some style of sword combat.

			I made Psi swords after psiballs, in order to practice more advanced shapes and programming, it seems like a good step to take after psiballs if you wish to get better at manipulation.

Never ever thought of fighting with them, seem childish, i mean, if you want to have sword fights, buy a plastic sword or grow up. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Yes... I hoped I would get some positive responses as such. I personally don't do it myself, but it would ba along the same lines as psi paintball. If you really like the idea, and you are a really hands on sort of person, you might like to read some books on blacksmithy (like I have) and literally fashion the sword, this would result in some really strong visualization, which tends to help make a strong construct. For that matter, the hands on idea could work for many types of constructs: you wire a device, like a doorbell, or you could build a machine which works like a factory, putting pieces together and making the finished product, my theory is, the more intricate the design (like you first make every cog, and then you assemble them) the more powerful the result... its industrialism + psi.
