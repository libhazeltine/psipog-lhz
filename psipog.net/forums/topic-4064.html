			Have you read The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield?
<br />

<br />
It has a lot to do with psionics.  It gave me a whole new outlook on life, and also some useful methods.
<br />

<br />
If you haven't read it, I suggest you get your hands on it! - Brilliant book!

			Hello UltimateBlob,
<br />

<br />
Yes. It's an absolutely great book. It's quite possibly my favorite book I have ever read. I must have read that book several times. I can't put in detail how that book is so good. Members will just have to read it.
<br />

<br />
I have had the privilege to speak with James twice. I pulled a couple of strings and wrote a couple of emails and made some telephone calls. I spoke with James for roughly an hour and a half in our first conversation. We spoke about energy in general and our power to manipulate it at will and unconsciously. I explained to him about my research/hobby of psionics and he found it highly interesting. 
<br />

<br />
James and I still speak and I believe the next time he is in Pennsylvania we're going to meet to discuss further about energy and he's book. I also had the privilege to see the early premier viewing of it's movie (was invited) in Philadelphia. Although the movie cannot at all match the book, it was still decently good. I recommend watching it.
<br />

<br />
Read this book!
<br />

<br />
- JoeT

It depends, You can consider it to be fiction, but everything makes sense, and there's proof of it; it's not just some guy's theory.

			I've read it. It's quite possibly the best book I've read next to the Carlos Castaneda set of books. I believe that all the insights are true and with each day more obvious to me.
<br />

<br />
First, I would like to mention coincidences. It's funny how I never thought about this the way this book describes it. Its like we're stuck in a space-time matrix, where every move of an object inside this matrix is directly connected to the entire matrix and every event that happens has some kind of meaning and a message for the observer. The book says the more you realize these coincidences and the more messages you get out of them, more and more coincidences will happen and strangely, you can almost know when something is going to happen and why. This is very interesting to me as I have experienced it several times, as did all the other creatures, knowingly or not.
<br />

<br />
Second, the part when he learns to observe &quot;the energy&quot;. In the book it was desribed a bit too easy I think. There's no way one can see energy fields around him with only half an hour of practice, unless extremely gifted. I'm learning to see the same thing for like a year, and I'm no where near the experience desribed in the book <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
Third, the &quot;human future&quot; thing. It says we will evolve into higher beings in the end of this century, but I just can't understand that as more and more people are only physically oriented and the entire world is going down to hell anyways. The image of an entire humanity spiritually evolved to the point where we draw a line between living and dead, well I just can't imagine it due to our stupidity factor. It does sound good however.
<br />

<br />
Anyways I'd like to hear your opinions on these things.
<br />

<br />

			Yes it is a very nice book, and the movie is very decent. To those who loved the book, read: The secret of Shambhala - James Redfield. Also a great book by him. I haven't read the tenth insight yet, but I heard it is not as good as these two.
