But I usually feel to tired to try to experiment with this phenomenom:P

			that would undoubtably be an OBE. You don't have to experiment with it if you dont want to, its not for everyone I suppose.

			I would recommend trying to experiment with it. Try moving around, you may just find that your body is still in bed after you've moved. Or, if you find yourself unable to move, try thinking about moving, for example: &quot;think&quot; yourself over to the otherside of the room.

			Omg, that's soooo strange. The other day I had the same experience too. I was so tired on a bus so I tried to go to sleep. My eyes were close and I was between sleep and awake but I wasn't receptive to any outside disturbances. However I distinctly saw the seats and the poles of the bus. I tried looking around and I actually did. But I tried to check to see if it was my imaginationa and I did it again...but it was only for 1 min or less though. But it was really kool

I think it was an OBE, if it was I'd love to experiment with it some more

			You may find yourself with the same problem that a certain disguised poster has... too many minds, and the most concious will never be sent on an out of body task.
