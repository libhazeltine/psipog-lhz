Can someone define love? I don't really have much love, it's weird, so I don't really know what you guys mean.

			I believe love can be interpretated in many ways, but roughly taken, there are two perspectives for me:
<br />

<br />
1: Love is a specific feeling (can be satisfactionairy but also disturbing) feeling of the ego of one's person.
<br />

<br />
2: Love is one with the source of life.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The first one is transitory and if you ask me, an illusion. The second form is unconditional love that is forever. It is the basis of our being. It is intertwined with the non-physical as well as with every manifestation.
<br />

<br />
If you are asking how to send love, I would say: Cultivate the feeling of love in yourself by trying to emphazise and feel connected with the person you are sending love to. Appreciate his being and his process in life and send this love in visualization or in intention. A smile can do wonders as well. So can a loving gesture or a nice flower or some sweet encouraging words. Love can be send on all different levels.
<br />

<br />
Nice to see this idea of yours Apollo. We should all remember it a lot more often I agree. And remember: If you send love to someone, some people fear to lose their own energy. But that is not possible, for if one sends love to another, the love first has to built up in your self before it can flow out to others. You will get more if you give more.

Ouch, that sucks for you... In a way. Once it comes, it will (most likely) go as well, leaving you in its afterglow, which SUCKS. So in a way you are lucky.

That's how it is for me. Comes and goes. It's a rare feeling for me to have but I didn't know that somefatguy (my brother) hasn't experienced it once. Then again I don't think I have ever experienced what I believe to be unconditional love until a year or two ago.

Good job for putting it so frankly <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />. Unfortunately, since you just typed it flat out without a little explanation some people, as one can see, took it the wrong way and misjudged you. But apart from that, a job well done <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. Maybe, just maybe, one or two relatively unkind people unkind people on psipog will actually stop to think about your compassionate message.

			People can take that statement however they would like.  The way you take it helps show yourself your personality.  If you think that I was being gay in saying that, you obviously are going through puberty.  You may think that i was joking or something....but i am not.  I have seen instances where people have made fun of others or argued with them to the point of them wanting to die.  That is not good.  I know a kid who committed suicide a year ago because he was taunted by others at school.  Be nice to others and they will be nice to you.  I know it is human nature to tease others because it makes you feel more powerful.  Here is a word of advice: Dont.  Not only is it not nice, it can have drastic impacts on others.  Even if you were kidding when you responded, re-read my statement and think of the deeper meaning.
