			I don't want to hide my psi abilities anymore. I am tired of being embarrased to be telepathic, and having to hide my talent. it allmost feels like I am being dishonest with myself and with my friends by hiding it.
<br />

<br />
What do you guys think? Are any of you open about your abilities? have any of you gotten negative reactions from people in your life when you told them? or positive ones?

I was going to be completely open about being telepathic and not hide it from anyone, but my husband said that I may want to be slelctive about who I disclose that to because he doesn't want me to get labled or judged by others.

			I phoned a friend after sensing she was terribly depressed and that her partner was the cause. As i phoned her it turned out she had just that minute kicked him out after having a row. 
<br />

<br />
However i found that being so open about sensing things freaks out the narrow minded people.

			First of all... yes, I am female. Though if I were male and had a husband it shouldn't matter either because love is love, regardless of gender.
<br />

<br />
Yes, it is nice that my husband has abilities too and knows about mine. It is nice that we can relate to eachother on that level too and I think it brings us closer. Its one more thing we have in common.
<br />

<br />
I am not sure why i thought it was important to be open about this to the world. I think I was just tired of feeling like I had a big <span style="font-style: italic">secret</span>, that I am telepathic. I don't want to feel ashamed about who I am in any aspect of my life...especially this one.

			Moreso I was confused about the married part, 'cause in most places, it's not legal, but that's just me. (I'm not too fond about the gays either, but I don't think we can deny them rights etc)
<br />

<br />
I'm open about it, but I don't claim to have any extra special power, and mostly what I say comes accross (in hindsight) as crazy talk.
