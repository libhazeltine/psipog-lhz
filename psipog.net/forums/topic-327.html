			I just finished reading it... it was interesting, but mostly just back-and-forth stuff.  I've never seen Larry King, but judging from the transcript, it doesn't sound like people have much time to talk <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.  I don't really agree with anyone on the show completely... If any actual debate takes place, it needs to be in a much more open mannor where people just go crazy in front of the camera <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.  (Of course, I didn't see the show, but that's the impression I got from the script).

			Sylvia Browne is fake it was proven a while ago heh. I have never met a real &quot;publicity&quot; psychic. If they want a debate they should get some real psychics.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;I have yet to find a single psychic medium who can offer any information of any public utility or real personal usefulness. For example, where's Osama bin Laden? Why can't anyone on our panel tell us where Osama bin Laden is? I mean this guy killed 3,000 Americans. If they have the power to see and speak to the dead who are all knowing and omniscient, then it's almost criminal for them to withhold that information.
<br />

<br />
When is the next roadside bomb going to go off in Iraq and kill our soldiers? Tell us now because these are fathers and husbands and we don't want them to die. James, can you please tell us, share some of that information on this show right now where is Osama bin Laden?
<br />

VAN PRAAGH: Hasn't God told you yet? You're a man of God. So, I assume that you're in touch with God because you're a rabbi. Therefore, I'd assume you're in touch also and you get inspiration from God.

			Just as an aside, unless someone personally knew or had come in contact with Osama Bin Laden, or was a professional (as in government rank) remote viewer, being able to get a fix on him within an area smaller than say, a few hundred square kilometers, would be extremely unlikely. Also, think about this. If the US, which for the most part has negative connotations toward the psychic community, is trying to track these guys, and the Easterners, who are much more savvy with spiritual things in general because they don't consider it taboo, or &quot;impossible to prove by modern scientists,&quot; they are sure as hell going to have psions on their side as well, trying to evade US scouts, causing general confusion. It seems Sci-Fi but it's completely real and it happen quite often in the Cold War, more often than most people realize.

You are correct about the potential difficulty in remote viewing Osama bin Laden.  If he's hiding out in a cave in a desert somewhere then there remote viewer would only get a picture of a cave and some sand and maybe a rock or two.  Out in the desert there really aren't many  landmarks, any discernible structures that can help you identify the target location.  However there is no guarantee that bin Laden is in a desert somewhere.  He could be hiding in another country, Iran, Syria maybe ?
<br />

<br />
As for your second point, I'm not so sure I agree.  First off, the government first took notice (from what I can surmise) around the 1960's during the MK ULTRA project.  They that some patients had ESP experiences while under the influence of hallucinatory drugs, although they didn't understand how or why this was possible, nor could they, at that time, find a way to control it.  Then in the early 1970's you see the start of the remote viewing programs under the direction of SRI, and funded by the CIA, and the project was eventually dropped.  In the later 1970's, RV was picked up again, this time by the ARMY under the guise of Gondola Wish (which would later be changed to Grillflame, and then to Center lane).  Then it's put on hold in the 80's by the ARMY, and started up once again by the DIA in 1984 under the guise of Sun Streak (which was later changed to Stargate in the late nineties).  This went on until 1995 when the CIA took control of Stargate to do a budget hearing/review of the program where it was then deemed as having no value as an intelligence tool.  This appraisal is hotly debated as being incomplete and propanda against the effectiveness of remote viewing.
<br />

<br />
Kinda makes you wonder why they drop the program, pick it up again, drop it again, and then pick it up again, all under different names but with a lot of the same remote viewers.  And as far as the government seeing remote viewing as unscientific, this is untrue.  Remote viewing protocol, and the analysis thereof was performed by SRI, the Stanford Research Institute by some very intelligent researchers, Hal Puthoff and Russel Targ to name the two most prominent.  Remember, with remote viewing it was science first, and then the project.  They didn't start the project without any scientific forethought.
<br />

<br />
Remember the credo of the US government, &quot;cheap and efficient&quot;.  Given the means of the government, other avenues of intelligence gathering are much more effective than remote viewing.  Why spend one million dollars on a remote viewing project that can be right probably 60% of the time, or spend 5 million dollars on a satellite that can provide real-time images of anywhere in the world and is right 100% of the time.
<br />

<br />
To be perfectly honest, I'm quite confident that any remote viewers from other countries will not do much damage.  You should be more concerned with nuclear warhead vs. nuclear warhead, instead of psychic vs. psychic.  You can't RV a target if it's been vaporized by a 2 megaton explosion.
