And to the religious thing, look at my avatar, Always had it since day one.  No ones said anything about it yet.

<br />
(watch now i'm screwed)

But it's not like it's some crazy religious statement, doesn't even fit under one religion, also doesn't even have to be IN a religion to practice it!

			This will be my first post, and depending on a few later circumstances, possibly my last (concerning the sites upcoming closure and whatnot).  However, before I begin I will have to say I am, by no means, new to this site however I have been gone for a number of years now and I had never, originally, signed onto this forum; in fact, I do believe this forum was not present.  As well, I might comment on the growth of the site over the years...it is quite amazing, really.
<br />

<br />
Of course, that is not why I am here.  I am posting a few thoughts concerning the nature of the rules in regards to tolerance...
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">5. Be Fair, 6. Be Understanding, 4. Understand different perspectives, 5. Avoid the mentality of 'I'm right, everyone else is wrong', 5. Listen to people who disagree with you, 6.

<br />

<br />
et al...(I may have missed something, but hopefully not).
<br />

<br />
So then, to the meat of my thoughts, as an observer and a past participant in the psipog &quot;world&quot; (so to speak) one thing I have noticed throughout all of my time here is a rather unfortunate lack of tolerance for discourse concerning the philosophy/ies that can/could be related to a study of psionics.  This is, despite what you may think, unfortunate indeed as a great many intelligent peoples end up leaving this site due to volatile atmosphere created through this level of intolerance.
<br />

<br />
A number of these people I have actually had to discuss things with &quot;off-site&quot; due to this atmosphere.  Did you know you have had scientists, of various calibre, studying this site and it's memebers?  I met them and had set up e-mail communications with them...off-site, of course.  One of the things they all notice is the immaturity of a large number of the people participating; it's like a clique that you cannot get into without &quot;proving yourself&quot;, like high-school popularity contests all over again, where conformity is king.  They couldn't, as many cannot, even begin to discuss their thought(s)/theory(ies) with those people they need to communicate with most...the practioners because, well, it's just not allowed; people get ripped apart for even positing a theory, unless, of course, the people running the show ok it.
<br />

<br />
Now, the biggest thing I do not understand is how you, as a site, &quot;teach&quot; on psionics, as in how-to manuals and such for achieving &quot;powers&quot;, but you end up discouraging related philosophical discourse(s) concerning the incredible paradigm that psionics represents.  Psionics works.  We all know this, but eventually people get to the point where &quot;powers&quot; aren't what is important anymore; the novelty has worn off and the real questions come to the surface...if psionics works, then we fucked up somewhere along the way (as our current scientific paradigm, the one running the show, has it that psionics is impossible), what does this mean concerning the nature of reality, and, perhaps ulitmately, what does this mean about us?  Of course, there are various ways of tackling these issues, each one way being a particular perspective...and this is where the problem starts: the little tolerance there is for the variety of perspectives available, which seriously limits any possibility of progress.
<br />

<br />
What I am saying, ultimately, is that to progress any further, one thing we will need to seriously work upon is tolerance; to begin by following the above quoted ideals would be a good start as things like this:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">1. Do not talk about religion/spirituality</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
serious limit the possible depth of any discourse as these are, in and of themselves, viable perspectives.  In the case of a relgious/spiritually oriented poster one would do any of the following:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">5. Be Fair, 6. Be Understanding, 4. Understand different perspectives, 5. Avoid the mentality of 'I'm right, everyone else is wrong', 5. Listen to people who disagree with you, 6. Explore multiple perspectives, 7. Avoid preaching 'the truth', 3. Don't force your beliefs/opinions on others, 5. Keep things in perspective...</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
...and then it shouldn't really be a problem.
<br />

<br />
As for peoples positing of a theory(ies), one should keep these ideals in mind as well.  For example, when someone talks about chakras, don't get uptight about the use of esoteric terminology and it's possible associations with various &quot;unsavoury&quot; perspectives, but attempt to understand it from your point of view, and at the very least, say perhaps...perhaps it is real; what if.  Or...if someone mentions past lives, same thing, don't get uptight over any possible associations, but attempt to understand it in your own way, and at the very least, say perhaps.  You don't have to agree with anyone or buy into anything, however, you must allow people their take on things, even if it is colored in a manner you do not like.  Nobody said it was right...but, then again, nobody said it was wrong either.
<br />

<br />
So, in the end what I would be hoping, as the fruit of all this, that we seriously consider how tolerant we are of other peoples thoughts concerning the nature of psionics, especially concerning it is a rather open area and progress will not be had by being close-minded.  Thus, I speak for all of those who have left due to this unfortunate intolerance, and speak for those who may arrive after this aspect of the community is considered.  Regardless, I am aware hat this site is closing, and that this work here is, largely, too late, but I feel compelled to write it; probably the best thing I have ever partaken in on this site.  I offer these thoughts freely, however; you are by no means obliged to comply as I recognize your claims to ownership (however I would debate the nature of ownership, philosophically speaking) and thus, your freewill.  I offer, not to offend, in the case this happens, but to inform from another angle in as clear a manner as possible.  Hopefully, I have succeeded in my efforts and offered some &quot;food for thought&quot;.

I like you, the site would of been very interesting with you around...but it still does have 6 months though. Yep, you have some very good points. I like the one about the religion rule. But I just want to point out about the immaturity thing. Well, this site consists of probably 70% 12-16 year-olds which are usually are immature. I for one am 15 years old. So you should understand why the site consists of so many immature members (no offense anyone). It's kinda creepy about the scientist thing  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

			Interesting post, to say the least.  I dont have any problems with the rules.  But what you've brought up is very true.  If everyone did learn a little respect, we would have no problems, but we really cant do that with this type of community.  In my other community there have never been anykind of problems ever!  Not a single flame war has occured in the near year and a half that i've been there!  Thats amazing!  But I have a feeling it just wouldn't work here.  
<br />

<br />
Aussie, Thats really cool about the scientist.  He should post, I'd love to get a true skeptic opinion, not all those cynical bastards, for lack of a better word.

			I am glad to have had a relatively good reception here; it shows people are thinking about these things and not just letting them slide, so to speak.
<br />

<br />
Of course, this is not all I want to say here, in fact, I am here now more so to clarify (a) certain point(s) that I feel I may not have articulated well enough.  For example, as one person pointed out - the immaturity issue; perhaps not the best choice of words concerning the context of this community...my bad.  Thankfully, no one has taken it too personally thus far and, as such, I can elaborate a bit on that point.
<br />

<br />
So...getting into that particular issue, what I ment had little to do with a persons age, and more to do with a persons attitude(s).  Perhaps an example may explain it a bit better, so bear with me on this one:
<br />

<br />
Say person A joins into a discussion and brings to the table a different viewpoint, one which isn't the &quot;norm&quot; for the community.  The immaturity, then, is not the age of B, C, and D but rather the manner in which they react to person A's viewpoint.  B, C, and D, following the conventions of their community, then proceed to, in a sense, &quot;oust&quot; the &quot;outsider&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Hopefully, this clarifies the issue; no offence ment to teenagers.  Truth be told, there are adults that are even more &quot;immature&quot; then teenagers.
<br />

<br />
Lastly, I would argue the thought presented here, in the following quote:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">If everyone did learn a little respect, we would have no problems, but we really cant do that with this type of community</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Anyone can learn how to respect other's; there are no excuses.  We are always responsible for our actions/reactions concerning others.  Of course, I'm not going to say it is necessarily easy.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, I feel this about wraps up my reply.  I will, given time, wander about the forum positing a thought or two, here and there seeing as there is &quot;some&quot; time left before the closure of this site.
<br />

<br />
With much respect...
<br />

<br />
Peace

About the respect thing, I know for a fact that people would leave over being respectful, and we'd loose way to much community...heh.  Me and a friend are hopeing to make a psionic site, I'm gonna try and employ looser rules.  but it's really up to my partner(s?)

Of course, this is not all I want to say here, in fact, I am here now more so to clarify (a) certain point(s) that I feel I may not have articulated well enough.  For example, as one person pointed out - the immaturity issue; perhaps not the best choice of words concerning the context of this community...my bad.  Thankfully, no one has taken it too personally thus far and, as such, I can elaborate a bit on that point.
<br />

<br />
So...getting into that particular issue, what I ment had little to do with a persons age, and more to do with a persons attitude(s).  Perhaps an example may explain it a bit better, so bear with me on this one:
<br />

<br />
Say person A joins into a discussion and brings to the table a different viewpoint, one which isn't the &quot;norm&quot; for the community.  The immaturity, then, is not the age of B, C, and D but rather the manner in which they react to person A's viewpoint.  B, C, and D, following the conventions of their community, then proceed to, in a sense, &quot;oust&quot; the &quot;outsider&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Hopefully, this clarifies the issue; no offence ment to teenagers.  Truth be told, there are adults that are even more &quot;immature&quot; then teenagers.
<br />

<br />
Lastly, I would argue the thought presented here, in the following quote:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">If everyone did learn a little respect, we would have no problems, but we really cant do that with this type of community</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Anyone can learn how to respect other's; there are no excuses.  We are always responsible for our actions/reactions concerning others.  Of course, I'm not going to say it is necessarily easy.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, I feel this about wraps up my reply.  I will, given time, wander about the forum positing a thought or two, here and there seeing as there is &quot;some&quot; time left before the closure of this site.
<br />

<br />
With much respect...
<br />

<br />
Peace

Yes, your clarification has shed more light into the darkness. I like you even more now. You are very intelligent. Are you interested in Peebrain's new website that will arrive in roughly 6 months? Any community needs more people like you.
