			Well seeing my Haloween story topic died a little while ago..(It sounded like a good idea... <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />) I thought it would lest be nice to know what everyone is planning on during this Haloween. Or lest tell me what your farviote candy is.
<br />

<br />
I myself don't plan on doing much, maybe watch a few scary movies. Or maybe go to the graveyard in hopes of seeing a ghost (with my eyes not my sense). I don't really have a certain farviote candy, but right now I do feel like eating taffy.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			My tradition for Halloween is simply buying a couple bags of candy (whichever kind I feel like having at the time, usually Andes Mints and Peanut Butter M&amp;M's), and hanging out with friends. Cheaper than buying a costume, less time consuming than trick-or-treating, and a lot less creepy if you're older than 15. As for my favorite candy, it's really whatever I feel like eating at the time, usually affected by whatever kind of candy I ate least recently (i.e., if I haven't eaten Starbursts in a while, I'd like them best, but if it was chocolate I've had least recently, I'd want that).

Instead of focusing on how everyone has it wrong, perhaps try doing your own thing. In your case, I believe that would be doing the original traditions (with regards to legality, of course, some old traditions can be brutal). I believe it would make Halloween/Christmas/&lt;insert random holiday&gt; much more enjoyable for you. Just because it lost the real meaning for everyone else doesn't mean you have to give up the true meaning.

			I plan on spending Halloween sat in front of my computer doing course work.  Fun, eh?
<br />

<br />
Before my Gran died we would spend Halloween at her house; bobbing for apples and such, plus she was the master of scary stories.

Hey, does anyone else find it strange that parents tell there kids all year not to take sweets from strangers, then on Halloween send them trick or treating?

			I don't do much for Halloween, if anything, I'll be doing homework. However, my sister is going to have some fun with eggs and washable paint.

Honestly its gonna be fun heh thats not even sarcasm cuz i like choas. Oh yah im bringing a tazer with me in case any of those midgets try and egg houses or something
