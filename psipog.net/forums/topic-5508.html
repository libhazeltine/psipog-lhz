PsiPog will be coming down sometime in the next 6 months to a year.  I don't know for sure when, and I promise not to snatch it off the internet by surprise.  But it will be disassembled in the upcoming months.  Perhaps I will just turn it into an archive.

			Wow i cant believe youre going to shut it down, i understand why but thats a big shock to me. Its going to suck not being able to discuss psionics with a big community of people anymore. I dont know if ill even continue it, because there wont be anyone to talk to if im having a problem with it. Well i hope you dont completely shut it down and atleast keep the articles. Because ive become very dependant on this site and I havent seen any sites who have as money people as psipog.

			<img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> Im really going to miss psipog. Like you said I too was mainly driven to prove psionics to myself through this site. But it was also a community of ppl who respected me and actually listened to me. (instead of the druggies who abandoned and disrespected me in real life) I hope you can make a site like psipog that just focuses on different things. When and if you do plz email me a link.

I can't help but laugh a whole lot right now. Because most of it was true and the fact that I saw parts of myself in you. I don't believe I can answer anything. Human curiousitly seems only natural and others just seem to close themselfs up by lies to end the pain in the back of there minds. It was only a about a week ago that I discover this place, but already I feel like I belong. I can understand why your going to do it, but I don't think it's going to end here by the long shot.
<br />

<br />
There seems to be a string of speical turths in you, however you are still human and desition to be flawed like everyone else.
<br />

<br />
I hope you find your calling, only you can find it. From the bottlem of my heart I feel as If I left something very importent out, but I can't find it.
<br />

O well, lol

I finally putted up my singulature. It's a small qoute of mine I use now and again

			I think it'd be illogical to take it down. I mean, It's a nice place for beginners to start, I find that most other psionics sites don't enjoy psipog because it's dedicated to new people more then advance. and if all the sites out there dedicated to advance, then where would one start? It'll leave out the beginners. either way, whatever decision you make, People aren't going to be happy...unless you contiue with psipog.

			Sean,
<br />

<br />
I am delighted to see your blog, it confirms my intuition.
<br />

<br />
First of all, I think it is rather brave that you posted that post in front of all your members and moderators. You are following your intuition, rather than letting fear of what others think of you lead you the way.
<br />

<br />
Secondly, I want to say that the quality with which you are able to observe yourself, is truely great. In my opinion, you are a very wise person. In other words, you seem to know yourself. Which is, I believe, the most important aspect for wisdom and self-confidence. Like you said, just the realisation of not being your body, after having for example an OBE, gives you so much confidence that you feel like nothing in the world could ever harm you. You walk in the middle of a busy street with all those people, traffic and chaos around you, but still there is this place of total confidence and fearlesness. You feel like you are walking around in a human body, but somehow you feel immortal. That is true freedom. Fearlesness. And it is, to me, the most satisfactional and true experience I have yet come across.
<br />

<br />
Somehow I feel like congratulating you for this transformation you went through. Your words have fascinated me, and I recognized alot of what you said, in my own transformation. Yes I was once a sceptic as well. 
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">That is the shift that society will be going through. We will move, as a society, through this transformation. From an unconscious fear of the mechanical world, to a conscious realization that the world is a spiritual place.
<br />

<br />
And my purpose is to help make this transformation happen.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
I think it is honorable that you want to adept this purpose of helping mankind/society. I think eventually, more of us should, and will, adept this purpose and bring joy and understanding to the world. It is my purpose as well.
<br />

<br />
About Psipog, are you planning to really take it off-line entirely? You could for example, like you said, hand it over to someone who values the original qualities which form the foundation of Psipog. I think Psipog is a wonderfull first step. It is a great bridge. Some will like to stay forever on this safe bridge, others will overcome these fears you spoke of and walk right through towards your new site, who knows. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Reading your blog inspired me. Congratulations on overcoming your fears to make this decision regarding PsiPog. And thank you for this joyfull read. Nothing fascinates me as much, as seeing people transform like that.
<br />

<br />
MA
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Hahah, I just read your realisations/insights that you discovered in the process of total sceptic, to believer. The way you state them is hilarious <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> , but fascinating nonetheless. They are actually pretty good insights for others also. Me included.

			At first this post shocked me, but after reading your two blog entries it all makes sense and seems to be the way forward. I mean sure I can spin this paper around a pin, and make psiballs, but what’s the point? (this was a thought I had yesterday). OBE’s seem to be where the answers are. And the world as it is doesn’t seem enough, or even to quote myself from a two days ago “It seems like the way we grow up seeing the world is wrong”. I totally support your decision to start a new site geared to OBE’s and spirituality; it seems that after you have enough psionic experiences it’s the way forward. 
<br />

<br />
About psipog though, to completely get rid of it would be a waste. All of the hard work you and other people have put into it over the years shouldn’t go to waste, and could help a lot of other people on the path to truth. Maybe someone else could run it, but then you would still feel responsible for the places that person takes psipog. Or you could archive it like skywind’s site. I’m sure there are many choices out there.
<br />

<br />
Good luck peebs, I’m sure a lot of people here have your back <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I was very scared when i saw the title...
<br />
Although i havent been here a long time...it pretty much hurts me to see that this comunity is going to be vaporized or slimmed down a whole lot <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> .
<br />
Well whatever your path leads to...i wish you good luck with it <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.
<br />
And the funny thing is that i thought the other day OBE is the path that makes the most sense,at least for now.
<br />
Well whatever your going to...expect me there! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

It would be great though if you could pas this on to someone else <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.

			I can't say that i'm surprised by this. To use a great quote i've heard
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">All things change in a dynamic environment. Your effort to remain what you are is what limits you.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Basicly put. I'm all for change. now that you have proof that This stuff is real Of course you should take it in new directions. but that doesn't mean that everyone beleives it without a shadow of a doubt. many people, such as myself, don't believe in PK. having never done it too successfully without any way to prove it wasn't anything external.
<br />
So perhaps venturing into the Spiritual aspect of psionics is the right way to go. 
<br />
 This doesn't mean accept all the crazy theories that spiritaully minded people cough up. but experement with stuff. 
<br />
And after reading your blog entry. i've decided that's what i'll be doing.
<br />
I've been with psipog for what must be about 4 years. and through that time i've grown from fluffy 'electrokinetic' to OBE attempting skeptic. And i've never realy ventured into the spiritual areas of psionics. not because i've been discouraged by other people. but rather i've been Discouraged by myself.
<br />
When i think about it. the skeptical way of Psipog is attempting to shoehorn psionics into science. well. what if psionics wasn't meant to be a part of science? what if it was meant to be an unconstant variable that science wouldn't be able to get a hold of?
<br />
I think it's time for an evolution of psipog. perhaps all the articles should be scrapped and there should be a fresh start. a more openly accepting start. that believes there's more than just 'scientific' psionics.
<br />
So yes, sean. i think psipog should come to an end and hail a new beginning for a new site that can focus on exploring every area and aspect of spirituality and psionics.
<br />
(apols for the rant. when i rant, i rant good.)
