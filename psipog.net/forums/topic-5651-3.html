It is the male orientation of a creature that rapes you in the night, sucubus is the female one that rapes you in the night. Originally they were legends to explain the occurence of wet dreams but this pressure on chest phenomenon does actually exist. There are several well known similar descriptions of things that rape you in the night, although this one doesn't seem to rape you. A description of one is called the green ogre, which puts an enormous heavy feeling on your chest and however hard you try it doesn't seem to come off, also noted is the fact that you can't hear yourself if you scream, you are basically in a dulled senses state. People who have been raped by this creature state it has grey hair and a scaly green surface. Also it is noted that if you don't believe that it exists than it comes and rapes you. Although not all forms of these pressure on chest creatures or whatever seem to rape you there are some that actually just seem to drain your life force, namely one woman who believed her house was haunted opened her eyes before some spirit like substance attacked her with fangs. Once again there was a feeling that it's intent was to suck or drain life force from her. The most famous incident that I recall was the one on some island in the caribbean. It occured when a creature began to mass rape several men in the night and warned each man that was a victim that if they did not spread news about him and claim that he was raped than he would come back for them. The creature was actually believed to be male was described to have wings, a large single eye in the center of the forehead, and a dwarflike body. Victims of rape could not see nor could they really be aware of what was going on. They could hear the creature speak to them but they could not hear their own voice nor could they do anything about the raping. Interestingly enough other members of the family could easily hear of the rape and they also saw the creature fly through the window and begin to rape, the entire rape scene was also clearly visible to all spectators and they could easily see and hear and percieve the creature as it continued it's work on the chest of the man, after when it was done it would fly away. When the family of the victim saw the creature they would immediately start screaming that the creature was at there house and dozens of neighbours would come watch the scene and try to help but to no avail.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I don't believe in it. I'll let you know how my rape goes.

			I've in the time since my last posts in this had a few more encounters with this creature, whatever it may be. Each time I came out the victor, and finally defeated it, I believe once and for all, with a sort of psi-weapon.
<br />
Ever since I started practicing Psi, I've found that I can more effectively repel it. This time, I do believe I have defeated it once and for all. None have come since.
<br />

<br />
That said, I have had a few DREAMS of similar experiences, but they have felt considerably different, and were easily identifiable as dreams. Since I was exposed to these &quot;attacks&quot; for almost a year, it's easy to understand I may have a few recurring dreams, but there is definately no notable threat in said dreams, and my normal lucid dreaming techniques work fully.
<br />

<br />
I also should mention: in the days and weeks following my victory, I have noticed some things. Physically, I feel healthier and stronger than ever before. I feel new strength within me, and also I seem to be sharper mentally. It's like a weight was lifted, or new fuel was put into my body and spirit.
