			Hello!
<br />

<br />
The forums are officially shut down.  The chat will be shut down in about 3 hours.  And by that time, I hope to have the archived version of PsiPog.net up and running.  The forums won't be migrated over to the PsiPog.net server for another week, I bet.  But they will find their way over fairly soon.
<br />

<br />
The PK Party was totally awesome.  At peak, we had 115 people in the chat room, which destroyed our old record (which was 99 for the Flare Party).  Everyone was really nice, and we all had great time.  The pictures will be online fairly soon.  Thanks to everyone who showed up.
<br />

<br />
I'm also sorry that not everyone could show up.  I know there were scheduling conflicts, but that's how life goes on the internet :-/.  At the end of this post is the log of everything, from start to finish, if you're curious.
<br />

<br />
The big news (or at least, what I considered the big news <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />) was the unveiling of my new website.  It's located at: <a href="http://alittleweird.com" target="_blank">http://alittleweird.com</a> .  I know in the past I said that I wanted to focus strictly on OBEs, but I thought about it for a while, and decided against that idea.  My new goals for my future site is to focus on everything paranormal, and instead of taking a scientific standpoint, I'm going to take a fun standpoint.
<br />

<br />
I think having fun is more important than being scientific.  Now I know a lot of you might be smacking your head, saying &quot;What?!&quot;, but it's the truth.  I think the reason PsiPog was successful was because we had fun.  It's not because we did things scientifically.  Being scientific probably HELPED... but what is the main reason for success?  Because we are down to earth and have fun in the midst of all this weird shit we can do.
<br />

<br />
That doesn't mean I'm dropping the scientific aspect of it... it just means I'm putting science where it belongs.  As something to help us.  Science serves us - we shouldn't be serving science.  At PsiPog, it seems like we sometimes go out of our way, or worry so much about the scientific aspect of things, that we miss out on what's going on around us.
<br />

<br />
In a way, I want to &quot;outsource&quot; the scientific aspect of the paranormal.  ErikJDurwoodII, of MegaTronic Online ( <a href="http://labs.megatroniconline.com" target="_blank">http://labs.megatroniconline.com</a> ), is the guy who came up with the geiger-counter experiment, and he knows a lot more about science than I do.  I've had a lot of conversations with him, and he has a lot of awesome scientific ideas.  He has fun doing science.  I have fun doing paranormal stuff.  I predict a healthy relationship <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  I hope to use some of the theories and devices him and his team come up with to help me hunt down the paranormal.
<br />

<br />
This is a positive step.  Focusing on fun is what it's all about.
<br />

<br />
I hope others see this as a positive step.  A Little Weird.com isn't open yet - but I did create a simple Yahoo! Group.  If you want to stay in contact with the status of ALW, then please join the Yahoo Group.  Go to the main site <a href="http://alittleweird.com" target="_blank">http://alittleweird.com</a> and put your email in the box to sign up.
<br />

<br />
If you have any questions, e-mailing me is the best way to get in contact with me, but realize that I might not be able to reply to everyone.  But hey - I'll try.  <a href="#">sean.m.connelly@gmail.com</a> .
<br />

<br />
Thanks to everyone.  Even though I was the webmaster of PsiPog.net, that doesn't mean that I'm the one responsible for it's success.  Every moderator and member, both the intelligent ones, and the annoying ones <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />, made this place what it was.  I'm very thankful that so many people have helped me create this site - I surely couldn't have done it alone.  I look forward to the next step, and I hope those who share my vision will join in creating another monumental organization.
<br />

			I've been thinking about this, and, I <span style="font-style: italic">can</span> come. But, I have never actually joined Psipog's chat. I don't really know how, I'm pretty sure I have to download something...
<br />
And downloading for me, is usually close to impossible. Dial-up!!

			If you're on Windows, then download mIRC here:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://mirc.com/get.html" target="_blank">http://mirc.com/get.html</a>
<br />

<br />
Pick any link near the top, they are all the same file.  Download, install, and run it.  Cancel out any pop-up windows, except the &quot;Status&quot; window, which should be all white with a spot to type at the bottom.  Type the following:
<br />

<br />
/server irc.darkmyst.org
<br />

<br />
A bunch of stuff should scroll on your screen, wait for it to stop.  Then:
<br />

<br />
/join #psipog
<br />

<br />
That's it!
