			Well, this morning I had my first OBE (partial I guess)!
<br />

<br />
It's kinda ironic, me and my friend were talking on the bus yesterday and he said he had gotten his first OBE that morning. So I said that I hadn't really tried achieving it that much but that I'd start get more serious this weekend. Who'd have thought that I'd be getting one the day after? <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Anyways, it was like this, I just somehow woke up from a dream or something I can't remember, and everything was all vibrating and I heard a loud ringing sound. I could see the TV that is in front of my bed, but it was like blurry, maybe like a double image even. Everything of this happened in just a few seconds and I somehow just knew I was going out. Then I felt my hands going through the blankets and I got freaked out, and it was like everything went into my body and I woke up. I sat up, and after a short pause I said out loud &quot;Damn, I should have continued!&quot;. Ah well, I hope I'll go out completely tonight <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> No I know I will <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I must congratulate you. I've been trying to OBE but I get REAL close but that natural fear of the unknown comes all at once and I just stop. <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" /> But I guess courage is fear cloaked with willpower. I'll try tonight and see what I get. Anywhoo, good job. I'm somewhat jealous of you for getting that <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			hehe, this is the first time back on this site for a while.
<br />

<br />
congrads on your obe. i remember having one when i was seven by total fluke. I thought i woke up from my dream but everything was still dream like, i could tell the it was different because everything was so vivid, but a little haze in the air making everything blur out. everything was pure and fresh, and i could see the air. It was cool
<br />

<br />
all though i never had an obe again, because i didn't know what it was until about a year ago
<br />

<br />
i should try to relearn and refine this skill, it could be handy.
