			I appreciate the response sgtpsion. However, on the subject of the religious aspect, I was simply giving the backround on the number that I obtained for a research paper about a month ago. I also want to clarify that I was not in any way trying to influence the religious perspectives of others. My apologies if anyone thought this.
<br />

<br />
I also found a second theory on 666, by the way. 
<br />

<br />
2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 11^2 + 13^2 + 17^2
<br />

<br />
By taking the first seven prime numbers, squaring them and adding them together, the answer comes out to 666 (also, note that 1 is not a prime number). I don't know what this could mean, but I'll leave that decision up to the readers.

			I'll tell you all what. This is whats gonna happen on 6/6/06. We're gonna have a day like any other. IF anything is to happen it'd be that all the crazy super religious Suicide/doomsday cults are gonna either wipe us out with weapons of mass destruction, or more likely take long walks off short peirs and dine on spiked punch and cheese curls.

			There's a broken comet headed this way!
<br />
Its comet 73P Schwassmann-Wachmann, it has broken into pieces somewhere in 1995, no-one knows why though.
<br />
Soon there will be a close encounter with the comet only 16 million miles away, but because it is broken it could hit earth, or pieces of it.
<br />

<br />
here are some links about that:

wow. i like the reference to heavens gate. 
<br />

<br />
i remember watching a doc about this new theory they have on the whole revelations book. (sorry bout gettin religious)
<br />
they say that while revelations was written it was OBVIOUSLY written in the time of the romans where they persecuted christians. the christians were an underground community and they had to write and talk about god and other related topics in code. not necessarily pig latin (lol) but if they talked openly they would get killed. 
<br />

<br />
relating to revelations......revelations could be a coded letter talking about jesus, but the first jesus (uhh..i think you know what i mean). it might not be a telling of the future, but talking about the life and death of jesus. 
<br />

<br />
in ancient times they would associate numbers with names. so everyone's name would have a number value. during their time of persecution there were three roman emperors before constantine but after jesus's death. i can't remember all of them but one of them was nero. 
<br />

<br />
the 666, in the theory, represents those 3 emperors (many different names can have the same number value btw.)
<br />
so there's my schpiel.

Well, I'm not gonna get into the religious part other to say that the doc you watched was OBVIOUSLY not done by believers, but by people who had no real idea of what the bible says. Because it's not about the stupid romans.. It's about the end times. Either way, no religion right? So don't bring it up at all.
