			so i was bored in history class one day (actually, it was after an assignment on block day, but that doesn't matter), and decided i'd just rest my head. at first i was just relaxing, then i realized that i was starting to dream (i couldn't even tell i was in a classroom physically), and then out of nowhere my senses went back to my body, and i felt my entire body being filled with a massive tingling sensation that pulled me out of my dream (note, it was whole body and not just one part.. i noticed it the most in my legs though). i remembered then that i was in a classroom, but in my mind i could see a diner with the circle seats that spin (ontop of a bar next to a counter), and the floor was square tiles alternating colors (yellow and something else)... it was VERY clear. 
<br />

<br />
i'm just wondering what the heck that was.. the tingling reminded me of when i practice OBE's (haven't had one yet =[ ). heh, maybe my mind's just playing tricks on me or something

			man you people have some seriously boring classes, that they can bore your mind out of the body <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

Perhaps some sort of hypnagogia, but hypnagogia strikes more in flashes - real and vivid for sure, but not so much a stable picture to look at it consciously. Maybe thats just me.
<br />

<br />
What i think this is, is something symilar to what i had when i was a teenager, though i had that prior to sleep. In the borderline between sleep and waking state, i had a flash going through an insect-populated tunnel very fast and then i could see some people in white shits sitting on chairs and casually talking and i was one of the (or more like looking through the eyes of one of them) - very real, very conscious at that point - wasnt a dream for sure. Then i snapped back into this reallity - still lying on the bed.. The intresting part is that i was not in control, i could just look at what &quot;he&quot; was looking, and hear litttle something too, but it was distorted. Im still wondering to this day what that was, what was that i saw and who were those people and was it me who was sitting there or was that some other guy? was it a space shift or a time shift.. maybe an OBE?
