			<span style="color: blue">Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
Here is a theory I have been working on. My problem is I don’t know enough about the brain to be able to write about it in a clear and concise way. Sorry in advance for misspellings or unclear ideas. Please give me your ideas and/or reasons why this may or may not be wrong  
<br />

<br />
My Theory:  We all know that separation of objects is an illusion. That everything is a great big pool of atoms. And that it is the mind that interprets and separates these objects for us. We also know that the mind sends out electrical signals to accomplish bodily functions such as arm movements Ect. Ect
<br />

<br />
What if it was the separation of objects that was all that stood between a &quot;non-Psi mind” and a &quot;Psi-mind&quot;? (Quotes are for lack of a better word). Everything we know in the world is made up of atoms. What if it was no different with Psi? If the brain can send out atoms all along the body, why can't it send out stimulated atoms to perform a task outside the body? 
<br />

<br />
Now here's where we get to the tricky part. &quot;Awareness&quot;, it seems that our body can recognize a certain amount of area past where our body stops. That &quot;Awareness&quot; seems also to be dynamic (changing). Extending in or out based on a combination of how relaxed the person's is and how &quot;open&quot; the person's mind is to &quot;Awareness&quot;. (My point is coming soon)
<br />

<br />
My point: By relaxing the body and opening up &quot;Awareness&quot; outside the body. The brain can distinguish a group of atoms (a soda can, psiwheel, pencil...ect. ect.) over time based on how tightly or loosely grouped the atoms are and the amount of space the &quot;Awareness&quot; has to cover. 
<br />

<br />
With Psi Skills people should be taking this into consideration for example with Pk, people should be basing their objects on type (paper, plastic, medal) and size. Not just the lather. 
<br />

<br />
P.s I found out the the more &quot;Awareness&quot; a person has, the more &quot;strong&quot; the person is in Psi
<br />

			I thought of a simpler idea before...so I know some of the problems in it.
<br />

<br />
This theoery (should be called hypothesis first of all) it donest really have a well form astral projection in it.  Plus coldness seems to be a problem in this hypothesis of yours. Hacking seems like a problem also. 
<br />

<br />
Care to give some more precise words? I can't really say more untill I hear more.

			Then psionics would be causing many chemical reactions with many elements or compounds(along with other characteristics of atoms) ,therefor giving the ability to prove that psi exists. From some research with a geiger counter, it's shown that particles shed, leaving it the chances that psi is a partical or photon (or possibly something else) rather than an atom.

			umm...actually the brain just interperets the wavelength of light that is reflected from an object when you see it.  The brain uses only its senses to gain information about the outside world. The mind doesn't seperate the objects. Now, all matter maybe connected in some ways, but there is still distances and space between atoms in our multidimensional reality. You need to study some more science and modify your theory a little bit.

			Its a matter of what space is really, and I don't think we have the evidence to support that the brain bends light or makes it.

But yes I do think it needs work.

Well I can see how this is partly adds...I do agree with you on that, expect maybe a tumer in your brain causeing a seizure.

			I don't think thats completely true. When you see something, your brain is detecting the wavelength of light that bounces of the object. The object doesn't just disappear after a while though. Your retina is still sends signals about the object to the brain, even though the stimulus doesn't change.

			An idea which might seem very plausible is that you are divived into two parts. Consciousness and non-conscioussness or maybe subconsciousness. The consciousness might be the you that makes the thinking and takes decisions and the sub- or nonconsciousness does whatever consciousness tells it or what it has learned how to act in specific situations and takes action automatically then if you dont interfere and tell it to do otherwise or to do nothing at all. 
<br />

<br />
so you might say: the robot and you 
<br />

<br />
or you might say: the body and the mind or / consciousness
<br />

<br />
or maybe: left hemisphere of the brain and right hemisphere
