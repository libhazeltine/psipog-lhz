			<span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal"><span style="color: red">Disclaimer: By posting this technique on this website I am neither taking credit for it, nor telling anyone to believe it. Believe what you want and who you want. Im putting it on here to help people improve there willpower and visualization.</span></span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">INTRODUCTION</span>
<br />
This a useful technique that I found on some website (I forgot where it is).
<br />
After using it I could produce a psiball in an instant and I could move objects that I couldnt move before. This technique only took me five minutes to master after my first try.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">TECHNIQUE</span>
<br />
Go outside on a cloudy/ sunny day and look up at the sky. Hopefully, you will see clouds in a variety of sizes and shapes. If it is possible, focus on a small cloud that is away form other clouds. Make an image of that cloud in your head. In your imagination, make the cloud slowly dissappear. When you focus on the real cloud again, you'll notice that it is slowly dissappearing until its gone.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN?</span>With psi techniques it is bad to question why something happened, because even after it works your mind will begin to think it isnt possible.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">HOW DOES THIS WORK?</span>
<br />
Without knowing it you used basic PK to separate the individual water molecules in a cloud. The water molecules in a cloud are not very dense so they are easy to move, even for beginners. The cloud did not really dissappear; it's still in the sky, but it is not whole anymore. This is similar to blowing the seeds off of a Dandellion (I know I spelled that wrong).
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">DO'S</span>
<br />
-If you've wasted five minutes of your life reading this article, try it.
<br />
-Do keep trying if it doesn't.
<br />
-Do relax before you do it. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">DONT'S</span>
<br />
-Dont say that this is fluff (or whatever), unless you're talking about the clouds. Try it.
<br />
-Dont give up after the first try. Take a break every ten minutes. It shouldnt even take that long.
<br />
-Dont try to send psiballs to the clouds. You'll end up passing out.
<br />
-Dont try to move the clouds across the sky. It wont work.
<br />
-Dont complicate this technique. It is more basic than making a psiball.
<br />
And most important...
<br />
-<span style="font-weight: bold">DONT REPLY ON THIS TOPIC ABOUT HOW ITS NOT REAL AND THAT IM A LIER. THE DISCLAIMER AT THE TOP IS THERE FOR A REASON.</span>

			You can move a cloud as a whole, it just takes practice. I know from personal experience that it's possible to stop almost any type of weather and bring nature back to balance, but it's difficult to start weather. Just try, practice, and have fun <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

your willpower will be stronger. FOCUS+WILLPOWER= PSYCHOKINESIS

I was just exaggerating. There have been times when I've tried to program a psiball to do something outrageous, and the only result was my energy was depleted and I was lightheaded.

			This is a fun one. I've heard of this before, but nice of you to bring it here.

<br />
'Cloud Blasting', I believe it was called when I first saw it. I've done it, but never seeing much point, haven't done it much. Good time-killer, and I suppose it can be used to build up to new skills.
<br />

<br />
I've heard rumors(nothing more), that if you get really good at it, you can actually 'sculpt' clouds, even if the shape only lasts so long due to the air currents and such up there.
