It's pretty fun to watch TV, but it takes away hours of your day and you don't get a thing from it (well, maybe a bit).

So can anyone give me tips on how they do it? I know some people say they &quot;just do it&quot;, does that mean you look at it and then it moves?
<br />
Do you visualize anything?
<br />
Do you use a psi ball?
<br />
I'm really curious about all this. I only found out about this stuff a few days ago and i'm sooooo interested! Alot of people might be skeptical, but I have always wondered about stuff like this (maybe one day I could do Carrie style stuff <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />)

			OK Sorry for this double post but I made it move, at first it wobbled but then it swung a few degrees to the right and then to the left.

I'm not sure if it was me, I wasn't breathing on it and there was no wind or anything. It moved. But when I took my hands away it was still moving for about 10 seconds after. Has this happened to anyone?

I think you shouldn't visualize or just do,
<br />
you have to get a feel or connection with the object and let it move.
<br />
I use a combination of pulling or pushing with psi and &quot;just do it&quot;

			My pinwheel moved!!!!!!!!! No wait, it was just the small air pressure distortion created when i moved my fingers too fast.

<br />
It always makes me excited. Even if I do see the pinwheel move, I can never be sure until I can make a sustainted rotation rather than just wobble to the left or right.

			What we mean when we say we just do it, is we are going by the gnomish philosophy in our method.  Check the article section under PK and check out his article.  Everyone is different, and different methods work for everyone, but I just like to cut out the middleman (aka feeling the energy and stuff like that) and jsut jump straight to the movement.

that happens to me, and it makes me doubtful, so what i did was put a pint glass over it so no wind can get to it, you can make it move but it is much harder, but much more belivable.

So I got this site off a friend, and after reading a bit, I managed to create a Psi ball within a minute, after that it takes longer and longer, but I can hold it longer.
<br />
Anyway, so I made a psi wheel and I've followed every instruction but it doesn't even shake. I visualize my &quot;atoms&quot; moving it without touching it, and it doesn't move (after 10 minutes my mom walked in and thought I was doing drugs) I also heard a guy made a psi ball and threw it at the wheel making it move. I did this but nothing happened either. Does anyone have any good tips? I've searched the forums but everyone seems to be able to move the psi wheel.
<br />
(By the way when I'm doing it my mind is clear and I'm really focusing on it)</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
your mom's part was the best ever, that was so funny lol lol lol
<br />
well, maxus said about the become-one-with-object technique but it won't work for me.
<br />
about other guy who said something about focused inatention, i checked out some really interesting stuff yesterday (or a day before yesterday? anyway, doesn't matter): i was trying movin my psiwheel, then i started to make some mental &quot;force&quot;. i feel something on my head when i do this, like an impulse. anyway, i was forcing it, forcing it, and didn't move. then i relaxed a bit, just to &quot;let it go&quot;, and it did move. like a muscle, you can close your hand very hard hard hard hard, then you let it normal again.
<br />
i think this is the best state to do tk. between doing totally nothing (or almost nothing) and doing something hard.
<br />
ill experiment a lill more, but it was the impression i had, that this state was good.
<br />
try it
<br />

<br />
ah, btw, when you dudes move psiwheel, what do you feel? i feel no conection whatsover.. just some kind of... well, i feel nothing and something at same time, a nothing something. does any of you feel that too? or do you feel something really strong that shows CLEARLY that you are moving the wheel?
