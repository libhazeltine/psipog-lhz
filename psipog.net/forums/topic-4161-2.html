			the point i was trying to make, is to show thats its ALL the same so why give something a new name when it already has one 
<br />

<br />
its like haveing a cat named furball and having a guest come over and call it fluffly you cat already has a name so why try changing it when the name suits its purpose already? Why CAUSE THERE IS NO POINT its total bastardiztion of what of what Psychokinesis defines (the purpose, not the actually definition of psychokinesis) and it is honestly stupid and dumb to give a name like aero-kinesis (just breath look you affected the air) soo there IS NO POINT GIVING STUPIDS NAMES when Psychokinesis does its puropse or at least call it pryo-PK or what ever

I have two cats, and both of them have at least five variations on their names (each) that my family calls them by on a regular basis. Why? Because we feel like it. Because we want to. People will call things what they want to call them. Is there a point? Probably not. Will people continue using terms like &quot;aerokinesis&quot; and &quot;thunderkinesis&quot; regardless of logic? Yes. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
And, although you can rip a word like &quot;aerokinesis&quot; apart with logic and analysis of its roots - you know exactly what the word is referring to when someone uses it, don't you? <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			i think we said enough to make anyone change his mind or know what we are refaring to but you darknecro1010 is hard to make you change your mind because you dont want to do so and you want what is exist in your mind only.

			ok you see we are arguing the same point we all know that psychokinesis effects matter we ALL know that
<br />

<br />
my main point was why are we making up names when we don't have to lol Thunderkinesis, Terrakinesis(Geokinesis), Aerokinesis, Hydrokinesis, Pryokinesis, Biokinesis,Atmokinesis, Audiokinesis, Chlorokinesis, Chronokinesis, Cryokinesis, Electrokinesis, Gravitakinesis (Gyrokinesis), Magnokinesis, Photokinesis (Lumokinesis), Technokinesis, Thermokinesis, Umbrakinesis. (this is all i found on just wikipedia.org you can see why its stupid)
<br />

<br />

<br />
there is your proof on how stupid it really is like why did we (i mean we as people) create so many terms where there was no need

			People do it because in most other psionic communities, the psions use terms like those.  Therefore, when they come here, they use them.  A lot of the terms come from video games, comics, or Sci-Fi movies.  People think they sound cool (ie &quot;Hey, i can do xxxxkinesis&quot;).  They also think, as it has been pointed out earlier in this thread, that it catagorizes things into smaller groups.  In reality, it just makes things more complicated.  Instead of saying &quot;I picked up some dirt and some water using PK yesterday&quot;, you are saying &quot;I did some aquakinesis and some geokinesis yesterday.&quot;  Well, it might sound the same but listen.  There are different terms for the same thing (ie. geokinesis and terrakinesis).  Not only that, but using &quot;PK&quot; <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> more specific.  What are you moving? Dirt, a rock, etc.  What is happening to it?  Did it levetate? did it roll?  did it do anything (you still didnt say you suceeded).  i hope this helps clear up some things.
