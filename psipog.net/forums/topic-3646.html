			Hello FrostBitten,
<br />

<br />
While reading your previous thread (which is now locked), I have come the conclusion that you have absolutely no idea what you're doing. You're material is totally incorrect and yet you decided to build your own community. You're also hiring people with absolutely no skill whatsoever. Do us all a favor, worry about learning rather than politics. You can't teach what you don't know. 
<br />

<br />
Take care.

Umm... no skill??? NO SKILL?!?!? Unless you are talking about the people who joined the forum just so they can be a captain that dont have a clue what they are doing. Here are the people with skill in the area they signed up in...
<br />

<br />
EVERYONE ON THE SITE!!
<br />

<br />
Its not that hard to realize that some people have skill. Instead of being mad at him for starting a community of his own... why dont you actually look into it and join. We are helping people with things... why dont you try to help people and stop being a jerk about him making a site!
<br />

<br />
Dont be an idiot... look at the rules!

First, Roy did the right thing by locking the &quot;MPW-13&quot; thread.  I noticed you guys complaining about it on your forums.  We have a specific forum for advertising (this one).  We don't like having advertising outside of this forum, because spam is annoying.  The purpose of the PsiPog forums is not to recruit people for your organization... sorry.
<br />

<br />
Second, Joe and Roy have made good points.  Instead of throwing a hissy fit because they aren't jumping on this bizarre bandwagon, why not try to understand what they're saying?
<br />

<br />
Third, people have very different definitions for &quot;skill&quot;.  The PsiPog community is full of mostly newbies, with very little skill.  If you don't believe me, check out the lost and found section of the forums.  It's not a BAD thing... but it is something that you should realize.  Just because Joe made you mad doesn't mean that you now instantly have skill.
<br />

<br />
You are free to do whatever you want.  As long as you follow the rules of this forum while you are on here, then I'll have no complaints.
<br />

			Hello Psi_Ninja,
<br />

<br />
Ah, someone who wants to argue with me. This should be fun. I don't know why you thought that debating me would benefit your statements but it's your choice. Let's get to it, shall we?
<br />

<br />
Over the years of being around the psionic community, I've seen countless members start their own psionic related web site. Do you know how many of those communities are still around? None. You're wasting your time role playing and basically bullshiting themselves. 
<br />

<br />
Starting this website is not going to benefit you nor it's members who you get to join. None of you have the required experience or skill to teach nor give advice on any psionic related ability. How dare you even say that you're qualified to begin teaching/assisting members with psionic related issues. You've been around for how long? Three months? Maybe four? Grow up, you're not ready to help manage your own psionics community.
<br />

<br />
Allow me to show everyone what one of the captains of this new community has stated in the past. These quotes were comments that you've made in the past concerning psionics as well as responsibilities.
<br />

<br />
1) Im too lazy. If anyone wants too, feel free to write them for me Very Happy .
<br />

<br />
2) Hey, Xiouslaidyn, how old are you now. Those voices might be talking about your age and something important happening to you or the world. And if you were trying to OBE, i would stop because the FOCUS FOCUS YES YES YES might be like (dont pick on me for saying this) an evil spirt trying to take over your body when you OBE. That would suck if it was. 
<br />

<br />
3) tastekinesis-taste objects from far away!
<br />

<br />
4) You are all so lucky im here Very Happy !
<br />

<br />
(just ingore &quot;ki&quot; and replace it with &quot;psi&quot;. Its the same thing.)
<br />

<br />
Do those comments look like they come from a mature moderator who has experience when dealing with psionics? No. Actually, those comments are quite humorous. Let's go over some comments that your &quot;leader&quot; has stated during his time here.
<br />

<br />
1) First of all, 2012 is bullshit, second: on the day of slayer, I'm going to fuck up any evil presenses that come my way. Third: Did you guys play Kingdom Hearts of something and then get scared? Because this sounds JUST like kingdom hearts to me, I hope this is real though, because I might get a keyblade.

It seems as if your captain is unable to remote view lost items without the help of other members. Yet, he is qualified enough to give advice on the subject? He didn't even give out coordinates! He has no idea what he is doing. How can someone who does not know anything about remote viewing or it's protocols have the right to teach and give advice to members?
<br />

<br />
Those are only a few reasons why I believe that none of you have the right or capability to start your own psionic related community and teach other members. Obviously your all hypocrites who's goal is to start your own community with the image of the boss. Like I said, you kids need to stop worrying about politics and start working on gaining actual skill.
<br />

<br />
You tell me you have skill, let's see it. Stop by the chat room at anytime and I'll be more than happy to work with you for a little bit. We also have a program that picks up on activity that energy gives off called the Geiger program. You say you have skill, prove it. I'm sick of hearing people bullshit around, show me that you have the ability/experience to be able to instruct other members. Like I said, anytime you wish and I'll be there.
<br />

<br />
I know I'm coming off as mean however, the truth is I'm simply looking out for you all. I don't want to see this group fall and quit like all the other communities started by members who wanted to break away from the community who've helped them and start there own. Take it from me, you will not benefit at all by doing this. 
<br />

<br />
Well, this rant is coming to it's conclusion. Please understand where I'm coming from and how I'm trying to help you. However, I'm going to make this clear right now. If you call me an idiot again, you and I will have a long talk based on respect. If at anytime anyone wishes to debate or discuss your new group, I will gladly participate. 
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

Now I agree with a lot of what you said, and I am part of the forum (becuase I figured what the hell, maybe it'll be fun) but that statement was a little bit of a generalization, don't you think?

			Hello Mad_Hatter,
<br />

<br />
Absolutely not. I've seen this same situation happen countless times in the past. These members are more concerned with their reputation rather than learning psionics properly and gaining from it. What these kids are doing is non-beneficial and stupid. My advice to you and everyone else participating with that community is to not get involved with fluff communities. 
<br />

Take care.

Let me just inform you that your grammar skills are thrilling me. Second, you're asking why do I care? I care because your coming to this community advertising on OUR forum and telling our members that you have something to offer them that we don't. Which is totally incorrect and quite rude. I have not insulted anyone who hasn't insulted me. If you're talking about Psi_ninja, then perhaps he'll learn not to call moderators jerks.

You can't remote view because you probably never put in the time of effort to learn how to remote view properly. Allow me to help you with that, you can check out an remote viewing article towards the bottom of this post. 
<br />

<br />
I am trying to show to your members that your community is in no way qualified to help them dealing with psionic related issues. Normally I wouldn't waste my time however, you are advertising your community and recruiting our members who I personally wish to help. I understand that I in no way control anyone. However, I can certainly try showing them the truth.

<br />
Take your own advice. Your original thread was locked yet you decided to once again to start another topic advertising your community. 
<br />

<br />
I have one more thing to discuss with you. This is yet another reason why I feel that you are in no way qualified to manage your own community. While browsing through your forums I noticed Roy's name appear in the General section of the forum. The topic is called &quot;Roy is jealous&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
How dare you come to our community, advertise your website and then insult our staff. That my foolish friend is very rude and quite immature. I for one think that you should be banned. Grow up kid.

			Here's a little run-down of their insults:
<br />

<br />
FrostBitten: Or something like that, we locked our topic on psipog, he claims to have a reason for this but I think he is just pissed and is driven by his hatred for MPW-13.
<br />

<br />
     My response: You're not important enough to hate.
<br />

<br />
FrostBitten:  No I haven't, quite frankly, I've never been fond of roy, I don't like him, most people in psipog irc chatroom don't like him aswell. They claim he kicks people and get's mad at people for stupid reasons, I have a feeling that when I join the psipog channel on darkmyst, people are gonna say dumb shit, so has the topic of MPW-13 came up in the chat or the forums by people yet?
<br />

<br />
     -My response: Looks like you're quite interested in how word is 
<br />
spreading about your organization.  It seems to me you're more worried about it's popularity rather than your members or your mission.
<br />

<br />
MarcusT: Ah but the thing is roy is a power hungry though and on top of that it appears to me he is a world class jackass pardon my language but it fits him.
<br />

<br />
     -My response:  Umm, who are you again?
<br />

<br />
Sparkz: I Agree. He seems to be a bit too much of a Cynic (right spelling?) to use his mod Privileges resposibly.
<br />

<br />
     -My response: if you can't spell it don't say it.
<br />

<br />
Mattz1010: He's too much of a jackass.  Even when compared to certain jackasses on CounterStrike: Source.  And I've seen quite the jackassery in my day.  He's just trigger happy.
<br />

<br />
     -My response: Et tu, Mattz?  Are you tired of flaming this forum and the chatroom with inane nonsense so you move to a new organization?  So be it.
<br />

<br />
3k: He probably locked the topic to boast his moderator privaliges. Plus we shouldn't really flame him to much, for all we know, he's probably reading this.
<br />

<br />
     -My response: I think that you'd be better off enrolling in an English class rather than a psionics organization.
<br />

<br />
Sparkz: Knowing the Guy's paranoia, that seems like an evident possability.
<br />

<br />
     -So now I'm paranoid?  Seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy here.  I see the forum post and now I'm paranoid because of it.  Excellent job.
<br />

<br />
It seems the only smart one in the group is 3k for suspecting that I might find these posts; and unfortunately, he's only correct because he's stating the obvious.
<br />

<br />
I've been around longer than you guys.  I've been doing this longer than you guys.  I may be rough around the edges, but my reasoning, especially in this case, is correct.  FrostBitten, you are unfit to lead any group of any people.  You disrespect Psipog by breaking the rules, and then continue to argue when you and everyone else knows you're wrong.  You also disrespect me by insulting me on your own forum.  You project your own jealousy onto me because you're angry you don't have a little group to call your own.  Well apparently, now you've got one.
<br />

<br />
I wonder if your members have ever bothered to ask what skills you may have, and what would actually make you a good leader, or at least a good psion.  I hope they would so that they can be sure of what they're getting themselves into.  FrostBitten, you are the blind leading the dumb.
<br />

<br />
And to you other members of &quot;MPW-13&quot; who feel that I'm not a beautiful person with a sparkling personality: say it to my face, or don't say it at all.  You're cowards.  You do nothing to uphold your status as a productive member of Psipog.
<br />

<br />
So, in closing: To all other prospective members of MPW13, you can do as you like.  I will certainly not stand in anyone's way.  Just make sure you know what you're doing, and make sure you're doing it for the right reasons.

			I have to admit, alot of those insults were some funny ones. Way to go burning me there. One thing that I have been telling numerous members, I am not the leader of MPW-13, I just started it and I am not leading it. Stop picking on people because of their English skills. Some people actually come from places where English isn't spoken. It's a big world. Well we sure just got burned. Congratulations Roy.
