			After three days of successful telekinesis I’m noticing certain side effects. To begin with moving the psiwheel was easy, and I guess as I realised I could do it, I did it more and more, today on the fourth day I have not yet been able to move it, and my head feels kind of tired: also my ability to move the wheel seems to be decreasing maybe my telekinetic “batteries” or whatever it is need time to recharge. So I wonder; is telekinesis an activity that requires a lot of rest between using it? I have decided-due to my head hurting- that I won’t be practicing as much over the next couple of days, which is disappointing as I wanted so badly to progress.
<br />

<br />
This brings me to the topic of this post, the question at the centre of it all. Does anyone else experience any side effects due to telekinesis? If so what do you do about it? Have you learnt a way to avoid such problems? Is it mandatory that you give your brain a rest? Or like I’m experiencing right now does telekinesis activity make you trance more improve meditation, or even improve your other psi activities?

			i got alot of side effects <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> , anyway you need some rest and dont practice for long time untill you get used to tk because it is use alot of energy because after alot of practice you feel headaches and feel daze and feel you want to sleep and rest . but you might notice you still not as like before in moving the psi wheel so rest for some days without doing tk and after that days pratice little and rest more till you become normal again but it will take little long time.
<br />
good luck

			I agree, Telekinesis cause so much rest, and if you don't get the rest, you can cause very serious side effects.  I would suggest eating alot of snacks/food between practice sessions and only practicing 30/45 minutes a day to start. O, and use common sense. When you start feeling bad, stop.
