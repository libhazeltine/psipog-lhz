			I've tried and tried but i cant seem to realize that i am dreaming when i am asleep!!!  i've gotten it to work once, but that was with the aid of this computer program, and it hasn't worked ever since.  i've decided that the best way to get repetitive results is to practice it over and over again.  i need some advice.  please post your method of entering a state of lucidity during you sleep.
<br />

<br />
dont say just tell yourself that you are in your sleep... that is a very vague explaination.  i need a detailed approach to doing this.  im sick of just dreaming during my sleep!!!!!!

			I'm in the same boat as you, I got it to work once but haven't got it to work since yesterday I read a method which says to &quot;reality check&quot; every so often.  Basically to either pinch yourself or look at your nose every so often, theorotically if you do it regularly you will do it in your dream as it becomes habit. If you use the nose method in the dream you won't see your nose then realise it's a dream or the pinch one if it's a dream you won't feel any pain so you'll know it's a dream. I didn't get any results last night but I'm going to keep trying it.

			You kinda have to think about LDing all day and do reality checks constantly and consistantly. Sooner or later your sub-c will pick up on these things off of habit ( like dylan said). Also, something I've been doing is recording my dreams and writing down at least one thing that was really out of place (like steering wheels on the wrong side of cars, wierd locals, etc.).
<br />

<br />
My goal since I've started writing these things down hasnt even been lucid dreaming and i've had three or for lucid experiances in the last month.
<br />

<br />
Hope it helps,

It's like nobody reads it... It has three of the most popular induction techniques breifly described then a link to a more in depth version of each.
