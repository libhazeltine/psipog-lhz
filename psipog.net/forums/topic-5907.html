			Well......... I think I know what you are talking about. Like, I was meditating on my chair once, and I was so into it and I tried to make my chair slide from one side to the other with me sitting on it. It felt like I was moving, it felt so real, but it wasn't becaues I was meditating. Sometimes you mind creates the illusion that you are moving.
<br />

<br />
I think you were not meditating, but this theory can apply to you also. If you really were moving your self, you should try to move a psi-wheel and see if you can control it. If you could move your self, the psi-wheel would be a walk in the park, or even try a pencil etc...

i have been practicing TK for a few weeks, but that was quite a long time ago... about 4-5 months, i still keep the idea of TK on my mind tho.
