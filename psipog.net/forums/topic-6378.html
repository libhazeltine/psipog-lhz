			I’ve noticed recently that a lot of people aren’t thinking a lot before they post, well either that or they are just plain dumb.  Over recent weeks there has been a plethora of stupid or unnecessary topics being made, either asking stupid things like “how do I be like &gt;insert anime character here&lt;” or “I just got gooses bumps, is that psi?” or other less stupid questions which are answered in-depth in the psipog articles.  
<br />

<br />
I’ve also noticed recently that a lot of people, some very knowledgeable and nice, have been leaving these forums, and a lot of them due to the decline in quality posts.
<br />

<br />
So I ask that people think before they post and ask themselves “Is this post stupid?” and, “Has this been answered in the articles?”, before we loose everyone who has any idea of what there talking about and psipog become a rotting putrid corps of what it once was.
<br />

			Psipog is closing. People have no patience, they are leaving. Quality drops becuase of it. What don't you see of it? It is only expected in my eyes. 
<br />

<br />
I sincerely miss the intelligent and nice people (well nice doesn't usually come with intelligence [that seems to be the natural order.]) But I am expecting almost every member to at least look at Peebrain's new site once, it may be a rebirth of it's past brilliance, or not. 
<br />

<br />
Rant for your rant: why are you guys bothering to rant about pointless posts? I am pretty sure I have seen more of these, than that of the &quot;bad&quot; threads.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> No offense, but people are the way they are, you complaining to them will not change them. Change is very hard especially for something that is embedded deep within someone. 
<br />

<br />
From the looks of things, I might as well leave too, but no, I stick with what I have. I'll stand by Psipog until it is gone. I have a strong sense of loyalty, and me leaving, would be like betraying this site.
<br />

That may very well be true, but it would be nice if psipog could end on a high note and not be remembered for the chaos it descended into before it died.  And I respect your loyalty somefatguy, I think that is a very important trait to have

Thank you, and yes, it would be nice to have a memorable ending. Although, since a lot are gone, it doesn't seem as if that will happen.

			I disagree with everybody going to peebrain's new site. The level he's on is the one after you finish messing around immaturely with psi. We'll have the same problems we have here and then some if we all just migrate. Think of it as stepping up though.

I said everyone will at least look at the site. What you said is true only to the fact that they may not like what his site is about or the level he is on. Maybe we are done messing around immaturely with psi as you so put it.

I don't understand how almost everyone can just put things on &quot;levels&quot;. &quot;Doing this is harder than this so it's out of your league. I've experienced this so I'm moving on from you dunces&quot; There's no such thing as levels, or stages or specific points to get to. It's all just experiences. Some people experience different things than others. That doesn't put them on any kind of &quot;higher&quot; level. Who says psi manipulation comes first, then the next level is OBE and the spiritual stuff? Only you that's who. (And others who self appoint the role of defining categories) I would not say you would be stepping up to anything, you're just stepping sideways. Just because Peebrain moved on to, not <span style="font-style: italic">up</span> to, OBE's etc, that doesn't mean it's the set course to be taken. I also noticed a large rise in the arrogance of you Niushirra since you've experienced what you call &quot;the commonplace&quot;. It's funny how you think because you've experienced this, your on a &quot;whole new level&quot;. Leaving all those immature psi manipulators behind right. Maturity comes with age and intelligence. Many psi manipulators are beginners, and therefor younger, which explains the maturity level of some. Your wording may be what makes it sound arrogant I guess, but that's what I took from it.
<br />

<br />
P.S Who cares how psi pog is remembered. You've learned and experienced things because of it, so who cares about what future onlookers think about some of the content.

			Derrick go committ suicide with bladey. Like seriously you are a waste of human flesh. All you do is just cause arguements on meaningless points. Do you actually have any real ideas in that head of yours? Infact, it is another level. There are also many ways to get to it. One of them is psi. Utilizing abnormal movement in the mental plane for psi is what everyone will eventually lead themselves too. It's the best way to do psi. You're bound to experience some abnormal mental &quot;movement&quot; whenever you do psi. Realizing this brings you up to the next level which eventually leads to you exploring the mental plane. Then you find the commonplace. Take things for face value derrick and not that everything is a threat or an insult.

			Sorry don't believe in levels. I believe in stages you may go through (yes levels you can say), but not the ones you guys put on everything. You try to make it so black and white and it's not.
<br />

<br />
P.S Have you ever thought that mabye I have experienced the &quot;commonplace&quot; a long time ago. And it I didn't &quot;get&quot; there taking the same route you have. It's funny how some experience the same things and view it completely diff. I don't think experiencing this puts me on any &quot;new level&quot;....Sorry for offending you master...I will never do so in the future.

			I would think reaching the commonplace would make you think you're special or on a higher level. Not many people have. Also, there are many differents ways of getting there; I already knew that. The point of the matter is, simple psi balls and energy manipulation will eventually lead to the commonplace. Psions always look for better methods and the best methods sends them straight to commonplace.

P.S Sorry if it seems like I'm trying to start an argument all the time. You're too easy to anger and I'm sometimes weak when it comes to poking the bear  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> . You must remember just because I'll try to add a wrench into your works sometimes, doesn't mean I don't agree with you. I very much agree with you sometimes, but I like trying to put every view/possibility out there. I'll try to holdback from now on.
