			I was in the library and found a book about how to test ESP. I figured I may find more ways to practice telepathy. I came across a chapter about psychokinesis and spoon/key bending and how to do it, so I figured, I have keys in my pocket, why not try it out, right. So I chose a really sturdy key... one I couldn't bend physically, and did the exercise in the book. I held it in my hand between my thumb and index finger and rubbed it gently, feeling it, not just physicalyl what it felt like with the bumps and ridges and metal, but trying to feel its energy. I visualized it becoming pliable in my hand and growing warmer, and I tried to clear my mind of everythign but the key.
<br />

<br />
After about 20 minutes, I looked at the key, and there was a deffinate bend to it, so much so, that I doubt it could fit in its lock well again. It wasn't doubled over in half or anything, but it was deffinately no longer straight like the otehr keys on my ring, or like it was before. I tried to bend it again physically but it wouldn't budge.
<br />

<br />
I will have to try this again, just to see if it wasn't a bum key or a fluke or something. I never really thought of myself as affecting objects with my mind before... telepathy is kind of my thing.
<br />

<br />
I think I was able to do it.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />
I will let you all know if I experiment with this further.
<br />

<br />
*Please let me know if you think I am doing it wrong or am completely full of crap.

I can answer that.  When trying to bend, your pouring shit loads of energy into it(well trying to), and it seems like it decides when it wants to bend.  So it's very random.  That bend took about 20 mins, no way in hell could i tape that on my shitty digital camra.
<br />

<br />
But i do have one vid, and a site allllll about bending.  (the vid is of somethien actually harder; breaking).

			Since I seemed to have luck with the key, I tried making a pin wheel and try with that too, but I couldn't get that to budge an inch. Makes me kind of wonder whether the key was really me or not.
