who says they have to be mutant? 
<br />

<br />
if you look at early hominoids, they began developing language (of course). We can presume that this is a primitive language and not as 'advanced' as our own. If we have communicational issues with our modern languages, wouldn't it seem that they had a shitload of trouble back then with their primitive? I can imagine so. 
<br />
What could make up for this? I think telepathy could have been a skill mroe commonly developed back them to make up for their primitive language. 
<br />
So going along with this theory (not fact), since natural selection will keep traits that will continue the reproduction of a species, telepathy could just a normal gene. Since our language has developed better and we have not really needed telepathy, it seems to be a rarer trait than having blue eyes. 
<br />

<br />
Basically what I was just saying with that, that if telepathy is a hereditary trait, it wouldn't be caused by a mutant gene.

			Yes but that really does circle around the hereditary trait deal. I think it could be a royal trait that got stronger from the alpha male of the group always overcoming the commoners.
<br />

<br />
So if its royal, its not common so in a way its a mutant trait.
<br />

<br />
But alpha males always do have more children do they? This is just a idea I thought to throw out.
