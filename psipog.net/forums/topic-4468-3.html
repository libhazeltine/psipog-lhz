i've noticed my anger being a trigger before but i can't ever tap into it when i want to. i mean, i can barley move the psi wheel for a couple rotations straight. yet when i need a way to take out my anger it seems to easily provoke silly things like this?

Psi is with you all your life. As you excersise it even in simple ways it grows. Your subconciouse(sp?) can access it more easily. I think that with some people anger is just a subconcious(sp?) trigger. When your angry yoru subconciouse(sp?) kicks into overdrive, of course this is all just speculation. Anyway that sounds intresting.

			I geisted a person once. You know how in movies someone throws another person into a wall or something (and there's <span style="font-weight: bold">always</span> window to shatter behind them?) Well it was nothing quite as fantastic as that, but there was this bully right? And he was coming towards me, so panicking, I said &quot;You stay away from me!&quot; and held out my hand to kind of ward him off. And he kind of staggered backwards a couple of paces, and looked at me like I was a freak or something, saying something to the effect of &quot;What the hell?&quot; ( I have a thing about swearing. I've sworn about three times in my life,)
<br />
I didn't think anything of it. You know how someone was saying anger triggered something moving? Well I find the two things that make me geist are anger and fear.

			Well there are 2 things but are related, I got very angry at my cousin because he was being a brat and my mom and aunt would take his side if I got into a fight with him so I used my little TV and my mind was still set on being furious and I kept getting angrier and angrier then my TV started to flicker which suprised my because it has never done that. Also when my dad annoyed me by talking to much I walked to the bathroom and released all my anger, then the lights began to flicker.
