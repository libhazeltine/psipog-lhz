			I became an natural Empath when I was 12. It burdens me though because when I first had it, I was overcomed by unbearable pain and emotions. I couldnt sleep for days. It'd be nice to ahve a natural shield too..

			Just a few days ago I looked back at my far past and realized I could be naturally empathetic. I remember back when I was a brat, I used to pick on the other kids, but when a teacher told me &quot;how would you like it if that was happening to you?&quot;, I cried for hours. Up to then, it fealt almost like that triggered it right there.. as far as I can remember, my life changed dramatically after that. I'm still a crying person, because I feel others pains.. I overload because i'm just a doormat, I want to care, I want to relate to the fullest so I can just say be strong, i'm here with you to work this out together.

			I think most folks have some kind of natural ability, but some don't at all.  Most probably just take it in subconsciously, though.  I think only sensitives would actually get overloaded.  So as long as you don't plan on getting too sensitive with it, I wouldn't worry.  However, learning how to shield is probably a good idea, just incase.  Sometimes psi abilities just seem to crop up on folks without them looking for them.  (For example, for about six months I was recieving precog, a while back.  I had never attempted it before, it just happened.  I'd assume the same is for empathy, or anything psi-related, too.)

			I've been an empath for seven years or so. 
<br />

<br />
A lot of what I've learned is that although shields are necessary, when an empath shields too much, there is always the possibility of the shields becoming ingrained.  Some people who are empathic that I know had natural shields to the point that they were headblind.
<br />

<br />
All I can say is that either end of the extreme with empathy can be problematic.  Overloads are not fun, and if you can't shield, or have no natural shields, I strongly recommend learning to shield.
