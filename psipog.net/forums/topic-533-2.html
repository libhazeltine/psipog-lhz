I would think so to, but then why can people defy it so easily in an OBE?
<br />

<br />
Now onto the science lesson:
<br />
I read 'A Brief History of Time' by Stephen Hawking twice, and he says that a black hole is what happens when a <span style="font-style: italic">large</span> star burns up it's hydrogen fuel and then collapses under it's own gravitational pull.  Because of this it becomes so dense (kind of like those sphere toys that expand to giant sizes and can also contract to very small sizes) that it's gravitational pull, which is determined by it's mass, is so strong that it attracts everything into it (including the own light that it emits - yes black holes are not actually black, they do glow but you can't see the glow because the <span style="font-style: italic">star's</span> light can't escape the event horizon).  Now, as stated the event horizon is the point of no return surrounding the black hole, once something has entered the EH it can never exit and therefore is pulled toward the black hole.  So, yes you can orbit a black hole - just as our own galaxy is orbitting a massive black hole coined 'The Great Attractor'.
<br />

<br />
No, you can not see a black hole - but scientists can see the gravitational pull a black hole has on surrounding matter/objects.  Also, particles stream out from just outside the event horizon - which can be measured.  Now, this to me would be proof they exist.
<br />

<br />
Also, they are not actually hole's they are spherical - remember they are collapsed stars.
<br />

<br />
Wormholes are inside a black hole (according to Einstein).  So going into a black hole would mean going through a wormhole.  Here's an excerpt from Wikipedia:
<br />
Wormholes known as Schwarzschild wormholes or Einstein-Rosen bridges are theoretical bridges between areas of space that are thought to be found in the center of a black hole and white hole, joining two universes. They exist in solutions to Einstein's equations, and are thought to be extremely unstable, and would instantly fall apart once created. Some speculation exists that quasars are actually white holes instead of supermassive black holes.
<br />

<br />
Here's what Wiki says about additional dimensions:
<br />
Additional dimensions
<br />
Theories such as string theory predict that the space we live in has in fact many more dimensions (frequently 10, 11 or 26), but that the universe measured along these additional dimensions is subatomic in size. As a result, we perceive only the three spatial dimensions that have macroscopic size.
<br />

<br />
But yes, wormholes and other dimensions are theoretical.  Time being the 4th dimension also is only theory.  But Einstein percieved space and time as a 4th dimensional manifold.
<br />

<br />
Wow, that was alot - there's the one thing you learned today. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Now that everyone is on the right page, can we get back to the matter at hand?  LOL

			I've heard 2 types of wormhole theories.
<br />

<br />
1. The first one I've heard of is the more common one, that they are completely separate from black holes.
<br />

<br />
2. The second one I've heard says that wormholes are attached to black holes. If an object of low enough mass entered a big enough black hole, the object would pass through the black hole, travel though the connected wormhole, and then exit through a white hole.
<br />

<br />
For the record: For a black hole to form, it must be at least 10 times more massive then our sun, and then go supernova.
<br />

<br />
I skimmed over some posts and fully expect some of this to be repeat information.

They are theorizing allot of stuff, the 5th Dimension though has nothing to do with &quot;Alternate Realities&quot;. I think that was his assumption.

Not too sure about this black hole dimension nonsense, but my dad says that there is a 5th dimension and many more dimensions past the 5th one- he says this comes into quantum mechanics/string theory. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

<br />
you're not defying gravity at all, you're in an energy body.Energy, aside from matter, has EXTREMELY little mass, so you could easily escape gravity because it would no longer be strong enough to pull you.

They say that black holes suck anything that get's close enough in and compresses it so tightly that it becomes nothing. Impossible? Maybe not. Think of the number 0. You can multiply it by ANYTHING and the result will always be 0. Perhaps black holes work in a similar fashion.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />
