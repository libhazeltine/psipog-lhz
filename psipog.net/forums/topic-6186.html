			I was sitting in my room thinking (which is never good for me). I realized that i havent been getting results in most of my psi abilities that i have been practicing in. 
<br />

<br />
I told my friend this, and he said that if i didnt want to do it, then i dont have to. I went insane. I couldnt decide if i wanted to or not. So i left it up to the psi wheel.
<br />

<br />
I put the psi wheel on the tack, and thought about everyone i met because of psi, all the good times i had, and even the bad times. I said to myself, &quot;I hope this f'in piece of paper spins, cause if it doesnt, ill miss psi forever&quot;.
<br />

<br />
and suddenly, it spun like crazy, and it kept spinning. The psi wheel then fell off the tack, onto the table. It slid across the table, followed by the tack, all around the table, and then off the edge.
<br />

<br />
So i would like to thank all of you when i say this...
<br />

<br />
Its you that kept me from losing it, and you who let me stay Psi_Ninja, cause its you that made it possbile for that wheel to spin.
<br />

<br />
So remember when you think about giving up about all the good times and bad times you had, and everyone you met. remember your first psi ball, your feelings when you got that guess right on your first try, when you found psipog.net
<br />

<br />
Thanks everyone, you keep me who i want to be.
<br />
