			Do you think that it is possible to store extra psi in a object (such as a ring or watch) so that it amplifies your psionic power. This idea came to me from Fullmetal Alchemist. In that show, Ed has a pocket catch that amplifies his alchemic power. Maybe this is possible with psi. If it is, im making them and selling them $10 each.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I'm not sure if it amplifies it, but it can store it.

<br />
If it's amplication your talking about, I'm not sure. It would seem to be awfully hard to get something that does that. However, I think that you could use a construct to be like a transformer and increase or decrease the power of the psi (analagous to voltage in this case).

			I mean to store psi in and have your rate of using psi double or even triple. But just storing energy would be good too.

			It'd be painfully hard to research whether the effect is because you think its going to work better or not but it is possible. I forgot for a while about, that just reminded me that I had a trinket that in the past appears to have amplified things through one of those two reasons, probably the former though to be honest unless you can provide a solid reason on why anything would do that.

			I've tried this once with a Glow-band i used to have. i would wear it throughout the day and add little bits of psi to it now and then, it didn't realy work out too good as i think the psi went stale (if at all possible) but whenever i wore it i would get a general sense of discomfort, and to be honest, i don't think i'll be trying it again in a hurry...
<br />

<br />
but that said: i hardly hold a degree on the matter. so i may have just been not feeling too well during around the time i was wearing the glow-band (it had stopped glowing, too <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> )

			The closest thing I've heard of that relates to it is a different kind of energy. It relates more to auras I think. For example, if a murderer touched an object frequently and a psychic used psychometry on it he/she would feel his/her evil energy.

			This would work.. although it sounds almost religious.. but I don't wanna go there.

I keep a silver chain around me, I never really thought of it as storing something, but one thing that I know about my chain, that it's always came back to me, no matter what happened.  There were times where i lost it.. on my bed for example, and then i would find it on my dresser.. O-o or something like that.  Creepy stuff.. no one else ever gets into my room.

			Its possible. My freind did it with a crystal (was shaped like an egg, but thats of no consequence) I still don't see why he would want to do it when you can just store psi minus the physical object, but i guess having something physical is cool too.

			I use a piece of tiger's eye crystal, with a construct to enhance energy and ability. It works, but it's not as convenient as putting the construct on yourself.
