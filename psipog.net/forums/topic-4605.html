			for me.. its simple.. whenever a coincidence happens.. or i finish someones sentence for them or what not. i just play it off like 'what a coincidence' we are all telepathic.. some are just unaware.
<br />

<br />
a female friend of mine is good at reading my mind, but shes has NO IDEA shes doing it. its only when i dont finish saying numbers or whatever ... if im eating and i dont want to be rude. i simply think of what im about to say and most of the time she can pick up on it. and we arent 'close' friends so i have no idea how she could do that.

I've never had trouble blending in or &quot;being normal.&quot; As far as &quot;don't use it,&quot; though, that's not really an option. There's no way for me to stop telepathizing any more than you can stop hearing. Still, I get by well enough.

			How to act &quot;normal&quot; huh??? I gotta tell you, I know alot of &quot;normal&quot; people who have trouble acting &quot;normal&quot;. People are typically really self absorbed, chances are they wont' notice or won't care. Don't be self conscious about it, be proud of who you are. I like other's suggestions of playing it off as a joke or a 'coincidence' if you want to poke fun about it... my personal favorite is &quot;women's intuition&quot;.

If telepathy is interfering with your functioning in the world such as sleeping, goint to work or class, or interacting with other socially, then that's another story. If this is the case <span style="font-weight: bold">you need to learn to control it!</span> It's really important.

			I think that it's best to be honest with your friends.  They might be scared that you will read their minds, but a real friend will stay with you no matter what.  You should be proud of your abilities, because you've worked so hard to gain them.

I do that too, especially if I'm not sure how that person would react to the truth.  If I get something and they say &quot;How'd you know that?&quot; I'd just say something like &quot;Hey, I'm psychic, haha&quot;.  If they freak out at just a jokey comment, then I know to be careful what I say around them.
<br />

<br />
I do it the other way round too, if I don't get something, I say something like &quot;Darn, my crystal ball just broke&quot; or &quot;I really gotta practice these mind reading skills&quot;
<br />

<br />
I only say it seriously if I'm with people I trust &amp; I know are okay with the subject.  Cuts down on the aggro.

			To be honest the problem is with strangers not friends. Say I walk into walmart, every person I see hits me with something verbally. Driving down the street and someone catches my attention the usual response is &quot;did you call me?&quot;   The <span style="font-weight: bold">I need to control it comment</span> is easier said then done. Focusing on breathing works to a degree. A friend of mind told me that the heart and 3rd eye are the source of focus. Can anyone see a way to tie breathing, the heart, and 3rd eye into a foundation for &quot;normal&quot; or cloaked?
