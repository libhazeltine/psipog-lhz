			Hi, all. This post serves three purposes. 
<br />

<br />
1) To see if it works, because on the index page it says that I can't post.
<br />
2) To indirectly introduce myself. Hi. I'm Barrett
<br />
3) To ask a question in regards to OBE
<br />

<br />
I'm not too new to meditating and not new with the IDEA of Psi. I guess there is a difference between reading books on the subject and reading what people similar to me think of the subject. So needless to say you all have inspired me. I'm much more interested in the perception side of the spectrum. Now, a few questions about OBE. Whenever I meditate my eyes tend to go into REM movement, much faster than I can do on command, and they do this when I seek an OBE. Does anyone else experience this because it is a block for me. I get vibes and I lose the feeling of my bed, but it seems like the movement of my eyes is keeping me connected. However if I stop them I lose the vibes and weightlessness. Later I'm going to try and stop them when it starts and see if I can continue to the same extent. 
<br />

<br />
Second question... My hands shake as a go deeper. The first attempt I lost feeling, it felt like my chest was lifting, but my hands and forearms were shaking. After maybe ten minutes of that, I tried to stop them, but lost the chance for an OBE. I read in a previous post that it may be in my head, but it's hard to differentiate. They don't shake as bad a few attempts later, so it's probably irrelevant now.
<br />

<br />
Finally, does it feel like you'll fall asleep. From my understanding you're aware that you're in bed, but you're essentially asleep. After I've relaxed my body, I try to imitate sleep in a conscious manner in hopes to observe my sub-c.
<br />

<br />
Any perspective is welcome. Thanks.
<br />

<br />

			well in this other post someone said their body went numb too. 
<br />

<br />
personally, it's never happened to me, but i think the numbness and the REM movement of your eyes is a sign that you are getting closer to performing an OBE.
<br />

<br />
i'd say keep up what you're doing and you'll eventually have one. best of luck

			this REM? is it where you eye LIDS start to twitch really fast? i think this just might be the vibrations, let it come ignore it, let your brain accept that it is happening, same with your hands, try to intesify the feelings see what happens.

			Actually, Mike, upon further reflection I think It may be my eyelids. They've always done it when I pass maybe fifteen minutes and have fallen deeper into mediation, so I guess I just assumed. Speaking of, upon my last OBE attemt, I feel that I was very close to falling out. I felt waves of tingles through my chest and arms, but my legs were simply gone for all I knew. I couldn't feel them at all. I've gotten all of that before, the difference here is that this is the first time that the vibes made their appearance in my vision. You know, first you have random lights, then you get flashes of images and spontaneous visions and sounds, then those images started shaking for me, but after a minute of that it must have freaked my mind out and I fell back to reality. I don't care that I didn't fall out. I felt close and I'm pleased with that. Now if that happens a dozen times in a row, that's another story...
<br />

<br />
When you step out of body, does that vibes stop, or at least slow down? I really hope so.
<br />

			I found that the sometimes the vibes are still there and sometimes they're not, but they slow down and are not really intense it may be different with other people, so im not sure.
