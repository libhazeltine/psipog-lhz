Chemical reactions cause you to feel hurt. That's why they say chemical reactions are the source of emotions; they're the ones that create them. It doesn't matter whether or not chemical reactions hurt. That doesn't change the fact that they cause you to feel hurt.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

That is the most bizarre statement I have heard in a long time. It's like the man looking for the invisible rabbit. He said, I have looked high and low and I can't find it, therefore it doesn't exist. If there are invisible rabbits, you are not going to find them anywhere. Why not? They are invisible.
<br />

<br />
That doesn't prove they do exist, it just simply points out that you can't disqualify the existence of something by looking for it in a way that won't turn it up. You don't look for the mind in the brain and try to find a location for it because the mind is not something physical <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-style: italic">by definition</span></span></span>. You can't conclude that it doesn't exist because you haven't found it after a century of looking. You don't find it that way.
<br />

<br />
But there is a deeper problem. If consciousness is just a property created by the brain, which is what you're inferring if feelings are nothing more than chemical reactions, when you make a decision who or what does the deciding? If consciousness is a mere effect of chemical reactions in the brain, then your conscious act of deciding is not a free will act of your own, it is a result of some physical process that came before it. Your choices are controlled by physical events outside of your will.
<br />

<br />
To put it more bluntly, you have no will at all. Not really. Why not? According to this view, physical states produce particular mental states, which produce particular physical states all following one after another in a determined pattern just like railroad cars following an engine.
<br />

<br />
Of course I think you know better than to accept this, but you may be intimidated by scientists in white coats telling you that you aren't really feeling love, you're just having a chemical reaction. You're not really seeing something beautiful, this is just light of various wave lengths. You're not really hearing something wonderful, it is just vibrating molecules.
<br />

<br />
Here's my final point on this issue. If the mind is reduced to the brain, pretty soon everything is lost. Feelings become chemical reactions, beautiful objects become light waves, beautiful music is reduced to vibrating molecules. Where did the music go? Where did the beauty go? Where did the feeling go? It's all gone. It ought to be obvious to us that this reduction is insane. It can't be made. It isn't valid. It's misleading.

I fully agree with you, but i wouldn't call it the down and dirty truth about how things work. I would rather say it's just how things work. Apart of that i find it more interesting to find out why things are happening.

			Maybe it's only aging, because you think that it's aging? I think some scientists said they had found out, that some gland was responsable for aging. Let's just say he was right. 
<br />

<br />
Now there is some psychosomatic element in us, right? I mean for example when you feel &quot;down&quot; or something, your body won't feel good either right? Well, bad example but i'm too tired to make up a better one.
<br />
Anyway, being in this forum and talking about psi &amp; influencing material stuff that is outside your body with your mind, it seems very ridiculous to me not being able to control your own body with your mind. 
<br />

<br />
I mean you are your body. Or at least you are more your body than you are a psiwheel. So i guess we could influence this gland that is responsable for aging. This would also explain why some people don't look like their age at all. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> I have seen 30 year old people that look like 50 and 50 year old people that look like 30. I mean them doing it subconsciously.  You could do it consciously. 
<br />

<br />
So you're immortal. At least you're able to be immortal. Anyways, i don't know if it would be so great to be forever or for long times on this planet. 
<br />
It's kind of getting too crowded here. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> But well, you could have a lot of fun being here for some hundred years or something.

I think that percentage is bullshit.  I want to know where you got that figure because I cannot fathom that it is even close to being accurate.
<br />

<br />
And as far as the body being a perfect machine, that can mean anything since the definition for &quot;perfect&quot; is variable.  Do you mean that the human body's component parts and systems work together efficiently, and that is your conception of perfect?  Then yes, I'd agree.  If you think, however, that our body is flawless, then you'd be severely mistaken.
<br />

<br />
In the context of evolution, it is very well possible that junk DNA is just that...junk.  It takes many, many generations for unused traits to phase out of our genetic makeup, so junk DNA as useless junk is certainly a reasonable conclusion.

Yeah, go ahead and tell that to all the Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimers, Cerebral Palsy, and Epilepsy sufferers.  I'm sure they'll totally agree with you.  Especially the ones who develop the disorder as a young child.  Have fun.

Maybe those diseases only represent their relation to their bodies and their states of mind? Ever thought of that? That's hard to prove but to me it makes sense. The interesting question is why people get infected by those diseases.

Yeah, a three year old child that barely has a conception of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;body&quot; and &quot;mind&quot; is thinking its way into disease.  Sturdy logic there, fellow.

I agree. The logic sucks. So let me further explain it to you in a more worked out version. 
<br />

<br />
What you are, is you, your body is you, too. So the disease is you in a way. I don't say you have to realise yourself as &quot;body&quot; and &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;. I don't say either that the disease has to be self-inflicted. Or at least not only.
<br />
Things just happen as they happen. 
<br />

<br />
Childs are formed by their surroundings more than adults. Do you agree if i say that if a child accepts ways of thinking from other people, it might come to the point where it thinks the same way or at least to a certain extent? If the three year old child is being formed by it's surroundings
<br />
in it's way of thinking, following my logic, this way of thinking could contain &quot;the disease&quot; and infect the child. I don't say that the people that form the child's thinking have to be infected by the disease, or maybe not yet. It's just about the way of thinking. 
<br />

<br />
My point is that children are more defenseless than adults in every way, but at the same time, they are stronger, too. So it is easier for them to be infected or it's easier for &quot;the disease&quot; to break out faster, but it's easier for them to be cured, too. In my childhood i had very hard diseases, and i had many, but i didn't die and now i'm as healthy as i can be. Adults would often die if they had those diseases i had.
<br />

<br />
I don't mean either that it's the own fault of adults, (or at least not only their fault) who have diseases, that they have the disease. But i believe that they could cure the disease by changing their way of thinking. But not only the way of thinking, the way of being, too. So in fact the way they're feeling too, and the way they deal with those feelings, or with the feelings from other people. 
<br />

<br />
It's kind of hard to understand this but watch people who have diseases. Watch people who have the same diseases. Sure, they're totally different persons, but there's something similar in their way of acting. There's something similar in the way they deal with their emotions. Sure, you might say it's coincidence or just in those special cases. But if you wanted you could say to everything that happens without a plausible reason that it could be coincidence. But considering coincidence, things get weird, so let's just say it's not a coincidence. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
