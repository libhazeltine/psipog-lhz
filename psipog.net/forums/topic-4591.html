			Well this morning i had my first lucid dream. so here is what happend in my previous dream i was flying. So i was flying in my dream and i saw someone so i said Hey! you can fly in dreams! then i was like oh wait i am dreaming! So i sat down because everything started spinning and i held on to something, I felt tingly. Then i tryed to teleport to school first, I did and there were all these people. First i tryed flying again and i did which was fun for awhile(During this hole dream it was like my eyes were slightly open so i could see light but i was still asleep. it was wierd) Then i tryed materialsing a knife because this dream guy was making me mad but i ended up not killing him(it felt wrong) Then i tryed doing psi balls with another dream person( They were flared) And i thruw them at the other dream people. Then i decided to wake up to see if i could remember it. And i did...it was sooooooo freaking cool.

<br />

<br />
i was about 10 when i had a strange dream that i was swimming under water but as i was dreaming i could feel my bed....but i was dreaming...i tried to get out of bed but i hit my head on something (i was on the bottom bunk of a bunk bed) and opened my eyes and the dream went away.
<br />

my 2nd lucid dream was a few months ago and i was flying around my moms neighborhood and thought i was dreaming but shrugged it off and went to school, once I thought that school was boring today i woke up.

			Alright well here was a partial lucid dream:
<br />

<br />
I was in my apartment. I was viewing myself from third person and I was supposed to be sleeping so I distinguished that I was dreaming. However I did not try to do anything I simply wanted to awake or get out of this situation of lucidity. So I proceeded to start hitting myself in the head with my fist. It didn't work because somehow the pinching and wacking were somehow contained within the dream. So I ran to my brother and mother told them I was in a dream, they dismissed it and I ran back too where I originally stood. I thought well Im stuck and I cant hit myself or use a vase and smash myself because I still felt pain in the dream. So I considered jumping off the balcony because I remember that in a dream you would awake just before you hit the ground. However I decided not too because I had a bad feeling that in this dream I would not awake before I hit the ground and the experience of that falling would be to horrible. I was hoping that the scene would change incongruently like in normal dreams, so I just had to forget this and slip out of lucidity. Which is exactly what I did because I don't remember the rest of the dream.

			This is a short description of my second Lucid Dream...
<br />

<br />
I went to sleep for roughly 5 hours, woke up, and thought 'nows the perfect time for an OBE'. So i did all of the meditation and relaxation to get into the altered state of consciousness.
<br />
The next thing i know is im running through an open forest (trees spaced widely apart), following a girl dressed in red. We come out to a small clearing, and she bends down, and starts picking mushrooms, so being the gentleman that i am, help her pick them. I never see her face while this is happening. After a while of picking mushrooms, i realise im having a Lucid Dream, think 'fuck this', so i jumped up, started fly inbetween the trees, wasnt looking where i was going, hit a tree, and woke up.
<br />

			I was in a rather dull and somewhat scary bathroom, pretty empty with just a clean lightbulp lighting it. I saw a sink on the wall, proceeded to look at the floor only to find another sink installed. It was very ..unclean if you want so and I deceided it would be best to just clean it up at this point. When looking through the hole in it I had my first moment of clarity as it basically just went down forever which seemed -very- odd. I looked back at the installed sink at the wall and realized it?s suddenly installed in the middle of the room instead of the left side. This is when I got really curious.. &quot;wait a sec.. is this a dream? let?s do a clock check.&quot; At this point I found myself in a very different room, basically just made up of concrete walls and myself staring at a common clock reading the time. I looked away, looked again - time was still the same. I thought &quot;maybe I should look away a little longer&quot; and did just that. Looked at it again - bingo - the time was completely different. At this point I deceided just to drop gravity and fly up which I did, up through to the next floor. I saw some very very blury red / orange shades and then woke up. Okay it was pretty short, but it was a lucid dream! <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  After I woke up I remembered that the clock had in fact 3 indicators instead of two but that didn?t seem to worry me whilst dreaming <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Odd stuff.

			Well, my first one was kinda boring, so I'll tell you my 2nd of 3.
<br />

<br />
I was walking around on the sidewalk and someone came up to me and said, &quot;I raped your girlfriend&quot;. Then he just flew up into a cloud, and I was like, &quot;What the hell?&quot; I realized I HAD to be lucid dreaming, it felt too real to be a regular dream. So I just lifted off the ground and through a cloud. I turned around and saw the guy from before. A Scarecrow popped out from behind him and started to fight me like Jet Li martial arts style. I don't know how, but all of a sudden I just fought back Jet Li martial arts style like the scarecrow. This lasted about 2 or 3 minutes, and I punched at his head and it popped off and a bunch of scarecrows flew out of it's body. Then the scarecrows turned to mist and went into the cloud the scarecrow and I were on, and transformed it into a dark storm cloud. All of a sudden lightening struck me and ther shock caused me to wake up.

That would seem normal compared to my 3rd lucid dream, that one's just crazy.

			ahaha, i have a good one
<br />

<br />
so, I was back at my old school's gym along with a bunch of highschool friends from my current school. somehow I had an assault rifle in my hands, so I went prone (laying down on my stomach basically). next thing I knew, I saw this kid walking towards me with a bunch of dynomite tied around him (kinda like a belt/vest). I started shooting him, only to realize that it wasn't doing anything. so, I thought to myself &quot;<span style="font-style: italic">obviously</span> he isn't playing this game (I'm not even sure what I was talking about here to be honest)&quot;. next thing I know, my clothes are off except for my shoes (I don't know how to put this any cleaner than that). so, I grab the kid and use him as a shield and hold him over my privates while I ran accross the gym to a back room (to get dressed). 
<br />

<br />
once I got back there, I saw a pair of feet walking around the corner (underneath a pile of chairs i passed coming back there). I grabbed a blanket that just happened to be there and covered myself (I dropped the kid off somewhere.. don't remember exactly). then, a really hot cheerleader came around the corner (one of my friends named katie). she walked up to me and saw my clothes just laying there right next to me and said &quot;sittin on the toaster again I see..&quot; and walked off. just then, I somehow realized it was a dream, so I told her to come back and say it again. so, she came back and said it again, except with a 'better' pose and smile. then, another girl came around the corner (also named katie... coincidence?). there's nothing really to edit out here because my dream started going away because i got excited.. blah blah blah. needless to say, my dream pretty much ended when i realized i was dreaming =/

			My first LD I remember took place in middle school. I was dreaming about being in school then i noticed a whole row of bushes were missing.
<br />

<br />
I thought right away I'm dreaming. And when I looked around it was so real and my friends wouldn't believe me. I tried to fly but was kind of nervous and fell straight backwards and did feel my head hit the ground. I moved on and picked up a lunch table and started breaking pillars and walls with it. Then I threw that really far and started throwing random people into the sky. I got bored and played mind games with people and made them all dance. I woke up sometime after that. Not sure why.

			My first lucid dream was about the matrix, probably becuase I had set my intent to lucid dream about the matrix. I was with Morpheous in the loading program with the red lion head chairs. Morpheous was going on about the &quot;real&quot; when I realized I was dreaming. I set up a dojo on the TV screen and then after I looked at it I was there. I went around (dream switched to 3rd person, I didn't mind) kicking butt matrix style for a while, then I kind of fell back into my body gradually.

			I just had my first lucid dream. What happened was I was hanging out with freinds and we started running, but i was running through sprinklers on the side of the street. I kept running through the sprinklers but I would motion them to stop with my hand, so I relized it was a dream because I could move the water by waving my hands, but I couldn't really control much. The most I could do was like jump really high, run really fast, and i could control water. Pretty much right after I did those things I woke up. It was pretty fun I just wish I could have controlled it better. I'm pretty excited considering it was my first.
