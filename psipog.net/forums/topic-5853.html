			I have documented results that psi can be used to alter seemingly random events.  The simplest example is with a single die.  You all probably already knew this, however.  What you might NOT know is that you can use online games to improve your strength in psi.  I suggest kingdom of loathing, but any game utilizing a random number generator should work, too.  You simply use what skills you have to force a specific result.  As I said, I have recorded statistical anomalies every single time I make the attempt.  My personal affect is in the 5 to 15 percent range.  My personal specialty (in kingdom of loathing) is getting particular items to drop from monsters.
<br />

<br />
The most interesting thing about this phenomena is that your brain can interpret and bring about an indirect result WITHOUT KNOWING THE INTERMEDIARY STEPS.  To use the above example, kingdom of loathing uses a random number generator to decide what items drop from monsters.  I don't know what those random numbers are, which number corresponds to what item, or how they are generated.  I don't even know where the RNG generator or computer involved is.  It could be in Arizona, Massachusetts, Australia, or way across the Atlantic in the UK.  I leave you to draw your own conclusions.

So what? It's basically SPAM in my opinion because we know already. I dont' see the addition of what he's adding on.

Yeah, Nev, you do tend to be an ass sometimes, but alot of the time, people deserve it. However, the thread starter was just posting his experiences.

			Neveza, dude, take a chill pill.  I didn't do anything to you.
<br />

<br />
I am well aware that manipulation of probability like dice is well known.  But do you really know why you can do it anyway when you have NO IDEA what you are doing, really?  If so, fine, I didn't know.  But I doubt it.  And I was assuming that the conclusion from my post was obvious to any reasoning, intelligent person.  But I guess I have to extrapolate a little, so this post doesn't seem like SPAM.
<br />

<br />
The ability to simply focus on the outcome, and have it come about is an interesting ability.  This suggests a level of self-abstraction inside your own head of a depth which is difficult to discern.  At the very least, you are automatically ascertaining what your psi needs to do, and then sending it out there to do its task.  And you don't even consciously realize it while this is happening.  With a die, you know exactly what you are trying to do.  This is a well documented use of psi.  You are trying to make a die land on a specific face.  The obvious automatic mental abstraction is that you are applying force to different sides of the die to get it to land in a certain way.  This explains how it is only a small percentile difference, as your subconscious mind cannot think spatially on its own (and may be unable to use psi to make it land a certain way all the time) and therefore just pushes in an obvious direction, such as whatever is necessary to put the desired face upright at any given time.
<br />

<br />
HOWEVER, due to my example regarding the random number generator, this model is obviously false.  If you don't know where or what the source is, you cannot influence it.  Your mind is potent, but it cannot scan the entire planet in a split second, locate a computer signal, pinpoint the exact calculation which is necessary, and tweak it to produce the desired result.  It's impossible to even get 1% accuracy, much less 5%.  So a different method is being used.  This is where things get a little hazy, and it is this point which caused me to write &quot;draw your own conclusions.&quot;  But now that I have been pressed, I'm going to give you mine, though they are a bit...  theoretical.
<br />

<br />
My theory is that you are capable of, using psi, directly altering a standing wave of probability.  The latest astrophysics theories say there are 10 dimensions, and our universe in fact ends at five.  You'll have to find out more about that on your own- that's its own, totally non sequitur, post.  Anyway, the middle-upper dimensions are a composite of multiple probability waves.  Assuming that they function like any other waves (energy) they can be modified by applying other forces.  You are all well accustomed to most of these forces, such as gravity and other physical laws, which can all be reduced to exchanges of energy.  
<br />

<br />
On to the root of the matter.  Psi is, of course, energy.  And as I said, energy is used to apply forces or make changes, and can be applied to any dimension the way YOU apply in every dimension.  Energy can be applied to the first dimension to add characteristics.  This is normally what we call programming.  Psi applied over the second dimension is a kinetic force.  Psi applied in the third dimension is an object or construction with volume and size.  Psi applied in the fourth dimension is giving it duration so it exists in an extended period.  Psi applied in the fifth dimension is more interesting.  The fifth dimension is a mix of the different branching probabilities which exist for our universe.  So applying energy to it will alter a characteristic in the fifth dimension, and can be used to, in effect, alter the future.  I won't go any further than that, as this post is already getting pretty long, and my theory gets thin past number five, as I'm still working on out there.
<br />

<br />
Basically what I am saying is that, all this time, you have been using latent forces you never knew existed, at a much greater magnitude and with more flexibility than you knew.  As a result, it should be possible to tap those energies and control those automatic psionic functions &quot;manually&quot; in order to do more, with less.  And to use that psychic strength that your mind uses, which you don't even know exists.  So, to extend that concept, when you practice and grow stronger in psi, you aren't stretching your psi like a muscle.  You are gaining control over it by taking it from under the exclusive control of your unconscious mind, so both can use it.  That way you have conscious control of it, AND you use it for natural purposes we have yet to divine.  Using this model, it is theoretically possible to teach someone to become very powerful very quickly, as they already have the power and extensive practice is not actually required.  It is just our best method right now.
<br />

<br />
And this is where I really want to start into &quot;the evolution of psi&quot; and how these mechanisms would have evolved, just like human psychology did, to keep us alive rather than to give us control.  But this is already a really long post.  I'll do that some other time.  By the way, not every point I made was obvious, but some of them were.  Like how the die alteration theory was obviously proved false by how you can do it without knowing what you are doing.  You can do it with only the outcome in mind.

			Neveza can do what he want when newbs don't realize what they're saying. I'm happy someone puts the newbs in the place they should be.. on the sidelines. 
<br />

<br />
When I approach a new forum I like I read peoples posts for months, I don't post. I observe what is helpful, what isn't. I make sure I don't post SHIT that hasn't been done before. I suggest newbs learn to post correctly.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, you post was decent. But, the random number generators on RPG's drop a certain percent of ___ item everytime. And with diff. monsteres comes diff. prizes. If you did, however, encounter a monster that only drops the given item 5% of the time, and you managed to prove that wrong then that is good. 
<br />

<br />
I suggest you practice on something more practical, then once you know you can affect rng really well, then do RPG's without an effort, with care or without.
