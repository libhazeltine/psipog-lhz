			I have been doing a lot of research, and I believe that there is a perfect analogy between physical and mental ability.  When one are born, one has no skill in either.  As a baby, one randomly kicks and babbles in an attempt to gain control over their physical abilities.  So, for a first time practicer of psionics, one would be unfocused, their power is spread out randomly, not affecting anything.  That means that focus on the task, not the ability, is key.  We all can do telekinesis, for example, but a first time user is analogous to a baby thrashing around, trying to accomplish something, but nothing is achieved.
<br />

<br />
We have something else to consider:  People who practice psioncs are not the age of babies.  For example, if you teach a kid to read as soon as he's born, it will take seven years.  If you teach a kid to read when he's seven, it will take a week.  Practicers of mental abilities don't have all the time in the word to learn, as a baby does to learn motor control.  But we also don't practice all at once.  Maybe an hour per day.  In between, what we learn in cemented in memory.
<br />

<br />
Also, there is muscle memory.  It takes time to learn to play a piano, and as you do, your &quot;muscle memory&quot; tells you what to do.  When you walk, you don't have to think about what muscles to contract and release.  So practicing mental abilities would work the same way.  Once you're good at it, you don't have to concentrate as hard.  So what does this say about how you should practice?
<br />

<br />
There is strength and control for mental and physical ability.  Having strong but unfocussed mental ability might have something to do with poltergeist activity/ the existance of 'naturals&quot; who must learn control rather than strength.  Does this mean there are naturals in control, also?  A baby born with strong muscles still has to learn control, but once they do, look out.  
<br />

<br />
One last thing:  As a baby kicking around will eventually knock a table over, maybe there is a chance to telekinetically move something at random.
<br />

<br />
So, there are my theories, tell me what you think, add on to them, help me sort out all this, or tell me how stupid I am.
<br />

One final note:  Watch Niushirra swoop down like a buzzard.

			I found this one by chance. I'm always checking modern sciences.

So your theory basically says that psi takes practice? Ok, we all knew that. Anything else?

			And when you say &quot;Practice makes perfect&quot;, do you have PouncingKavu's entire speech go through your head, explaining what the fuck is truely going on? 
<br />

<br />
No.

			His speech was an analogy like the title says. I don't see a point to it.
