			This was my first attempt. About five minutes ago. I read a few guides on how to make a Psi Ball and than i sat completely still in my chair, breathing casually and staring at my hands in my lap. Than I focused on me sitting in the grass with the sun pooling on me, i said this over and over in my head things like &quot;i feel the sun warmly soak into my skin&quot; and so on and as i did this my hands started to look hazy, but i continued (and ws sort of uncomfortable) and as i continued my peripheral vision sorta looked orange to me until i stopped and snapped my head. when i snapped my head it dissapeared and i was out of breath.

			My guess?  You probably either fell asleep or went into a light trance.

			sounds like something that happens to me cept I never lose my peripheral vision. If it <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> the same thing that's going on with me then all that's happening is your losing focus. It can usually help with meditation or whatever as long as it doesn't distract you like it usually does me.

			Well , so far i've made 3 psiballs within 2 days. My advice, don't worry about questioning what you may have accomplished, but when your hands are sucked in or pushed outwards apart from each other, in a way that feels familiar to a magnetic pull or static electricity, you are making a psiball, especially when your hands only  go inward or outward  depending on the size of the ball as you change it.

Trust me, you'll know you've done it when you have.
