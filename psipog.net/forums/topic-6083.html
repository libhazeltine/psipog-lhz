			hi all 
<br />
i did not post topic from long time because i was in other good forum <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
telekinesis is not magic like you will get it by dream or by others methode like imagination but we use imagination to help us to produce emotion and make us more determine to move the object , it is not about methode to use or like it , it is about understanding positive and negative energies , and where to put the your will , how to imagin to make yourself produce the emotion for change and make you more determine and the workable energies and so on that i still dont know ........  .
<br />

<br />
we all can make tk , we all can move our arms , hands , legs and our body , we dont need methode to move our body and that is about tk too but in tk we need only to understand what i wrote up to make tk , tk dont need methodes , it need to be understood because it is not easy skill to be mastered because you need to understand alot of ways of things to master it , tk like tree have alot of branches .
<br />

<br />
simple ex: if you want to carry small light object with your hand , you just pick it up right? so what about big heavy object can you just pick it up or put your hands on 1 side to carry it? no you here make some balance to carry it put hand to right side and put hand to left side then you carry it .  that is it you need to understand how to deal with it and that is with tk need to understand its branchs to know how to deal with it and master it.
<br />

			but if we use emotions, don't we get deppendent on them, and can't we have accidents or make stuff we don't want to, sometimes?
<br />

<br />
first of all, as you all may know, emotions kind of get &quot;exausted&quot;, like, when you get a new video game, you get all excited about it, when you hear a cool song, you feel good stuff. but with time, the emotions you feel just fade away (not 100% of the time, but i think a good portion of it). it's still somewhat cool, but you don't feel like you did before. or, at least, you need to &quot;rest&quot; from it so you feel the same again. now, if you try to &quot;force&quot; an emotion, it might be even more difficult, isn't it? so wouldn't you be able to lift a soda can, then with time just a pencil, and barely the psiwheel? you know what i mean?
<br />
so, this way you get deppendent on emotions, and if you need (want) to do something, but can't force your emotions anymore, you won't be able to do it!
<br />
now, if you associate tk to emotions, isn't it possible that if you get angry, sad, happy, excited, i don't know which emotions you guys use, stuff start to happen? like, you get utterly excited with something, your tv starts moving, and crashes on the ground? you got no tv anymore!!(ok, a bit exagerated, but you get me)
<br />
please give your thoughts about what i said ^^
<br />
thanks

			hi MikauZora.
<br />

<br />
i hope you understand me because my english is not very good <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
i think you know that emotions are signals from the brain , that mean emotions are signals felt in the body to force you to do something , as feeling hungry the brain give signal to the stomic and you feel that signal as emotion of hungry in your stomic and it is the same about love , your brain know that is the person that i feel with him peace or the one who make me laught or always be with me to help me so your brain send signal to your body and you feel it in your heart as love . so you dont do tk if you dont have the desire to do tk and it is the same about eating you dont eat if you dont have the desire to eat and that is about wight lefting you cant carry something if your determination is weaker then its heavy.
<br />

<br />
you do tk all the time but it is not strong and it is not concentrated and it is not strong because you are not determind to do it as wight lefting , if something heavy and you dont have desire to left it or desire to try hard to move it then you are not going to move it .
<br />

<br />
so you doing things with emotions and emotions have levels first levels sometimes you cant feel it and strong levels you can feel it and this levels are up to you and your sensetivety.
<br />

<br />
sometimes emotions make you do somethings that you dont want to do like when you get angry you say something that you dont want to say or hit someone and that kind of things and when you are happy you take some decisions that when you calm down and be normal then you say omg i cant do that decisions , i was too much happy and positive to take such decisions, so physical or mental emotions play its turn so it is the signals of the brain play its turn so it is better to use determination emotion in tk because it is about what you want , it is not happy or angry for not to be forced to be positive or negative , it is determination to do what you want.
<br />

<br />
ofcours always using emotions or one emotion will make it decrease by time but if you change your imagination to produce determination , you will produce the emotion of strong determination or the emotion that you want.
<br />

<br />
i think emotion and focus are very important in tk , focus is to direct your energy to the object as nothing you think of but concentrating on the object and concentrating on moving it and emotion to make tk stronger or it is like its fuel.
<br />

<br />
so if you lose part of them you will greatly effect on tk power so if you get very angry or very happy and not focused then you will not crash your tv <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
i think that is all i can say <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
