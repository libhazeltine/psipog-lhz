			Hello, poggers. Got an interesting deal that could use some decent responses.
<br />

<br />
I have a friend, natural empath, who's lately been having some problems with hypersensitivity. Which wouldn't be so odd, but lately it's been close to overload proportions and it's showing up with some physical oddities as well. 
<br />

<br />
The hypersensitivity hasn't all been empathic, some of it almost seems telepathic. He's had occasions in crowded resturaunts where he can identify exactly what every person in the place is talking about or thinking. I did a scan on him last night, and there's some very unusual feedback coming from his sub-c. The scan, which ususally comes out very clear for me, was jumbled and somewhat chaotic. It was almost as if part of his mind had taken up the tricolor and was running around yelling &quot;Viva la revolution!&quot;. I took a break and on a second scan where I was trying to strengthen some of my impressions, I got a very distinct impression of a building on fire that was about to cave in, only with blue flames instead of normal reddish-orange. We both have feelings about the meaning, but I'd rather not give them to keep you folks with an unbiased opinion. Either way, shook me up pretty bad, and was one of the strongest, most unusual readings I've ever gotten. Any ideas?
<br />

<br />
The other part of this is that the hypersensitivity started at the same point some physical abnormalitites started going on with this friend. He's having problems with sensitivity to light- in that when he goes out into bright sunlight, he can't really see anything but the light. He's taken to wearing sunglasses constantly outside. He has been to see a couple of different eye doctors, but none of them have come up with anything concrete yet, and he's being referred to a different specialist each time. He's also constantly thirsty- and I've honestly seen him down a helluva lot of water and still be complaining of being thirsty. Again, it's entirely possible the two are unrelated, or that it's a primarily physical issue, but I'm trying to look more into the psionic side to see if there's anything I can do to help. I'm going to start him off with some grounding and centering before getting him to shielding, but I'm wondering if anyone else has any better/more fitting ideas. 
<br />

<br />
Sound off! Thanks, Poggers.
<br />

<br />

			I would suggest that your friend see a general physician and/or neurologist, since you?ve pointed out all his senses are overloading.  Perhaps once his other senses come back in line, the empathy and telepathy will return to normal.  The other symptoms are troublesome as well.
<br />

<br />
If the general physician and/or neurologist aren?t seeing anything, or if a different opinion is desired, I?d personally visit someone from the oriental medicine tradition.  That is entirely biased, as I study that area.  They can treat folks for symptoms as well as disease, with or without a complete Western Medicine diagnosis.
<br />

<br />
However, I reiterate that he should see a general physician and/or neurologist first.  Western Medicine is amazing for emergency situations, and this sounds pretty? unusual.
<br />

<br />
Good luck to your friend,
<br />

			See a doctor. ;-P
<br />

<br />
It is pretty curious though.  How long has he been like this?  Did he do anything that could have sparked this?  Like did someone punch him in the head..?  I can't really give out medical advice.
<br />

<br />
As far as the scan... you are probably more qualified to interpret it than I can, since you know the surrounding circumstances better, and actually performed the scan.  A burning building doesn't sound like something good is going on though <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

			empathy and lucid dreaming have come natural to me, and now that you bring this up, i have been annoyed by lights, mainly car lights at night, the sun too at high noon...
<br />
edit::and i dont mean, yeesh its bright, actually to the point where i have to close my eyes::
<br />
and i do down more than 2 liters of water a day...
<br />

<br />
interesting that you bring this up, before i found psipog i created a natural sheild of apathy, not the best thing for being a constructive citizen, but then again i never really wanted to be one XD
