			Let's confine this to the part of intelligence that can be measured in IQ.
<br />

<br />
I think that psions in general have higher intelligence than other people, seeing as a big part of the definition is ability to adapt to new stuff, understand stuff quicker. I'm not saying only smart people can do psionics, but I think most psions are pretty smart.
<br />

<br />
What do you think?

			Same as somefatguy, but if you talk to actual psions, they tend to speak with more refined english (or whatever language they speak) and present themselves as intelligent.  Now, I don't know if some psi's are &quot;faking&quot; their intelligence, or are actually intelligent, but they do tend to present themselves as intelligent, which is a start.

			This is a tough question...most people tend to like it because of the power. The fewer seems to have a higher intellegence that only want to experience it. I don't want to say &quot;no&quot; because there is a few who spark that speical light bulb in there heads. In all I guess I'm 90% no, and 10% yes. Then again that speical influence will stay with them forever.
<br />

<br />
Older and wiser that I gotten over the years (only 20 years old but I like the drama) I still think and feel myself as a small child of that of 8. But there are them times that I think above myself over others. But of cource I'm ashame of myself afterwards.

			If you were to take a sample of psions and a sample of norms (A big sample mind you.  Bigger the sample the more accurate the ratio) I bet the ratio of intelligent people to less intelligent people would be nearly the same between psions and norms.
<br />

<br />
What excactly sets us apart from norms?  In my opinion it's mainly the interest in this stuff.  That hardly makes us more intelligent just because we seek the unkown.
<br />

<br />
If we're talking about the psions that have had a bit of success (Past psiwheel or past psiball etc.) then they probably are more intelligent.  To get that far takes a lot of patience and concentration.
<br />

<br />
Again, it really depends on what you call a psion.

			I think that it takes an intelligent person to navigate around the internet, stear clear of fluff, discover Psipog, read some articles, connect with them, get involved in the community and post intelligently.

EDIT: Oh and it also takes intelligence to perservere though the tough times and actually get results in psionics (or a complete idiot).

Your one point over me. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

Anywho, I think their is no difference in intelligence between Psion's and Humans.  Like humans, psion's can be either dumb or smart.  I think why you'd think psion's are smarter then humans through adapting and/or understanding stuff quicker is because I think psion's think both in and outside the box to find out a different solution that could be the truth, whereas humans always do it through the scientific method, which is mostly thinking inside the box.  Sorry for that sentence being a run-on.

Edit: Also, because every human has the capacity to do psionics, anyone can be considered a psion, really. There are a lot of idiots in the world, and I'm sure many of those idiots try or have tried to do psionics. Being a psion doesn't make you intelligent or better.
