			Premonitions and Deja Vu?
<br />

<br />
So what causes the phenomenon? I'm really grasping at straws here but these are some of the best theories that I have on the subject that actually make sense.
<br />

<br />
Okay, so energy is sent to us and it causes a stimulus which gives us a reaction based on its level but why does it seem like we have knowledge before we do? Well first I would like to make clear that we receive these energies (receiving knowledge) from EVERYWHERE. Meaning they can occur from anywhere and affect any place at any time. Think about it, how are new concepts developed in the first place? The signal to create the knowledge had to come from somewhere right?
<br />

<br />
That being said, my first theory is universal knowledge. Okay for example, I'll use the place I work: I'm at Subway and Lady A wants a sub and I ask what type. For some unknown reason, I receive a frequency of energy that translates into an emotion which gives me the &quot;feeling&quot; that she's going to order a BMT. So she does. Now where did this feeling come from? (And don't you DARE say &quot;Lucky Guess.&quot;) A. The Universe. Somewhere in the universe, energy sends you that signal. B. The woman. She could have known what she wanted the moment she walked in and the energy from her thinking of that sub got so strong that she sent out a signal which I picked up on. C. The rate of traveling energy and time or interpretation is not in sync.
<br />

<br />
Traveling rates:
<br />

<br />
Okay, now bear with me please because this part I can't keep straight with myself to save my life so it's going to be very sloppy and hard to make out. ::takes deep breath:: 
<br />

<br />
ok..now...
<br />

<br />
Energy travels all around to receptors. When we receive, 2 things happen: The initial emotion occurs followed by the higher translation, (moving up the levels of energy stimuli.) In most cases, the initial ping (reaction or emotional signal from that stimulus), and the higher translation occur one after the other so fast, they're practically synonymous. Trouble occurs when they're more spaced out, making them out of sync.
<br />

<br />
Premonition vs. Deja Vu
<br />

<br />
Premonitions:
<br />

<br />
This can be a result of any of the above theories. We simply receive a stimulus from one place almost directly before we receive that same stimulus from a different place. Or the initial ping and higher translation are out of sync. When this happens, we mostly recognize the initial ping, giving us time to already be familiar with the higher translation based off of other similar higher translations. (Example: Well I felt like this when it was raining so it must be raining) 
<br />

<br />
Deja Vu
<br />

<br />
Again, any of the above theories, but what makes this different? The traveling rates are out of sync but however, your brain translates the signals and automatically sends out a mach of those same frequencies of energy and the brain retranslates it, giving us the impression that whatever is happening has already happened before.

			Well, before I comment...Don't call it a theory. You don't have any scientific evidence to call it a theory.
<br />

<br />
Now, to the comment, It's an okay idea, but I still have problems of that fact you only mention how we're affected by it and not the real source of this energy or what this energy is. (unless I missed it)
<br />

<br />
Premonitions and Deja Vu', I doubt psionics has any part in this. Ever hear that lesser mind beings will dream of hunting or a survival situation in order to be prepared for the future of living? I think that's basically what our minds do, but at a higher level. We take in information, then our minds form it to recreate a possible event. However, because of our minds and enviroments, we would dream of non-surviving situated dreams, or possibly non-sensual ones. Some could be just a social standards, since we do socialise as humans are social creatures.
<br />

<br />
I'm not commenting on the spiritual ones, as I dont' follow such ideas.

			Yeah, no. I believe there is some connection between all forms of psionics including psychokinses. Until you can cannot them I think your hypothesis is crap. We can all feel the connection but no one can spell it out.

Until you can cannot them? I'm assuming you mean CONNECT. And I can connect them. It's just a lot to type out. No one can spell it out... how can you be so sure?
<br />

<br />
As far as theories go, I have evidence but not proof. You don't need proof for a theory. And yes they are theories so I will continue to call them that. Of course I don't expect the posters here who only know tiny fractions of the whole picture to show anything BUT blatent ignorance and arrogance.

			Yeah it's true, if you prove a theory it's not a theory... It's a fact, lol.
<br />

<br />
As long as he has evidence it's fine and since it's a theory he doesn't expect everyone to believe it. Better just to discuss it rather than disprove it.
