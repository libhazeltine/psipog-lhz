EXCERPT 1: The most common explorations of PK potentials include levitation, influencing the throwing of dice, controlling random generators, spoon or metal bending, producing visual images on a photograph, the raising or lowering of temperature, splitting or dissolving clouds in the sky, and of course, the outright movement of an object. Sometimes even miraculous healings, illuminosities and the appearance of apports are credited to someone?s psychokinetic ability. Some even believe that curses and weather control can be manifested with PK.
<br />

<br />
As you explore psychokinesis in depth, it becomes difficult to deny the existence of a very real mental ability. Today, even scientists claim psychokinetic power is a proven phenomenon.
<br />

<br />
But let?s begin with the basics. The components of our physical universe are atoms, which in turn are made up of electrons, protons and neutrons. Everything in the universe is made up of this matter and energy. Matter is potential energy ... and PK is thought by my some scientists to be the ability to affect the energy surrounding matter to generate the desired result. So instead of moving an object with your mind, you?re harnessing the surrounding energy to move the object.
<br />

<br />
The term psychokinesis is of Greek origin, meaning ?motion produced by the mind.? And if you care to label some Biblical manifestations as PK, occurrences of the phenomena have been documented for a very long time. Even the shackles of Paul and Silas falling away might have been due to a psychokinetic influence.
<br />

<br />
In the 1800s, PK was elaborately investigated in both England and America, primarily in association with Spiritualist activities. The ability of mediums to levitate, move furniture, and produce floating heads and hands was investigated by the British Society for Psychical Research and its American counterpart -- the ASPR. And although some fraud was discovered, most of the cases were labeled authentic. 
<br />

<br />
Duke University Professor J.B. Rhine began conducting his famous PK experiments in 1934. Rhine did establish that people could psychokinetically influence the throwing of dice, and went on to learn that in any one session, the longer a subject worked at it, the lower the control factor. So fatigue or maybe boredom were valid factors in the ability to demonstrate PK, just as it often is in other PSI areas. PSI, P-S-I  being the undefined force resulting in psychic phenomena. Dr. Rhine first coined PSI to mean ESP-- extra sensory perception, and then later to mean PK and ESP, which he described as ?a general term to identify a person?s extrasensorimotor communications with the environment.?
<br />

<br />
Dr. Rhine reported that PK did not appear to connect with any physical process of the brain, nor was it subject to the basic laws of physics. He concluded that it was a nonphysical force of the mind and like extra-sensory perception, it was independent of space and time. 
<br />

<br />
 
<br />

<br />
EXCERPT 2: A friend had given me a decahedron -- a globe made of light-weight sticks forming ten triangles. I hung it in my living room from the cathedral ceiling, directly above the couch. This ball of sticks appeared to be floating about eight feet in the air. Then, with all the doors and windows closed to avoid any drafts, I?d lie beneath the decahedron, relax my body, count myself down into an altered state of consciousness. Next, I?d just barely open my eyes and command the globe to turn either clockwise or counter-clockwise -- always varying the way I willed it to turn. Because it weighed so little and was hanging freely, the globe could easily respond to mental energy. And it worked. It took practice, and the more I practiced, the better it worked. But I definitely moved matter with my mind. 
<br />

<br />
As another example of psychokinetic projection, I was once having lunch at Gladstone?s restaurant in Malibu with Dr. Patrick Flanagan, the man who introduced the world to ?pyramid power.? We were discussing PK, and to make a point, Patrick placed a drinking straw across the top of a water glass on the table. He then mentally commanded the straw to move ... and it did.
<br />

<br />
As an interesting aside, our waitress came to take our food order just as Patrick was demonstrating mind over matter. The shocked woman looked at the moving straw, then at Patrick ... whereupon she ran away and refused to return to our table.
<br />

<br />
Metal bending is another demonstration of psychokinesis. I?d heard about how Uri Geller bent keys and silverware even over the radio in England in the early 1970s. But my first personal experience with this phenomena took place several years later in a workshop with Jack Houck. I?d invited Jack to conduct a spoon-bending party at one of my annual Super Seminars in Scottsdale, Arizona. 
<br />

<br />
In the workshop, for over an hour, Jack talked about the physics of PK. His voice was monotone and I realized that without ever conducting a hypnotic induction, he was putting the audience into trance. As I always tell the attendees at my Professional Hypnosis Training, the real secret to being a good hypnotist is to talk ?boring.? Talk like you?re bored to death and you?ll put everyone to sleep. 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, once his audience was in an altered state, he had everyone pick up a spoon and send ?bending? energy into the silverware. Soon we were all shouting ?bend, bend, bend? at our spoons. And to my surprise, my spoon just curled over as if it had melted. I looked over at my wife Tara, and she too was looking wide-eyed at her melted spoon. All over the room the same thing was happening. In the end, almost all the workshop participants did it. And believe me, they did not forcefully bend the spoons to attain the results. 
<br />

<br />
After that, Tara and I often included spoon-bending hypnosis sessions during the evening sessions in some of our Psychic Seminars. By directing hypnotized subjects to mentally bend the spoons I greatly shortened the time it took to produce the phenomenon. And again, almost everyone could successfully bend metal with the power of their mind. The only downside, was some of the hotels didn?t want us to come back for future seminars, because our participants ended up mentally bending so much of their restaurant silverware.  
<br />

<br />
EXCERPT 3: (These words follow one of the two altered-state sessions in the course.) Welcome back. You just experienced an altered state of consciousness mind-programming session. Use the session daily to help you rapidly develop your psychokinetic abilities. 
<br />

<br />
And to alter consciousness on your own, use the ?Mudra? technique I programmed. Touch the tip of your index fingers to the tips of your thumbs, close your eyes and begin to breathe deeply as I previous described. Then, imagine your body relaxing one part at a time. Actually tell each part of your body to relax. Imagine the light coming down from above and moving though your chakra centers and then count yourself down just as I did in the mind-programming session. You?ll be in an altered-state and you can now use the ?psychokinesis? trigger word to focus your energy and begin to conduct your PK explorations. Once you?ve attained your natural altered-state level, you should be able to just barely open your eyes and soft focus your gaze, without awakening.
<br />

<br />
Don?t move around much, or allow other interruptions or distractions, because you don?t want to be drawn up out of the altered state. When you?ve completed your explorations, count yourself up from one to five and say the words, ?wide awake, wide awake.? 
<br />

<br />
The more you practice, the better you?ll get. It will take you a couple weeks of daily altered-state explorations to reach your natural level. At this time, the suggestions will become much more powerful. And you?ll need to do an altered-state session, on your own or using one of my pre-recorded sessions, at least three times a week to maintain your altered-state abilities at a peak level.
<br />

<br />
Each time you use the Mudra technique it will become more powerful and in time, you?ll find that you won?t need to go through all the body relaxation and count down to induce an altered state. All you?ll need to do is invoke the Mudra, close your eyes and breath deeply for a few moments to attain your level. 
<br />

<br />
All right, it?s time to prepare for another session. This time I?ll induce the altered state just as I did before, but then you?ll open your eyes, focus your energy and mentally send commands to affect an inanimate and remote object. Now you?ll have to set up the exploration. You might hang a very light ball from the ceiling as I described, then when you open your eyes, you command the ball to turn either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Or maybe you lay a straw across the top of a drinking glass. Then you go into the altered state sitting up in front of the objects. When you open your eyes, you focus your energy upon moving the straw. Or, you might set up a house of cards and mentally attempt to bring it down. Another idea, place a thermometer before you and attempt to change the temperature. And of course, you can hold a spoon and mentally tell it to bend, bend, bend. 
<br />

<br />
There?s no limit to the kinds of explorations you can attempt. You may want to explore several different potentials, a new one each time you do this session. But eventually you?ll find a particular experiment you?ll want to stick with and really work to develop. Now whatever you do, start off small and be content with small results as you develop your ability. 
<br />

<br />
So go ahead and turn off the player. Set up your experiment and then do your deep breathing. When you?re ready to proceed, turn on track 5.
<br />

			Hello,
<br />
   Does it work? I'm really busy and if it's not worth my time, I won't bother.
<br />
   Also, is anyone aware of any subliminal/supraliminal programming besides that of psychokinesis? I've never undergone hypnosis or &quot;altered state of consciousness&quot; or subjected myself to subconscious programming before ... I'm very weary of that stuff :-/
<br />
   God bless,
<br />

			Well, just a follow up i did take the day off school and tried it, i burned it to a CD and worked threw it 8 times in my room since this morning and plan on doing it another 2 after this and i can say ive had some surprising results, it has definatly improved my abilities. i was able to move stuff that would take me forever under normal circumstances with realitive ease well in the altered state. i do suggest all SERIOUS TK users try this and use it daily, if you are not serious you may find it hard to work threw because it can be very very borning and bland.

			If anyone is interested, there is another great series of hypnosis recordings for paranormal stuff (including the standard body-part-improvement things, but there is also some great stuff) available at Deep Trance Now. They have levitation, PK, invisibility and much else. Worth a look.

			wooooow!!! just got finished with four sessions of this and i have to say. Wow. Though, towards the actual use of PK nothing more exciting than i have been doing has happened but not to worry. This is deffenatly being intergrated into my practice routine. (lol or lack there of) I was very happy with this find. Now im off to give my first try at lucid dreaming.

It sucked but I'll give it a chance, so i will seriously listen to it daily for a week or so, though I hope i will not fall asleep when listening. That guy has a BORING voice...
