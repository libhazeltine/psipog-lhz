			Anyone have high skill with giving suggestions I have read stories about people that use suggestions to make people turn around and walk backwards randomly... 
<br />

<br />
My suggestions are ALOT more subtle and I mostly use them to control people <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" />(is that combat... please tell me and I'll take it out immeditly) and steer people toward certain ways...(I think it may be a little uncontrolable sometimes I will be pointing out &quot;paths&quot; one can choose in something and I will be noting pros and cons and I'll be on the first thing and they choose it before I even list everything... maybe they are just stupid..)

			Thats what I thought,. The psipog articles however not only explain suggestions, but halucinations and crap. Also it talks about destroying mental files. If psipog is so set against combat then how come thier telepathy articles give alot of info on driving people crazy?

2. where in any of the psipog articles does it say that?

			Peebrain explained the existence of the hacking section.  He said it was there to make people aware that this kind of thing can be done.  Personally though, I think just defining what it is should be enough but actually describing how to do it is a bit too much of a risk. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Yeah, I know like evil people could read it and print it out and practice with it... and then go around putting people into their own hells..... kinda evil, but then again you make someone think their a bunny, or a kittie.... still might cause mental tramua though <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> .....

			Woodpecker is right printing it is a risk.  But it would also be a risk to not inform people that it can be done, so they can know how to protect themselfs against it.

There's a difference between saying, &quot;People can hack into your mind and destroy your memories&quot; and, &quot;People can hack into your mind and destroy your memories.  Here's how to do it.&quot;  I'm not against warning people against it but the manual in question clearly tells you how to achieve it, which to me is as dangerous as saying, &quot;People can shoot you with guns.  Here's the address to get an AK-47 without a license.&quot;  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Like I said, Woodpecker, I wrote the manual before there was a ban on combat. I think it's not true that the whole thing should be scrapped. Adam lost his copyright on it formally when he surrendered it to me some years ago, but altering it to remove sections, though considered fair use, is something that would need to be discussed with Rainsong and I seeing as we still own the document.
<br />

<br />
I'm very, very anti-suggestion, as telepathic suggestion is something I'm horribly vulnerable to and something that has had a major effect on my life - but be assured I'm going to discuss it in my book on the subject.

			Yeah if anything, put warnings because it's not a &quot;This can happen&quot; it's a how to do it... Nothing wrong with giving information.... but AT least some warnings would be nice
