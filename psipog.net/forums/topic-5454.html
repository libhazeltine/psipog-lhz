			On the nights that I can remember my dreams, they feel pretty real but I feel as though I'm just watching, like I have no control. Since I'm feeling them, are they lucid dreams? Or do I need to have control over the dream for it to be considered a lucid dream?

			Well, you don't HAVE to be in control, as long as you know that you're in a dream, then you're lucid.

			It depends, I would think, on the circumstances when you perceive your awareness.
<br />

<br />
Do you wake up, recall your dream, and then think that you were concious during the dream because you remember parts of it? It's pretty easy to fool yourself once you're awake into thinking you were completely aware. You start to make things up without realising it.
<br />

<br />
It's also common for dreams to feel very real but not be lucid. You know what's going on, you feel your heartbeat quicken, you smell some pie on a window sill.. but unless you reach some point during the dream where you fully realise &quot;Dude, I'm totally dreaming this!&quot; it's most likely a dream where you just go along for the ride.
<br />

<br />
Some people will say you need to be able to control your dream for it to be lucid *ahem, oneta*. In most cases, I agree. Personal experience has taught me of special exceptions to the rule.

			I realize that I'm dreaming, most of the time, but it's like I'm watching it. I can't do anything to interfere. The dream just happens but I know it's a dream the whole way through.
<br />

<br />
Like the other night, I had a pretty plain dream that I could jump 6 feet in the air. I remember when I realized that it was a dream, too. It was after the first jump, at the peak of it I realized ''I'm not really doing this.'' but I just kept jumping for a while down the street.
