Does anyone know the Quantum or Quantom (not sure how to spell it) thoery? I think (and if that is not the name of it then this has a different name but is a real acceptable theory). The thoery or proof (not sure if this has been proven yet) that the reason we can not reach absolute zero is because atoms are belived to be made up of something smaller, Quantums (lol not sure if this is the real name but I know that they are made of something). Basically when there is motion there is heat. The thoery is that these &quot;Quantums&quot; are always moving in AND OUT of the atom and that they pop up in random places of the universe every second, if you will (it's probly shorter than that). Basically in a different term, they teleport or move possibly between dimensions (because I cant see any other way) and eventually end back into ours (possibly the forth since that is belived to be time). Then another Quatum replaces the other one eventually. This , if teleportation is real for people, may be an answer to how it works. AND maybe the reason we feel all of those vibrations is because we have controlled every atom or quantum to start vibrating to the point where they are all syncronized (I can't spell very well) and we are able to escape from are bodies. Im not sure if what I said about the thoery is completely correct but it is really close. And I think all religions belive we have a spirit except Athiesm so I'm going to make an opionized statement. If we have spirits and have a mind capable of so many possibilites such as telekinesis, which would actually seem more unbeleiveable than this, then why can't we control the spirit, or soul, or astral body, or whatever kind of body you want to call it that can be different for some people? After all it is in a sense our core. Are true being. Telekinesis seems more fake than this because telekinesis is not a natural part of us that everyone is born with but it is still real if we practice it. Anyways if I have offended anyone in any way then I am sorry and I did not mean to. This is just all one big thoery and has not been proven yet. I am just &quot;putting two and two together.&quot;
<br />
And another thing if we are still controled by our brain when we have an OBE then how do people die and go to heaven? Eventually the brain rots but the spirit is still there.
