			I'm a beginner with RVing, so this may not be very accurate.
<br />

<br />
I see the phone being grey, next to something black, in a box-like container (looked kinda like it was made of wood), and it's at the side of the container.

			ok this might be a little hard to explain... hmm...
<br />

<br />
Ok if you take a rake and get another one. Put them back to back with the sides matching each other. You should see like a cruvy, X shape. I'm only talking about the shape you can see from just that end not the shape the whole 2 rakes make together. Just the one end that touches the ground.
<br />

<br />
See what I'm saying? It could be near something that makes a curvy X shape maybe not actually a rake though I just used the rake to describe the shape. Anyways I have no clue what it is. It looked like it could have been metal though. Good luck <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
*edit* I'll try again later if that doesn't help
<br />

<br />
Oh ya. And the shape looked like it had some prongs too like the end of the rake.
<br />

<br />
*edit2*
<br />
I also saw something like a bed sheet or a blanket but not really a bed. Maybe some laundry.

<br />

<br />

			Ah a garage that makes sense. Haha that problem with RVing is that you have no clue what it has to do with anything sometimes but ther person your helping knows exactly what it means. 
<br />

<br />
It's great but kinda sux at the same time but definately awesome.
<br />

<br />
I'll RV again soon I just wanna give my mind a break for now because I've done a few other things <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Glad to have helped so far <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			yes i know what you mean, personally when i would play this with my friends..RV. we would give out like specific parts of locations. and then even go as far as decipher what room its in.
<br />

<br />
it makes sense that it would be in the garage being that, <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> everything spoken or written about here points me to garage...problem is, i have an attic as well, could narrow it down since garage and attic are the, roooms of storage, tons of boxes.
<br />

<br />
only one area holds that X type mark, atleast 12 boxes to look through, those are books i believe, and another 15 that are cloths, i got 8 down and 7 more to go, of cloth boxes.
<br />

<br />
I get a picture of this old bed sheet, possibly like wrapped in it, is the phone,but the bed sheet, it has a weird like faded look, could that be a little interference or could that mean, it has been moved or the blanket given away??
