			First of all - hello to everyone. This is my very first post in this forum.
<br />
A few days ago I got very intersted in PK (already forgot why) and I googled &quot;moving objects with your mind&quot; so eventually I stumbled upon this site. I have to say this forum is quite the deal. Lots of information and obviously lots of serious and dedicated PK's.
<br />

<br />
Anyway long story short. The so-called psy wheel intrigued me so I decided to give it a shot. Now what puzzles me is that I saw many threads in which people complain about not being able to turn the wheel at all even though they were practicing for days/weeks. Last night it took me less than an hour to make it spin and I even recorded it. So my question is : what am I doing wrong? Apparently its not possible for someone to make it the very first time. Maybe the improvised platform is too high or the wheel is too big? Check out the video and let me know please.
<br />

			nice thats your first time? well done umm i dont understand what your asking. you moved the wheel didnt you? theres no wrong way to do it if thats what your asking, if your asking why didnt it take as long. well that depends on the person some people are naturals they are born with the abillity and unlock it quite easily which seems to be what you have done. some people can take years to move it. but i think for most people it takes about 1 week - a couple of months.

			Thank you for the kind replies. Still... I am not certain if this is my &quot;inner power&quot; or just the laws of physics. It just felt too...simple to be PK.
<br />
You probably don't like scepticism of the sort so I'll just keep practicing for the time being. Maybe If I can move it when its covered...

			if your not sure if its you or not try spining the psi-wheel under a glass container or try rolling a tooth pick.

PK IS that simple and we welcome skeptics here they even have thier own section  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> keep up the good work.

			We don't mind skeptisim, but we don't like skeptists who think everything that leaves their pie hole is fact. Skeptists who try stuff out and experiment instead of dismissing everything are healthy skeptists. Anway, I've gone off topic...
<br />
Defintely keep praticing, and it may feel simple, but that may be just because your mind finds it easy to do. Everyone is different and the feelings do vary. Some people feel a tension in their forehead, others get headaches. I, myself put a mental strain on the object. And if you think about it, it is physics. I think it was Newton that said that an object will not move from it's stationary state unless a force is applied to it. That statement does not say what kind of force, so, in theory, the thing that makes pk could be considered a force. A video of a covered psiwheel would be great. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  A good source of inspiration to noobs and skeptists. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Heh, have to say that it's refreshing to have someone who finds it too simple rather than overly complex.
<br />

<br />
Now I can't watch the video as I'm at work but my first suggestion in to put a glass over it. If you've had no problem spinning the wheel without it and you really want that hard affirmation, cover the wheel and spin it that way. It's much harder because our minds tell us that we can't do it. I'm personally working through that myself right now.
<br />

<br />
After that get into moving larger objects - rounded pancils, cell phones, etc. There are some great videos in the media section too.

			psi is different for everyone, in every aspect.  for some people, it may take months to spin the wheel.  others in weeks, others in days, and still others in hours.  it differs from person to person.  respectivly, it may be very well possible that it takes you weeks to create a psi-ball when most people it only takes minutes (i hope lol) or even days.  psi and all of the abilities differ from person to person.  for me, it took me hours to affect the wheel (shake it) but about a week to actually spin it 360 degrees.  i hope this answers your question.

BTW, congrats on your accomplishment, keep at it!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
