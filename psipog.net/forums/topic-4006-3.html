			One of the basic points of Shotokan karate-do is <span style="font-style: italic">kimete</span> (focus). The concept is to lock the heel, back leg, hips, arm, fist at the same time as striking (a punch), in order to deliver the maximum power. Instead of just hitting someone with your hand (which is really, rather in-effectual, and  I don't care how strong you are), you strike with your whole body.
<br />

<br />
Layered on top of this is the idea of kimete, focusing your bodies energy to strike through the opponent (performed by an instant tighten-relax of your muscles upon impact). Performed with <span style="font-style: italic"><a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hs=jZ6&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=define%3A+kiai&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" target="_blank" class="postlink">kiai</a></span> ('spirit shout'), a proper attack (be it punch or kick) can be incredibly powerful. Considering that it's all energy (psi, ki, chi blah, call it laundry for all I care), there is an element of it in Karate-do.

   How does psi do that? You're just focusing on more things. You're only going to hurt yourself by trying to do psionics while fighting. Also... there are no moves in Capoeira where you're really supposed to look away from who your wirth for more than an instance. And you only pull those off when you know you have time. The same applies to every martial art as far as I can tell.

   Yeah... putting your body weight into hits is used in... everything.
<br />

<br />
   Hitting through something? Yeah, that's also used in everything... you don't need &quot;psi&quot; or &quot;ki&quot; for that. It's just the proper way to hit. Nothing special about that. No &quot;psi&quot; or &quot;ki&quot; required.
<br />

<br />
   heh, did you know that kiais are used a lot less now because they didn't do as much good as they did bad? Too many broken jaws ans all of that. You have to be wary of doing a kiai if it looks like your jaw is about to get smashed in.

			TY for the book info. And chuck i am guessing you belive in KI as you probably wouldn't be here otherwise (unless to argue) but if you belive in ki (sorry psi just sounds so rubbish) you have no reason to not belive in aura as it is also more beiliveable and has science behind it. Although i admit there are people who disagree.

   I don't believe in ki. I don't believe in auras. Psi has a lot of science behind it. My reason for not believing in auras? Never seen one, never felt one, lack of evidence, etc

   It depends on who you ask. Some people think ki is just breathe, others think that it is a vital life force, some people believe that it's some healing/destructive force that people can use, etc. The list is huge.
