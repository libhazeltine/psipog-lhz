			Hi,
<br />
  Just wanted to ad my $0.02 as I am very interested in this topic. I think about this stuff when I am bored. But I seem to hit a brick wall. There is a thing called The Twin Paradox concerning travle at the speed of light
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox</a>
<br />

<br />
 Basically, one of the twins goes on a journey away from earth at speed of light. When he comes back, he will be younger than his twin brother  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />  . Anyone who unlocks this secret becomes god IMO. Just look at Buddha. Maybe, he figured out all this stuff. And now hes got a religion!! But I am just not ready to do what he did to find it. 
<br />

<br />
  It would be difficult to create a time portal with Psi as we don't know how it works, so we wont be able to program it. OTOH, it COULD be possible to make a portal to another physical location. (teleportation?)
<br />

			eh....woot does the twin paradox theory (edit of explaination of twin paradox:
<br />
1) this is enstien's theory, he does not believe that anything can travel at the speed of light, only light itself
<br />
2)so that means the twin travels at NEAR the speed of light
<br />
3) ....great, u want to travel at the speed of light to slow time? all the while using a psiball???)
<br />
 got to do with time travel?

<br />
Anyways, I don't think that you can travel to a future time. The reason is because its the FUTURE, and time hasn't been made for it yet. So therefore, there is nothing for you to travel foward into.

			well in theory (part of one of mine actually) everything is happening at this second. I'm not really sure how to say this
<br />
.ummm..oh boy this is hard to figure out how to explain it.
<br />
we are jsut travelilng a road.(time) in wich it has already been paved. we're jsut following it. (I'm not talking about pre-destination I firmly believe we have our own choices. if you don't understand I'm going to post my theories,as soon as I figure out where, and maybe then you'll understand.

			My theories on time is that the future isnt in progress. So we can not travel forward because there isnt anything to travel forward to. Though the past has existed it doesnt stay in progression unless counting when it becomes present. So in essence its only posible if you are jumping into another deminsion thats timeline has progressed more then ours. If alternate deminsions do exist at all. 
<br />

<br />
      Though if it is where the past present and future are all runing at the same time (I cant grasp my mind on the fact that every moment from the past the moment happening now and every moment that will happen in the future is all ocuring at once). I dint believe that a simple machine will be able to do it. I think if it is posible to move from one moment to another psi or the combination of psi and technology will be the only applicable way to achieve time travel. Doing this may involve something like phasing where you use Micro-PK to bring your atoms to a difrent plane of this dimension then also precog to see where your target destination is then something else either i dont know about or that hasent ben tried yet or perhaps this is where the machine comes in... But this last element either psionic or mechanical would move you then from set realm/plane and back to existense but at the time your previous precognition set.
<br />

<br />
     Worm holes... according to scientists dont skip through time but from destination A to B... Though I dont like to be on the same side of scientists... they usualy are to definatative.
<br />

<br />
     If you went back to stop yourself from breaking something it would be broken eliminationg your need to go back... So sincve you didnt go back you would have still broken the item thus causing you to go back sooooo this is where i think you would alter deminsions... but i can figure weather you would be creating new ones or destroying/altering this one or even more then one. Figure that out and maybe you wont have the conundrome of going throught the l;oop of the item being broken and then you going back just for it to start again...
<br />

<br />
     To the original post of this thread... A psiball that opens a portal wich you could walk through and be somewhere else in time to me is imposible for a few reasons... Well not imposible, but very close to it. Many people at psipog say you cant have a construct that does things you cant, though even this i dont believe. Another reason it may not be possible is you would have to in some small aspect know how to connect the times. Also you need to know how to make a construct that would alow you to go from one place to another. So in essence you need a portal that teleports you and one that connects this time and the next. Some may say it also wouldnt work because of the energy it would take. But who knows it may nopt take much energy... or if it does you dont have to use your own. Also it could unlock energy of its iown in the prosces. Or it could be something naturaly very close and ready to happen just waiting for some small triger to start something we could never understand. 
<br />

<br />
Amazing if you made it... Thats my thoughts.

			you probobly said this I just skimmed over that post but my main theory is that if you succede in time travel then you are splitting your timeline into two and you're going to the alternate one. and when you try to go back in time to where you started then you split it again and you never end back up where you started you only end up in a replica. Another theory is that for every possible outcome there is an alternate demension so there are virtually infinate amounts of alternate universes. and adding on to what you said about having no need to go back and fix it I believe that you will go back and fix it which will cause no need to go back and fix it wich will mean you break it the next time wich means you will go back and fix it ect. and your descisions will be like in a mobius.(a mobius is a time where time repeats it's self over and over and over and over non stop)

			Tag, you're trying to say the same thing I said, that the future, past, and present are all the same thing, happening at the same &quot;time&quot;.
<br />

<br />
You've only got to change your perspective to time travel, but bringing your body with would be the hard part.
<br />

<br />
When you have a premonition (a real one) your mind is just changing perspective. Your body, of course, doesn't follow because it is a part of the perspective you're looking at, not the actual observer of it.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Anyway, I'd just like to cover the paradox thing really quick.
<br />

<br />
First off, you'd need to actually physically take a piece of a certain perspective of time, and put it in another piece.
<br />

<br />
This alone, I don't feel can be done with technology...
<br />

<br />
Anyway, say you DO get your body into a different perspective... say, &quot;the past&quot;, and you decide to kill yourself.
<br />

<br />
Alright, you're dead, so you couldn't come back in time to kill yourself in the first place, right?? Wrong. Because, if you DID go back in time and kill yourself, that would mean that even BEFORE you did it, you wouldn't exist to do it.
<br />

<br />
===============================================
<br />
The truth is, what you really did was clone yourself and kill the clone. You go back in time. Now two of you are existing simultaniously in the same time period. So, you kill yourself. You now exist in the past, and the &quot;you&quot; that you killed does not exist. But you still exist in the past and can travel back to the future and continue existing, because you existed in the past when you were killed.
<br />
===============================================
<br />

<br />
This is because time, as I've been saying, isn't a straight line that you can follow. It is merely a bunch of events happening in unison.

			Here, I've drawn out a quick messy timeline detailing this.
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v203/[HOD]PK/LifeGoesOnNoParadox-1.jpg" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
So, when you travel back to a different time, you are encoded into that time and exist in it like you were another person. At this point it doesn't matter if you did or did not come from the future, since you exist there.
<br />

<br />
Now, you kill yourself. This is just like killing a random person, because your present still exists in the past, and now becomes the past.
<br />

<br />
So, your past and present get killed off, but your present is still in the past, thus supplying a present for the present and for the future.
<br />

<br />
So, even if you killed yourself, YOU wouldn't be gone.
<br />

<br />

<br />
[edit] It's still hard to explain this, but the thing to remember is that there are <span style="text-decoration: underline">Two Separate Timelines</span> going on here, so you have to think 2-dimensionally in relation to time. If you only think 1-dimensionally (time is just a straight line) you'll end up thinking about paradoxes. But by travelling to another time period, you're creating another &quot;time-line&quot;, thus another dimension to time.

			I would like to add my take on time travel and wormholes.
<br />

<br />
Time travel, everything in the past has already happened, therefore if you were to in the future go into the past and alter events, your present self would already be a result of your meddling in the past.  Thus time travel would not create a paradox due to a technicality in that its already technically happened. Ever wonder why you havent met yourself yet? maybe you have, maybe there are rules to time travel in the future that we  currently dont know for obvious reasons.  You might have been only able to meet yourself as a baby or small child, and sense time travel is nowhere near ready yet you would of course be alot older that you are now.
<br />

<br />

<br />
On to wormholes, Theoretical Physicist Micheu Kahku (sp?) is leaning towards the belief of multiple dimentions co-existing in space but not being able to interact or percieve eachother, except in gravitational pull.  As there is dark matter, mass we are aware of because of its gravitational pull on other objects, but no visible light, nor any light in the invisible spectrums are detected from it, making in &quot;invisible mass&quot; or dark matter.  He believes this is matter from another dimention.
<br />

<br />
He also believes that in order to travel to another dimention via wormhole you would have to pool enough energy into one spot to literally &quot;boil space&quot;, which is currently an unknown ammount of energy, but to try and find out you would probably be using the total ammount of energy output of one sun condenced into a small area, but that is a theory not fact, as we dont understand space fabric enough nor energy output requirements, heck there could be a wormhole at the center of every sun and blackhole and we wouldent know it yet because we havent been there.
