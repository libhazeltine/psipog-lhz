			I often have trouble to clear my mind; Thoughts rapidly swirl through my mind, keeping me from focusing properly.
<br />

<br />
I ended up listening to some music (Daft Punk - Discovery), and noticed how I experienced difficulties thinking while listening to it.
<br />

<br />
I began to wonder.. Would making a psi ball work at this moment? So, as expected, I began to try.
<br />

<br />
Not only was it a lot easier to create a psi ball, but I've never created such a strong one before. It truly felt as if I was holding an actual baseball, rather then a ball of energy.
<br />

<br />
It was an interesting discovery. Since this forum exists, I wanted to tell others. Perhaps it'll help you as it helped me.

			Sometimes i have this little problem, too. Random Thoughts keep popping up, and it's pretty annoying. I think music can be a shortcut to enter into a more &quot;meditative&quot; state, because it saves your mind from paying attention to everything around you. Try to relax, try to concentrate, and once you're focused, don't let your mind wander. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			well i use music to my advantage. i dont beleive in meditation, as im usually always engulfed in a musical extravaganza or im multitasking, i.e. doing PK whilst on the phone/drawing stuff...
<br />

<br />
like say for example, the song harder better faster stronger...
<br />

<br />
replace those lyrics with what you want to achieve....i .e with pk and a psiwheel
<br />

<br />
&quot;spinny spinny spinny spin&quot; etc
<br />

<br />
for some reason these helps me big time...it seems to allow me to focus...

			My theory is that when you start listening to music, you only have to focus on two things, rather then many.
<br />

<br />
Ignoring the music and focusing on your current action.
<br />

<br />
It makes life a lot easier for me.

			I often found that listening to more mellow bands like Modest Mouse, or Air, helps get me into a deeper meditation then with no noise. I think having something on in the background jsut sets the atmosphere for whatever it is you do.

lol its a complete contrast for me.... it seems everyone relaxs and calms themselves before doing PK....
<br />

<br />
i hype myself up lol, bit of Dj Darkraver, or some X-bass, at like 98million% volume. seems to do the trick for me <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />
when im hyped i can do it alot better for some reason.

			For some reason when I started psion stuff, I for some reason gained the ability to just blank out my mind. Very creepy as I just noticed it now XD. I listen to my favourite music, I love it, and it clears my head.. almost. Leaves me with a happy feeling, which is probably healthy to everyone!

			Music invokes emotional energy and psionic rhythms/mobilizations that can be channeled &amp; programmed into specific tasks.
<br />

<br />
Find what music works best for your mind, find stones &amp; herbs, etc, as many enhancements as you can -- then use 'em all at once!
