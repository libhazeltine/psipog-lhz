			So last night was my second time trying to induce an OBE,and I was wondering am I supposed to do it when I`m tired or when I`m in an awake state. Also the first time i tried it I was on my stomach and I felt the vibrations and I started to see wispy greenish colors on my arm and I didn`t know what to do after that.
<br />

<br />
when I tried the second time on my back I never felt the vibrations but I saw the greenish wisps forming in the air and i heard the voice only once say &quot;stop&quot; after that I feel alseep.
<br />

<br />
So after reading that could anyone tell me what I`m doing wrong?

			You shouldn't expect it on the first or second try, it takes some years....I've been going for a month with no OBE <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			forget about how-to obe in 1 day 
<br />
forget even about obe in one year!
<br />

<br />
If you just do everything what is writen.. ( techniques how-to )
<br />
you wont be success.
<br />
Im right because tell me who can go into astral anytime he wants?
<br />
Who is from this forum can do this? And how many months did you tried? Many i think so...
<br />
Its not first forum where many ppl are trying and doing and none of them suceed.
<br />
Lucky times, accidental times doesnt count.
<br />
So its nothing to do about techniques, they will help for those who know how to do techniques.
<br />
Prove me wrong  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
be so kind and tell me about :
<br />

<br />
1. how many months you try with any technique how to go into astral
<br />
2. how many times you were lucky to control yourself fully while you were out of body?
<br />
3. tell me all times you know yourself you are out of body.
<br />
4. can you go out of body anytime you want?
<br />

<br />
1. 15months
<br />
2. none
<br />
3. more than 5
<br />
4. no

			dont drop the idea about obe... just keep exploring this unknown...
<br />
<img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> it will take more than techniques..
<br />
also doing techniques you may be able to understand more that will be needed to go obe

			It takes time.  Don't think you will be able to do it in a few tries.  Dont let this discourage you, but there are people who can't do it even after years of practice.  Just RELAX.  Don't need to be so ancy about &quot;inducing an obe right now&quot; or within a few practice sessions. Ideas like that will definitely not get you an OBE.  Relax, it takes time and practice.  I had one within 2 weeks of practice, but I am using the Gateway Experience.  Don't let that get your hopes up.  Read as much as you can.  Affirm that you WILL have an OBE throughout your day, not just before and during practice sessions.  The night I had an OBE, I was singing at work &quot;I'm gonna have an OBE, I'm gonna get out of my bodeee!&quot; ... obviously it helped...
<br />

<br />
Enjoy your practice.  Keep us posted...

			I was on wave 2, intro to focus 12.  It wasn't my first time doing this session either.  My consciousness just *popped* out and started floating above me right after I hit focus 10. After that, it lasted until the first countdown to focus 10 from focus 12.  It wasn't the session that did it for me, it was, i believe, all the affirmations I had done throughout the day.  Note, I wasn't &quot;aware&quot; of my astral body, but this may be due to the fact it was the first OBE, of many to come <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.  How are you practicing?  What techniques are you using to get OB?  You can always just stick in Free Flow Focus 10 and then take off headphones and chill in focus 10 for hours (you most likely WILL get vibrations if you give it enough time...), I am personally trying this technique now, but i keep getting interrupted, damn people!  All an OBE requires is &quot;mind awake/body asleep&quot;, obviously there are other states that induce it as well, but this seems to be the most common one...you could always try BWGEN.com and download that...that seems to induce the vibrations for a lot of people....

			I've been in focus 12 for an ungodly amount of time...kind of fell out of consciousness but not quite asleep for about 2 hours...I was really disoreinted by the time I came to. Well, I've gotten pretty good at the mind awake/body asleep thing, maybe I just need to try to induce the vibrations instead of always waiting for them (and inevitabley falling asleep)
