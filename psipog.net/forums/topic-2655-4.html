<br />
how do u gaze? simple just use your peripheral vision.. </span>
<br />
most people who practice seeing auras say that always be calm and dont strain your eyes ...
<br />
and the last layer which is the 7th i think you have to be in a meditative trance to see it.. im not sure because there are a lot of fake websites about auras.. and there is no such thing as a aura camera.. there is but most of them are fake..
<br />

<br />
i've been practicing almost everyday and im able to see colours now it use to be a white light but it turned into colour and another weird thing is i think my framerate of my eyes increased because im able to see fast things easier like whenever im in my car(while driving)  i look at other car rims and i can see it very smoothly but before the rims use to be scattered.. 
<br />

<br />
it gets easier to see the aura everyday.. it takes less time to see it now than the other days.<span style="font-weight: bold">. i guess practice is the key and its nothing that hard to see auras.. </span>all you have to do is use your peripheral vision</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

For the first one I agree. But alot of times you can just look centre of the object and you can see it. But about the looking at the centre you obviously must be able to see the entire object quite easily, as in, it's at a distance from you. There's no need to meditate when I say this, you can easily think about something and still see it provided you do what 02a1 said - or what I said as well of course.
<br />

<br />
For the 2nd one you said you had to practise to see it? I didn't practise when I saw it accidently at the start of this year and been seeing it without all that much effort so sue me. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

One question for people here who can also see Aura...I find that say I focus on my finger and see the glow, I let it build up for about 10 seconds or so and when I move mu finger away quickly I see the Aura in the place where I put it for a while before it dissolves away. Anyone else get this?

<br />
thats the afterimage.. its not the aura.. no matter what you do there will always be a afterimage if you try seeing the aura.. thats why the trick is not to move your eyes cause when u move your eyes just a few millimeters or centimeters you will think it is the aura but it was just the afterimage.. this is why i think it would be a good idea to go in a meditative trance while seeing the aura... 
<br />

<br />
the afterimage i cant really explain it.. it only shows the opposite colour of the object not the aura.. although in objects the opposite colour is the aura.. that is why it is better to see the aura on a person or animal because the aura always changes but the first layer of the aura on a person is always blue.... i dont know about animals havent tried it on them
<br />
although the afterimage of a person body is blue too... so i guess there is no easy way to see it except practice keeping your eye still and practice using your peripheral vision.
<br />

<br />
it is hard to explain on how to check if you are seeing an afterimage or not.. you will be able to tell the difference once you keep your eyes still and able to see the first layer
<br />

<br />
i think i still have a long way to go to see all of the layers because i can only see the second layer.. seeing the second layer helps a lot on how to concentrate your eyes.. the second layer is easy to see.. when you see a whole bunch of colours around the blue(first layer) it looks like a rainbow.
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately i cant see the aura using my everyday eyesight i have to concentrate to see it.. but i can see the aura faster than before..
<br />

<br />
i hope this helps those who want to see the aura... remember just try and eventually you will be able to see.

			Last night I was standing in front of the mirror and I think I went into some sort of trance. After about 10 minutes something started happening and my face turned black except for areas that I concentrated on but were not necessarily the center of my vision either. It got to the point where I could almost control what parts turned black and what parts didn?t. I?m not sure if this is aura vision but it was definitely interesting.

			hmmm... I always thought Aura and Psi are seperate energies and as for Auric Sight? I regularly use it to aid in healing or heal and be lazier with it as using my Aura comes easier than Psi healing. Ever hear of Runes? Thats what their supposed to be powered with. I never tried Psi I wouldnt know if it still works anyway.

EDIT: Forgot the actual Auric sight bit XD Woudnt having a non psion see a collection of  in the form of a sloppy drawing just above thier skin as &quot;blue haze/light&quot; classify as seeing Aura spontaneously?

			I can see auras sometimes (I don't try to really). My only proof for myself to know that it is real is experience. For example: I was speaking with a friend in the evening and I saw a red glow about her with other subtler colors about her. This fragmented moving many sphered glow also conveyed a feeling of anger to me though she had her shields on high and I could empathically sense only a vaque difference in her. I told her what I saw and she told me the next day she was angry that night and did not wish to cause me discomfort. I normally see auras at night surrounding whoever I'm with.
<br />

<br />
 One interesting thing I've observed is that traces of the same color aura that a subject always has (unless their emotions change) can be found in places they've been. I suspect that there is a dominant color that goes along with the personality and also contains it's essence. This could explain why you can &quot;feel&quot;a persons sig in their home or workplace. Also I think it also relates to psychometry or when you touch an object and pick up emotions/information from the person who last touched it.
<br />

<br />
Aura perception also pertains to animals since I have seen my pets aura before and the color also went along with his mood at the time.
<br />
I'm not saying anyone shouldn't doubt what I've said or depend upon my word. Maybe some of you should try seeing auras on people you know (who know about your abilities and are people you can trust). Tell them what you perceived, see if it goes along with their current mood.
