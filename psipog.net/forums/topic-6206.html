			I was just wondering if this were possible: <a href="http://narutofever.com/information/sharingan.php" target="_blank">http://narutofever.com/information/sharingan.php</a>
<br />

<br />
you have to read the whole thing to know what i mean.
<br />

<br />
Could you really change your eye to have that many pupils?
<br />
And could you make it so your eye works the same way as stated on that webpage?
<br />

<br />
I am aiming to change my eye to this...notice the pupils that was talked about on the webpage..thats wut i want:

I cant really give you any hard facts, but my personal opinion is that if you focus and practise hard enough, anything's possible  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
The sharingan would take you a while though, and if you did manage to transform your pupils you would have to practise consistently to keep them that way.

			sometimes i think it is impossible but when i think about tk , i say everything is possible as my believe system change .
<br />

<br />
but as long as there is no vedio about that then i think it is harder then tk because you know we all saw tk on vedio but we did not see changing our eyes .

			Through bias judgement, no. I wouldn't trust anything from a site with &quot;naruto&quot; in it.
<br />

<br />
Now, through a science. No, not possible. There is a reason we have one puple. (more light can focus and we can see better or effectivly.)
<br />

<br />
Even if it is possible, you're changing your DNA and all the coding, which I don't think having more than one pupil on one eye is part of a coding, would be dangerous and possibly painful.
<br />

<br />
Now, after reading that site. The idea is stupid.

			actually i think this would be an interesting thing to attempt. obviously yes it does seem impossible to change your pupils (which is pils not ples) due to the fact you have to alter actual gentic make up and such. but eye color can be altered showing that perhaps this has a chance. now an alternative to this would be to perhaps charge psi to your eyes and attempt to make the &quot;rods&quot; expand to take in more thus making detailed images. as in make a magnifying glass over just the rods in your eyes and have the magnification possibly either over them or move it into those 3 areas as in the sharingan but that would be harder and id try the first idea of just magnifying the &quot;rods&quot;  and see if that does anything first.
<br />

<br />
btw some naruto things are just weird and overexaggerated. what they do in the show is extreme and at this point no normal person without constant training since birth to around 40 or older would be able to attempt most of this. actual  ninjistu does involve chakra but only to increase streagnth to a certain vantage point and ninjitsu also utilizes very little known physics and knowledge of biology in order to trick people into thinking it is superhuman when in fact its merely several pressure points being activated resulting in something normally bad(for the reciever) which can range from, paralysis, black out, red out, respiratory disruption, and many other things.
<br />

<br />
such as a temple shot will cause you to black out immediatly if hit hard enough and can possibly send the victim into a coma. a sharp blow to the neck where the bone of your throat(what your adams apple travels on) inbetween that and your chin where you feel both(like a corner) can cause your throat to collapse(im tired and cant remember my big words) and certain shots to your hamstring can of course give you a deadleg as we all know
<br />

<br />
so theres my lesson on ninjas lol

lol for one, im tan as hell, two wear dark jeans, black shirts, and have a mohawk. oh and im 5'10''. im kinda the type of person the ppl you described run from. which they do. then they stop to take a breath from their inhaler...
<br />
lol everyonce in awhile my asthma gets to me 2 tho but rarely cuz ill stay running through a race even with a attack, no inhaler within 300 yards.
<br />

<br />
so everyonce in awhile i have to make my esophogus expand with biofeedback but that doesnt really fit in here(idt) but i have managed to make more lines in my eyes than usualy(you kno the lil black lines that expand like your pupils a black hole drawing them in look for yourself)
