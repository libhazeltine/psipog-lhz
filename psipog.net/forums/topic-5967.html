&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Focus on the part of your consciousness that is 'above', not in physical reality, as if watching yourself from another level. This takes practice, but is easily achieved. You are watching yourself from 'outside the box'. Telekinesis is not done with the physical mind, but from higher frequency movement, above. Step aside and watch your subconscious send energy to your hands and move the needle. This is the way healing and energy work is done. It is all connected through a grid matrix in which you are experiencing. 
<br />

<br />
Move your hands back and forth slightly, imagining lines of energy moving from them to the tip of the needle. You may physically see these 'lines of force'&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

			You should focus on your own consciousness, just like it says. You should focus intensely on that, and then you will experience a higher focus, as if you are floating on higher energetic vibrations tha vibrate at a higher velocity or so. You feel more transparent than normal, less physical, and more subtle. Then you can also see the distinction between your own conscious ness, and your mind/body complex. Then you should use this distanced and unattached state of consciousnes to make the body and mind send the energy to the object. However, I must say some things in your quote sound a little fluffy. In my experience, tk on that level of consicousness, allows you much more easliy to 'just do it'. I've also heard the term 'superconscious TK'In which you just know that the object will move, and accordingly, it moves. The difficulty here is reaching these higher states of consicousness and actually focus on your consciousness itself, rather than on the mind which is clouding your vision.

			I wouldn't be so sure of that Theorist. It doesn't sound too bad for me. Though some things which are said sound doubtful, others don't do. So do many other things in other guides.
<br />

<br />
The important thing for me seems to be rather, not to use your &quot;thinking&quot; or at least not normal conscious thinking, that's why it is hard to explain through just that which leads to missunderstandings because each has his/her own sight of how you do it. 
<br />

<br />
As Martial Artist pointed out very well i think, it's about consciousness and not about the mind, which means the &quot;how&quot;. The &quot;how&quot; will come from itself, once you were able to do it. The other way round it's possible too i think, but more difficult. Don't let yourself discourage from explanations like these. It's like many other things, that are hard to explain, but yet easy to accomplish. Just try out. 
<br />

<br />
Reccomended seems to be for me being a relaxed, though focussed mindset. You should feel alright and don't force anything. Just let it happen.

			hello =)

<br />
The site you found is very good i think. That's the way one should approach to Telekinesis. I find the explanations that are given very good too. I think it's very important not to force things, or not to try force them. That helps nothing. 
<br />

<br />
And thanks for the music i will check it out soon. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Huh, that just explained what I feel when I do pk. When I get the wheel moving really fast my mind feels like it's floating and transparent. There is a lot of truth in that tech. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I don't know about you but if i was to read all this shit i would first look  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> , then think: omg im doomed.
<br />
come on, it's hard enough for most people just to silent their minds, which they are supposed to have some kind of control (now i'll think of an apple. now i won't anymore and will think of an airplane), what if you come to someone and say: just step out of your consciousness, take a step above it, and be more transparent, less physical, and vibrate faster. did you ever imagine what it would be like to try to become transparent?? omg. this is difficult to imagine and &quot;logically&quot; believe by itself. and.. what's the use of it anyway?
<br />
for me, just try to do it. look to the object (or don't), listen to music, or not, watch tv, or not, until you are able to do it. all this stuff of feeling transparent or anything else you will start feeling naturally, THEN you will know what it feels like, and try to feel again.
<br />
it think it's like trying a lot of different ways. once something works A BIT, you say: AHA!!! i thought of an ice cream and this made me feel like a strawberry, and the paper moved. now ill try to feel like a strawberry again.
<br />
THIS works in my opinion, but telling someone: &quot; hey, just try to feel like a strawberry&quot; doesn't make much sense for me at all.
