			It can be useful. My boyfriend broke up with me last week. He didn't want to but his feelings are beginning to dissapear... Maybe it's something I could try? But I'm afraid I might screw up DX Maybe I should try it. It won't be against his will <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I dont like the idea of a love construct. It could mess with peoples minds just so you get what you want. Is that happiness? Making someone do something they truly feel they dont want to do?

			dude..........you're 13. whats the big deal w/ liking her? you have your whole life in front of you and you're sitting here worried that she put a love construct on you? wow. 
<br />
look......let's say hypothetically she did do it..well that means she likes you. just give her a shot. you shouldnt just wag at someone because they like you. and anyway.....you should keep your options open.
<br />

<br />
i remember when i was younger and i this kid started hangin out with my group of friends. we were like whatever just talk and hangout. then after about a week of getting to know him it was like sparks. weird how that happens. it's chemistry.
<br />

<br />
in grade school you always start likin the guy that picks on you. ya its kinda weird..........but the tense energy somehow turns into chemistry that works.

			ok so when you said you scanned it, but you're not sure whether it's real from someone else or you tricked yourself. look at the signature and try to figure out if it's your signature or not. if you cant recognize it, well follow it to its source
