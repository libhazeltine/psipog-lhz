			I have always felt that in order to best practice and improve your psi skills is if you are not under stress, tension, anxiety, yata yata yata.
<br />

<br />
I think we all know that important people in our lives can cause stress and tension; ex-boyfriend/girlfriend, argument with parents ect.
<br />

<br />
I found this exercise in my chakra book that will help eliminate negative ties to loved. Remember, I say NEGATIVE ties. We don't want to break all of the emotional ties, unless you really feel you should and if you do then just give me a pm and I'll help as much as I can.
<br />

<br />
But I feel it necessary that psions practice this because this will help EVERYONE in the long run. It seems to me that this is a psionic skill, I just haven't decided in what 'category' to put it in, but thats unimportant.
<br />

<br />
In order to keep our minds clear, we need to reach for the 'purer' sides of ourselves. I know that sounds fluffy, but I strongly believe it. 
<br />

<br />
So here's the exercises: (method 2 will be on another post)
<br />

<br />
Method 1:
<br />

<br />
-Begin w/ central column breathing (if you don't know what this is, send me a pm) then breathe in and out through your heart chakra. (again, pm me if you're confused)
<br />

<br />
-visualize yourself standing in a circle of light. The person with whom you wish to cut negative ties is also standing in a circle of light facing you. your circles of light are toughing each other or even slightly overlapping. There are greyish pulsating cords running from some of your vital centres or chakras to the corresponding centres in the other person. 
<br />

<br />
-In your visualization move back so that your cirlces no longer overlap; now put an extra circle of violet light around your existing circle and then a fine circle of silver light around that. Do the same for the person with whom you are intending to cut the ties. Emphasize the space between your circles.
<br />

<br />
-Now visualize the grey cords withering and droping away into the space between you. let the space between you become a river of light. The river of light takes the cords into its flow, filling them with light and washign them away to the sea.
<br />

<br />
-Back away from the light and try to become aware of teh lessons that you and the other person have taught or mirrored to each other and be thankful for those lessons
<br />

<br />
-Feel your own space firmly around you as you let the visualization fade.
<br />

<br />
Explanation: Remember, think of the grey cords as the negative experiences, emotions, etc that you have associated with that person. Also, usually in relationships these negative experiences and emotions run both ways. What you want to do is break all the grey cords so there is no underlying tension between either of you.
<br />

<br />
Think of this lessons as a start over cleaning the slate kind of deal. It is very lifting in the sense that anxiety does go away.
<br />

<br />
Remember to do this for about two months almost everyday. Give yourself a break now and then.
<br />

<br />
Again, if you're confused or need help just send me a message. I want to know if this helps people because it's really important to rid oneself of impurities. I say that on a non-religious level. You don't need to be religious in order to realize that there are unfavourable elements and that it's best to get rid of them.
