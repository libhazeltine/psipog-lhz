			Creepy! But I don't know if maybe you heard the noise in your dream right as you were waking up.

Or maybe you have yourself an infestation of zombies...

			i know it wasnt a dream...because i wasnt dreaming.
<br />

<br />
My ears are sensitive to tvs because i am the only one that notices if there on in another room.
<br />

<br />
But it usually occurs after i attempt, and fail <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" /> , and OBE. Then, after i fall asleep....i will wake up ABRUPTLY to the noise to see that everyone is asleep in the house.

			I don't have much SCIENTIFIC experience with it, but I do have personal experience with the phenomenon, as well as a general knowledge from what I've read thus far.  I take it you were in that small area between being awake and asleep?
<br />

<br />
Generally that's the area when you can often hear, feel, even see things.  I've had moments where I'm watching TV and I start to doze off, only to find myself still watching TV (oddly enough, what I hear from the TV has NOTHING to do with what's actually on, as I notice when I actually shake off the sleep).
<br />

<br />
Often during this period, you can also have that sudden feeling that you're falling, causing a reactionary jerk to try and catch yourself - which can also wake you up.
<br />

<br />
I've also woken up many times from dreams because of sounds WITHIN my dreams (I swear, they're sounds that could have never occurred around the house).
<br />

<br />
I've also found that I cannot talk in my sleep, because I end up waking myself up, haha.
<br />

<br />
And on regular days when I wake up normally, I usually have a song left over from my dreams (apparently, my dreams have a soundtrack).

			well, we live in a condo and they probably would have already taken care of a &quot;loose plank&quot; because someone would have heard it too and reported it. Nobody in my house hears it except me.....so it HAS to be the hypnogogic state of mind.
