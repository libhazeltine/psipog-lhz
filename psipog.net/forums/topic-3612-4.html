Wow... Read that post.  How much he is trying to convince us.  Read some of his posts with all the name callings.  &quot; Oh Shit that kid called me an asshole! I guess I have to believe him now. &quot; If it was me and I was telling the truth I would let them be skeptical.  They have every reason to be. 
<br />

<br />
 Alright now for why I know your lying.
<br />

<br />
You post said TK in a day and it was made Tuesday.  Maybe you might have even started Monday.  That would mean today is the start of your fourth day.  It says it took you 3 hours and 4 days which is longer than when you started.  And it takes a lot of energy to move a mixing bowl and a pencil so that means some would already be used.  
<br />

<br />
If you are telling the truth I'd reccomend stopping if you get even near the point of throwing up.

			Manipulator - I totally see what your saying but coming on here and saying he is moving all this stuff his first couple days being a skeptic should be perfectly fine.  If it were me it would drive me to do some more stuff and get it on film.  He has a camera and all we've seen is little bit of psiwheel stuff.
<br />

<br />
maxus - You go anywhere and state something without proof you will will have skeptics.  It's perfectly fine too, it doesn't mean you can't do it, it just means you need to go the extra step and get a video or something of it.  And calling these people who don't believe you assholes won't make anyone believe you any faster.  randy said he highly doubted you bent a spoon and you go on saying &quot;what an asshole, you have absolutely no idea about me, do you? Why dont you shove an object up your ass and try and make it move, i heard thats a great party trick....&quot; How is that being an asshole?
