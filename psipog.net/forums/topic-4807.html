			How many of you have heard of the &quot;twin vibe thing&quot;. I myself being a twin am curious about this. I think it exists. My brother Josh and I do have a <span style="font-style: italic"> twin something </span> to an extent sometimes finishing each other's sentences and on occasion know what the other is thinking.
<br />

<br />
Is the connection through &quot;twinship&quot; so strong that it can relate psionics? What are the conditions for the varying strength of the bond?
<br />
Who else here is a twin and has experienced it ? To what extent?

			Try and get hold of a book by Guy Lyon Playfair called &quot;Twin telepathy: the Psychic connection.&quot;  It could be better-written but contains some interesting odds and ends including some research (shock, research!)  It's worth a read.  Incidentally, are you an identical twin, or just a twin?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Josh and I are fraternal <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> , personally I think the bond is greater when twins are identical due to the fact they came from the same egg...it just split is all
<br />

<br />
Also, i think the more common ground the twins have the more the vibe exists.
<br />

<br />
I kinda like we're fraternal though, b/c we're so different for the most part,(probably why the bond isn't too strong, but strong enough lol, like it better if it was more though)but in other ways we're exactly the same...i'd kinda hate it though if i was mistaken for my brother lol...
<br />

Thanks for the info; i'll check that out...research lol

The small amount of research that has been done (according to Playfair's book) suggests that the order of telepathic strength goes:
<br />

<br />
1) identical twins,
<br />
2) non-identical twins
<br />
3) normal siblings/lovers
<br />
4) friends etc
<br />

<br />
The research is sparse unfortunately.  It seems that the scientific world is even less interested in the 'twin vibe' than in telepathy itself. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

That has happened to me and my brother, and we have never looked like twins as I am two years older than him!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			that order would make sense, then maybe some research needs to be conducted <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> , by twins lol...

			i have twin sisters. there identical -.- uhm idk what to say. I dont think there realy is a twin thing going on there. More like a best friend kinda thing with the addition of the sister/brother thing adding to its intencity. The reason i say this is because i've seen very close friends acting the same, with the same maniorisms and such and yes finishing each other sentances or just acting like twins. Sometimes best friends even look alike for some reason. But im going to say no

			I think its easier for twins to become best friends and thus forge that sort of bond.  There's this guy I've known ever since grade 3, and he's the sort of person that have a 'twin' vibe going on with (but obviously not being twins).  He and I have an even closer connection than myself and my boyfriend when it comes to just 'getting' one another.
<br />

<br />
Thus, I think that it's more of a close friend thing, but being twins makes that easier.  Was that a clear explination? <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			i think that twins have this certain bond between them because due to the fact that they are always together every single minute... and since they are more than best friends they actually share things to each other which in turn strengthens the bond.. they create this link to each others mind and strenghtens it all the way..
