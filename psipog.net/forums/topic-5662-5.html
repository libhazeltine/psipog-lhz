Yes you heard me, each person tell me whether he/she wants Ushima to live. LONG LIVE USHIMA!! (perhaps I overdid it <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />)

			Oh yeah, I just remembered something everyone. I have finished my new drawing. Unfortunately, it's not much because I didn't want to spend forever working on the background, as I have other things to do. I only consider it a slight improvement over the last one. Ushima looks a bit better I.M.O. yet the corpses in the background lack volume and look very vague. I even intended to draw more corpses but it would have taken too long and it probably would have made the drawing look even worse. I suck at drawing background <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />. I need to study my manga drawing book again. My brother will get out of class soon (I'm in the library since I only have four classes and I have to wait for my mom to leave work) and he'll be able to e-mail it to Psi_Ninja so it can get posted. I hope you all enjoy looking at it more than I did <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />. You'll hear from me about it on Friday. Later everyone.

SCORE!! That's the spirit Rahmid. (Now I just need you to somehow impersonate others and make the same vote <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />) Sadly, despite my efforts to make the prospect of this potential manga alluring, someone just voted a 1 for Ushima and now I'm a bit discouraged <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />  (but on the other hand, 6-9 is still in the lead <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />).

			Just keeping this on the first page <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. Hopefully Psi_Ninja will post the picture for us. Today is the last day I can post this week. I will be able to respond to the following statement on Monday:
<br />

<br />
A several days ago my brother gave me the idea of giving Ushima a brother. From there I decided (details is what I do best <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />) to make his brother an identical twin with an almost opposite personality. The only things they would have in common is that they're great fighters and they're both pervs <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. So the twin brother is a nice guy with more anger control and a gift for psionics. I'm thinking of making him almost as good as Ushima simply because his natural talents could make almost anyone good at psi combat. My intended role for him in the story is that of a double agent for the bad ninjas. He gets in there real deep and eventually meets his brother after not seeing him for many years. Together they decide to attack the ninja crime syndicate ( <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />; haven't come up with a name for them yet) from inside and out at the same time. And I may even do a special plot in the beginning where it occasionally switches to small scenes of major things happening to Ushima's brother. And he'd be covered in shadow and stuff and will be undercover so the readers (including Ushima and his crew) will think he really is a high ranking evil ninja. Here's a few more things I have &quot;sewed up&quot; in the plot:
<br />

<br />
1. The lumberjack's daughter will turn out to be a spy sent by the evil ninja crime syndicate far into the manga. She still loves Ushima but if she doesn't work for the ninja crime syndicate they'll kill her and her father. But despite this she risks her and her father's life by not making a crucial report about Ushima's crew and dies a tragic death but the crew manages to save her father (she told them about it all as she bled to death). In the end Ushima exepts the medic ninja as his true love (he never fancied the spy that much but still cared about her yet had a deeper affection for the medic ninja).
<br />

<br />
2. This one's more of a maybe but could make for an interesting beginning: When Ushima goes to the school and moves back in with his grandfather, the crime ninjas <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> are able to get a fix on his location and start tracking him down through the forest (his grand father lives in a log cabin a mile or two from the edge of the forest where Ushima's school is appoximately located) but Ushima's newly acquired ninja skills allow him to slip by most of them. The ones that he doesn't get caught by he has to fend off (this makes him late sometimes) and sometimes kill. When he kills the first one he realizes he feels little remorse him and this affects his decision to become a real ninja. He keeps all this secret from his master because he fears his master will stop giving him lessons for fear of endangering Ushima. The ninjas are after him because they don't want to risk him finding out that his parents are still alive. I'm sorry I should stop here. I need a crap!! Bye.

			I'm back (from the crapper <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />). And I have just come up with an interesting twist to the whole story. The only problem is the fact that I would have to ruin a great ending to a potential manga for all of you. It's really cool but I don't think it's that original. But the good thing is that I doubt many people would suspect it which would have a greater impact on the audience of course. If any of you would like to hear about it just ask me to PM it to you at the cost of ruining (but that does depend on whether any of you think it's a good ending in the first place) the ending <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />. Well that's all I can say for now. I'll be back on Monday. Fare well.

			The twin brother idea's been overdone I think(especially on different &quot;sides&quot;) But still a good mix to the story.....It'd be cool if you made it his cousin or uncle or something, which would help in explaining why there was such a long period of time being separated...mabye an uncle he never knew he had who's even better than ushima?(since he has the same blood)..mabye then since his uncles so much more experienced ushima can learn new stuff from him and eventually surpass him also? just a suggestion  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

I've read volume 2 and 3. Are the rest good?
<br />

<br />
I think we need some sort of MAJOR traumatizing effect to happen to Ushima, that would greatly 'set him off balance'. Somebody close to him dies? 
<br />
He could undergo a huge change in personality, and then one day he could be fighting some people when he notices the person who 'died' earlier. (Not that dieing has stopped necromancers/various other practitioners of the dead &gt;_&gt;. So yeah, she/he does come back to life. Or something like that. I'll leave you to the details so that you can shape it anyway you want.)

I'll respond for him, yeah, he doesn't like to use pen because it always seems to make his drawings look bad. Or maybe he just needs to find the <span style="font-style: italic">right</span> pen...

Although I like the cousin/uncle suggestion, doing that would kind of make it a bit superfluous unless I incorperated it into my other similar situation. It deals with the ending so if you want to know about it and the &quot;complication&quot; just ask me to PM you the part in the ending that explains a few things in the story and I'd then be able to tell you how I could incorperate the uncle (I prefer an uncle over a cousin) thing into the plot. The twin thing IS optional but I think it would interest readers since it would be a big surprise and readers would learn things about Ushima's twin and his relationship with Ushima. Come to think of it, the uncle thing really would be useful in helping Ushima refine his abilities and learn some secret techniques <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />. But I'd still like to PM you about how I could incorperate it into my plot and you can tell me what you think. Just give me the word and I'll PM it to you <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.

<span style="font-weight: bold">TO matzz1010:</span> About the Samurai Deeper Kyo thing- I'd have to say the the first five or six volumes are the best because all these new concepts and characters are intoduced, but it's still very awesome and interesting throughout. I've read up to vol. 14 but I don't know how many have been made in america so far (Japan has 38; I think they've finished with it). Okay, back on topic. The first traumatic event would obviously be his parents &quot;death&quot;. I could make another one where his uncle (if I give him one) would die a hero's death while teaching Ushima some moves. Ushima would, as a result, become more protective over people and would not allow himself to make mistakes that endanger the lives of others (this also makes him more uptight and almost incapable of relaxing).

			Damn, it's hard to keep this on the first page. I'd like to describe some of the other main characters to you but I'd probably get carried away and waste to much of my precious time. I've got an idea. I'll just briefly describe one character and we can all go over it together to see if he/she should be changed or excluded from the story for greater effect. The first character I'd like to describe is Bobutsu. Funny name, I know, but it was pure imagination at work. Okay here it is:
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">BOBUTSU</span>-
<br />

<br />
A cheery, obese (in honor of somefatguy <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />), hungry, funny, incredibly strong comic relief character (he would squint and smile a lot like benitora (comic relief character from Samurai Deeper Kyo)) who can materialize/dematerialize objects very fast. That's his major ability. He uses it to make deadly weapons (weapons could also include things like boulders that fall from the sky and stuff like that <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />) and food of course <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. I can either make him a good cook or a bad cook. A bad cook would be funnier because his food could give them diarreah and stuff <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. If you ask me he is a kind of essential character in a manga like mine since he's for comic relief. The manga would be more depressing without him. Tell me what you think everyone.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span> I forgot to mention his weapon. It's gonna be typical of a big strong oaf like Bobutsu: AN OVER-SIZED DWARF HAMMER!!!!...with a little spike on it <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. He'll also be bald (wears a visorless hat (a kind of hat worn in the snow that stretches over your head).
