Your mind also needs energy and your heart. If you try to do TK with no food in your stomach your body will go to reserves. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			none of these happen to me, but the oddest thing. I was moving the wheel under my glass (or trying to that is) and my feet had a rush of energy. This isnt out of the ordinary since this happened half a month into my practice, but it was always room temp to luke warm. This time it was firey. Like heat. Except it was more... electrical. BTW does anyone happen to know how many volts a wall socket puts out?

I think this is because you are still concentrating (takes effort), instead of meditating upon the object(effortless, automatic continues stream of cognition towards the object). If you look at Nina her vids, you'll see that she looks very stressed and her way of doing tk seems very unhealthy to me. My guess is that she concentrates too hard, instead of letting the attention flow continues towards the object. That way your heart won't get excited, instead you will become even more relaxed and enter a deeper state of mind.; hence the body will relax more as well. Excitement is not so good for tk, because then it is likely that you are using adrenaline. Real concentration comes effortless and automatically.

			I've noticed this too when exercising PK on larger objects. Only I can't claim any weightloss due to it, heh.
<br />

<br />
As far as I've heard, no-one <span style="text-decoration: underline">knows</span> why those things happen. It doesn't happen to all people, and sometimes the opposite effects on the body can happen [as Neveza said].
<br />

<br />
Its clear that not pushing yourself too much in one go is a good idea... cardiac arrest can be quite unpleasant!

			my guess is that you are getting excited (either conciously or sub-conciously sp?) and your heart starts racing from the adreneline running through your body.  also, if you hold your breath or breathe slower when you attempt tk, this speeds up your bpm (beats per minute) and could also be a reason for your increased heart rate.  this only happens to me occasionally since i try to stay nuetral to what happens.
<br />

<br />
as for the weight loss, it depends.  are we talking about major weight loss (at least a couple pounds, noticable), or minor (like a pound, or some ounces)?  if it is minor, this could be due to tensing up during practice.  tensing up creates sweat and in a miniscule way, you are exercising, which helps you lose weight.  if it is major, i dunno, i'll have to think about that one. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
