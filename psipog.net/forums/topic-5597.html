			Alright well I'm new obviously.  I'll give my a intro a good go... I'll giver, cause soemtimes you just gotta giver <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  I did some training in psi before on Universal Lightworkers, if you guys have heard of it, and I was doing ok.  It sorta slowed down and I got into arguments with my trainer and stuff but we're cool now.  I was training to be a Jedi by the way... cool, eh?  
<br />

<br />
So what happened to UL then, lol.  First off me and the admin sorta had some disagreements or whatever.  It's not that he was a bad guy, we just had some disagreements.  I didn't hold back, got banned, its all good  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> So then I eventually got unbanned and it cooled off for a bit.  I got to know some people well at that forum and found out they all had some similar opinions about this one admin but no one ever said anything back to him.  I'm gonna be honest right now, I am sick of telling this story so I'll just leave it at I got into another argument with the other admin and I got permenantly banned.  But in the end I atleast stood up for the little guys so I feel good about that.
<br />

<br />
And as for the whole psi thing, well I want to get pretty dam powerful and shit eventually.  I think I am ready to start up again.  I am looking for another trainer or two.  First off I want to get really good at healing, like extremely good.  After that, I don't really know what is going to happen but hopefully I'll work my way into the astral and just keeping learning more and more.  I understand this stuff takes years of practise so I am starting young  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> I've heard of some scary dates in the future and all so I am hoping to be ready to help out by then.
<br />

<br />
And talking about psi can get boring so me in my other life (the whole split-lives thing) is pretty normal.  I go out to parties every now and then with some friends and have a good time.  I am practising alot now for football coming up in the fall, hopefully I am going to be our new kicker - wish me luck  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> I used to be captain of my rep soccer team for like 6 years so when summer rolls around again I'll be out kicking a soccer ball for our school team, wish me luck on mvp honours (I quit competitive soccer, too much commitment - but I miss the trophies and medals).  And me and my chick friend, who is smoking hot btw, are starting a running club.  We already have have 3 new members haha and once school gets started I know a bunch of people I can get to join.  I mean who looks jogging by themselves, quite boring it is  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Anyways, glad to be here, hope you enjoyed my intro and I am looking to meet some new friends and also hopefully find a new trainer (anyone willing to help a kid like me out there? <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />).  If anyone wants to ask questions or chat or whatever just add me to msn <a href="#">tylerphillips777@hotmail.com</a>

Sorry for the long intro lol
