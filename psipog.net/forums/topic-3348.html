			I had a dream about 4 days ago, it was the most sub-consious controlled dream i have ever had. It started out funny and ended up me waking up with a confused look. I was in class and was watching Dave Chapelle for some reason, lights were off, and i was surrounded by my friends. All of a sudden, this guy pops up, and i can't see his face, so in self defense, i blast him away , then he changes, and comes back, i am sarced so i run away, now mind you, the class room looks like my classroom i take in high school, but i step into the hallway and am transported into a house.
<br />

<br />
I have never seen this house before, but, i know it some how. I look around and see children in their pajamas, running to their beds, laughing, i then look to my left, and see their parents bedroom, suddenly I see two people, a man and woman, i then blank out and find my self in between them. I am nervous as my body pulls to the man yet then towrads the woman <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" /> I am homosexual, and this is the most reason i am confused at this dream.
<br />

<br />
 I have thought about this to reason why i had this dream:
<br />
1) The kids-thought to be impossible without adoption
<br />
2)My friends saying i am not gay
<br />
3) My relations with my friends
<br />
4)My hidden feelings for 2 guys
<br />

<br />
I aprreciate any replys to what i wrote and if it was to much, also there was more to the dream but don't know the ages of the topics readers

			Just to let you and everyone else know, that I think gay people are the awesomest people in the world.
<br />
To me it seems like you're afraid to show something without more conflicts arising. The children part could mean innocence, in that.. maybe it was fun back then, being a child you don't really know what kind of sexual orientation you are, so maybe your mind misses being so care free... I don't know if you have done the &quot;come out of the closet&quot; thing to anyone but it doesn't seem like it coming from the dream -.- the man and women part might mean that you are denying your own orientation, and just going to the woman. Going to the man and being nervous could be that you are nervous of others criticizing you for who you are.

			Thanks, Lucidess for your kind words. My friends are all telling me i am not gay that i am just saying that to get girls. And it does work, but i am 100% gay, so to post about it so much. I do agree with the children=innocence, cuase it was only 7 years ago I did'nt care what i was , i was just trying to have fun. Also, i have been thinking about going out with a girl, but, really have not tried to exercise that yet <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. Also, i do have some people at my school who, for one reason or another, hate my for being gay. They think I will hit on them or something. I try to tell them that we have types like they have types, but, they never listen.
<br />

Thanks for your very kind answer!!

			No problem Wizana.
<br />
I wouldn't understand how it feels to be pressured down like that.. it must be really hard <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> but I hope things work out for ya! because I know a gay couple, and they talked alot about their struggle over this stupid world of descrimination. Descrimination truly <span style="font-weight: bold">SUCKS</span>
<br />
My thoughts on this is that you shouldn't go out with a girl, but just wait patiently for that special someone, if you really need to.  Through my experiences with relationships, sometimes it's best to stay single to a certain point that you just know you are ready.

			Wizana,
<br />
Be who you really are. DEFINITELY don't go out with the girl just because you think that it will make people think better of you. Not only will you hurt yourself, you will also hurt the girl if she finds out... 
<br />
And psions should know kinda how this feels, most of us don't go out telling everyone that we are psions because 1. They'll think we're crazy or 2. They'll constantly test us until we say that we don't wanna display it anymore.... then they'll say that we're faking it. I doubt that it's nearly as bad as trying keep your sexuality a secret..... So my point is, don't come on here trying to flame him, trying to make yourself look better. Because it'll just make you look look like an ass-hole and/or a hipocrite.
