			To help battle fluff and general lack of caring, I've modified the forums to restrict how many posts everyone can make.  The current restriction is set to <span style="font-weight: bold">5 posts per hour</span>, which I think is fair.  I am hoping this will encourage people to think more wisely about how they use their posts.  I'll probably be adjusting the restriction to either more or less (most likely less), depending on how this goes.

Can't you make it that the &quot;user above you in jail&quot; thread does not fall under this rule? j/k <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
Why does editing posts also fall under this rule??? NOO 2 posts left!

I agree completely. I was also going to say that this should encourage people to make higher quality posts to make them worth while. And also I do agree that people should not try to make as many posts as possible. They should choose their posts wisely like I'm going to have to do, seeing as I only have four left!
