Light bringer , People do invent some shit claiming it's relegion, and that ofcourse because of the lack of the relegion knowledge so anyone can say about anything it's relegion .

Roy , I dont know where these forums would have gone to  without you in it ?? , I think they would have gone crazy

Your logic is equally as flawed and biased as Roy's.  Let me point it out to you:  You say that &quot;some&quot; shit is just called religion and expected to be taken as unquestionable dogma.  No argument here, people will use many different manipulative techniques to forward their unfounded views simply for the sake of their own validation.  Religious dogma is one of those techniques.  But you can NOT say that because a percentage of a body of material (often estimated by yourself and done so inaccurately because you don't want to put in the rigorous study to know what you're talking about) is wrong that ALL of the material in that body is wrong.
<br />

<br />
If I use a piece of paper and write 1+1=2 and 1+4=6, you can not say that 1+1 =/= 2 simply because it lies in the same body of knowledge (the paper) as the fallacy 1+4=6.  You're just too damn lazy to do the research and yet can't stiffle your yearning to express your totally uninformed opinion.  The same of course goes for Roy, as demonstrated by his (now becoming typical) reiteration of the poor logic I am condemning.
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Roy wrote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">The &quot;Psalms&quot; evidence is pure crap.  It's religion and therefore it is ill-inspired and...ahem...wrong.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Such a statement is not only useless, it's actually a serious hinderance to critical thought.  Use common sense and whatever knowledge you have to offer, but drawing conclusions from your own incomplete body of knowledge gets the discussion nowhere.  Here is what I mean by using common sense in case there was any confusion.
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Roy wrote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">I wonder what you could dig up if the date was Nov. 5th, or the 6th, maybe October 4th, and with that, I'm sure you can find some &quot;mother&quot; connection.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
No topical knowledge is required to come to this conclusion and it's highly reasonable.  It also does not include assumed knowledge, which many people seem to be so very fond of, where you just got a few pieces of data, decided that was enough because of laziness then just &quot;filled in the blanks&quot;.  Do the work and be an authority or use your head in a critical reasonable fashion and you may still contribute.  Anything else is a bloody waste.

			Um, hey, you guys can talk about the end of the world or what you think it'll be 6 ways from Sunday, but no one is ever going to prove a single thing about it until that time if and when it happens. Everyone's speculation is equally valid because no one knows a single damn thing for sure, so arguing about it is just a waste of energy. Guess what I'm trying to say is....is there a point to this thread?
