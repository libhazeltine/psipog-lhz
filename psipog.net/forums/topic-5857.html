			After reading one of ....I forgot his name. the Mirco-PK one I flamed.
<br />

<br />
anyways.
<br />

<br />
Just thinking back in my 10th grade math class, my teacher would say 7 is the magic number (or something equivlant). Just got me to thinking.
<br />

<br />
What if there is 7 senses? I mean, we obviously have 6. Touch, smell, taste, sight, sound, and ESP (energy sensing). What if there is a probablity sense? I mean, if ErikJDurwood's explaination to me, that the particles are in wave form and move in probablity...or something like that, I'll refram in going to detail of that to advoid butcther. Back to what I was saying, If we have another sense of probility, wouldn't that allow us to change direction of these energy forming psi. It'd come back up to the whole non-physical idea, but only for probablity, not psi. 
<br />

<br />
Obviously, this isn't much new ideas, I mean, I'm just throwing in another sense. 
<br />

<br />
I really shouldn't post this in modern science, but I couldn't think to where anywhere else to place this. I'm just curious on what you guys think. I mean, I don't believe that psionics can affect probablity, maybe sway it a bit with dies and physical objects, but not random generated information.

			I have hard thoughts over the really meaning of probabilty. It goes over the factors of time that I also thought over. I thought time itself could exist in 3 forms
<br />

<br />
Absolut: There time is never changing it would mean that probabilty is meaningless because time would already have predicted it. Of cource time can't exist in our 4th dimensional world because Einstein already proven that time is relative. However there is no proof of a 5th dimension, a 2nd layer of time that predicts the changes in the 1st. Of cource this can be silly now can it? Just layer after layer of time...
<br />

<br />
Relative: Many people believe in spacetime (as in being one as predicted by Einstein) as in being relative because it gives free will and probabilty into it. But many people don't agree with the dice throw into our lifes. Evidence seems to support it, but to comperhend that your really existence is based on chance seems hard to accpet at first. What are the chances that you will die this really instance? One thing I find in people which annoys me is that most people use small probabilty as in impossible. So is it impossbile you die right now?
<br />

<br />
Illusion: Time in gerneral does not exist. Of cource the word time could still be used to explain the travel and movement of objects. How else could we explain them?
<br />

<br />
hahahaha lol, dear me I gotten off the subject a little didnt I? The question was about a 7th sense. Itsnt the number 7 simply refer to god? I don't want to get religionish but I think it came from there. People just seem to take it because of that. Like people tend to avoid the number 13 because its unlucky. Infact I had a teacher who had the number 13 as his lucky.....It was the same teacher who gave me a IQ test.........hehehehe

			Honestly I believe strongly in a similar '7th sense theory'. The 6th sense is things like intuition, mild clairvoyance, things that all humans inherintly have and can't control, can merely acknowledge. The 7th sense is something that some people believe is unlocked by things like NDEs and the like, personally, I believe it's simply a matter of becoming aware of it. The 7th sense is what gives us the ability to control an manipulate energy, if you believe in such theories, and can be broken down into it's own individual senses. Either way, good topic, in my opinion, I'd like to hear feedback from others on it.

			This may be a little besides the point but you actually have over 9 senses and that doesnt include anything unproven like ESP.
<br />

<br />
The 5 senses your usually taught are just a simple set you need to know in everyday life. However, im sure you can think of some more yourself. There is no definitive list but, for example, you dont keep falling over because you have a sense of balance. You can move your limbs without looking at them because you have a spacial sense. I believe pain uses different receptors to touch as well.  There are a few others and even more that are contested.

			No you're totally wrong. People always jump to complicated conclusions when it comes to psi for everything. In Micro-PK you tamper with small small factors like which way an electron will go using TK (the movement of physical matter using psi.) All these small small factors and then it creates a big result; like a die landing on 6 every time. There's no waves of probability that we can sense. It's very simple like precog.

			Please, don't go around saying I'm wrong without any evidence.

<br />
I'm not even saying I'm right. I just expressing my idea. I don't conclude everything as psi, just a idea that popped in my head during my daily cleansing.

Enki, yes, but I think it's not psi that does it as people would think.

It's also optimal for long-term memory. Hence the 7 numbers to telephone someone.

			How do you figure sight is touch? Taste is more of a chemical than physical thing, as well as smell. Hearing is the sensing of waves. Touch is electrical impulses stimulated by physical contact.

			The number 7 is inexorably linked to spirituality. Not sure why, but it is. In Yoga there were 7 chakras to be fully flowered before one could reach enlightenment. In Taoism there were 7 apertures to be opened before one could be come a sage. In Christianity there the 7 lamps before God's throne, 7 seals, 7 bowls of God's wrath, 7 trumpets, 7 scrolls etc. In Buddhism there were 7 stages before one had his first experience of enlightenment. 7 is a significant number, in terms concerning things like spirituality, enlightenment, occultism. They say 7 is perfect and 6 is humans, 666 the Beast etc.
<br />

<br />
As for 7 senses I read a book that argued that 7 senses do exist. We shouldn't be able to feel cramps in our legs apparently and the 6th sense has already been established. We also shouldn't be able to feel things like momentuos movement or things inside the body.
