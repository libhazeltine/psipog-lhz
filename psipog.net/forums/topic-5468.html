			Well, ladies and Gentleman, im officially going now, and never ever coming back. I made a promise to my girlfriend that i would never visit any Psi websites, or practice it again. As it has turned me into a real fucker. You won't see ChorZ, maxus, or TomHather on the boards again, as theyre all the same person. Psi is brilliant, but a waste of time. This has nothing to do with the fact i only have 4 Months to live. Yes, the Radiotherapy failed. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

~M, ChorZ, TomHather.

It's really weird, because this whole thing is very sad. I'm sorry things didn't work out with the therapy, and I'm sorry that you feel psi is not of any concern anymore. I guess I can understand it though. You'd probably much prefer to have fun and do whatever you want in the remaining days of your life. I hope you enjoy them.

I am not sure if you are reading this, but there have been lots of people who cured from terminal cancer. It has been examined and there are many cases stated. One that I want to make notice of to you, is the healing of the woman Brandon Bays.
<br />

<br />
(Translating from the back of her book, which I have here in Dutch:)
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-style: italic">Brandon Bays - The journey: A practical guide to healing your life and setting yourself free.</span></span>
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Brandon Bays has co-operated with great masters like Wayne Dyer and Tony Robbins. In 1992 she got the diagnose that she had a tumor with the size of a football. This diagnose stimulated her to dive deeply into her own soul and to carefully examine her own life. Seven weeks later, she was 100% cured. Without medication, without operation. The story of Brandon doesn't stop there. In the years after her healing, she went searching for a way to methodize her experiences, so that they could help others as well. Ever since, she has been able to help thousands of people to cure themselves from lifelong issues and emotional blocks. In this book she hands over everything the reader needs to experience this healing journey him or herself.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />

<br />
I also have a method that Roy Martina once taught me, that might help to reduce the cancer by stimulating the Thymus Gland which is responsible for the immune system. He claimed that it truely had a clear and positive effect on these people. Some even cured completely. I got no proof for this, so it is up to you to believe this or not. I am not some sick guy that tries to make a joke in making you believe in some sort of last hope. My intention is pure.
<br />
This kind of healing has been done before, and I bet it happens all the time. The choice is yours to make Maxus. 
<br />

<br />
I believe that if you read this book intensely; apply what is given by this book; combine it with this method concerning the Thymus gland which I can email or PM you; and if you have the required amount of will power and energy to dive deeply into this kind of healing, there is a way. There is always a way. I am no doctor and it is not allowed to give medical advice here, but this is no medical advice, just a couple of tips and a method(invented by a doctor btw) that you can take into consideration <span style="font-style: italic">if you still have the will to be healed.</span> I say this, because I do not know if you are already passed this stage and perhaps already accepted your situation. If this is so, I do not wish to disturb your acceptancy if it came with inner peace. For healing often requires your will energy, However sometimes, acceptancy and <span style="font-style: italic">total</span> surrenderment can do wonders also. PM me if you want.
<br />

<br />
Either ways: Take care my friend, my blessings are upon you.
<br />

After that or before I said &quot;tell me&quot; he went offline and I was unable to contact him. When people block you they appear offline to you. Also I say that he may have blocked me before I said &quot;tell me&quot; because my version of msn messenger (Windows Live Messenger) allows me to messege offline people and they normally receive my messeges when they get back online. Also, however, it is entirely possible that he simply went offline. Regardless of these factors, he said what he said, which prompted me to go to the goodbye section of these forums and read this thread. I did not know this user was maxus but it clearly said &quot;Goodbye.&quot; and so I decided to look into it further. Sure enough it was maxus and I had looked at it before anyone had posted a response. Naturally I did not post a response because I utterly hate posting but I find it utterly and entirely necessary at this point to preserve ChorZ(and thus, Maxus') innocence. If you would like to read more of what happened earlier in our conversation(what happened immediately before the above quote occurred), I will post that if(and/or when) it is asked for. If you beleive this scenario is a utter fabrication then you have a very sick mind. However I will do what is necessary to prove the truth even if it means posting the original xml logs of our chat(and beleive me, I can not doctor xml). Also I agree with Martial Artist(who I am also in contact with via MSN messenger), in regards to the fact that this can be healed. It can be healed. That is the truth. Martial Artist sent me an article that helped me control my bipolar disorder better (a mental illness[lets not get into it]). It helped me recognize different states of mind and to seperate myself from my mind in order to control my mood fluxuations to a greater extent. Anyways, enough about me... Maxus, if you are reading this: <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">You can heal yourself, I honestly beleive it.</span></span>
