			Well, my parents half know. I think they might think I'm joking around. But once able to move the spi wheel and maybe roll a few pens and pencils and stuff I'll show them. I'm Christian and it doesn't affect my beliefs at all. I think it may just be further proof of God. But thats just my opinion(sp?).
<br />

<br />
BTW, I just got into psionics, just a couple of days ago, so I'm not really expecting super results over night. And I don't feel the need to find out if they do think if I'm joking or not.

			I'm 19 years old and I know that if I told my parents, they would say they don't believe me, they don't care, it's a waste of time, and all that other crap that I can hear them saying. So I mainly keep it to myself, except for the people I talk to in the forums. Maybe after I get more and more results, I'll show my friends, but I am still waiting for results, lol.

			I'd never tell my sister, because I respect her too much and I don't want to shake her faith.
<br />
I'd never tell my brother, because at my age of 17, I don't think he'd let me live it up.
<br />
I'd think of telling my mother, because she does care alot about me.
<br />
And the one time I got the psiwheel to move like mad shit, I showed my dad, and he still made fun of me. So yeah, I don't really talk much about it to ANYONE in my family, due to the fact they probably won't accept it. They'd never disown me though.

			My father does not accept it, but is sometimes amazed when predictions I make come true. My mother on the other hand has been practicing psi for most of her life, without ME knowing. In fact, she kept it so secret that she didn't tell me it was a part of her life until half a year after I told her I was into psi. Psi runs in my family, my brother has a thing for it, so does my great uncle, and my aunt.
