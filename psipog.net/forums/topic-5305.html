Unless you're some hardcore druid, then no this isn't possible.  And even if you are a hardcore druide, no, not possible.

			Thinking beyond thinking, emotions, and anything concious related, I would only think you can't really speak to it, but kind of read the energy from the tree and the environment.

If you think it's talking to you with words, than you shouldn't be talking to a tree.

			There is a certain amount of evidence that trees and various other plants respond to signals, and some evidence that they also produce such.  Some of that evidence comes from a polygraph technician who clearly had too much time on his hands. 
<br />

<br />
As for telepathic communication with trees, verifying the supposed communication would be problematic.  In this field, any data that cannot be checked against another source is suspect.

			I've heard of reiki trainers using plants to gauge their skill... to see if they can keep a plant healthier than expected.  Something like that, I don't entirely remember.
<br />

<br />
I talk to trees.  But... I talk to everything.  Walls, bugs, air, people, pencils, myself, etc... I think it's a good habit to get into to be friendly to things that you don't understand.  The habits you form will carry over to unconscious states of mind, where it actually might be useful.  Whether or not a tree understands me and talks back, I have no clue.  I might look crazy when I say hello to a tree, but oh well.  No harm, really.
<br />

<br />
I don't consider it real communication.  More like... talking to characters in a video game.  Of course you don't really believe you are talking to them, but your thoughts act like you do.  &quot;This asshole is trying to snipe me, but I know how to beat his artificial intelligence.&quot;  etc.
<br />

<br />
Or maybe I'm crazy.  *shrugs*  Nothing new there.

			depends on how you define &quot;thinking&quot;. High level thinking is limited to certain species of animals, of course, but most organisms above viruses tend to alter their behavior depending on the situation, which could be considered thinking. plants will lean toward a sunlit window, or direct their roots towards water, which again could be considered low level thinking. viruses only do what they are designed for, but even bacteria will change to fit a situation. oh, and incidentally:

&quot;Astral beings.&quot;

<br />
since when do trees qualify as astral beings?

			I see it this way:
<br />

<br />
Everything from single celled organisms and up respond to &quot;stimuli&quot;. Ie. Something happens and they change, react, and in a way are &quot;aware&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
On the psychic level, it is not impossible to see such responses and minute (my newt) changes. 
<br />

<br />
But the REAL question is, what would such small or mentally &quot;inferior&quot; organisms have to say? It wouldn't speak in words, and would have to be translated from maybe emotion, and definetly pure impression <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

			I can talk to trees, just look at them and see how they are moving. They can tell you how hard the wind is blowing, where the wind is blowing, and how much water they are recieving, etc. 
<br />
I am kinda joking incase you haven't noticed, but in the aspect that I just explained...you could say that the trees can &quot;talk&quot; with movement and apperance. Other than that, nah, I don't think they can really talk with words in your head or anything. 
<br />
They can also say John loves Ashley though. Ha, get it? People sometimes write love notes on trees.
