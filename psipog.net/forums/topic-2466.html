			I voted wii beaucse its new and intersting and hasn't been done before. Plus it comes away from the old trend of &quot;wow, these games now have even more polygons than before and brighter colours!&quot;, reply..&quot;What else has it got?&quot; ...&quot;errrrr, nothing. Thats it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
What a watse of money that does the exact same thing as the console sitting next to your tv, but just a tiny bit better. Seriously though....?200! *cough* ripoff.

			I definetely admit that it has better graphics and faster gameplay, but i voted the wii purely becuase of its uniqueness.
<br />

<br />
And holy crap I just realised that you have over three times as many posts as I do!!
<br />

<br />
 I think it goes something like: The xbox 360 has 10 times better graphics than the xbox, the ps3 has 5 times, and the wii has 3 times. Not sure about that though. Ten times as good doesn't sound possible. Well, anyway, I'll be laughing when the day comes when Nintendo make the first game console that you put on your head and feel like your in the game. mwuahaha.

Groundless pro-Xbox360 enthusiam...sigh.  First off, PS3 will have far better graphics (hello?  Newer graphics card, waaaay faster processor and the ability of that processor to allocate resources far more efficiently).  Better gameplay isn't something anyone can claim yet, unless you've gone to the future and played both systems well after their release when more than just launch titles are available.  From the current trend I'm seeing, 360 doesn't even have that many games that aren't ports.  Every game right now gets released for PS2, Xbox, PC and 360 so why shell out $400 for the system and an extra 20 bucks per game so that you get one cool lighting effect in one level of the game?  So if anything, quality of original gameplay seems to already favour PS3 because of the road Microsoft is taking lol.
<br />

<br />
Second, PS3 will be the same price for far more advanced technology. Nuff said there...
<br />

<br />
Third, since when has Microsoft been known for their bulletproof programming?  3rd party programming will be of equal quality on each system, so the games made by Sony and Microsoft are the only games free from that trend.  Have you not witnessed the numerous alerts on the news about bugs and worms that sneak through Microsoft's terrible programming and wreck million of computers?  How can you even claim to have confidence in programming like that?
<br />

<br />
Fourth: better XboxLive?  Well yeah, I guess you have everyone else beat since XboxLive is not even used by the Wii or PS3.  If you want to talk about connectivity in general though, I know that Nintendo will have a full library of previous Nintendo games all the way back to Super Mario Bros.  Sony will have connectivity between the PS3 and PSP as well as numerous other Bluetooth and Wifi accessories.  Meanwhile XboxLive has...oh right, Geometry Wars.  Again, how did you find that Microsoft had the upper hand in this category?
<br />

<br />
Finally, there's the claim of &quot;better games&quot;.  Now, right off the bat I'm going to agree 360 has a LOT of good games in it's lineup (though many aren't finished yet) like Halo 3, Oblivion, etc.  But so does PS3 with RE5, Devil May Cry, Killzone, etc.  The only difference between the 2 systems I've found as far as games go is not the games quality since neither comapny would be in the business if their games sucked, but game exclusivity.  Microsoft releases tons of their &quot;exclusive&quot; games onto PC as well as Xbox and 360 while PS3 games are only accessible by playing a PS3.  So why should I shell out about 600 bucks total for the 360, Halo, and Oblivion when I can buy just the games for about 100 bucks and play them on my PC?  Again, because of exclusivity, there is much more reason to buy a PS3 than an Xbox besides the chance to paly with a controller...
<br />

<br />
Oh btw, Nintendo's money is made by creating new markets then exploiting them by using household names (like Mario).  It's like 3M as far as it's business platform goes because they rely on innovation to exploit relatively small but numerous niche markets previously untouched.  It's not that Nintendo can't compete with the other gaming companioes but simply that it's easier for them not to.  Trying to compete with Sony and Microsoft would be like entering the grpahics card race now between Ati and nVidia, there's no point because both companies are already trying sooo hard to out-do the other.
<br />

<br />
So, all around, I'm obviously going to say PS3 is superior to Xbox360 in virtually every way.  Because of the later release date mostly, PS3 will do to the 360 like Xbox did to PS2.  The Wii is also a formidable system and I might even pick one up simply because like the PS3, the gaming experience will be exclusive to the system, rather than playable on PC or the system like 360 games.

			Clearly, lightbringer has not played an xbox360.  The games are completely different and graphics are a lot better than its previous consol.  I dont know how anything can get a better processor because the 360 runs at the speed it is supposed to (and the games run at great speed) and there are no &quot;choppy&quot; parts.  I will grade the PS3 when it comes out (if it ever comes out and stops delaying the release date).  &quot;Newer graphics card&quot;.  Heh right.  it comes out a whole 2-3 months after and it has new graphics card.  heh.  Etc etc etc.  We shall see when and <span style="font-weight: bold">if</span> they come out.

			I actually saw an xbox 360 in game station recentely playing what I think was call of duty. My opinion. Crap. Not as good as I had expected. Thats my honest opinion. Of course it was only one game and you can't judge a whole generation console and hundreds of potential games just by one of the first, but it was even on a hd tv and it didnt look as good as I had thought. To me it's not worth the money. 
<br />

<br />
I will probably get a wii if they use it to their full potential, like bringing out some star wars games so I can slice people with my lightsaber. Possibly the funnest game to come, if it does.

			PS3, because I have always been with Sony. PS1, PS2, and next PS3. I have no other reason than that. I don't care about the technical stuff...it's only obvious that all of the new systems are going to have around the same attributes in the technical field otherwise they would be in big trouble. And no I didn't read those 5 paragraphs that Lightbringer wrote about the PS3 and the technical stuff because I don't care for the technical stuff. (no offense Lightbringer, I am just glad you are on my side on this one) I also like a lot of the games on the Sony platforms. The only reason I would get the Wii is because it has Super Smash Brothers...I have played all of the other ones and love to play them with my brother and friends. It's the only reason I got a N64 and a Gambcube (I did play a few others on the Gamecube though) As for the Microsoft systems...I would definetly get them, if I had the money. It's all about the money...a game system is a game system to me, I would get them all if I could.

Alright, name some 360 games not on other systems.  In fact, name some 360 games that are on other systems that have any significant changes.  Do you know what distinguishes NBA 2006 on the normal Xbox and on the 360?  Sweat.  That's right.  For 20 bucks more you get players who get sweaty throughout the duration of the game.  Now I'll admit the shine is well rendered, but such a miniscule difference doesn't even make the 360 worth purchasing over last generation's systems, let alone the Wii and PS3.
<br />

<br />
PS3 also comes out far more than 2-3 later than the Xbox and they have been advertising their graphics card (the nVidia RSX) since LAST E3 (that's a year ago now) which is technically better than the 360's.  Regardless, you obviously know nothing of the industry since th 2 main graphics card-producing companies now release better GPUs each month, so a 2-3 month difference in release WOULD be significant.  The processor for the PS3 will also be waaaay better because the 360 uses a multicore CPU whereas the PS3 uses a cell processor (which will become the standard in CPUs in a year or 2).  Sony has also stated a final release date for their PS3.  You would know these things if you had any clue what you were talking about instead of making claims after playing a 360 for 5 minutes at your local Toys R Us.

Btw, I've played 360 and can say that Oblivion for one has areas of frequent and significant choppiness.  Play it on PC (surprise! another 360 title that isn't exclusive!), the experience is better by far if you have a decent rig.  So again, your claims are completely false.  Honestly, did you just browse the XboxLive menu and decided it was the best thing ever because you're extremely susceptable to hype?

Mattz: I was pointing out the trend of Microsoft to rush into production programs with bugs and errors alike (and who's to say that someone couldn't put a virus to spread through XboxLive with a little modding? People put Linux on the original Xbox).  Meanwhile Linux, famed for it's quality of programming, is going to be used on PS3.  Thus, less bugs, less crashes, less errors, etc.
