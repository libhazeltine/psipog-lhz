			Me and my brother...seem to be connected somehow. Becuase this happens like three or four times a day. I will be looking at something, and I will focus on one part of it and my brother with out even looking at me or the image can tell what I am looking at. It is reallu weird. And you cant tell me this is coqencadence (bad spelling). Becuase it would be mathmatically impossible for this to happen this often.
<br />

<br />
So what i am going to ask you is that, do you think me and my brother have like a connection in some way. BEcuase it is bugging me.

			In telepathy their is something called a &quot;link.&quot; A link is consciously established with another person by a telepath to read their minds and such. 
<br />

<br />
But sometimes subconscious links are made. Between mother and child; husband and wife; brother and sister; so on and so on. In fact, their are theories that say more than 10,000 people are linked together at any given time, and that a universe cannot exist without the mind entering into it for the mind is constantly shapping what is going to occur.
<br />

<br />

<br />
What you and your brother have is a strong telepathic link. 
<br />
Links like this are seen in close family members and twins.
<br />

<br />
I suggest that you attempt to develop this, because with practice you two will be able to communicate telepathically with each other. 
<br />

<br />
I suggest reading this article 
<br />

<br />
<a href="../art-psi-games.html" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/show.php?cmd=wp&amp;id=27</a>
<br />

<br />
and trying out all these fun telepathic games with each other.
<br />

<br />
After you've mastered those try to send one word to each other and see if you can successfully read it. Then slowly increase the number of words. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
This is the whole telepathy section
<br />

<br />
<a href="../articles.html" target="_blank">articles.html?cat=101</a>
<br />

<br />
They all are short articles that I suggest you both read.
<br />

<br />
They are short because telepathy is simple. People expect it to be complicated but it is not. I think of it as in terms of physical strength. We all know what is needed to punch through a wall. Thats to lift weights. But allthough its a simple process it takes long to do.
<br />

<br />
PM me with any questions.
