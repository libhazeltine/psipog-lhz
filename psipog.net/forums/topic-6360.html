			Something has been bothering me lately. Whenever I get a pair of shoes that have to be tied really tight so that they stay on properly, it usually seems to cut off my circulation a bit. The wierd this is that I feel psi flowing through my feet when they are too tight and this makes me wonder if it is not psi at all but just blood flowing at high pressures. This makes for 3 major possibilities:
<br />

<br />
1. What I thought was psi for over a year was just blood, making me a blood manipulator= bloodkinesis <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. 
<br />

<br />
2. It is just psi that for some reason flows heavily when under pressure.
<br />

<br />
3. My blood and psi feel the same.
<br />

<br />

<br />
(By the way, my psi/blood feels like icy cold water that moves with a trickling sensation most of the time.)
<br />

<br />
What do you all think it is?

I think the answer is plainly obvious and if you have trouble determining whether you're feeling constricted blood or psi flow, then you've got much bigger problems than tight shoes.

Thanks for avoiding the entire question <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. I'll bet its psi anyway. I don't think that I have been controlling my blood to relieve pain over the period of my several months here.

			I think you're doing psi wrong. The first psi balls seem to always feel hot or like a pulsing feeling. This is just blood flow and natural body warmth. In fact, psipog is somewhat spreading ignorance by telling people that psi can feel like any sort of strange feeling. Theses feelings of pulsing and pushing and warmth COULD be psi but they are most likely muscle fatigue, warmth, and blood flow. Try mastering a cold a psi ball that you can really feel is freezing cold and other people can feel is cold. Once you have that, remeber what it felt like to make and that and remeber the feeling that energy is present in the cold ball. Then you can recreate that and make a real  psi ball that does stuff like warmth and pulsing.

Thankyou for the advice, but there are two reasons why I know that what I feel is psi:
<br />

<br />
1. As far as a know, manipulating blood or whatever cannot relieve/extinguish heart pain (which, as I have just implied, I have done (on multiple occasions))
<br />

<br />
2. When I supposedly made a psi ball, somefatguy said he felt an unusual amount of heat emanating off of my hands when he put his next to mine (not touching though). Although he felt heat it felt like icy water to me.
<br />

<br />
That's all I can post for now. I have to go.

Seconded. This post has to be a joke. You're just cutting off the circulation to your foot. Ever have your arm fall to sleep?
<br />
And, yes, of course blood is still flowing through your foot. It's just lowered because of the pressure put on the veins.

It is said that chi (psi basically) flows through hundreds of tiny energy currents in the body, some of which intersect with others. Acupuncture is the science of stimulating this currents with needles. For all I knew, the pressure applied could have been screwing with my energy causing me to feel it. Of course, this is just a wild guess so don't act like I'm claiming this to be the truth. I don't want to start any arguments over such a trival thread. Also, since you and zemeon say that it's just blood flow than that means that I can not distinguish between blood and feeling psi. If you think it's just blood and want to make fun of me for it just look at my previous post describing why it HAS to be psi. One last thing, my psi does, at times, feel warm. Especially when I visualize white light which I have already established as a mental link to heat which is why I call it my warm psi technique. Sometimes it switches between hot and cold during a single exercise. Oh, and BTW Roy, when I feel psi it isn't a vague feeling. Infact it is so strong that sometimes I could swear that someone was pouring really cold water on me. More recently this has happened to me in the groin area <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> and I almost thought that it was number one but then remembered that there is no such thing as urine that is close to 0 degrees celsius! That is all. Case closed.

Uh...Niushirra...I said that it feels cold to ME but warm to OTHERS. There is no point of testing it. Another thing that proves this is that somefatguy once transferred psi to my arm and it actually felt cold to ME but warm to HIM. I think that is proof enough. Thankyou for the advise though.

			In my experience, increased blood flow = increased psi. I can manually increase my blood pressure quite high to the point of twitching rapidly. During that time I can generate psi ten times quicker and in more bulk.

Personally, I think you felt tte circulation cut off. I know this because I had exactly the same experience a while back when I was mediting;my feet and half way up my legs went ice-cold and trickly. Then, when I got up, it started flowing away.

Thankyou so much. That is probably one the most helpful posts I have  received in a thread like this. I can agree that my blood flow would be obviously increased but I believe now, because of you, that I was FEELING psi due to the increased blood flow which I didn't actually FEEL (unless you count the tremendous pain of the shoe on my foot <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />). I remember that Yamamaya made a post long ago about blood's relationship to psi; that means I should have PMed him in the first place, dammit! <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />
