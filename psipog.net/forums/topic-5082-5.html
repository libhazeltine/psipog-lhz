Technically they're not bumping, they're spamming.

I would enter Randi's challenge if I was closer, but I live too far away from him to come to America or wherever, and I'm too young. Even if I was old enough, it wouldn't be worth my time or money, since Peebrain already showed that the prize was bonds, not cash, in his article.

Meh. This whole thread is spam. The very first post was spam. If you enter this, chances are that Randi will call you a fraud, edit your emails, and post them on his site, making you a laughingstock. Anyway, this isn't James Randi. We were just making fun of this dude's lame attempts to impersonate him.

Well, if he would comply to a simple test to see if it's really him, we could easily found out using this method...
<br />

<br />
1- Give J. Randi a jar.
<br />
2- Tell him to fart in said jar.
<br />
3- Give it to someone willing to smell the fart.
<br />
4- Have the person smell it. If it smells like ignorance and sin, it's the real Randi.

			That has to be the best Randi Test ive ever heard of. Some of the other tests ive heard have included:
<br />

<br />
*Boiling the Randi's socks in a solution of salt and manure, and see if they turn purple, if they do, then you have a Randi.
<br />

<br />
*Pull on his beard, if it won't come off, then you have a Genuine Randi.
<br />

<br />
But seriously, i really doubt this is the real Randi, the perpetrator doesn't really type like Randi, ive seen Randi's typing and use of words, and its definately not like the posts in this thread. The Randi Impersonator does not use any arguments as to why Psychokinetic Abilities cannot exist. Finally, im sure the Real Randi wouldn't even bother to come onto a Psionics website to advertise his $1,000,000 challenge, he relies on the people to come to him.

			well, i doubt this is randi.  if it was, do you think he would have took the time to join the forums?  no, he knows we would rip on him and ask him about peebrain and others that have been rudely neglected.  he would probably just contact peebrain somehow, and ask who the most experienced of us, or those of us with most interest in the challange were, and try to contact us further.  
<br />

<br />
myself, i don't know if i would take the challange.  because of work and school preperation, i haven't practiced tk for months.  i was never really into telepathy until recently, but i haven't practiced much.  all i would have to offer at the challange is remote touch (which would freak him out lol) and the forbidden topic we can't discuss here, which i would be more than obliged to test it on him  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			Someone please lock this waste of time. There's two possibilities here: 1)Some loser, who spends most of his time trying to create some form of &quot;chaos&quot; on message boards, has decided to play pretend. Emphasis on the loser part. He's now either bored with this or afraid to continue. Or he got caught up with violating his Wonder Woman action figure and forgot he posted this. 2) James Randi is desperate for people to point at and call phoney and has sought us out. And if it is truly you, be aware that most of us know that your contest is worthless and no one is interested in &quot;performing&quot; for you. You have no interest in science, you only need people to tear into and parade around in front of your fellow &quot;skeptics&quot;. You make real skeptics look like jerks with their hands clamped over their ears. Skepticism should be as neutral as possible, but you're arrogance and pomposity taint everything you do. Anywho, enough about you (a phrase I want you to think about for awhile). People, please stop responding to these things, both possible authors of this post thrive on attention. Again, <span style="font-weight: bold">please</span> lock this. And I think we should stop discussing this challenge altogether because it's been proven as a scam and waste of everbody's time.
