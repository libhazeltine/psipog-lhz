			To keep this simple, and allow for further conversation in the future, I am not going to dive into my past and explain why I am indeed a knower of the vast capabilities that we all hold.  However I do remain skeptic, the truth is, even though inside I  know that the truth and ability to do &quot;things&quot; does not rest outside of myself, I do also look for evidence outside of myself, others like me.  So far outside of groups such as this I see no one, where is everyone.  If everything is legit if our innate feelings speak truth, if we are incarnate of greater than what we would be lead to belive then where is everyone. Why secrecy, is it of fear, to evolve as a conciousness we must face fear and overcome it. Is it to keep these things for ourselves.........I dont know. this is a calling voice from me, from many others too. If there is truth do not hoard it.  
<br />
     As I have said above, I am not going to dive into my past on here, but I will say that I have lived many things and realize many things about us all, I am no master of anykind of anything though. I am simply looking for someone to share with to observe together, to learn from eachother.  
<br />
I am aware of the indicated contradiction above between my statement of knowing and being a skeptic, the reason for that is to remain open, inspite of my life experiance I do not want to become caught on a single track, instead be completely open and let the truth reveal itself.
<br />
    I am not sure if this is the best way to have exposed this on here but it was all I knew to do.  So, if someone would like to talk, I can make an effort to check back here, but the easiest way to communicate to me is either through myspace,  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/necronate" target="_blank">www.myspace.com/necronate</a> or my e mail which I am going to assume can be found on here somewhere.
<br />

<br />
thanks anyone

			I don't know, your posts seems like you are some what denying why we are all here on this message board.
<br />

<br />
You say there is &quot;secrecy&quot; and we are hiding something. What are you talking about? We are all here to help each other gain the ability to master Psi. (At least that's what we should be here for, among other things). To communicate with others who share this interest, as well. I, and many others I know, freely discuss Psi outside of this forum, and outside of the internet. This is merely an easy to access gathering point.
<br />

<br />
I believe it is a good idea ot remain &quot;skeptic&quot; of Psi, even if you believe in it. It allows you, as you said to keep off of a &quot;one track mind&quot;, and to constantly check reality. This, is a great thing to have the ability to do.
<br />

<br />
I don't know about you, but the topic of keeping Psi secret has really been beatin' to death, and the arguer had ZERO good points:

<a href="topic-1600.html" target="_blank">http://psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1600</a>
<br />

<br />
I hope this helped.
<br />

Also, it is just as easy to come back to Psipogbb.net and post, as it is to communicate through Myspace.

			Well I am under the impression that secrecy is abundant in all fields of knowledge.  The fact of it being good or bad is a matter of personal choice.  As for the particular case of (psi) a reason could very well be safety. 
<br />

<br />
Now since acquiring knowledge makes even the brightest impatience it is important to remind each other that answers come from within. When the time is right everything will unfold, as it should. yada yada
<br />

<br />
As for whisper my advice should be taken lightly. You seem to be at a stage where meditation might help gather your questions, and then one by one you could make progress. On some of my tougher questions I would be satisfied if I got an answer within a week or two. Hope this helps

			None of us are keeping secrets.  We all come here to speak our minds and learn new things.  There are so many things i've learned here that don't even pretain to psi.
<br />

<br />
I beleive that psi is unstable when mixed with public beleifs.  It could be the fact that psionics is too big of a change for the public.  Remember, being skeptical is healthy.

			Most people keep things secret because when they speak of such things they are ridiculed. So because of this they keep things secret. Furthermore most simply don't believe these things and trying to convince them is a waste of time. Most people don't keep things secret because they are afraid of what they are capable of, some might though, but afraid or sick of of others responses. Nothing more nothing less.
<br />

<br />
Furthermore we exist in the information age. Where all things on all techniques of the mind and body can be found and practiced. A heavy theme in this day and age is seek and ye shall find. Those who care enough to look will care enough to follow the doctrines and techniques they find. Those who don't often times will not unless it is directly within their interest. I tell those who will listen and who can benefit from the techniques i know about a specific one. If someone I know has a huge workload, I will tell them of speed reading. If my little cousin wants to win the spelling bee, I'll teach her memory techniques.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I for one may show my friends something cool just to entertain them but to never to prove what i believe. I am not here to prove anything to anybody but to learn and become greater.
