			I started to think about this, and realized the burden and annoyance, people pull theories out of their asses thinking it is backed up and bug everyone, then the evil users, stupid people that mis uses psi by accedent, the cults, and other things that could be included.
<br />

<br />
then agian it might be different, it might work out well and probably give our culture and species an boost and health and age would increase, possible new cures.
<br />

<br />
 what do you think will happen? do you really want it proven? would you think it be benefitual?

			Hiya guys.
<br />

<br />
Sorry to jump in like that, but I would like to input a little thought.
<br />

<br />
There is (to my humble little analysis) nothing &quot;psychic&quot; into telepathy, or at least nothing comparable to &quot;spirit&quot; related experiences.
<br />
The explaination is actually pretty scientific and logic :
<br />
_FACT: We know that our brains works through electric connections, like a radio, and like a radio, electricity allows us to produce frequency (electric impulsions). If we can produce frequency, then why couldn't we emit it? If we can emit, then we surely have a receptor...
<br />
_CHALLENGE: Learn how to control, translate or encript/decript, target and emit these frequencies!
<br />

<br />
I myself never had any &quot;obvious&quot; proof of efficiency of telepathy, but, it is not because I do not know how to do something that it is not possible...
<br />

<br />
Happy to hear (read) your thoughts...

The best thing you do is, don't even pick a discussion with someone who says it doesn't exist. I learned it through experience, it's not worth your time. You'll say to them to prove it doesn't exist, they do the opposite, saying that you have to prove it does exist, leading to a neverending cycle. Just learn to ignore it like I did. Close minded people (note I'm not saying skeptics...) don't deserve that I waste my time proving something, so that in the end, with the ball on my side, they still remain stubborn and attached to their original beliefs.

			Most people are too focused on their own beliefs to accept new ones. If science ever does establish the fact that psi/psionics does exist it would most likely be rejected just as most new scientific theories are. I'm sure even with solid proof some people would deny its existence. Heck, people today still don't believe that Hitler brought genocide to Jews and that he held them concentration camps...so there is still a chance psi/psionics would not be openly accepted by society.

			Yamamaya: That doesnt make any sense. With the same logic i could tell you that i can fly, then you would say people cant fly prove that they can, then i would say prove that they cant. Beleiving something just because you cant prove it doesnt exist is stupid. You cant really &quot;prove&quot; something doesnt exist. And trust me if people beleived things just because other people told them to we would still have religious monarchy. Being a sceptic is a good thing.

			the unfortunate thing is that we have and maybe always will have a relgious monarchy. the bible is still the no 1. best seller in the world. there are political parties based upon religion and people vote them in. we are controlled by our beliefs.
<br />

<br />
no, i am not saying that sceptics are bad, and my pervious post was probibly a bit overboard there, i admit. but, to tell the honest truth, skeptisizm never got anyone anywhere in the world. people sneered at edison when he failed near 1000 times to make the lightbulb. said it will never work, and told him to give up. 
<br />

<br />
the truth is that people will never know and will fear what they don't know until they try it for themselves. and true, somtimes we are wrong, but there is no harm in trying and believing.
<br />

<br />
heck. religion is exactly the same. you believe something, you think it's real.
<br />

<br />
but, i am not religious so no offence guys.
