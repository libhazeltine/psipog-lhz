			I've been trying for God-know a month or two right now but still not an iota of success so far. I'm still having difficulties rolling a can. I'm quite persistent but to no avail. Is this natural? Or is it still the same old advice...practise and practise? Any help or guidance would be much appreciated. Thanks <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			You probably should start small with the psi-wheel.  Rolling things is a little advanced.  I just started moving to that.  No success yet, but i'm gettin shakes and wiggles from the pen i'm using.  The psi-wheel is incredebly easy to get to move.  I had it going after a week or so of practice.   Be patient, and yes practice, practice, practice.

			Agreed. Start with the wheel. Or you can stick with the can for another few months with small results <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> . Your choice.

			Why do people believe in advance skills? there isn't any proof that sliding an object is &quot;advance&quot; if it was true, I would be classified as advance user of psychokinesis, and I'm not, I've only been practicing for almost a year, and I started to slide objects.
<br />

<br />
So, which I'm saying is, Don't restrict yourself on ability and objects, Just because someone say it would take months to do or it's advance, I never did.

			Hello wyat,do not get upset if you can't roll a can because greater you get depressed,the lower is the chance of any achievement.So,don't get upset.Believe that the can will roll and be positive.I can say that after a week or so,you will get upset naturally.But getting sad and losing faith are the worst things that can happen to practising TK.If you have no faith,your sub-concious mind would not be in the right state.So,whatever you do,DO NOT get upset. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

Advanced is a point of view.  Just like the word &quot;evil&quot;. It is more advanced than the psiwheel because it is harder to move.  With the psiwheel, you are just spinning it around and around with a little friction.  With rolling and especially sliding, there is a lot more friction and other factors.  You are right when you say not to restrict yourself.  But from the way you posted, you make it seem that you could move a car if you have never done it before.  It is like, if you had never lifted weights before and you go for the 500 pound barbell, you will not lift it.  You will not ever lift it unless you start out smaller.

			Maybe it's a sense of frustration. I mean it's natural that people feel it cuz sometimes they just feel like the tonnes of effort that they put in doesn't compensate with the fruits of labours. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> 
<br />
In fact I read up on almost all the articles about rolling and stuff, it still doesn't work well yet.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> 
<br />
So, I'm beginning to wonder that something's amiss with the way I practise, like I wasn't focussing at the correct angle, etc...
<br />
Believe me, I always accentuate positive and keep a capacious mind. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Anyway, i agree with the people above. Except apollo. You're still exerting force on the weights, just not lifting it. your muscles will get stronger, you just won't get results. How about this... try moving something &lt;i&gt; heavier &lt;/i&gt; than a can for maybe 2-3 practice sessions, then move back and see if you get better results? That might just work.

			ok what i meant was.. at first make a goal.. lets say you want to roll a pencil...
<br />

<br />
think.. im going to roll this mo-fo right after i do __________ whatever it is you need to do to get your mind off of things. take a moment to relax whatever. when this is done return to your pencil (hopefully its already set up) and just do it without trying to think about it much.
