And as a last thought, wouldn't also be possible to create them in such a fashion that they could function independent of your life and survive by filter feeding energy?

			I don't  think they will be visible unless you are very good at flaring. To the other questions, I think that it is possible, but for now I think you should practice on make one pet for now if you already haven't. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> If you do decide to make one, I'd like to know about it.

			I have a swarm of constructs, though they're not intelligent.  I suppose if I really wanted to I could give them intelligence.
<br />
In case you're wondering how many I have, I lost count.  I programmed them to self-replicate so I wouldn't have to concentrate on every one of them.  And then some of them died so the numbers are all screwed up now.

Basically, you give it a shape, like an animal or something, and program it with certain qualities, and jobs. Make sure you shell though, or it will dissolve into the air. You can also just have a pet for fun, or a little psi companion. I believe that after time they will start to develope their own little personality, but make sure they know who's boss.

			haha! &quot;Havn't the foggiest (for psi_manipulator_3000)&quot;. You know me too well.
<br />
It could be useful to have an army of constructs. But I would personally call them a group of constructs. I would have one to heal me,  one to give me some extra energy for sport and the likes, one to tell me if someone is lying to me (very handy). Bunches of them. The only problem is that they are hard to keep track of. If I could have only one, I would make it able to do everything and give it it's own personality and communication means(telepathy and stuff). coooooooool. You know what they say...&quot; A psipet is a man's best friend.&quot;  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

<br />
yes, but only if the person is capable of doing this in the first place.  with constructs, you are limited to what you can do:  if you can filter feed energy yourself, then you can program constructs to.
<br />

<br />
also, constructs don't have a big longevity.  by the time you are done programing your constructs, you would have to go back and replenish their energy.  now, if you don't run into either of these problems, it is still a very tedious task that will take a lot of time to accomplish.  and after using all that energy on the first 'n' constructs, you won't make the constructs as strong anymore, and their strength will decrease exponentially.
<br />

<br />
but don't let all this daunt you, you may find a way around it  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

However, the only 1 thing I can think an army would do is simply run around and confuse somebody. That can also be done by a pet though <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> .
