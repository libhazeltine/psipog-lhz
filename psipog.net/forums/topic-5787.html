			Hey,
<br />

<br />
I'm new to Psi, I'm not a skeptic, and I've believed in Psi abilities since I was a little kid. I've been trying to create a psiball for the past 3 days, but no such luck yet.
<br />

<br />
When I think I feel the heat in my hands from one, I realize it's just the heat from my hands.
<br />

<br />
So I want to know your first time stories, how long you tried, if you were skeptical, what you did that finally eventually lead to your first psiball.
<br />

<br />
I figure if I can tell how people felt about their first experience, then maybe I can put myself in their place, visualize what they may have been feeling, and get some good vibes that way.
<br />

<br />
Cheers,
<br />
Harber

			Well, first time I made one I was around 10. It was by curiosity and I tried to make one. Took a few minutes to form it my first time.
<br />
I think I was frighten of my first experience, I mean, I don't remember much of what happen but I think I got scared of something then stopped for 5 years not thinking I was ready.

I've never been a skeptic, I have always beleaived in this for many years,   can't really remember my first experince, but I do remember creating a psi-ball and feeling the energy floating in beetween my hands, I remember asking my mate to put his hand in beetween it, and he said he could feel presure..
<br />

<br />
I have had many other experinces with PSI, and Telekneisis 
<br />
&quot;forgive my spelling on this lmao&quot;  but thats another matter..
