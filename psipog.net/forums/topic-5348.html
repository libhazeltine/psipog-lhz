			This idea has come up a few times, but it never really took off. Nobody wanted to make shirts or take the extra time to run a store that wouldn't sell very much.

			It's a reasonable idea, however there are some drawbacks:
<br />

<br />
1) Would you really want to walk around advertising the fact you are a psion?  If people found out you really thought you were one, nobody would ever treat you seriously again.
<br />

<br />
2) Maybe this is just me, but nobody would take Psipog seriously either if it started producing 'tourist tat'.  If something is good enough, it doesn't need advertising.  I think the sheer number of members proves that point as Psipog doesn't advertise as far as I am aware.

			That would be a pretty cool idea, I want to make a t-shirt that has the symbol on it, a big red one. Not sure if I should put psipog on it though.

			Ya I have to go with Pecker. If we walk around with shirts that say PsiPog and/or have some funky symbol, people might misunderstand and take it to be an occult.
<br />

<br />
I wouldn't want to broadcast the fact that I'm a psion either. There may be very powerful people walking around that maybe recruit psions for evil purposes or something. I guess basically what I'm trying to say is I wouldn't want the wrong people to find out what I can do.

			Yeah, I sort of pitched this idea to Peebrain a long time ago. I still plan on making a shirt, with the psi symbol on it. Partly cause I'd like to see if anyone recognizes it. And partly cause I want to have an excuse to play with fabric paints... If Psipog was ever to have &quot;merchandise&quot;, it would have to be done <span style="font-style: italic">just so</span>. If it's not handled a certain way it will come off as kinda tacky. But I'm thinking it could work if we keep subtlety in mind.

			Ya going commercial is something I really don't think PsiPog should do. It will lose credibility.

			I have about 2 packages of iron on paper for designing tee shirts. If anyone wants a T-Shirt, IM,  PM or Email me. All my info is at the bottom.
<br />

<br />
Just tell me, the shirt size, what you want, and how big you want it. Basically, design the shirt, and give me the info.
