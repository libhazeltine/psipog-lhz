			I have a close friend and during the past few months we have noticed some subtle weirdness (not sure what to call it!) 
<br />
For example, I am singing a tune in my head (which I often do) and he will start whistling that song.
<br />
Or he will say something that I was just about to say (or vice versa) 
<br />

<br />
I know these are only small things but in one day together it happens many times.
<br />

<br />
The funny thing is, when we actually tried to guess the object the other was thinking about, we failed miserably  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Is this telepathy, coincidence or the fact that we know each other so well?

			All are possible situations. 
<br />

<br />
What I suggest may be happening, is unconscious telepathy when you're just 'hanging out' together, being 'yourselves'. - Then when it came to actually 'trying', you closed up and 'tried' rather than 'did'?
<br />
This seems to be a big problem people face when trying to learn perceptive skills.
<br />

<br />
Or maybe like you said, you just know each other very well. The only to find out is practice, I guess!

			My friends and I are aware of the telepathic links we share. We just don't often speak of it (though we do). What you and your friend have is probably the same thing my group and I do. Recognizing that there's more to it than just a funny coincidence is the key to being able to practice it. Most of my friends are reluctant to speak of all the &quot;psychic&quot; possibilities out there, unless it's in regard to some research or some such. I'm a bit more interested than they are, however.

			I'm a terribly uncoordinated person when I'm trying to throw something.  Just over a month ago, I was with some friends up at a cabin, and there was several feet of snow still around.  I sat with my girlfriend and chatted, exhausted, and tried to throw snowballs at a tree.  In trying, I couldn't hit it at all.  My snowballs kept going to the left or the right.
<br />

<br />
When I stopped trying, relaxed, and didn't even pay attention to the snowballs I was throwing, I realized I was hitting every one dead center.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps telepathy is the same sort of thing.  Your subconscious is really good at it, but when your consciousness tries to take the reins and do it intentionally, it fails miserably.  Of course, there are still ways to make it happen.  You just have to &quot;ask&quot; your subconscious to do it for you.
<br />

<br />
Or at least that's what I gather.  My own moments of accidental telepathy have been enlightening, but trying to make them happen has never brought me any closer to recreating it.
