			Here's my story: I used to practice PK alot...i think...(actually looking back I can't exactly remember how much i preacticed, but I know I was OK at moving psiwheels, nothing else) and now, about a few months later i tried to do PK again. It really is like people say, if you don do it for a long time, you really start to wear down, the same way how a persons muscles can become &quot;out of shape&quot;. I try moving the psiwheel. No luck. None at all. 
<br />

<br />
Now I have been practicing for a little over a week now for 15-20 minutes a day with little to no success. Any tips from anybody? Tips on things I should change? ways to &quot;stick with PK&quot;, so you dont get board and simply stop doing it like i did? sooooo yeah, tips would be great.

Even if it's not much, you should try to do it regularly.

			There isn't a special way. I mean, you've experinced it, you know what it's like. Or should know. So why ask such a silly question?
<br />

<br />
Just keep praciticing psi manipulation and PK.

O also, i think i may have found what really helps...2 words &quot;aluminim foil&quot;. seriously, this stuff is SO much more effective then paper. Easier at any rate. I was just practicing tonite, I gotthe psiwheel to spin, like, 35 times. I could even move it at a distance without my hands, although it wouldnt go as fast.  I hope I can keep doing that. =D

True but the tin foil also takes less skill to use, I only use it when I need an ego boost cause it's really easy to move.

			DON'T use the foil, if you want to improve on pk you have to challange yourself in moving always bigger things. Like i read in the N_I article on Pk, you will never have the full controll of the psywhell if you can't move pencills, go figure yourself if you start praticing with the foil <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
