			<a href="http://www.kinow.com/" target="_blank">http://www.kinow.com/</a>  This is an Aikido website, there. As to your persistent skepticism of ki, tell me this: do you beleive psi exists? If so, then why not keep an open mind about ki? I know what i experienced was real, my friend can vouch for that. I know what I've seen in my dreams. It is possible to project ki outside of your body. They tell you its possible to project psi out of your body on this very site! I did it, my friend felt it, and i'm a believer. Oh, and you notice how they refer to ki as the breath sometimes? Well, if you'll look in the Holy Bible, it says that God breathed the breath of life into Adam. The breath of life!!! It's ki said differently!!! God gave us each a small amount of ki when we were born, and left it up to us how to use it. Look at my quote &quot;God gives the spirit without limit.&quot; There is no limit to what we can do with our own energy! God said so. So, if we can do whatever we want with it, that pretty much includes projecting it outside our bodies as well. No offence to true psi beleivers, but I think psi is energy that we want to be psychic, it still stems from ki. Ki can be made to do anything, and manipulated, so it can be manipulated to be psychic energy as well. Thats why we get the pyrokinetics and the cryokinetics on here. Its whatever we want our ki to be! Don't have me keep listing styles on here that teach ki, do some research into it, you might become less skeptical. Learn what you can, and apply yourself to it, and truly believe that your power is limitless because God grants us this, and become someone that can project ki themselves! Do this, and you will do fine. Harness that energy, its yours. TAKE IT!!!

			i can show you how its done, yes. but, and im sorry if it wasn't said in my experience, but my reaction was one out of fear, not just the execution of a technique. see, we both meditated before we sparred, in order to, how you say, simulate a life and death situation. It was like i was in this zone, where i reacted on an instinct, an impulse sent to my brain that reacted with my chi from training, and therefore i willed it out of my body. I had created in my mind that i was scared so bad of his attack that i would do whatever it took to stop him, and i did. So, if you wanna train on this, you should clear your mind, then envision that your 'opponent' is out to do some harm to you, that you have to seriously stop him. Didn't i mention i grounded just before he did his flying side kick? Well, grounding is a technique that enables you to take in a whole bunch of energy at one time. I grounded to the earth, and took in energy from the air as well. This gave me the boost i needed to knock him out of the air. Yes the website doesn't talk about ki attacks, becuase it is not a common thing right now. Yes its possible, but we that do believe and have experience to back it up are working on it and trying to make it more tangible. So, if your still skeptical, wait... just wait... one day.

			MY guess:
<br />

<br />
You felt that you were, instinctually, considering there was a guy with loads of ki energy flying at you at an ungodly speed, threatened. Your subconscious snapped like it does sometimes (chaos magicians call this gnosis) and your psychic filter was blown out, allowing you to perform a massive PK feat.

			To Eldibs, umm, what exactly do you mean by fluffy? I am sorry, but i don't understand what you are trying to say. And no, its not a joke, this is real, not some game. I joined this website for support, not to be hounded for my experiences. I look down upon anyone who doubts the abilities that we are all born with. Everyone on this planet is capable of incredible feats, you just have to truly believe in yourself, and always keep an open mind to what you want to achieve. Here's a short story: my brother is an excellent baseball player. I know, this has nothing to do with my topic, right? Wrong. However, i know my brother is good enough to be playing in the major leagues, but he isn't because no one ever believed he could make it. And because everyone always doubted him and his abilities, he doubted himself as well. He still is the greatest ball player i know, and he knows that he could have made it if only he had an ounce of support. Never doubt the abilities of anyone, cause it might affect their lives forever, and maybe yours. Would you doubt a strange man in your home if he threatened to kill you? Would you say &quot;Psh, your not going to kill anyone.&quot; I wouldn't. I wouldn't doubt him for a second, cause he might really be willing to take your life. The kids that get picked on at school are the ones who could come to school the next day with a gun and start shooting people. How would you feel then, after having doubted them for so long? And now they've killed your best friends...

No, I'd blow him off the front porch with one of the many guns around the house before he could get to the door. Nobody comes to my house and threatens me or my family, and nobody just walks into my house, they meet someone at the door. The last time somebody just walked into my house, they got bit in the crotch by a Sharpae.

There's a difference between doubting and &quot;picking on.&quot; I pick on my little brother (and he returns the favor). I doubt that my friends could beat me at running track.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a wookie, from the planet Kashyyyk. But Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now, think about it. That does not make sense.

<br />
From the way you talk, I'd say you didn't doubt him. Why didn't you support him and try to get him to play baseball in school? If he totally stomped everyone at baseball in school, certainly they wouldn't doubt him any further.

			Oh sorry for the misunderstanding. About the &quot;psychic filter&quot;, yea thats the first time i had ever heard of that before too. As to blowing a man off your porch with one of your many guns, I'm glad there's someone else with sense around here, lol. As to kids getting picked on, yea there is a difference between doubting and picking on in a sense. Still, for some kids, getting picked on is very detremental to their self esteem, which triggers in their minds that people doubt them. As to why i didn't support my brother when he played ball in school, here's the reason: i was like 3 or 4 years old when he was in high school. So, a 3 or 4 year old doesn't have too much say in a lot of affairs, lol. The other thing about my brother, yea, his friends really respected him when it came to baseball, but he watched his teammates giving up as well. I remember him telling me about them making the state champs game, and when they got their, the whole team just pretty much screwed around because they had all lost interest, and i believe my brother felt that it wasn't worth trying anymore.

1. how do you know that. maybe they have, but as scientists haven't proven it real they haven't bothered documenting it, <span style="font-weight: bold">especially</span> over the internet.
<br />
2.because so many scientists have gone out of their way to find these people. either way, what good would it do if you could move stuff around. its not like it helps prevent the greenhouse effect or actually does anything to help the world.
<br />

<br />
i do beleive in it all, i just think that this banter is uneccesary, and everyone on this site should be fully aware that practitioning super/unnateral things like ki chi and psi is more of a hobby than something to prove the world and science wrong.
<br />

<br />
just my two cents. either way, keep an open mind thanatos.

fiar play, yes mostly universities have/do the research, but what about elsewhere .i.e governent. i swesr i heard something about the superpowers all  doing research into psychic operatives (hence the idea for the game psi ops aswell)...or is that unrelated &gt;_&lt;

			Thats not the point, if it was studied only in a goverment agency it would mean that it requires so much effort and facilities to document anything like that. And from what i hear, people pushing other people a few feet away without moving sounds like a pretty easy thing to &quot;document&quot;.

			Im not looking at it through the internet, look, you dont see scientists arguing wether or not the earth is round are they? Scientific research is published in many places quite quickly. And on the internet too, unless there is a reason it should be kept a secret, but if it was a secret, they wouldnt supposly practise it freely in china would they?
