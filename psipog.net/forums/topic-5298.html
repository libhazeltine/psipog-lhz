			Hi everyone that past few years has been a trip, i've been trying to open up my third eye with some strange results, and trying to astral project while i do this aswell. At first it was very difficult to get out, then it started becoming easier and i started to feel the vibrations. Then i was able to open my eyes sometimes, i saw something once but that was it. Then it got to the point were i started to fall out of my body (it felt like i was falling really high) and then i couldn't feel my body anymore. But this was only beneficial to me a little bit. What also troubles me is it's hard for me to relax or to go into trance mode, does anyone have any ideas? I tried the rope method, and even pretending that there a white light around my body, bring it up to your heard, and pretend that your conciousness is leaving through the top. So right now i'm out of luck, and i'm getting a little frustrated and i don't want to buy another apping book if it's not going to work. So if anyone could help that would be great, thanks:)

			I've been working on astral projection for about a month now and i've came across quite a few ways that really help relax your body. Though the first thing you need to keep in mind, something i've discovered for experiance, is that sometimes your body will not relax. It just refuses to (well i guess if you layed around for like three hours it probably would, but where's the fun in that?).
<br />

<br />
Here's a few little tips I've picked up over my practices.
<br />

<br />
1. Before you even start trying to relax make sure your body is in the most comfortable position possible. I really dont think there's a universal &quot;OBE position&quot;, nor logically -should- there be one. Whatever makes you comfortable will work. This takes me awhile sometimes but save me from alot of fustration.
<br />

<br />
2. I picked this one up from one of the articles here on psipog (cant remember which one right now, though.) Basically you pick a number and start counting backwards, all the while imagining your body becoming more relaxed. You might have to loop the numbers a few times, but at least this gives you something to do, right? ;D
<br />

<br />
3. I can't remember exactly where I read about this one, though I would like to give credit to whoever came up with this (if anyone knows it would be appreciated). You pick a song and &quot;play&quot; it in your mind. It's good to pick a simple song that disnt take too much consicenceness to orcestrate(sp). I'd suggest the &quot;Song that never ends&quot; song (i know its a kid song, but it loops constantly and is very simple.)
<br />

<br />
4. And as you already know, visualization. But the trick is finding a visualization that works for you. Honestly, whenever I try to use someone else's visualization, it seldom works. Every person is different and we all have our own preferences.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Well, that's all know. Hope it helps you out.

			thanks for the help echo, but sadly i can't really ap right now. I'm on both zoloft, clonapan(sp), and geodon, so i highly doubt these medecines are going to help me get out. I was thinking about a teacher, because i tried to open up my third eye, and all i got out of it were strange hallucinations. Now i'm screwed, either that or i was thinking of joining the buddhists, maybe just maybe they can help me with the answers that i need.

			You said it was hard to go into trance mode
<br />

<br />
Theres an .mp3 at <a href="http://www.WarpMyMind.com" target="_blank">www.WarpMyMind.com</a> that helps you go into trance. First the guy's voice helps you relax, then trances you out, and then installs triggers to bring yourself in and out of the trance instantly.  A remote hypnosis type thing, but I havent tried it, the site kinda freaks me out.
<br />

<br />
If you want, I can just email you the mp3.
