			ok well earlier today (like an hour ago) i tryed to talk to my subconsious for the first time.. well first i asked it what i should draw.. he said or showed sasuke.. than i asked why.. he showed me a picture of sasuke being happy and energentic. and i did it.. so a bit earlier i tried comunicating with it.. but i couldnt do it.. i heard talking but it wasnt the same tone of voice so im thinking &quot;im forcing the thoughts&quot; and than i asked if i really had talked to it before and i heard &quot;of coarse&quot; in the actual voice.. it happened suddenly and i didnt even think about it.. even now its tryiung to say that it did..

			Well, a good way to tell: ask it something you forgot. Like where you left something or the name someone you forgot (but remember how they looks like). Sub-conscious never forget things. If it give the right answer (when we hear something we forgot, we instantly remember of it if it is relevant), then ask him something you really have no way to know. But don't ask nothing stupid (like what will be the numbers for lotery, you will never get the answer). If it gives the answer that looks right or you can check, then is not really your sub-conscient, but very likely a guide.

Its nice to know my art is being liked.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

In my opinion, the sub-c wouldnt talk at all. To me the sub-c I think the sub-c is infact the backgrounds of your thoughts and emotions, and memories. When you try to commicate with you sub-c. Your just trying to talk to yourself. Just think about your own thoughts and become aware of your actions on a different level.
<br />

<br />
When I read about your story, it told me that you were asking yourself what would be nice to draw. Your memory and emotions and a little unaware intelligence must have brought togather that image. But your most likely thinking right now that why did it just pop up all of a sudden? Well the thing about ours thoughts in our brain is that when it jumps around the nerves and such. Well its not always in our awareness.
