			I had a couple of questions, and I don't want to get into the details of them because if I do this post could get locked, so I just want general answers here, maybe even Peebrain will respond and answer my question once and for all.
<br />

<br />
So my question is simply this... Why doesn't Peebrain want us to talk about psionic combat?
<br />

<br />
And my other question is this: Since I can't learn about it from here, could someone tell me of a reliable site where I can learn how to defend myself with psi?
<br />

<br />
Sorry if I pissed off a moderator, I just want to know.

			They do not want to talk about combat, because it could be dangerous.
<br />
However there are safer ways of practicing combat, it's called sparring:
<br />
Damaging the shields of other people.
<br />

<br />
You can check out my site, I do cover it, but it has to be practiced safely.

			Thanks, Gonzo. I am asking about psi combat not because I wanna be the next Goku or anything stupid like that, but because the way I live, I'm sometimes one wrong word away from a fight, although I've had the priviledge of being able to live for 17 years without getting into a serious fight or even having to strike someone for real. But I've gotten really close a few times, and although I may be a big guy comparably, I'm not especially strong, and I wish to be able to defend myself and others should I one day be forced to confront someone. Preferrably in a non-lethal way, but my philosophy is that you shouldn't get into a fight unless you have no other choice but to to kill the other person; gives you fewer reasons to get into one in the first place.

			It takes loads of practice to be able to do something with psi combat in real life.
<br />
If you have much fights I suggest learn boxing or start working out.

			Psipog does not cater to psionic combat because it attracts the wrong element.  We don't want people coming to psipog to learn about combat; we want them to come to psipog to learn about self-awareness and their mental potential.  Learning to make a psi-nuclear-ball-of-fucking-death is, for most intents and purposes, childish.  However, psipog does recognize the fact that combat does happen, and therefore we cover some methods of defense, such as shielding.
<br />

<br />
If you are a big guy, but don't feel like you're strong enough for a fight, there are a variety of options at your disposal that do not require nearly as much time, energy, and focus that learning combat does.  Take a karate class, or study aggression-resolution tactics.

			You know how some people can be, they just watched another episode of Dragonball Z, and they want to learn how to fire lasers from their hands and the such. If they were to actually learn the ways of psionic combat, they would only end up harming someone, or more likely, themselves. As said before, there is a chance you may encounter someone that wants to battle you, so that's where shields come in. The only real advantage of psionic comat, that I can think of, would be getting rid of any sort of negative entities that may seek you out or whatnot.

			I sometimes wonder If what I said would harm someone else mentaly. I tend to put a lot of energy in my shields (Or lest I think I am). But even I agree with battle when given no other choice..

			Ah, I get it, Roy. That makes perfect sense, thanks.
<br />
Combat's not something that I'm particularly interested in engaging in, but I feel like it's a good thing to know, that's the only reason I asked in the first place. Thanks for all of the comments, everyone, they've been real enlightening.
<br />
Got a few random quotes I either heard or made up, decided to throw em in just for kicks, since my signature was getting a bit crowded.
<br />

<br />
-Let your words always be better than your silence; else stay silent. -Some ancient Greek dude whose name I can't pronouce.
<br />

<br />
-Battle is something that every young boy wishes for, but every grown man fears. Once you know the true terror not of being in danger yourself but of shedding another man's blood, you are faced with one of two choices; despise war for all that it is, or lose yourself in an endless pit of insatiable bloodlust. - Me.
<br />

<br />
-People die in wars every day, more oft than not in the quietest and most unremarkable of circumstances. A silent thrust of a sword or the gentle whistling of an arrow can extinguish a life quickly and finally, allowing for neither drama nor profound words before their final breath escapes their lungs. So what makes the death of a solider so remarkable, so touching that even the most calloused of souls quakes with the repercussions thereof? No, it is not the manner of their death. Rather, it is the way in which they walked while they yet lived, the good they accomplished within the living world that gives such tremendous power to their deaths. It is who they are and what they have done, the person they have made of themselves, that holds the power, and when that power is released from its mortal coil, it rocks the foundations of the world. -Me, from my incomplete novel, <span style="font-style: italic">The Dragon War of Aion.</span> Yes, it needs a new title.

			Your right is does need a new titile, I like to put a few quotes down myself to counter it. ....why?...don't know really.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Its better to let people think your a fool instead of opening your mouth to prove it.&quot; Some guy/girl
<br />

<br />
&quot;A solider already either win or lose before entering the battlefield&quot; Me
<br />

<br />
But I guess your quotes are better.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Psionic combat isn't practical, but it's really nice energy manipulation practice in controlled enviroments(sparring).

Regarding the combat thing, sparring is fun. Also, telepathy is the best thing in a real, physical fight because you could cloud their mind or distract them and give yourself an advantage in a fight. Then you could flee or beat them to death, depending on your mood. But that goes against the rules, probably, so *shhhhhhh* I said nothing. Oh yeah, and psionline is a good site for psionic defense, but that's for psionic fights. I used to take karate, you'll get even more out of it than just self-defense techniques.
