			Is this possible? I ask because I think it was done to me last night. I was at youth group and my leader asid he wanted to try something out on me. I said ok. He told me to hold my arm out and push up. he pushed it down with some trouble. He then rubbed his hands(?) and hovered them 2 inches off my body and he went from my stomach to the ground. he then just touched my arm and it fell down with little resistance. I could feel he was screwing with my energy levels some how so i set up a shield and asked him to do it again. he looked funny at me and did the same thing only instead of running his hands down he poked my lightly in my somach. it felt.... bad but not in a painful way. well getting back I couldnt feel my sheild any more let alone the majority of my energy. and of corse he just pushed my arm down. I asked him about it and he said he messed with my &quot;energy field&quot; and tried to change subjects. so I was like ok whatever.... I will pursue this later.  I feel better now having a night and a nap's rest.

			Yes, shields can be destroyed.  People do it on a regular basis when they want to put up a new shield or clean their field (usually, some folks can clean their field without taking down their shields, I think).  People usually call it &quot;taking down their shields&quot;, and it's quite different from destroying someone elses shield, hehe.  It's quite possbile that your shield &quot;fell&quot; because of you stopped focusing on it.  Don't forget to program it to &quot;stay up&quot; on it's own <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
And another thing, breaking someone elses shield would be considered combat, and combat discussion is not allowed at psipog, as others have noted.  I'd suggest asking the person that was &quot;messing with your energy field&quot; to not do so, next time.
