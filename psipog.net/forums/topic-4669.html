			Hey, I'm new to the forums.  Before I got locked up a while back, I began to experiment with TK...without many results.
<br />

<br />
Upon return however, I started up again, attempting to bend spoons, and move objects.  I have experienced the most success in Psi Wheels, but am sometimes disapointed by my strange progress.
<br />

<br />
The other day, I was attempting to bend a spoon using TK, and I actually felt the energy being used for the first time, I felt the tingling you get when your &quot;connected&quot; to an object like a psi wheel, the tingle on your finger or hand or w/e.  I didn't get any further than that though, and just was unable to bend the spoon.  Luckily, this didn't discorage me, it sent me back to practicing with a psi wheel.
<br />

<br />
The other morning, I was finally able to effect a medium sized psi wheel.  The more I felt that I could do it, and the better the mood I was in, the easier it became.  Even stranger was that when I showed my little sister, it seemed to be EASIER...I would have thought it would break my concentration.  I made sure not to let breathing/fans/etc influence the movemtn of the psi wheel. 
<br />

<br />
When I was confident in my ability, I placed a large glass bowl over the wheel and attempted it that way with no success, so ever since I've been just doing it on my small or medium sized wheel w/o any cover because it seems MUCH easier.
<br />

<br />
I have a few questions though, and I appolgozie in advance if theyre listed elsewhere on the site, I don't have that much time to troll really.
<br />

<br />
Does your mood matter? (that morning after accomplishing it once, I was happy, and seemed to make it easier.)
<br />

<br />
Does your physical state matter Ie: being tired (the other morning I was on an all nighter, and seemed to do it better.) 
<br />

<br />
How can you tell? Sometimes, the psi wheel moves by itself (when there are no fans on or anything) I know this is just air circulating.  When I actually get my hands working in position, half the time it seems to go the way I want it to, and do as I mentally instruct it to, then half the time it doesnt, but I do seem to notice some kind of influence.
<br />

<br />
Sorry if I'm not more clear, but its hard to explain these kind of things.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for all help.

			Sorry if it seems as if I'm double posting, but I thought this added question deserved at least it's own post rather then an edit.
<br />

<br />
When using a psi wheel, and I'm in full control (the feeling when its as if there are strings attached to your finger [you see, i dont keep my hands completely motionless as many do when doing tk, I find it helps me concentrate having an existent visual aid] ) I can move the psi wheel back and forth without a full rotation...like I'm pulling it with the &quot;string&quot;.  I try to &quot;yank&quot; the &quot;string&quot; away quickly, in an attempt to pull the wheel off the base...but it never seems to work.
<br />

<br />
Who has pointers on taking the wheel off of the pin/base?

			I was wondering the same thing about fatigue, not from neccesarily doing Psi, but if you are fatigued merely from living out your life, will it effect your Psionics?

			I was thinking about it--and I guess the answer theoretically should be yes?  I mean its all based off of energy, thus if you are fatigued, you have less energy to give...that is unless your using energy from an outside source.
