			if she has a &quot;psycho&quot; boyfriend then just wait for them to break up then after that wait a least a month or for another guy to date her. Then go for it. Whatever you do don't be the friend guy in that time just because it gives you a very slim chance of her seeing you as a boyfriend ever.

			I'd say to do this:
<br />

<br />
   Sit back and relax for a little while. Then, think about the girl as much as you can. Think about how she looks, how her voice sounds, everything. Then let your energy flow out to the person. Put a lot of energy into the link. A lot. Now send her an image of you. Or try to. At the very least, try to make her think of you. Then, send the concept of calling you.   
<br />

<br />
 .... are you experienced in telepathy?  if you're a telepath, then you probably know what I'm talking about. If not, then I can't really explain sigs and sending conceptual feelings very well.

			thanks for the dating tips...and Fakiti for the telepathy ideas...i understand them and ill try it...also...she stares at me (seriously..im not showing off) and wants to talk to me and get to know me better (said so herself) and she actually seems genuienly interested in me and my thoughts (for example she said to her freinds that she wants to smoke pot, but when she asked me if i did, and i said no, she called her freinds stupid for smoking pot and also said she didnt want to)...so im not trying to cheat, i thnik if i stayed there long enough it might work out...its just we've finished school forever...and im not sure ill see here any more (especially with her psycho boyfreind) so was thinking it would be nice to keep in touch... and i swear her boyfrineds really psycho and wants to kill any guy that talks to her....i think he might hurt her if he sees that she wants to talk to me....well at least that will give me a good reason to kick his ass i swear he just wants sex

Don't use suggestion for this type of thing.  It's morally wrong, and I know someone already said this, I just wanted to emphasize.  
<br />

<br />
If she is genuinely interested in you, then it will happen.  That simple.  If she is as in to you as you say, then you have nothing to worry about, just wait for them to break up. 
<br />

<br />
But seriously, think logically for a second.  You say her boyfriend is psycho...ok.  But she obviously is still with him, so maybe she doesn't think he is psycho.  And if she is still with him, maybe she feels something for him.  I had a friend who had a very psycho boyfriend, he didn't like it when I talked to her.  I never understood it until me and my present GF started dating.  All my other girlfriends didn't last very long, most cheated on me.  I have been dating my girlfriend for two years now, and she has never cheated on me.  I treat her like the precious diamond she is, and if that means giving all the guys who look at her the &quot;death stare,&quot; then so be it.  I love her, and I don't want to lose her.  Maybe this psycho boyfriend is in the same position.  Try thinking about his position for a second.  
<br />

<br />
Also, if you dated her a month after they broke up, that isn't going to make things better.  The psycho boyfriend will still be pissed at the sight of his ex dating someone -anyone- and will still probably start a fight and harass whoever is dating her.  Ask yourself, is this something you are willing to deal with?  Is she that important?  I know that I hate it when guys stare at my GF, so how exactly do you think I would feel if we broke up and I saw someone dating her?  Besides, you are 17.  You still have more than three times of your life left.  Are you sure this is love, or is it puppy love?  I mean, there is still a lot of time in your life left, and a lot of other girls as well.  I thought I was in love many times when I was in highschool.  Then I experienced what I am now and realized I was wrong.  
<br />

<br />
Now that the negatives are down, let's look at some good things  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
If it is meant to be, then it would happen.  Don't worry about it.  If what you feel is love, and she feels the same, then the break up is just around the corner, and you will have your juliette in your arms.  So try not to worry about it too much.  Sined is right though, once you become a friend, generally that's all you will be.  This isn't always true, but for the most part it is.  So, just lay back, relax, read a good book, and be there for the break up.  Make sure you are more than just a rebound though.
<br />

<br />
And above all:  NO TPS!

			Nightshade's answer was too long to read so, sorry if he said this. But hasn't it occurred to you that SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND! If she liked you more than him don't you think she'd dump him for you? She obviously likes him more seeing as he's <span style="font-weight: bold">boy</span>friend, and you're friend. Not trying to burst your bubble, I'm just saying. If she wants you, she'll let you know. *Don't get lead on with false hope.

			Give him a break, Derrick. I know where he's coming from. I agree with those who advocate patience. It's not a good idea to knowingly go to lengths to break up a relationship. If you want to date her, get to know her (and more importantly, let her get to know you). Just don't get too close, otherwise she'll be likely to bust out the &quot;we're such good friends&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
If you're close, but not <span style="font-style: italic">too</span> close, then you should be alright.

			dont use psychic powers to pull chicks...
<br />

<br />

<br />
Instead use NLP based seduction techniques and a lucrative supportive online  community of seductionists.  
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.fastseduction.com/" target="_blank">http://www.fastseduction.com/</a>
<br />

<br />
Remember, regardless of how skilled you are at a skill one must remember the limits of the skills themselves. This helps you get them and deal with all the bullshit. But lacks in information on keeping a constructive relationship and such is all up to you.
<br />

<br />
Read the basics and post your questions there minus the psychic babbel and they'll get you on your way.
<br />

<br />
These guys at psipog deal with psychic powers, not females. You dont get a rocket scientis to fix your sink.
<br />

<br />
The advice that the people here are giving you is just average and even some of it AFCish (Average Frustrated Chump). If you want a REAL answer that will help you dela with the jealous boyfriend and such go there.
<br />

<br />
Furthermore I wont tell you not to use telepathy because its morally wrong. It's just some kn3wb copout I'm such a loser i cant even get a girl without using super powers shit. I'd be embarrased if I ever did something like that.  I'd rather just not have the girl than use tp on her.
