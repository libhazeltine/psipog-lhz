			Unless you can observe the same qualia between two people (aka, cold for both of you) the psi is probably wrongly done. You can manipulate your mind into feeling whatever you want and if you feel cold and other people feel warmth, they are just feeling your body heat and you're tricking yourself. The double cold test is the best proof.

			Increased bloodflow would cause twicthing because the pressure is making your arm jolt. Quite simple to understand I think. Imagine it as a firehose Niushirra; the more water you pump through it and at higher pressure, the more it flings around. That's why I think I'm raising my blood pressure.

As for evidence, all I can really think of is to actually show you in person or get a test. To put it simply though, I can feel it flowing faster. It makes me very jolty and manic sometimes. It also feels rather nice.

If you want visual evidence, I suggest you go research it yourself. I don't want evidence, you do. Or you can try it yourself.

There's no relation between lots of blood flow and higher muscle activity. What you're experiencing is a tricking of yourself. You think this should happen so subconsciously you start twitching. It dosen't matter if it makes sense your way. The body isn't wired for that.

			Actually Niushirra, I didn't expect that. I did it before I knew what it was, it was completely alien to me. I only realised what it was after doing it for some time. Also, if high blood pressure makes your blood vessels pop, then half of my friends and relatives should be dead right now. In other words, I don't go to extreme heights with it, for obvious reasons.
<br />

I am definetely not imagining this, and you can't just assume that I am because it doesn't quite fit with your arguement.

			2 things, theorist, you must use proper english. Psi man, you are definitely not increasing your blood pressure with psi. You could be just making yourself produce more adrenallin but the main point is, twitching is not caused ever by high blood pressure. Your sub. is tricking you.

Well, Theorist, here's my THEORY: You apparently can't be taught how to be observant. Had you been observant enough to read the key points of my previous posts (this excludes the first one) you would have noticed that my dilemma spawns from the paradox of blood and psi feeling the same which I don't think is what has been happening to me. And since<span style="font-weight: bold"> I</span> know for a fact that what I normally feel must be psi due to it's curative properties I therefore know that it was most likely psi that I was feeling. I guess my major error was titling this post wrong. I should have called it &quot;Can increased blood pressure cause one to feel psi without any conscious manipulation?&quot;. I think that would made my point of view easier to understand. I apologize to those concerned for the confusion (if there was any). As I said before, Psi Manipulator3000's theory on a blood-psi relationship satisfies my curiosity as to a possible explanation.

He apparently isn't the only one with this theory. If you doubt his credibility why don't you just PM Yamamaya about it? He started a big thread about it months ago. He seems like the expert on the phenomenon.
<br />
Anyway, unless someone says something stupid on my thread and I have to correct them, I doubt I will be posting here again. Like I said earlier, &quot;case closed&quot;.
