			This is one of the coolest non lucid dreams I've ever had:
<br />
I was sitting in a yellow buss loaded with all sorts of people, most of them were guys except one little girl standing next to the driver. 
<br />
The cool thing was that I could see through all of the passangers eyes, I could think  and controll the actions for every single one of them at the same time.
<br />
I remember how I drived through this really weird forest and ended up on top of a big mountain full of snow. 
<br />
The buss stared to glide down some snowboard track, we were sliding towards a really big jump with a long gap comming after. The little girl (I) shouted &quot;Step on it!&quot; to the driver while the others (me) just chilled. There we were, heading towards a big jump at full speed when my view of perspective suddenly changed, I was now a basball player at the end of the gap, while being filmed I started to kick on a brick wall that was standing in the snow, I could now see the buss flying in the air from the baseball players view ( I was still controlling the people in the buss).
<br />
 The buss landed safe at the end of the gap, next to the baseball player and then I woke up.

			I had another last night. It involved the conversion of most of humanity into zombies including me. I was trying to help the remaining humans survive, but they thought I was attacking them. My best friend (also a zombie) started attacking me for being a traitor to my people. Then I woke up.

			my strangest/scariest dream was when i thought i was sam neil from jurassic park 3, and we were running from velociraptors, i woke up just as one jumped on my back, i woke up breathing like i was hyperventilating and my arms had locked their positions and my back hurt, it was very odd indeed.
