meditation for aura vision specifically = long time to reawakening.
<br />

<br />
meditation on opening third eye/chakra balancing = less but still long time
<br />

<br />
chakra balancin + third eye opening meditation  + BINARY BEAT and Holu-sync technology + aura vision training = quick opening. (weeks)
<br />

<br />
People say &quot;it takes differnet times for different people&quot; and that is true. but they never answer why. here's some answers for you. not all, just some.
<br />

<br />
1.) your chakra's not balanced in the first damn place.
<br />
2.) mental constraints 
<br />
3.) energy blocks
<br />

<br />

<br />
those are just some that can eliminated by balancing first.
<br />

<br />
Doing things the hard way don't make sense. Entrainment for altered states make's things HELLO LOT EASIER.

<br />
simple but extremely effective. other entrainment are basically the same shit as this plus music and marketing.

			Ownin, what if
<br />
1. I don't believe in chakras.
<br />
2. I didn't really use a method.
<br />
3. I can see them anyway.
<br />
I know it's not an afterimage because I can see it moving, even in the dark.  Wanna know what I did? Try looking between your fingertips or palms, see a connection or energy(psi), move it around and see it move.
<br />
personally I think an aura is just psi energy naturally given off of the body, creating a field that is unique, as it reflects the person itself. So you can see your own, you can see others, and most likely can see any psi energy floating around if you know where it is. The only advice I can give for this is just to practice your sensitivity towards energy.

			In answer to your question you don't have to open the third eye in order to see your aura. so you don't have to beleive in it. Your aura is seen with your eyes when they become sensitive enough, or/and when you learn how to concentrate properly. The third eye method works well, but that moves on to relegion. This is because its main purpous isn't to see auras. It's supposed to help you see spirits.

			you don't need to meditate to see Aura, quit talking bs. I don't meditate, you just focus and you see it. In rooms where artifical light is, or slightly dim places (eg. in the evenings with natural light coming) I can see Aura usually within under 10 seconds, things like my finger and other inanimate objects I can see it instantaneously.

Your nothing but a load of bullsh*t. Holu-sync Technology? And it amuses me all the time when people talk of the so-called chakras and third eye and at the same time they have not the slightest clue where the terminology comes from.

			i knew they were associated with hinduism, but technically, depending on who's practicing the third eye and whatnot, it doesn't have to be considered religion. 
<br />
Depending on the hindu practitioner, hindu can either be a religion or not. It's kind of like buddhism and sort of zen buddhism. (when i said alike i dont necessarily mean dogma wise (or lack of dogma), i mean, and i say this word loosely, 'behaviours'.)

			the easiest way to see auras is NOT to stare but instead gaze...
<br />
how do u gaze? simple just use your peripheral vision.. 
<br />
most people who practice seeing auras say that always be calm and dont strain your eyes ...
<br />
and the last layer which is the 7th i think you have to be in a meditative trance to see it.. im not sure because there are a lot of fake websites about auras.. and there is no such thing as a aura camera.. there is but most of them are fake..
<br />

<br />
i've been practicing almost everyday and im able to see colours now it use to be a white light but it turned into colour and another weird thing is i think my framerate of my eyes increased because im able to see fast things easier like whenever im in my car(while driving)  i look at other car rims and i can see it very smoothly but before the rims use to be scattered.. 
<br />

<br />
it gets easier to see the aura everyday.. it takes less time to see it now than the other days.. i guess practice is the key and its nothing that hard to see auras.. all you have to do is use your peripheral vision

			i dont really like trying to see auras just because you run the risk of seeing a 'fake' aura, aka afterimage. 
<br />
i guess with practice you'll be able to eventually distinguish the two, but i dont wanna go around believing oh i can see auras when im just looking at afterimages.
