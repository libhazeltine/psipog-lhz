			Recently (about a month ago) I had a vivid dream wherein I was looking through walls/cups/tables/clothes/etc... (there was a certain way to do this which involved focusing your eyes in a certain way)
<br />
Though this dream did seem &quot;big&quot; to me I just shrugged it off and forgot about it for awhile.
<br />

<br />
Around two weeks ago I was at my job walking around bored out of my mind when I remembered my dream.
<br />
With a &quot;wtf&quot; attitude I used the method that was imprinted into my mind from the dream to try and see through someones clothes
<br />
It worked. It was like the top shirt just went translucent (almost exactly how it was in the dream, although it was easier when dreaming (obviously <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />)
<br />
Anyway the shirt faded out alot (not totally but enough where I could see outlines of undergarments) 
<br />

<br />
anyway just curious, is this a form of Clairvoyance or what? I haven't been able to find anything on it
<br />

<br />
(PS. the thicker the object the harder it is to see through {ie. I can easily see through a thin sheet of paper but a wall would be impossible at this point, though I know it will be possible with practice} I'm thinking the dream was a message from my subconscious showing me what the ability would be like at its fullest)
<br />

<br />
PPS. or it could just be that I'm hallucinating, which is cool too (the ability to hallucinate at will would be pretty nice <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />)

			How about you quit your job and go &quot;work&quot; at a casino. Seeing through peoples' cards should bring in at least a couple g a day. Go to vegas for a couple days, make millions, and retire. Your welcome.
<br />

<br />
If you' re not lying, theres better things you can do other than look through peoples clothes.

			Derrick, I must admit that's a perfectly viable suggestion, but I know I wouldn't do it, simply because it offends my conscience. I would be cheating, in essence.
<br />

<br />
Of course, looking through people's clothes would also offend my conscience, because it's pretty pervish. 
<br />

<br />
But other things are useful. It would be a brilliant tool for soldiers to learn. If there's a terrorist on the other side of the courtyard wall, and I could see him through the wall, I'd huck a grenade over the wall, instead of trying to shoot him after going around. And that's just the first example that came to mind! Imagine the implications!
<br />

<br />
BillyBob, you REALLY should post a detailed tech for this thing. It would be amazing to learn.

			Just so I don't look like I'm trying to gain this to be a perv, I wanna know how to do this cause me and my friends often run around the neighborhood at night. We're often going through/on places that we probably shouldn't, like schools and orphanages. This'd be helpful for knowing where people are, like security guards or something. I'm not saying my school has any over night, but it's an example.

			Guys he's not going to be able to post a technique for this. Think about how many people have lived over the years and how many people focus their eyes in different ways each day. There's never been any report on seeing through things by focusing your eyes a certain way, it can't work like that. Think about how many people, children and adults alike, who tried looking through walls and such when superman first came out. Your eyes are not built to see through things by a level of focus. <span style="font-style: italic">If</span> he's not lying, then I believe what he experienced was some kind of advanced RV'ing. Things like this have been reported. Like people knowing a detailed painting that they've never seen before, and it's in a locked room one floor below them. They've drawn the painting just as it originally was in the other room, by using RV, I believe, mabye some type of clairvoyance. Whatever the case, this is what I believe he would've experienced, not just focusing your eyes to look through something.

			I don't buy it. I don't doubt that you saw what you saw, but the human imagination is a powerful thing. Also, it is very possible and actually commonplace to convince yourself that something that didn't actually happen is true - especially if it was powerfully imagined in the first place.
<br />

<br />
This is the old &quot;psiball problem&quot; - people go through a technique for making a psiball, then imagine (subconsciously fabricate, really) evidence that it is there, then (subconsciously) convince themselves that they actually had that evidence and made that psiball, then come and post on this forum, &quot;hey guyz i liek maed psibal i r liek goku phere me ololol!!!!11~&quot;

<br />
Thats what I meant in my original post, 
<br />
I didn't mean for it to sound like I was actually making my eyes pick up the light waves that were being bounced off of her skin, but more of seeing it with my mind (then my mind overlays that image onto my eye-sight or whatever {a controlled hallucination thats controlled on the subconscious level})
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Soldier:</span>
<br />

<br />
As I mentioned in my original post I also think this could be a possibility.
<br />
There's a couple reasons I didn't nail this as the culprit first thing though:
<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">
<br />
1)</span> My family has no history of schizophrenia (as far as I know anyway) 
<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2)</span> I have never actually &quot;seen&quot; anything so vivid that wasn't there (I have had half assed hallucinations when sleep deprived and stuff though...)
<br />

<br />
Anyway just to make it clear: If I'm not somehow using some form of clairvoyance to visually see through stuff, then I'm definitely hallucinating...
<br />
The reason I say this is because I'm actually &quot;seeing&quot; with my eyes rather than with my mind
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Anyway I've experimented some more and I have a few questions for you psions:
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">1)</span> If this is clairvoyance then why is it so hard to see through walls but not through objects placed on tables, people, clothing, plants, animals, umbrellas, etc?
<br />

<br />
Its weird, I can't really see very detailed stuff through anything (just outlines and extremely vague details (its not like looking at silhouettes).
<br />
The weirder part yet is the fact that I can't really see much at all through walls.
<br />
I'm guessing this is a mental block though, and I'll be able to get past it soon enough
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">2)</span> Has anyone ever heard of someone that could do this?
<br />

<br />
I don't want to sound like I think I'm so special or something stupid like that, it would just be really helpful to read up on someone else's experiences 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">3)</span> If it turns out that I am hallucinating, how can I continue to advance the vividness of my hallucinations? any suggestions or personal stories?
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Random stuff:</span>
<br />

<br />
to Damien: 
<br />
I can't really explain it... I just look through the object.
<br />
I think the adjusting of my eyes is just an activator that tells my subconscious: &quot;Oh, he's trying to see through that object, better get that information&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
Anyway I forgot to mention in my first post that I've meditated for at least 30 minutes a day, every day, for the past two years
<br />
I know how stupidly outrageous that might seem that I didn't mention that before but here me out <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />:
<br />

<br />
I began lucid dreaming about two and a half years ago, after about half a year of just normally trying to have lucid dreams I decided to try my hand at &quot;WILDing&quot; (wake initiated lucid dreaming)
<br />
WILDing is a method of getting into a lucid dream wherein you get up after 6 hours of sleep, stay up for about an hour, then essentially just lay down and go into mindfulness meditation until your body goes into sleep paralysis (which can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours). 
<br />

<br />
Anyway I've done that almost every night for the past two years, which qualifies as 2 years of mediation I guess.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Thanks in advance for any comments.

			Okay, replying to your last post.
<br />
  I must warn you that hallucinating isnt something you might want to encurage yourself to do, it could get worse and lead to non-practical hallucinations, such as seeing objects as if their moving though in fact they are static (hard to explain, sort of like its constantly starting to move).
<br />

<br />
   My opinion is that what you encountered was in fact a hallucination, I said something on one of the newsletters about this. The visual information you saw was probably not the result of anything to do with your eyes, my bet would be that you used vision as a relay to whatever ability you used to see through a bit of fabric. There have been documented cases of people reading with their fingers and seeing stuff blindfolded.
<br />
  I think a blindfold would help you practice, you should be able to eventualy map your soroundings in your mind and have a general idea of where things are including things that you didnt nitice beforhand... but this is pretty advanced though.
<br />
  Not being able to see through thicker stuff is probably just a mental block you have... unless you are litteraly seeing through things in wich case I'm afraid to say you are a freak of nature (no offence.... just sarcasm).

			I think your hability is related to RV, but it is not the same thing. RV can see things without really using the eyes, you can see even with closed eyes, and they can see things they don't even know anything about. It's like taking a dimensional shortcut for your awareness. Now, what you see I have seen similar history under the name zooming, which is used for healing: <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html163" target="_blank">art-outline-to-shielding.html163</a>
<br />
Have you tried to see below your skin? Not seeing across your entire arm, but just your muscles and bones?

			With regard to the previous post, and the general idea of what you've done, I've have one or two experiences in this. 
<br />

<br />
The last time this happened I had just gotten out of the shower and was practisicing Auravision in a mirror 1 1/2 metres away for around 10 minutes when I noticed something odd. I looked at my face closely and I began to see progressively deepening layers of my skin wherever I looked. Lighter to darker kinda thing. 
<br />

<br />
I've seen auras (just the first layer though) plenty of times, I've experienced After Image plenty of times and this was neither. When I did it it was the most natural thing in the world, just like looking and concentrating/focusing. I tried the next day for a few seconds, couldn't do it, moved on and forgot about it until it was mentioned here.
<br />

<br />
So yeah, I don't disbelieve you if that's any comfort.
<br />

<br />
Does what you see fade in from layer to layer, increasing in detail?
