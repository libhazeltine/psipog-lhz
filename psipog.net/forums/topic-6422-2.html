Umm, Wasn't a basket ball player cured of aids.... well just saying, the gov't keeps a lot of crap secret and well unless you have 1 million dollars to spend on your life then you can't do anything to save it.

			Yes, a lot of my anger has now been released, it will be a while until I can equalize it. (it has nothing to do with this) Anger is a dangerous thing...it's one of my biggest problems. I can be the most insensitive person in the whole world right now, but normally I can be the most sensitive person in the whole world.

Yes, your right. I let that slip by. Life is a beautiful thing. Although, I am not sure if we can say that, since we don't have AIDS.

Considering how much $425 billion is...I think that disease would be wiped out immediately. Yes, that's how much we spend on our defenses. It's not right. Now I can see how much people care for living.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Lots of people want HIV to be cured - everybody who has it!  And it's not as if we can leave it alone because there are no sufferers in the Western world.  Just because America charges people for their Health service (one thing for which I DO NOT envy the USA) doesn't mean that people don't want to cure it just because they are making money.   Heck, they would make loads of money from selling the cure, and for infinitely higher prices!  The problem of AIDS is a problem here in the UK too.  We have an N.H.S. which is being funded through our taxes.  They do not charge each patient each time they have an operation.  What would be their motive for witholding a cure?  None!  The situation might be different in America, but I can't see why they would withold the cure over here.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Heh, okay, understood. But look at this: The cure is a one time shot. The treatment for staying alive is infinite. Where do you make the most money? In the realm of infinite. 
<br />
You cure it. You can't make anymore money. It's quite simple.

Look at how much money and greed humans want...ughh

Jynx: The man you speak of is &quot;Magic Johnson.&quot; He has millions of dollars. That is why he has survived for so long. He is in no way cured.

I just recently heard that a company may have actually made AIDS while trying to get monkey kidneys to properly interact with the human body. Look more greed!

There's already dozens of conspiracy theories out there about the gov't creating aids and other problems to make money. Ever see that guy all over TV now with his book &quot;Natural Cures&quot;, can't remember his name but that's what he's all about.

What exsists is research. You take that money away from defense and put it into research for a while. And through common logic, I can almost gurantee scientists will come up with a cure.

Scientists need materials at their disposal. Considering the money that they have at their disposal, it may take a very long time until they come up with anything.

Indeed, good point.

Well, I only looked into it a bit and I found this:

It actually says that America spends more money than I said. You don't even have to get rid of it all...just take maybe 100 billion dollars and you are set to cure AIDS and cancer.

I don't think logic has anything to do with being able to estimate something like that but I understand your point.
<br />

<br />
EDIT* I understand how much the gov't spends on most things, and agree a cure would come sooner with more spending directed towards it, I just don't think you can predict how much spending it could take to find a cure to a disease.

Heh, I see where you are coming from. It's just that, $400 billion is A LOT. I would assume the scientists could do wonders with it. But that's not the point. It doesn't matter if I can predict such a thing or not. The thing is, that department (AIDS), and many others need more money put into them. 
<br />

<br />
This is what the ego causes. America is so fearful about others that they spend all of their money in one place. But how can I blame them? It only seems to be human nature...
