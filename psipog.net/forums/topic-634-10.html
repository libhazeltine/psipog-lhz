			All this talk about people wanted to &quot;Levitate&quot; and their techniques for &quot;levitation,&quot; or even that silly <span style="font-weight: bold">ff7_master2002</span> who ased in the Q&amp;A section he's practicing how to fly like Neo and Peter Pan.
<br />

<br />
It's simple, you cannot leviate - not with TK or even some shield. Quit making topics about this - it's a no no. You can make as many theories as you want though there's no point in making them if no one has actually done it. Seriously, you have really good TK'ers like Float who from his video, which I'm asssuming is true has levitated that small coin to a certain extent. But with some difficulty, it drops.
<br />

<br />
If a really good TK'er like Float had trouble lifting a coin for a really long period of time how on earth can you people levitate let alone fly like <span style="font-weight: bold">ff7_master2002</span>.
<br />

<br />
Let's say a person weights 70kg, now I'm taking gravity as 10m/s^2, so you would need at least 700N to keep at a constant leviation or height.
<br />

<br />
But of course, I bet alot of you people who don't know physics and talk about levitation and flying = fluff. You know it's not possible, if it were someone would have already done it by now.
<br />

<br />
And for the Dragonball Z lovers, no, Criss Angel cannot levitate and no, you can't fly like Goku or launch Spirit Bombs like Goku at Freeza <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			HOLY CRAP! <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />  I made a post...got the answer, and come back months later to find...7 EXTRA PAGES! WHy? Holy crap people. Man, I was just realating experience and wondering peoples oppinions. This much off topic might as well be freaking locked, and I insist it gets locked as well. Also, I read through some posts up to about the 6th PAGE...and wanted to tell everyone that I also am a street magician, and I can reveal to you EVERY way that criss does his tricks. Its not anything real. I could make a video of effects like that, if I was so inlined. The point is I amaze people every day...but IT IS FAKE! OK! I can levitate just like criss angel, its stupid, and hard to get the right angles. If you notice its always from his back...so gosh people...stop posting lol. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			Actually, Batworz, it is possible to levitate and even fly. Many religious type of monk-like people  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  (Sorry don't know they're proper name if that insulted anyone) in China and India for example have done this. And my whole class has seen me levitate an inch off the ground in PE where we were doing meditation for 2 hours.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  The greatest PE lesson ever. We had to imagine sitting on a cloud. I know I can't explain it but sometimes things can't be explained.
