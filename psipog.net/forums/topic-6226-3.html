			nightshade im sorry about referring to him as psycho, i understand the situation ur in (sort of) so lets refer to him as very very agressive. i aslo think now that TP is out of the question as she might aslo detect its me even if shes not psionic...well all i can do is go to any parties that her freinds throw (cause im freind with her freinds) and see how things go....but u know its very frustrating cause i see the looks she gives me and like i said she constantly stares at me, even when around her boyfreind.....oh well just wait it out and see where it goes i guess

			Hmm... Not dated and you are 17... What to do... What to do...
<br />

<br />
I'm really not sure because you have absolutely no experience with girls. Remember this:
<br />

<br />
There is no point in dating if you are going to be totally prude with her. You can't be prude. You have to kiss if she wants you to. You have to hug her a lot. You can't be clingy. Girls don't like that. I remember first asking someone out on a date. You really don't want to do it, but you really want to. I got this feeling, like I had to do this. I just walked right up to her, called out her name and said. &quot;Do you want to go out with me.&quot; She said yes, and we are still dating. 
<br />

<br />
DO NOT BE JUMPY.
<br />

<br />
Once you are in front of her, you have to do it.

haha you should win the award for most depressing comment. It's ok, you can't change the past, so don't worry about it now. Just make sure next time you get the chance, go for it. So you get shut down. Who cares. Mabye next time you won't. When you're old and crippled you're going to look back on life and regret those chances you never took.

One time, I went asking all around the school for a dare, and asked about 100 girls but nothing went my way.

			Well, I don't care anyways. 
<br />
I do not wish for a relationship. They are wastes of time, and more trouble than it's worth. I have been told many views of women and such. Teenagers these days are complete idiots to me. I do not see any real love between them. They aren't old enough to even understand what love really is. They are trying to act older than what they are. And what do they get from it? They get a child and maybe some STD's to go along with it. They get a child and they are not prepared for it. 
<br />

<br />
Don't go out looking for love, let love find you. If that's what I have to do, then I'll just wait. I have the patience to do so. Another reason is that love isn't something I can do all that well. I don't follow the herds of sheep in any manner, they don't know where they are going anyways.

^^^^^listen to him for he is truely wise. love will find you and all you have to do is sit back. im still considered kind of young and i fully understand what love is because i am mature beyond my years or so I am told. kids these days a punks and they truely pay for it with stds and such down the road. You need to let the great girl find you and you will know when that day comes even if its a long time down the road
