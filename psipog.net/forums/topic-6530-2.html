			Seems too much work to be a prank or scam of somesort, then again, some people have enough time to seek many members and E-mail them crap. I'm not going to bother with checking it out.

I don't see anything wrong until people get disemboweled. (reference to a dream &gt;_&gt;) Dream delt with psionics and a secret agency...although it had aliens and some chemical causing people to lose control of their arms and strengths.

This still really doesn't explain how my Second Consul got it sent to the account she only uses for personal correspondence. She didn't get it in her public inbox though, which raises even more questions about Meticus' means of obtaining contact info. 
<br />

<br />
Considering the intended audience of the survey, maybe he's got psi operatives finding us all?
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">[EDIT: I'm doing some serious intelligence-gathering on the survey and on the group performing this research. I'll be uploading a comprehensive document to the current STAG site, which will not be linked to on the website. I will announce when this dossier is finished. When I do so, contact me directly for the URL. Theo out.]</span>

<span style="font-style: italic">[EDIT #2: It seems you were right, Peebs. Merticus said on PsiStudies that only those whose e-mails were public domain were e-mailed. Still doesn't explain why Aglaia got it in her private account, though....]</span>

			Why do you feel unimportant, Tankdown? Because you didn't get the e-mail? Don't worry about it. Personally, I feel like I've been thrust into a world that's far more confusing and dangerous than I thought. Vampires? Scary thought; although this group that Merticus is in is strictly donor-fed (meaning people who willingly give their psi or blood, termed &quot;life-force&quot; by these people).

Quite simply from the memberlists of respected psion/psi related forums or web sites - ie: PsiPog, etc.  If at anytime you listed your e-mail on a forum and checked for it to be publicly viewable we used those lists to contact you.  We respect everyone within the energy worker community, as several of our own members are energy workers themselves, and do not intend to trouble anyone with e-mails they do not wish to receive.  We appreciate your participation and involvement in this study.  Thank you!

That was what I got back. It seems they just combed the internet for public emails.
