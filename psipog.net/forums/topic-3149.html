			Well, I recently discovered Psipog in all of it's glory, but I'm having a hard time believing in it all.  I've seen the videos, but as you know, using magnets or static electricity I could do any of these myself.
<br />

<br />
So, I was wondering, would anybody want to help me out?  I have read about pinging with psi balls, and I was wondering if somebody could &quot;ping&quot; me long distance so that I could feel it and lose my doubts. 
<br />

<br />
Or perhaps somebody could remote view me and tell me what I'm doing, that would work too.
<br />

<br />
So, anyways, I'm not sure if either of those things are possible, but if you could that would be a great help to me.  I want to believe, I just tend to be a bit too physically grounded.
<br />

<br />
Thanks
<br />

			I can't do anything, but I speak from experience: this stuff works, and I among many other people have proven it, time and time again.

Magnets don't work for levitation, though. It'd attract, not repel the coin.

			Personally, I think it'd be kind of hard to move a PAPER psiwheel with magnets.  Also, in the User's PK Videos thread, there are some non-metal items that would be hard to move with magnets.

			If you are serious about trying, I'll gladly practice tp with you now and then. I'm not *that* good though, so don't expect definite proof right away. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Just add me to MSN and talk to me when you see me online.

			I can't really ping you long distance because I am not good enough of a psion to do it, but would that really prove it to you? Anything short of me, or someone else projecting their voice in your head could be atributed to just about anything. Even then you might simply think you are going crazy. The effect of pinging is quite limited. Even seeing someone move something infront of you is not that convincing. Doubt goes to the point where I can doubt myself even when I move something. Was that me? Was that the wind? What else could be moving this? (maybe its just the paranoya of the physics major). My point however, is that seeing is not always believing, especially with the limited effects that psions in this forum can produce. The best way is to try it. It takes only about two weeks of practice to learn to move a psiwheel. Try it, and see what you think. Maybe psionics is for you, maybe not. The point is, if you can't prove it to yourself, no one else can. 
<br />
I personally think that there are many ways that those videos can be faked. Since when is low res video considered any kind of proof? I have seen in person much more amazing tricks done, that I haven't been able to figure out. The point of those videos however is not to prove that psi exists. They are there to inspire you to find out if psi exists for yourself.

			Yeah, the best way to find out if its real is to just give it a shot.  I found this place one day when I was bored and decided to dig up some dirt on psychic abilities on the internet.  After a while of practice, I finally got a pinwheel to move.  Its not so hard once you get it.  In fact, I'm doing it right now, even as I type this.  (Typing one handed is pretty darn hard, lol)  Took me nearly a month of nightly attempts, but I hear others get it faster.
<br />

<br />
My point is, just give it a shot, and you won't be disappointed.

			well, i'm trying to lose my doubts, and i think i've lost nearly all of them <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
was staring at the psi wheel from a little distance, and it didn't move or wobble...
<br />
windows closed...
<br />

<br />
and i remembered the &quot;feeling&quot; when it was rotating and tried to &quot;project&quot; these feelings onto the wheel, and it started rotating slowly...
<br />
but it needed lots of concentration
<br />

<br />
anyway, no arms, no movement, no wind...
<br />

<br />
Lucidity, I'd suggest you to do some research on the net, pick something you like, PK or RVing or whatever you're interested in, and just start trying...
<br />
Just don't give up, it can take you days or weeks till you get results
<br />
but there will be some, trust me <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
so yea:

			Best convincing is practicing telekinesis yourself.  Belief is not needed, just willingness to practice and put your energy into it.  If its not real, then it will be a waste of a few months (practicing everyday).  If after a few months of practice daily you have no results I would be extremely suprised.
<br />

<br />
Have fun.
