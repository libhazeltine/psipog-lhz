			I'd like to comment on something that I noticed I can do. Many a month ago I made a post that concerned sensing people via psychic means and got some useful information. But recently I've noticed that I can sense people from a distance at work without using any visual technique at all. When I walk down aisles I just &quot;feel&quot; a change in the &quot;atmosphere&quot; (the &quot;atmostphere&quot; I'm referring to is just a feeling in my head that feels real) when I concentrate on them to see how many people are there. Sometimes I got this really strong feeling from certain aisles and looked there but noticed that they were empty! This confused me when I tried guessing if an aisle was empty but I soon figured out that that feeling represented the emptiness in the aisle itself. I soon began to increase my accuracy and I'm usually right in my predictions. My theory is that a person's aura (If you don't believe those then please don't start a flame war about it. Just state your unbiased opinion and show me that you aren't immature.) &quot;cut's off&quot; this emptiness feeling as if it has mass. Of course this is all just theories from MY experiences so don't act like I claim it to be true. I'm just providing my analysis of this phenomena. Unfortunately I cannot really teach anyone interested in any kind of detailed technique. All I can say is that I just get rid of all mental distractions and become aware of everything. I think this phenomena may be related to what Pete A. Sanders called &quot;psychic feeling&quot; in his book, &quot;You Are Psychic!&quot; (um... the title may be off a bit but I know that's what the author's name is <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />). When I first started doing this at work I actually concentrated on the &quot;psychic feeling reception area&quot; that he mentioned in his book (If you have any questions or just want information about the book just PM me. If you don't like PM's I'll just PM you ONCE with my e-mail address.) So, has anyone ever experienced this?

			Interesting results, although small they are <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />. I, as some of you probably figured out, am the one who voted for the &quot;I experience it when ever I want because...&quot; option <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. I had to vote just to view the results. If anyone would like to post their experiences and insights/tips about this phenomena please do. I am no master of this technique and would appreciate any additional knowlege on how it works and how to increase sensitivity and such.

Thanks for telling me that. Very interesting. I'll bet you're better than me though. I've only been able to tell if a single person was or wasn't in room anymore or appoxiamately how many people were in a nearby aisle that I wasn't able to view. I am impressed with the poll results. I almost expected that some may have experienced this at least somewhat. I just wanted to see how common it was. I wonder if there is a correlation between your awareness of psionic/psychic abilities and the your skill in sensing things. Who knows?

I think that's a pretty good description of how I do it. Thanks for mentioning it.

I'm not sure if that has anything to to with the topic (sounds more like clairvoyance to me <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />), but good for you I guess?! <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			I feel something similar, but instead of in my head, it's on the top of my skin.  Sometimes I know how many people are near, sometimes I only know that someone is there.  I don't think I have ever been able to tell who, but I have been able to infer.  Like, I have been able to tell if it was a male/female, and sometimes if they were moving and where to.  I can control this to an extent, but haven't practiced very much.  It mostly happens pretty randomly, usually at night.
