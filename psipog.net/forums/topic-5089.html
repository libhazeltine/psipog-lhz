			I am going to ask a series of questions. The first thing I need is a volunteer, who I will PM the awnsers to. 
<br />

<br />
But anyway, here are the questions.
<br />

<br />
1.) I am thinking of a number, what is it?
<br />
(Since I'm PMing the awnser, I don't expect this to be a problem.)
<br />
2.) What is my first name?
<br />
3.) Post a picture of you performing some psychic activity, in front of outside observers.
<br />

<br />
This isn't comprehensive or scientific, but I'd just like to see if anyone can do it.
<br />

<br />
Also, if any of you can really do these things, I'd highly suggest going to James Randie. One million dollars for a few days work!
<br />

<br />
I'm not trying to be an asshole, I'm just personally curious about your claims.

Because proving it could improve peoples lives immesuarbly?
<br />
Because I'll give you a reward?
<br />
Because it seems like your lying if you don't?

What do I care if people think i'm lieing?

Read Peebrains article on Randi.
<br />

<br />
As for the picture,  psipog has a media section.  None of them are in front of outside observers but you might find them interesting.

			You must understand, that most people here wouldn't give a fuck about you. Most people here couldn't do shit that you ask for. Those that could, wouldn't waste their time on you or Randi.
<br />

<br />
It's a lost hope for you, don't believe us, then leave and laugh. Most you could do, is practise and learn from the articles for over a year. 
<br />

<br />
Please, don't attack me for what I say, I'm tired of it and gets threads locked.

			Indeed, i agree with Neveza, you're a dick.
<br />

<br />
We have many people sign up to these boards, and just want us to read their minds, or tell us their future, and we keep saying that it would be better if they tried it themselves, and still, they do not listen. Then carry onto say, 'since we cant do the challenge, we must be fake'. Lowlifes like this should grow up, im getting all too pissed off with people coming and saying, prove to me that Psi is real, and i'll believe you. Well we keep giving you evidence, and it keeps getting 'shot down' as fake, so i have stopped trying to convince people that Psionics are real.

This brings into question several aspects of YOUR ability to telepathically SEND a message <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />. Most people need a little help and cooperation from the subject to make a clear message.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Edit: Also, question three is not really any good. I can Pose a picture of me practicing infront of people. Which I do often around several of my friends and family members. But... It's just posing, even when it's not.

			I already decided that I will attempt this for you Dubbus. I have had some experience guessing names and numbers from people <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. Which brings me to an interesting memory of when I met a girl who believed but didn't practice paranormal. It was a fun day of Telepathy.
<br />

<br />
But, I do not want to perform such a thing over the message board. I will do it over an IM with you, or over E-mail. The only catch is I would like a picture of you to help me get connected with you. 
<br />

<br />
If it makes you feel good to post if I fail or succeed here, you may do so.
<br />

<br />
I would also like to add a thought, to you.
<br />

<br />
Are you doing this because you want to experience Telepathy, or because you want to disprove/prove it? Because, all you will get, success or failure, is the experience to telepathy.
<br />

<br />
One or two success'/failures can not prove/disprove anything. I hope you realize that.
