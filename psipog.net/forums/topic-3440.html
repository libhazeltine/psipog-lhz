			Ooooo i watched this soppy flim with my girlfriend called Just Like heavan, the girl was in a car accident and she was put in a coma and her spirit was wandering around, its like she was out of body permenatly.
<br />

<br />
But umm, IMO No.  its harder to get out than it is to get back in, i had to fight to stay out of my body for the first month or two.

			What if, it would be able to couse something wich keeps &quot;your spirit&quot; 
<br />
(i dunno how else to call it )
<br />
out of your body for a long period of time? like a long time obe.
<br />

<br />
wich exaclty looks like a coma.
<br />
but isnt.
<br />

<br />
for Example.
<br />

<br />
im having an obe.
<br />
for a long time.
<br />
my mom finds me in my bed and i aint wakin up.
<br />
so she calls the doc. 
<br />
he thinks im in a coma so brings me to the hospital.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Meanwhile im still wondering around.
<br />

<br />
so my &quot;spirit&quot; is outside wich im controlling.
<br />
my body is in the hospital in a Coma.
<br />

<br />
Maybe it is possible if people become strong in it.
<br />
Human's havent discovered the entire galaxy yet.
<br />
i see Psi the same way.

			stop making talking about things that you cant do.
<br />
First do obe...when talk.
<br />
You are talking so many things, but that knowledge does to you no bonus.
<br />

<br />
I wont answer the question, because nothing will change when you get it.
<br />
You cant go into astral, having answer you wont be able to go into astral too.
<br />
Mind tricks.

Knowledge is the worst enemy.

			Well it's true, but one more advice, look at older posts, I've answered at least  3 times the same question. No, it's not possible to. If your mother shakes you , you would have to be a higly, highly skilled ober to stay outside. So no, impossible to get stuck.

			i think we're using the wrong terms here...or maybe we're just mixing 'em up.
<br />

<br />
when i hear you guys say 'stuck' i of course think ok they obed but willing can't get out. I think this may actually be a possiblility, but under EXTREMELY RARE consequences.
<br />

<br />
now...what if someone willingly stayed obed? well.....of course technically we wouldn't know, but i bet there are those powerful enough (eventually will be) to stay obed for extremely long periods of time. Maybe not necessarily forever; that's going into a topic i HIGHLY doubt ANYONE here can know about. and i mean SERIOUSLY KNOW. (i like to hear people's ideas and theories about somethin like this, but please don't pass it off all fact cause honestly you really don't know.)
