			ah don't mind me to much, I'm to much of a pacifist I guess. I just don't like to see anybody or anything hurt for whatever the reason, but when I get angry it's like every one gets out of my way lol for an example:
<br />

<br />
In my P.E. class back in my freshman year, a buddy of mine decided to play a really dirty prank on me, he did a full strenght uppercut to my nuts. I went down to my knees, let the anger override the pain and got back up on my feet and started walking toward him and he went white as a sheet and ran and there were some other people that had saw this and they took off too.... just a little story when a trigger gets tripped I go a bit wacko :O

			Yeah english si wierd, why do we say: I wish (insert name here) <span style="font-weight: bold">was</span> here? Shoulsn't it be <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> here? If it was &quot;was&quot; or &quot;were&quot; here, then that would mean that they were there, not they are there.
<br />
Anyways (wow, that went offtopic) I suppose you could just make a really strong psiball, although I couldn't do that because I never got that magnetic pushy feeling before.

 Nah, lived in a little redneck community and was a public school. However, I moved just before my junior year so yea don't have those kinds of tricks done on me at the new school. Just occasionly a flat tire...

			You can't block a punch with your mental energy, if someone could everyone would have known that. Quit dreaming, there are people who are bagging you on another forum you know for your stupidity.
