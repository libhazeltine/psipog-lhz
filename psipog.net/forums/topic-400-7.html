DING. Correctomondo. Almost everyone, most ESPECIALLY people who don't believe in psionics or psychic phenomena to the degree that a lot of psipog goers do, are in a constant struggle for energy. Parents take it from their children (bad or inadequate parents do anyway), friends take it from each other. Energy transference is constantly going on, everywhere. And everyone is participating in it... Some people, though (positive minded individuals) tend to create more energy within themselves, while others (usually negative people) take energy from others. And, If I had to guess, I'd say there are way more &quot;psy-vamps&quot; than there are &quot;energy wells&quot; out there.... hyeh, funny story:
<br />

<br />
One of my roommates friends is an asshole and is around all the time, dirtying dishes, shitting in our toilet, etc.... I mean, the guy basically lives in the apartment with us (one main reason why im moving out). One day I got really annoyed with him, because he's the kinda guy that pisses people off and brings them down, so I started trying to consciously sap some of his energy... End result: That same night, he got sick as a dog, all weak, puked in the toilet a few times. I didn't feel at all sorry for him. I was feeling great, and in a good mood.
<br />

<br />
I can't say with 100% certainty that it was due to my attempt at draining his energy, but it seems like a reasonable assumption.
<br />

<br />
Normally, I do not try to drain people's energy, because im not a psychic vampire personality. Doesn't mean I can't though.

			OK, here goes.
<br />

<br />
Since semantics always creates needless issues in an argument, let's change the term to - &quot;Energy Leeching&quot;. Actually, we can be hip too. NRG Leechin'. 
<br />

<br />
Now, remember Annie's articles on Healing? Remember Reiki? Or some of you might have experience with Chi Kung, Tai Chi, Quantum Touch, etc. These influence the life force of a person's body to cause their effects. Essentially, your energy, stamina, etc, has an energetic counterpart that is probably very closely connected with psi. 
<br />

<br />
A person who, as many in this thread have decided, may desire to take the route of doing things in a &quot;dark&quot; manner to perhaps feel &quot;special&quot;, can with great ease take the &quot;life force&quot; energy of other people, to the point where the other person may feel tired, get a headache, and may want to pass out. It's an energetically drained feeling, similar to how you might be after an extended TK practice session.
<br />

<br />
The Energy &quot;Leecher&quot;, so to speak, actually does not benefit as much from this practice as if they were to draw on that seemingly infinite supply of energy all around them, because it's already been synthesized in many ways by that other individual. This is why, after experiencing things like Pranayama and Reiki Energy work I cannot understand why someone would want to retain the old methods of stealing from other people...unless of course, they're doing it for self-image reasons.
<br />

<br />
Yes, in angstier days, some years ago, I did try &quot;leeching&quot; from other people, only to have them act very tired and sometimes even remark aloud their sudden change in energy (they were not psions nor interested in such matters). Afterwards, the energy always felt somewhat pre-processed, like I was having my food chewed and regurgitated for me or something. It wasnt comfortable energy and felt like it was already attuned to the other person, and was not for me.

			I've read there are 4 different typesof vamps, that psi one being one of the four. Either they don't have enough energy of their own and feed off of others, or they just want more for any given reason and steal it from others. Some do it for energy, some do it for fun, and some doit without realising. That's what I've read at least...

			point 1: anybody can become a psi vamp.
<br />
point 2: Although this is not a site for psi combat so I will not go into it, stealing others energies make well for powerful attacks. Furthermore, it makes well for more effective psiballs and such. 
<br />
point 3: Remember that a psi vamps connections are two way. So regardless of how much pain they can cause your or how well that can sense your locatoin simply by thinking about you YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING TO simply by knowing how to do it. Better yet, simly by trying to do it.  
<br />
point 4: A common technique that psi vamps use is &quot;dreamwalking&quot;. Which is entering someone elses dreams.  Anybody can do this but it is easier for a psi vamp because they have already established a connection with that person in the real world by taking his psi energy. Thus they are empowered with more than average preson for obvious reason thus such a feet becomes childs play.
<br />

<br />
I personally don't like the term psi &quot;vampire&quot; becaues of the thougths that the word &quot;vampire&quot; anchors. That worrd anchors evil, negativity, and disbelief. When you think of the word vampire one would usually think of a fairy tale made up being. Because most don't believe in vampires  just from that word you anchor disbelief.
<br />

<br />
If I told somebody I could take and use their psi energy towards effective means over me telling them I'm a &quot;psi vampire&quot; they'd be more inclined to believe me.
<br />

<br />
Also I'd like to state that some techniques overlap within other doctrines. Such as the ability to slow the aging process. It's not that it's rare, it'sj uts that all the real psi-vamps with high level powers don't waste their time on the internet. Furthermore such skill requires discpline in intense training which most people and their &quot;15 minutes of day&quot; training can't supplement.

			You do have a good point there most of the skills they do are the same techniques we use here apart from stealing psi.
<br />

<br />
About the psi stealing, do people who dont believe in psionics need their psi energy?, could you live with little or no psi energy? If they dont need it then whats the harm in taking it if you think about it when you gather energy for a psi ball how do you know your not taking it form people?
<br />

<br />
I think &quot;vampires&quot; is a harsh word just to make them sound evil (Dont forget we're probly dealing with goths here) i prefer psi borrowers or psi collectors make your own up, whatever.

			We uncounsioucly exchange energy all the time. CONSTANTLY.  I am REDICULOUSLY agianst the psivamps that just steal cuase they get their lil high, and feel bad ass for a while.  
<br />

<br />
I can understand when people have a kinda &quot;definciency' of life/psi/energy.  I've never heard of that.  But if it is real, the block is probably something emotional, and why do you have to take it from other people? Couldn't you just ground?  I mean when I'm putting a shit load of energy into somthing, like when I'm healing, I have to grow roots or my legs feel like they are going to fall off.  Would that not work??

			psi vampires may actually exist. although those who are considered psivamps are the ones who are conscious in what they are doing i.e. sucking all the energy from someone, something, somewhere on purpose.. while yeah, everybody has the tendency to do this as well but not consciously. they aren't exactly &quot;into&quot; this sort of thing. psivamps maybe very dependent on this energy-sucking-hobby..

oh, and i also heard that there is this certain club about people (people not real vampires) who are drinking each other's blood but not to the extent that they kill each other.. they have customized canines and are goth-like..
