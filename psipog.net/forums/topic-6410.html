			Hey when i joined psipog psychokinesis was what interested me the most, on my second day i moved the psiwheel and after a couple weeks i started moving straws and empty soda cans. But after about 2 months of hard practicing i started getting lazy and practiced less and less. At one time i hadnt practiced for about a month and a half. Actually i stopped coming to psipog that much and totally forgot about PK because there was other things i was doing at the time. So then once in a while i would just try PK once or twice a day and didnt care so much anymore, and now for 2 or so weeks ive really wanted to get back into PK and be able to do what i could before so willingly. But no matter how hard i try and how hard i focus i can barely move the psiwheel at all, sure it jiggles but that could just be the wind or my breath. One time i was trying so much to move it it was the most focus i had ever put into anything before. But it still wont move. I dont know why this is happening though, maybe im not motivated enough, but i dont know how to motivate myself more then i already am. So I really would appreciate it if someone else who has gone through this experience and has learned to do PK again could give me some advice. Thanks. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			wow tough break.  I had this happen a few times.. I think. Well with getting serious about pk then losing interest then getting serious then losing interest.  Well that's the problem.

I did have that happen a few times, I started back at the psi-wheel and it would bearly move.  I suggest you take another break, forget that you even had this little downfall.  After your break you should've forgotten all that was troubling you and just go about pk with a new confidence and well hopefully you'll be able to do what you used to, since you were always able to anyway.  Seemed to work for me.

Best of luck to you.

			What you call focus in your post, sounds to me more like forcing or straining. Be more gentle, you are too attached and dependent on the outcome of your attempt. Let things go a little, loosen up and give the body time to remember the feeling. Get back into that feeling you had when you used to move stuff decently. Just relax and spend a little quality-time in that sensation of your memory. Then try moving it again. Not with force or attachment to the result, but look at the situation as a new experience to explore right here right now. BE there and let the object move. Give it time.
