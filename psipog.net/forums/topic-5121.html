			I have a queston. 
<br />

<br />
Before I started practicing psionics, me and my mom discovered the Psiball... I did it without even concentrating energy(Well I didn't even know)... I just made my hand like holding a ball, and 1 minute after could feel like a ball of energy. And right now, after reading the psiball part. I'm not sure I'm doing it right. And even if I concentrate my energy I feel the same thing as if I wasn't. Does this mean I'm not getting enough energy or I'm good enough to do it without concentrating.
<br />

<br />
Oh... and about the feel. I just feel like a ball. I don't feel heat nor tingling, just energy.
<br />

			What probably happened is that your sub c new your intent of wanting to make a psiball so it did that even though you didnt concioussly try to make one.  About doing it now, if you feel energy then you are most likely doing it correctly.  Remember not to try to focus to much on the articles, but rather do what feels right to you.

Good luck,
<br />

			That's good. Try to make one that does something, I dunno wha't easier, but lot of ppl use it to move things, so you can try that. But keep that in mind, focus on the objective before you make the psi-ball, I think it does work better if you have a clear objective in mind.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

			there are some people who are &quot;gifted&quot;.....they need no one to teach them psionic arts (the people who started the whole thing are these people)
<br />

<br />
then there are the not so gifted...but with some believe and practice...they manage to pull it off....
<br />

<br />
last but not least.....idiots who do not believe and refuse to practice

			I agree with Theorist when he says that there are gifted psions.  But I don't believe that there are psions that can literally do EVERYTHING all at once.  They may be able to do the most basic aspects of certain abilities but just some and only the basics.  Good for you though!  It always feels good to accomplish something, especially if it defies modern beliefs!

			I've read somewhere the sub-c has triggers, and one of them is when you cup your hand it creates a psi-ball. 
<br />

<br />
I dont know much about triggers so use the search button.

			Thanks guys... for all the replies. And even though I can do it without thinking about it. It feels stronger when I visualize sucking energy from everywhere.
