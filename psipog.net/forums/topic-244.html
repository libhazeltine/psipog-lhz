			There are three street lights in my home town that always turn off when I?m about 7 meters away from them, and then turn back on after I walk by them.  I would normally think this was coincidence, but it happens every time I walk by them and it started happing after I started practicing psionic?s again. 
<br />

<br />
One of the bulbs on the ?chandelier? (think I spelt that correctly) in my dining room also goes out when I?m around it.
<br />

<br />
Has anyone else found that electrical devises periodically act strangely around them?

			Past the point of mp3 players just doing weird things like freezing up and randomly going back to the start of the song in the middle of it, yet keep thinking it's in the middle of the song...
<br />

<br />
Yeah <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
That other stuff happened before I started practicing.
<br />

<br />
Also, today it rained massively... I never watch the news, and especially the weather channel. I didn't look at the clouds the previous day, nor did I on the way to school. It turned out I picked rain-/wind-proof pants and  a raincoat... Weird. (Normally, I wouldn't wear that to school.)
<br />

<br />
But yeah, computers, light bulbs, radios... they sometimes act weird when I'm either practicing, or just finished.

			Ever since i started practicing psionics, whenever i take a shower (and only then), the light above the sink comes on and the switch is flipped.
<br />

<br />
ALWAYS.
<br />

<br />
its beginning to annoy me.
<br />

<br />
I know i'm not leaving it on, i check, one time i was looking at the clock in the bathroom and saw the light come on (didnt see the switch flip tho)

			I know exactly what you guys are talking about. I had the same types of things happen to me. But heres a new one: whenever I'm around speakers of any sort, they kinda tweak out like a burp/&quot;put-put&quot; noise. It happens to me all the time but whenever a friend heres it they go, &quot;WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!?!&quot; and it makes me laugh greatly. Ah teh sigh.

Yeah, I find empathy easier when at the computer, on MSN or something, but it's far more likely (though not certain) that simply reading text means less analitical overlay,as opposed to hearing someones voice and there are less disturbances. Dunno.
<br />
As for the actual topic <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> I have noticed that occasionaly the lights will dim for about half an hour, after I make a psiball, though not always.
<br />
This has happened in two different places, with the same pattern.

			I noticed such dramatic occurrences with electronics acting weirdly that I made manipulating of electronics one of the main areas of psionics I focus on.
<br />

<br />
I think it was about 4 years ago that I was completely immersed in that game Morrowind (anyone who's played it knows how addictive it is).  I would play it for hours at a time, but I was always bummed if I played it so long I forgot when one of my favourite shows was on TV.  Well, one day I wanted to watch Stargate or something and so played Morrowind for a of couple hours.  All of a sudden the game magically shut down (not like a crash, it was quite literally like someone saved then closed the game) and I looked at the computer clock and it was 2 minutes before Stargate was airing.
<br />

<br />
This has happened to me dozens of times since and was one of the main reasons I started looking into if I could control it.  I've always had the effects lots of other people in this thread talk of such as any flourescent bulb, like those in street lights, going off or oscillating, speakers making that weird sound (which is oddly also produced by receiving a cell phone call near speakers) but they were hardly extreme enough to think I had any potential in the area.
<br />

<br />
Now I recharge batteries while still in my MP3 player (by the way, don't recharge those batteries that are permanently encased in your devices because those are lithium ion batteries and they seem to break down waaaay faster if you're recharging them psionically.  It probably destroys the salt bridge or something, so stick to recahrging disposable batteries), I turn my computer on or off, open or close programs, unfreeze computers and generally just fix them without doing much other than sitting down in front of the troubled PC.

			Yeah, one time I was trying to bend a spoon without  touching it on my computer desk, I barely bent it but I completely fried the motherboard on my computer. It sucked I had to buy a bunch of new parts for my comp.
<br />

<br />
And another time I was trying to see if it would help to focus real hard on the psi wheel then distract my focus, like people sometimes do with spoon bending. for a distraction I was watching the TV and then switching back to the psi wheel, it worked pretty well but them my TV started to fuzz out. It got worse and worse until it became a solid gray screen, I couldn't fix it and I had to buy a new one.
<br />

<br />
Also my mom was telling me that she used to practice TP and Pk as a kid, and one time she was driving with her boy friend and he really pissed her off and she made the street light go out, the guy freaked.

			Lightbringer- I've had extremely similar occurences before, for the same reason. The game would just flick off and it would turn out that the show was commiing on our I had to do something else. Really kind of odd that the subcon would keep of track of stuff like that.

			Well I was in my kitchen, and  i was pouring a glass of pop, and using the microwave. the florescent light on the celiing was off then it went dim-full power- dim and off again; In under 3 seconds.  this is weird enough. to make it worse the switch was off. 2 hours later getting some apple juice. It did it again only this time one quick flick in under a second. my girlfriend saw it too; I'M not crazy im not i say.

			Ancheron:  Cool.  Never heard of anyone else having the same thing happen.    I guess before being born we spent a little extra on the psychic subconscious alarm clock option <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
In relation to psiguy's post and a few others, does anyone else notice that flourescent bulbs react waaaaaay more to the presence of psions than incandescent bulbs?  I mean, I have a fluorescent bulb in my dorm room and it ALWAYS flickers.  I walk by a fluorescent street light and it dims or shuts off.  Etc, etc.  But at my house, there's nothing but normal lightbulbs and nothing abnormal really happens to those...
<br />

<br />
Maybe it's a clue as to the nature of psi...

			Unfortunately, I have had two cellphones in the past 2 weeks completely stop working on me. One just kind of stopped working as I answered it. The screen was completely blue, and it wouldn't do anything. I had been trying to bend a fork right before it rang. Then I got a new one, but it has stopped connecting to any calls. I wasn't doing anything related to psionics when it stopped working. It may be a coincidence, but the odds are pretty low of this just happening.

			I've also noticed they like to flicker alot when im around and close to them. I just never figured that was really big enough to matter to put on, but when it went on out of the blue I was creeped out and happy.
