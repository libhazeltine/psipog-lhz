			It is said that Madame Blavatsky, of the Theosophical Society, witnessed this invisibility for herself and was actually given the secret, thereafter accomplishing this for herself on several occasions in front of witnesses. The literature on the Spiritualists in the U.S. shows that there is no doubt they, too, knew about the cloud and its creation.
<br />

<br />
What is this cloud? We are looking for something that is between empty space and actual physical matter, something unseen by the naked eye but very much in existence. The Rosicrucian manual tells us that the first form into which spirit essence concentrates preparatory to material manifestation is electrons. When spiritual essence gathers into very minute focal points of electrical charge (due to certain conditions), we have the creation of electrons. Science reports that such a cloud of free electrons will absorb all light entering it; it will not reflect nor refract light waves, nor are light waves able to pass through a human being. Consequently the observer?s eye sees nothing there and the person surrounded by such a cloud is invisible. Since light is necessary for human sight, when there are no reflected or refracted light waves bouncing off a person and hitting the observer's retina, the person is not able to be seen and is not visible under normal circumstances.
<br />

<br />
How is this cloud created intentionally? That is difficult to say.

I don't often feel pain. I have no technique, I just try to ignore it. I was once punched in the crotch, and I put my hand down for about 2 seconds and got back up. I dunno what it is, but I'm sure I'll figure out.
<br />

<br />
I suppose I can try working on a shield that reflects (or even better, refracts to another person) pain. The one I subconsciously put up around me did that one day. My friend punched me in the soft part of my arm and he said his arm killed the next two days after.
<br />

<br />
Am I a good subconscious shield constructor?
<br />

<br />
EDIT: My good friend Sir Sparhawk can attest to this.

			refracting pain is not a shield.

<br />
as for my personal experience with cloaks n such was very random.
<br />

<br />
one time at like 2 am i heard a noise outside and i walked into my living room to check on it - i thought it was someone trying to steal my LCD screen so i threw on an invisibility shield in an instant to catch em. then all of the sudden i see my mom come out of her room. and i ask her what the sound was. she told me it were some fireworks, on july 7th wtf? as she was standing about a foot or two away from me she looked right at me, then we talked for about 20 seconds and as she walked away she said 'you know.. i couldnt even see you'

			Well, I'm pretty good at them.  I was making them though before I even knew about psi.  Like one time I was playing hide and seek with a friend and I sat down next to a box in the hallway(if he would have stepped to the right he would have stepped on me)  I imagined myself as part of the floor.  He walked past me THREE times.  But I can make a quick one in about five seconds.  I just imagine myself melting into the wall and being unseen.  Normally I'll hide behind a door and my brother will notice me but if I do that he has yet to notice me.  
<br />
When school starts I'm going to try to make the girls notice me more.....or make myself more attractive.

			Dude, just read the topic on shields.  It will tell you how.  Or just imagine yourself melting into the wall and no one noticing you.  That works pretty well for me.

			There's a place in the dorms where I stay, right in front of a main stairway, near the enterance. If I sit down there, I always get the feeling that I'm invisible. I was sharpening my penknife once, and a girl even came to check where the sound was coming from, stopped about a meter away from me, and scrutinized the area for what seemed like half a minute, looking for the source of a constant scraping sound(my knife on my whetstone... <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> ), <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">and still did not notice me</span></span>  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
I don't do anything intentional(no shielding, &quot;melting away&quot;, or anything...), just sit down there, and I seem to turn invisible involuntarily. I have to add that I naturally have a talent for staying out of sight and hiding, so this might not mean much. But still, it occurs every time I sit down there, and it occurs involuntarily. Sometimes it frustrates me to no end... <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />
