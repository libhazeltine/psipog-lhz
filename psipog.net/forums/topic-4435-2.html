The idea that we're stuck in the &quot;now&quot; is an illusion, as well as past and future. It's all simultanious.
<br />

<br />
You could say time is the sixth sense, actually, because it doesn't exist outside of perspective. Correct me if I'm wrong.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
So, if you were going to &quot;travel&quot; through time, you wouldn't really be travelling, only changing your perspective. And you don't need a psiball for that.
<br />

<br />
This is all in theory, of course.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

			Does anyone else find the concept of time travel a little confusing?  I mean, with certain circumstances it makes no sense.  To use a simple example, you drop something valuable on the floor and it breaks.  So, you go back in time and stop yourself from dropping it.  However, that changes the timeline, and all of a sudden you never had the need to go back in the first place, so you didn't.  But you did, so now what?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Another good example is the story of the video game, Shadow Hearts, where the girl falls in love with with the main character, only to end up back in the past to find out she becomes his mother. (Is there even a word for reverse Eudipus complex?)   So technically, there are two of that girl, young and old, existing at the same time.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  Man, I hate time stuff.
<br />

<br />
The only reason why i would really want to try going back into the past, would be to see if fate really exists.  I meana fter all, if you go back and do things to change the future, and nother actually changes, then you must have been fated to go abck to do it anyway, right?

			Ugh. It would be impossible to change the future in that way, if that object was going to break and you somehow went back in time to stop it, it would have already happened. See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_paradox" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_paradox</a>

Easy. you answered your own question partly there. If you break the vase, you go back in time to stop yourself, thus having no need to break the vase, you would exist simultaneously with your other self, possibly a few seconds older.  And if you had the power to go back in time, chances are the combined two of you would dominate the entire universe in a matter of hours.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

			I think that in the end, the whole concept of time (whether it exists or not) is probably pretty easy to understand. I think trying to explain it like we are (using language) is where everything becomes difficult. Since language is so cut and dry and absolute, I don't think anyone can adiquately explain time's properties.
<br />

<br />

<br />
btw, in my physics class we watched a movie on time travel. One of the scientists being interviewed said that he had been exploring time travel for years and he believes he has figured out a way to travel to the future and for the future to travel to us. He says that all you need to do is gather lasers that are very powerful and position them in a circular fashion. Then you do a whole bunch of mumbo jumbo that i can't remember and at that moment when everything is complete and you press the on button, people from the future would be able to travel to that present time. What that said, we cannot travel to the past but those from our future can travel to our present time.

			i dont know how anyone would really know exactly how much energy it would take to go back into time. have you tried it? have you been successful. i think that unless you have some experience under your belt, you shouldnt just throw stuff out there.

im not implying that i know either, cause i dont. i havent had any experience with time travel.

			I really like this topic on having to think about it times before (some headaches) so I thought id share my own 2 cents.

<br />
Useing the secnario from before.
<br />
If it was possible to stop the object from breaking, once time would be altered you would have no intention of going back thus never happening in the first place.
