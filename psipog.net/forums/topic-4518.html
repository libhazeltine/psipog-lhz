			Hi guys. It's pretty late so I just wanna get this comment out because it was on my mind. I found this site not to long ago and I always get pretty amazed at the unknown. But you gotta wonder if its fake or not at times because it is unheard of to the real world. now to my question, in which it relates. This has probably been asked lots of times so forgive me, but I need to know the answer.
<br />

<br />
Why don't the ones that have practiced this for years like joet(amazing vids btw) come out to the public and let there knowledge be known? Now, I know what some are thinking. What do you have to prove to anybody? What do you have to prove to me? Well this is not just your pride on the line, and this isent to prove anything to me specificly. 
<br />
This is for history. This is for mankind. And I am dead serious when I say this. Not trying to sound corny, but this is for the world. It is an amazing thing, and it needs to be known.
<br />

<br />
It's the only thing that holds me back from believing its real because of the lack of &quot;comeing out&quot;. Well, time for sleep.

They probably still called a fake.

It'll solve nothing or achieve anything great. More that'll come out, the same number of skeptics will form.

			What does &quot;coming out&quot; consist of?  Imagine you had the same skills has JoeT - what steps would you perform?  Would you go to a University and be tested?  I think Joe already did that (or is planning on doing it).  Would you do the Randi challenge?  Joe has spoken to Randi a couple times on the phone about it (correct me if I'm wrong).  A lot of people say we should &quot;come out&quot; and &quot;tell the world&quot; about this stuff.  But that doesn't make any sense.
<br />

<br />
HOW do you &quot;come out&quot;?  HOW do you &quot;tell the world&quot;?  I think PsiPog.net is a great start - we have 13,000+ members.  There have already been news reports on psychic abilities.  Project STARGATE is openly available for the public to read about.  The world knows about psychic abilities... this stuff isn't a secret.  A lot of people just don't care, or have negative beliefs about psychic abilities.  Very few people actually don't believe in psychic abilities.

			Very true. People aren't just ready. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
In my country, instead of saying &quot;that's bullshit!&quot; they would probably go on about magik, miths, legends and demonic stuff. Most of people here have a very medieval mentality.
<br />

<br />
That made me remember one time I suggested psipog to a friend. She rejected it because she liked more spiritual things and that stuff (whitelight mentality), she must be practicing magik by now. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
I'd like to first welcome evildead01 to the forums. I hope you have a wonderful time learning, good luck <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. I have been tested several times by my local college professors with many success rates. I do plan on applying more of my time to the science of psychokinesis however I have a few more important priorities before I make time to perform testing again.
<br />

<br />
I have spoken and discussed psychokinesis as well as remote viewing with James Randi over telephone conversations twice. At first, he agreed to schedule an appointment and testing however, I have yet to receive any phone calls for future planning. He wasn't too thrilled to hear that I am a technical remote viewer or that I have documentation concerning previous testing with local professors. 
<br />

<br />
Although I would love to share my progress/skill with Psychokinesis and remote viewing, I do not see that happening in the near future. I'm currently going through college drama and I'm sure we all can agree that school can be time consuming <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. 
<br />

<br />
I firmly believe that if more people perform psychokinesis, science will spend more time researching/testing this amazing ability. Although psychokinesis is currently being tested by several organizations, I believe that the scientific community should give more effort to researching/testing. So, my goals are to help as many people as I can to help get the ball rolling.
<br />

<br />
Thank you for the comment on my video's, I appreciate it. Good luck with psionics. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
<br />

<br />
- JoeT

			You know what I watched last night? The first x-men movie.
<br />

<br />
The concept on that movie is also the problem this community faces, in a way. These mutant people have incredible powers but no matter how much they help people, humans still consider them a threat. So...if psions were to come out all of a sudden and show people what we could do, they'd become scared, and they wouldn't trust us at all. Especially the psions who were very skilled at it. Or they'd call us fakes.
<br />

<br />
Plus...some things such as clarivoyance and other things considered psychic, also brings up fortune telling in some people which is said in the bible to be the works of demons. People can jump to conclusions very quickly. ;P
<br />

<br />
I say, if you wanna prove it to someone, prove it to a close friend or anyone you know who will be amazed by it. Therefor you spread the skill on people who do believe, not on skeptics.

Sounds a bit pathetic, doesn't it? We humans presume a great mental ability of deduction and brain flexibility, while ourselves smash the idea to smithereens by demonstrating we can close our minds and keep them safer from new information than the earth does with it's core. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

<br />
I think the world is TOO ready for it, and you are simply insecure about your belief in the existence of psi.  After all, the 'other' people are simply blind to the truth.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> Honestly, you're starting to sound like a religious zealot.

			JOHNNY, you should have entered your sn like a normal person, but anyway... if you hadn't noticed, there are quite a few &quot;religious zealots&quot; who just love to talk about how psychic powers, and smurfs, and Barney&amp;Friends come from the devil and are attempts to draw children into &quot;occultic&quot; beliefs.

now first that is retarded, and second, Occultic is not a word, google occultic and you'll find thousands of overzealous twats using the non-existant word, &quot;occultic&quot; and talking about how witches should still be burned.

Believe me, I'm not saying that &quot;the world isn't ready&quot; because I'm insecure about my religion, know why? Because I have no religious belief, I'm all &quot;I won't belive blindly but search with wide open eyes&quot;. I don't base my life in Bible or Torah or Confucious sayings. That's why I like this forum rules, I won't have to bear with people trying to &quot;convert me&quot; to any religion or bring me back to my parents' religion.

I don't think it's all about your government, I've heard that even the URSS and China had their own psychic experiments, but I think they had other excuses rather than money. Maybe national security? Maybe the fact that they are not obliged to do so?
