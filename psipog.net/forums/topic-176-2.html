			It's extremely hard for me. I have only done it once, and it was when I wasn't focused on doing it.
<br />

<br />
I was looking out my window towards the sun and shut my eyes, put my hands over my eyes, and was able to see a shifting hazy blue outline of everything I would've seen with my eyes open. 
<br />

<br />
But then the picture faded away.. really was an awesome experiance

To the other guy with the weird sig: Nice, blue hazy outlines can mean one of many things: Remote Viewing, Eye Strain, or something else.

			I highly doubt a near 100% success rate is due to aol. That is impossible, or at least quite improbable. I only do that as a game with my friends anyway. This is not a serious skill for me since I find it quite easy to do. I may pursue it more later on, but for now, I'm developing better psychokinetic functioning.

			I would be really interested in learning this skill. 
<br />

<br />
I honestly think that if someone can find a way to perform this under any and all conditions, at will, they would effectively find a possible cure for blindness... seeing without the eyes! Because, as far as I know, blindness is caused by something being wrong with the eyes. If one does not need the eyes to see, then it should follow that blindness would be eliminated.
<br />

<br />
If any has any ideas, I'd like to hear them!

			Back when I was trying to meditate (this was a few weeks ago), I had my eyes closed, and I saw stuff in my room perfectly, as if I was looking right at 'em.  Now, I'm not sure whether it was because of some psionic function, my mind recreating my room, or being way out of it and forgetting that my eyes were open, but...  I might try to recreate the event again, under better circumstances.

It'd be interesting if it really is eyeless sight, though.  Can see how it'd be a useful skill, pun not intended.

From what I've seen, its extremely hard to get anything close to that.. because psychic input gets translated to your physical senses. That's not to say you still couldnt run off intuition, or still use sensing to 'feel' your way around..
<br />

<br />
Its also known as dermo-optical perception. Theres a whole bunch of articles on google.

I've read about something called etheric projection that has that effect. Only I read that there is usually a strange quality to the light, usually a golden color. Something about an inner eye opening, can lead to an astral projection if you leave your body then the room. You may have done that by mistake...

			Astral Projection is a touchy subject in the forums. Technically, it can be seen as religious, but at the same time, it is a legitimate Psi ability. 
<br />

<br />
Very confusing.
<br />

<br />
I guess if we just look at Projection (notice how I dropped the &quot;Astral&quot; bit) in a secular light, then we can explore the ability without causing too many problems. 
<br />

<br />
(Shall we see how long we can keep a projection thread going before it gets locked? <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> )
<br />

<br />
But anyways, back to the Eyeless Sight. It would probably be very useful to people who were born healthy, and lost their sight at some point in life. It wouldn't be as effective for those who never <span style="text-decoration: underline">had</span> sight to begin with, though it would, most likely, still have its merits.
<br />

<br />
Anyone got any ideas for how it might be done?

			Obviously through practice. You can start by doing things like 'feeling' your way around your room, sensing movement, getting a deck of cards and 'seeing' what it is..

			i have kind of been able to see with my eyes closed, for about a week i walked outside in the woods blindfolded forabout 30-45 minutes, then one day all of a sudden  i could see all the trees, it was awsome. im not sure if i what i was seeing was just the energy of the trees or the tree its self, because it didn't look at all like my normal vision. but it was still one of the most exciting things that has ever happen to me.

			Back to the topic of reading while touching the material, I myself, have never done this.  Although, i do feel that it would be possible quite simply.  Now i see some people asking about what is the point to touching the material? Well, i can't say this for complete fact, but i can say this out of a personal theory.  I think that the reason you touch the material is due to the fact that it improves focus, it is kind of like putting coordinates on something, except it is a direct link through your hand.  I also believe that you dont have to be touching something in this theory, as long as you can get your mind to willfully be strong enough in order to see the object/text clearly.  I hope this helped a couple of you out, and its my first post, so please bare with me <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
