			I've been doing psionics for about a month or so and I seem to have a strong visualization for things.....meaning I can visualize extremely well. I've been making psiballs for quite some time now and I do get physical feelings from it. EX: cold, tingling, hot, pressure, magnetism etc. it depends on what I'm visualizing. I've been also trying to spin a psiwheel for about 2weeks. I used tin foil to spin one but I haven't been able to spin it under a glass container. When outside, it spins only for 180 degrees then stops. I decided to move on to paper. There was no success in that. It seems to me that the problem is that so many things are going on in my life, I can't seem to concentrate on a visualization or even focus. I need a strong and effective visualization and a guaranteed way to calm myself and block any distractions. I tried making shields to block disturbances but I can't seem to get it. As for the psiballs, I can't seem to get it to act natural. Some psions here have been saying that the psiballs they make are moving in such a way, its hard for me to believe they are even telling the truth. I could imagine my psiball moving in any way I like; so how do I get it to move as if I'm not imagining it to? I really need effective methods for visualization and concentration. Can you guys give me some tips?

I tried reading the articles but there seems to be no help.

			I'm going to throw a bit of Psych at you.  While visualization is important, if you tell yourself that what your visualizing isn't good enough then your sub-c will make it real.  Be very cafeful that you don't confuse &quot;I can't focus right now&quot; with &quot;I'm not focusing enough&quot;.  The two may sound similar, but they mean very different things.  You have to be VERY exact in your language when training your sub-c.  It doesn't &quot;get the jist&quot; of what your saying, it takes what you say 100% literally.
<br />

<br />
If you try to move something and say &quot;I can't do this&quot; to yourself you just told your mind that you literally &quot;can't&quot;.  If you try to move something and say &quot;I'm not focusing today, I'll <span style="text-decoration: underline">do</span> better tomorrow&quot; they you are literally setting up your mind to do it tomorrow.
<br />

<br />
If your haven't problems that interfere with your ability to focus, take a break.  If you keep trying and failing your mind will expect you to keep failing.  Take some time and deal with whatever is taking your focus then start moving objects again.  Unless your going to die in 3 months, it isn't a race.  Take the time you need and set yourself up for success.
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure what your asking near the end.  Please retype &quot;I could imagine my psiball moving in any way I like; so how do I get it to move as if I'm not imagining it to?&quot;  This doesn't make sence.

For working your concentration muscles.  Find a rock on the ground and find a quiet place to look at it.  Stare at it, turn it over in your hands.  When you feel you have a good handle on how it looks, set a timer for 1 minute and close your eyes and just picture the rock.  If your mind wanders, ask it to go back to the rock and restart the timer.  Next time add a minute. Repeat as often as you feel comfortable you are making progress in the length of time you can focus on the image of the rock.  Pick a new thing each day to consentrate on, this will help because your mind won't get bored so easy.
<br />

Your mind is going to look either for higher priorities or new stimuli.  When you started psiballs were all new and shiny toys for your mind.  Then it got bored.  When you started you put a high priority on practicing psi.  Now the toy has started to become familier and other things are fighting over priority in your mind.  Sort out whatever's competing for priority, then try and find ways to keep your mind from being bored while you practice psi.
