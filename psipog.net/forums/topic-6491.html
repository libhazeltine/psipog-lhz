			Ok so about a month ago i had a dream about somebody teaching me how to fly. He tought me the exact technique of flying (levitating myself). so i forgot about it, then just today i read a post about someone with x-ray vision and their dream that tought them that. I then remembered my dream, and it took me awhile to remember how, but then i remembered the technique. i concentrated, then i felt the floor go a bit lower. I looked down but i was still on the ground. dissapointed, i walked back to my computer, the relized that i wasnt touching the ground.... I looked down, and then i felt contact with the ground once again... but i did fall a little bit (maybe an inch but i could still tell that i was hovering). 
<br />

<br />
           another thing is that is it possible that everybody has a person in their head (their subconcious maybe) that teaches them stuff? because the &quot;teacher&quot; tought me how to fly correctly (still working on it, little success). maybe the person with x-ray vision had a &quot;teacher&quot; in their head &quot;teaching&quot; them how.
<br />

<br />
I would like to hear other peoples thoughts and opinions on this topic.
<br />

<br />
(P.S) I didnt post the technique, because im not sure if im aloud, am i?

			I'm pretty sure you can post the technique. In fact, I suggest you do so because I'm certain that there's lots of people who would want to try this themselves.
<br />

<br />
Anyhow, on topic now: I don't think I've ever really had a dream teacher, at least none that I've noticed. I've solved programming problems in my sleep, but that doesn't exactly count. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			i dont know i saw something like &quot;dont teach others without permission...&quot;
<br />
i really dont want to get banned, especially, because u cant make any more accounts. i want to make sure that i wont get in trouble.
<br />

and about your dream, do you remember there being anyone else at all, or maybe a presence that you felt but couldnt see that was almost &quot;Guiding&quot; you? Maybe you had the dream but dont remember it, but it did teach you something overnight.

Perhaps. I tend to forget most of my dreams, excepting the really strange ones. Like the one I had last night about Leonard Nimoy coming to my high school reunion in women's undergarments and yelling drunkenly at the teachers... I woke myself out of that one pretty quick.

			There is a difference in teaching and posting the technique. Regardless, there isn't any moderating anymore as the site is going to down pretty soon.
<br />

<br />
I recommend you do so, or you'll look like an idiot if you can't even post the tech.

At this moment, I think you're retarded and a fluff.

			alright i guess it doesnt matter anymore so here i go...
<br />

<br />
im warning u i trained for like eight hours straight in my dream, so it might take u awhile. I have also trained in levatating objects for my whole psionic career, so im just going to say it WILL take a long time of practice.
<br />

<br />
ok so here is what i did
<br />

<br />
I visualize air flying around me, I hear the wind scoweling and whisteling, then i feel it brushing up against me in the form of wind. I open my eyes and keep concentrated still feeling, and hearing. Then the air moves upward and it starts to lift me up. the air is under my control. I imagine myself becoming as light as a sheet of paper (however you choose to do this, it will probably work) then the air moves upward quickly, and i am pulled up slightly. concentrate on staying focused. dont think about anything. keep your mind clear. after a while, you should feel the ground leaving your feet, but dont look... stay focused. then you will feel strange sensations of tingeling, but stay focused. After a few moments, when you feel steady, look down, but be expecting to be hovering above the ground. If you get surprised, then u will fall. be ready to be hovering, look down and see yourself flying. 
<br />

<br />
all i have been able to do is hover, so thats all i know how to do. also take note that the air probable isnt real, so nobody else will feel it.
<br />

<br />
practice this every day, and soon enough you will hover.
<br />

<br />
also lately i have been talking about not reading articles, so i suggest u make ur own way of hovering, it will be much easier for you.

			Thats nothing I once had a nightmare about that robot from &quot;short circuit&quot; in the basement. There were tons of them and I turn to run up the stairs and trip on a banana and did a 180 turn to the robots in slow motion. I mean REAL slow I saw them reaching out to me...
<br />

<br />
Also a another when I open my backyard screen door and saw. Tons of little girls in my back yard in purple alien uniforms and a purple UFO. I gone into a mini space shuttle and started to drive down a allyway with my brothers. I was afired of high places and the shuttle landed back on the ground right after it lifted up a little.

			It is stated by experts that we forget about 70-75 % of our dreams in just a short time of 10 min. after waking up.
<br />
And ,ofcourse,I too had a dream about a dream teacher but it was not about tk.It was about music.I saw one of the greatest singers ever (i ,well,don't want to say his name here.)coming to my school and teaching me.Well,all I can say is that &quot;its just a DREAM&quot;
<br />

<br />
And on the flying technique :- An almost-flying method has already been found out.The technique is fine and it works.This method is used by the Ninjas.When you study Ninjutsu,you will learn a technique in which a ninja concentrates and focuses all (or partly) of his body weight into a particular point in the body such as fingertips.When you get even more advanced in the training,the body weight is concentrated on an external point like a pen or some other stuff.At that time,the pen has its own weight along with your body weight.Thus you become less in weight and can move faster,jump higher and you can ,then,defy gravity.
<br />

<br />
Well,this method is succesful but the even the ninjas can't really FLY.They do something like.....well,watch the movie Crouching tiger Hidden dragon... <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

Anyway, once I tried to create a teacher in my dreams in which everyday I would go to him and he would teach me psionic things.  I did have a few lucid dream (obviously because I induced them) with him and he taught me some energy manip stuff, but I don't think anything serious was taught.  I'll keep an eye out though. And thanks for the tech. I'll give it a shot.

			yea, and also (this is just an idea) i don't think you could be successful in a lucid dream, because then you are trying to teach yourself stuff. If it is a non-lucid dream, then your sub-c is controling the dream, so it should work then. I guess it is just luck if you get a &quot;dream teacher&quot;.

			Right that's what I was thinking.  Oh and also, I guess I would kind of be teaching myself, though I would create the intent so start it out and let it carry out, just aware I'm be taught.. Just sayin.
