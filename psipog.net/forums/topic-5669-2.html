			Hmm. What if we define &quot;psion&quot; to &quot;someone who has had noticeable success with any psionic skill&quot;? It does take a bit of intelligence (adaptability and all that) to get there, yes?

			not really.  Some people can do telepathy from the beginning of their life.
<br />

<br />
all humans can decide to start psionics.  Thats how we all got started.

My answer is no.

Still, *most* psions didn't do telepathy consciously before they started practicing.[/sidetrack]

Yes, but not all of them get far enough to fit into the definition I made. That is, having success. And I think more than half of those who get success are above average intelligent.

			Well, most with above average usually take the time to understand what the fuck they are doing.

Obviously, being fit mentally and physically will help with psi, it's part biological what we do. Yet, that doesn't mean only the high IQ or intellect people can do psionics.

			Psions may use a tiny bit more of their brain. But that doesnt make them smarter. So I voted no

			I have known some very, very stupid people who have success with psionics. I agree that conceit is the only thing that would make someone believe that psionic ability makes them more intelligent than anyone else. Some of the smartest people I know scoff at psionics, and some of the most unintelligent are talented in psionics. It's a matter of innate ability, not intelligence- for example, some guys are really good at football. Just innately have a talent for football. Have you talked to some of these football players, though? They can be dumb as a rock. And by the by, that damn ten percent theory is a myth. Don't refer to it anymore. It's a sign of ignorance.

			I remember listening to a audio book &quot;The Genius Formula&quot; and I learn that the basic IQ test we are given are only &quot;3&quot; out of &quot;10&quot;. I have to look up the other names for the other 7 tests but our IQ is often thought up on a averange from it. The tests we don't take include (ones I remember)
<br />

<br />
creative=mixing things up and yet still make sense
<br />
interpersonal=How well you can interact with others
<br />
intrepersonal=How well you can interact with yourself
<br />
Spirital=Connected with nature
<br />

<br />
The 10th test, the &quot;Genius&quot; IQ test. It test your base on a mixure of the other 9 tests to see your total ability. This audio book was made in 1997 but I still find it nice to listen to. 
<br />

<br />
Personaly when I was in high school I toke a IQ test to settle a agurement (to prove to a teacher if I was retarded or not) Which I got 136 (the teacher always mock me with his &quot;master&quot; degree afterwards). Recently I tried again to see what I get late one night and I got 127. I don't think the IQ test is wroth anything, your not even tested on everything (like it manners). You all could well be a genius on some other IQ test and not even know it. lol
<br />

<br />
Darnet...I gone on talking in a discussion to myself again, you problitly didnt need to hear all that.
<br />

<br />
I guess the best way to find a stupid psions, is to ask him
