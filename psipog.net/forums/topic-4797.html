Use that anger and put it to something good. You wont accomplish anything when you're frustrated.
<br />

<br />
Try a using a different perspective or technique to get what you want to do done.  Also, keep practicing. 4 days isn't long.  It took me nearly a year to get any good results.

			It's quite random on how long you can get it, it can go from hours to years.
<br />

<br />
Have you tried different things of PK? LIke DMILS or pyro manipulation or cryo manipulation. What about sliding or rolling...levitation? Trust me, I've done most of this trying to use PK successfully, eventually getting lucky on Sliding and DMILS.
<br />

<br />
Just keep practice, you've not trained long enough.

Caps lock makes you special.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, the idea behind that (as I understand it), is that you have to realise that the boundaries between objects is all in our minds.  After all, we're all just different forms of energy at different densities and there really are no boundaries between us and any other object or person.
<br />

<br />
Of course, my saying that doesn't imbue you with the ability to do PK.  One of these days it'll just *click*.
<br />

<br />
Might I recommend you go meditate?  It sounds to me as though your mind could use some down time.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />   Good luck.

it took me just over a year, but I didn't practice at all for most of that time.

<br />
It sounds like you're getting really pissed off and so you're probably concentrating too hard, dexo. Try imagining both of your hands slowly catching on fire. The fire should be your favorite color, or purple works good- it's what i use. Now see the fire spread to your whole hand. Now that both of your hands are completely on fire, go to your psi wheel and cup your hands around it. Now just relax your mind. Don't get distracted, keep focused and remember your intent to move the psi wheel. But just relax. I did this and then it started spinning for me, my first time. I made an awesome video on my second day where it spun for, like, 20 spins and then I stopped on purpose.
<br />

<br />
P.S. tin foil psi wheels are easier just in case you're using paper.

			Becoming 1 with an object:
<br />

<br />
JoeTs Methods: Visualize the room you are in is all white.  Only you and the psi wheel are blue.  Tell yourself 3-5 times, &quot;There is no difference between the psi wheel and you.&quot;  
<br />

<br />
What I do is, visualize an energy beam coming from me to the psi wheel.  Also, after reading Gnomes article about sensitivity, I put my awareness around the psi wheel. 
<br />

<br />
Always remember, you DONT have to become one wiht an object to move it.  Just ask Neveza.  He always makes it clear how he never links with it.   If you dont want to link with an object or become one with it, then use the Just Do It method.   To do this, I go into the Alpha State (search for hwo to do this) and just know that the psi wheel has to move.  Then you just watch it move.  That method is so hard to explain. 
<br />
