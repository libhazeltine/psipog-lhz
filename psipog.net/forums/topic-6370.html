			As I said in my hello thread....The universal mind is one of my greatest intrests.
<br />
Universal mind being the all knowing mind of God, or the mind of all sentient beings combined. I had read that while in the Theta state of mind one becomes receptive to the universal mind AKA akashic records, and while in the Delta state one becomes unified with it.
<br />
I've been practicing suspending between the sleep states and the conscious state
<br />
and during these states I have visions, most often auditory but sometimes visual and auditory.  These visions come true.  
<br />
I think my abilities has everything to do with the DNA activation, higher chakra system, time travell oversoul merging....meditation...
<br />
Perhaps the most memorable one.....being memorable because I remember it,
<br />
is I distinctly heard ..somebody order a pizza...then I came downstairs turned on the TV and started to watch mad TV...sure enough ...knock knock knock...
<br />
&quot;somebody order a pizza&quot; one of the charcters remarks.....It was eerie..
<br />
than I started to ponder If all my visions would happen.....I should start writing them.
<br />
So....anyone who is in tune with universal mind or even has any idea what im talking about....use this thread to post predictions..........
<br />
As for me ....I don't think i'll predict anything.........
<br />
unless you ask.........
<br />
&quot;One question...only one.....not two......ask one....Not one question each...
<br />
only one question.......I will read universal mind...hopefully recieve an answer for you......Seriously though..&quot;

			Calling the universal mind god is a misconception. The universal mind is an experience of the origin of all thought. We can't comprehend something that huge and not sentient so we label it conscious and warp it into a conscious being, in our minds. Focus on not all this scientific relation crap with DNA and brain waves. That does not work. Just search for that experience of connection with the whole universe. And do it again and again.

			yeah, seriously the DNA stuff(and your physical anything) has nothing to do with pretty much anything.  It's just what allows us to learn stuff and stuff.

Also dont get caught up with trying to get abilities, their neeto but pointless also...if you goal is to be Delta all the time.

			Well actually, when returning consciousness to that of the physical level, after being in a superconscious state, it takes some processing to take that information with you, so to say, into the physical vehicle. The brains cannot handle every experience directly. Some people fail to integrate the experience so to say and take that with them when they return to the physical, so I bet DNA has deffinately something to do with all this stuff and is very important for the physical body in the sense of processing information and 'saving' transformative experiences, but I am no expert on the subject of DNA, this is just my frist thought.

If Meta is right then buddha's descendants should be getting enlightenend much faster than everyone else and there should be some change in physiology between buddhists monks and normal people. I don't believe there is though. The hardness in 'storing' this experience though is that it comes in thought perception and emotion form. It has to be formed collectively as this 'tri-mental event' and that's hard to do. I can't back it up though so all of our hypothesis are equally possible. I just don't believe DNA could be a 'memory' for the universal mind.

			Indeed, mmory is the wrong word. I was actually aiming more at the fact that the dna unlocks more potential as we evolve. It changes as to suit our current state of evolution.

			I just dont think dna would need to do that.  We dont physically evolve during our lives.  Like, where not going to sprout an arm cause it's handy to have a third arm.  I'm just missing why the dna would need to change at all in the first place.

			I know what you mean, but if at all the dna changes, it is a result of consciousness's evolution, and not a requirement beforehand. It is just the body adjusting to suit your evolution.

			But dna relates to our physical things.  It really wouldn't have anything do with our psychological character changing.

			All our bodies are intertwined, the mental body does not exist on its own, it feeds of the causal body, and it interacts and communicates with the physical body. All bodies change when your mind changes, except for the highest few bodies. The physical, etherical, pranic and mental body and higehr mental body change though when you 'evolve' or in other words progress very quickly in thought and being: transformation.

			But dna is a about our physical make up.  If you change it, part of our bodies would change.  Something noticable usually.  Like eye color.  Dna wouldn't change nor need too becuase your divinity is showing through more, as for as I understand.
<br />

<br />
What do you think wouldn't need to change?  Like what part of our body or somthing.

			Well the best way to explain evolution, is there are two sides: There is consciousness, and there is matter. The different levels of our bodies are made up from matter. be is gross matter, be it subtle matter. What happens when we 'evolve' is that the capability to correctly respons to, and express our manifested vehicles, according to the demands of  our consciousness increases. Consciousness itself is already perfect and eternal. It can not evolve. What evolves is consciousness ability to communicate with it's vehicles, and the vehicles capability to respond to consciousness commands. So yes, all our bodies, including our dna and physical body, change and evolve with the purpose of allowing purer expression of consciousness.
<br />

<br />
When consciousness has the body of an animal, say a dog, it has less capabilities of expressing itself. It is to consciousness a huge handicap and it does not allow him to express his powers, creativity and whatever more to a great extend. The lower and less intelligent the body that the individual consciousness is incarnated in, the more limited and imprisoned he is. Now the human body allows for much more expression than a dog's body correct? However, the human physical body is still a major obstacle, or rather a vehicle we need to learn how to master and refine. It evolves to allow for better and clearer expression as we go. I don't know exactly to what extend dna has got to do with it, but I heard lots of rumours about it and I bet it has alot to do with our capability to express ourselves and our power through this physical vehicle.
<br />

<br />
So evolution depends on the vehicles capability to respond to consciousness, and the pureness and perfection of communication from consciousness to it's vehicle. this is basically what we are training on a very minor level and a very low pace with psionics. We are refining the body and training the capability of consciousness to express its demands on our vehicles and on mother Nature. (Matter)

			It's a pitfall to believe that Delta states are ultimate because you can only remain in them for so long. If you were in this Delta state forever you're in a peaceful oblivion forever but with no contact of outside life.
