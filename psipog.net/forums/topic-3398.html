			I've known about RV for a few years now, and I would give it a 'shot' and sometimes I'd get it right sometimes wrong. But I never really believed it was real, to me it was simply a matter of luck. Well I was in another forum which discusses remote viewing also, and they had a test there, where they determine a thing or place and later gave a link to the picture. So I gave it a 'shot' and so did others, and about a week later I saw the picture and it scared me. Cuz I was the only one that 'guessed' it was a white vehicle and it was a white van. I was a bit stumped you can say. I still doubt it in some ways, I guess I just want to practice a bit more to see if how real it is and learn from the pros. Cuz I'm a big skeptic with these sort of things.
<br />

<br />
I would also like to add that another person from that forum referred me to this one, because this one seems to focus more on these things. Anyway see you all around.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Indeed remote viewing is very real.  During World War II the russians tested a lot of psionics, one being remote viewing.  The U.S. found papers on this and decided to try out remote viewing.  They had a lot of names for it, the best known was Project Stargate.  They had sucessfully found a plane that was lost only being a few feet off from the exact location, along with that they had found some hostages being held and many other things.  After this war they closed this project, but one of the members teaches it to anyone that wants to try it out.  Some people don't really need it taught to them, but on average people are usually 88% correct on what they see and that is an awfully high number to be just pure chance.  Do some digging for progect stargate and anything else, maybe it will completly swat you towards the fact that remote viewing is truly real.

			As EliteSinkes said above, the governments have been using RV for a while...and it's good to want a little proof instead of following blindly...but don't go all crazy with skepticism <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Yumper made a great guide that you can learn with and there are a few of us here that remote view <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I know its real from what i can do. ESPECIALLY what my friend can do. trust me its as real as your hands and feet. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
its just that it does take some practice like everything else and if your not good at it it will take more practice which is why it leads people to believe its not real. i was ok at it from that start an di hope your are too.

you know you may need to ellaborate a little for me and explain exactly what you mean. when you say learn you mean random little spurts of the skill every now and then and mastering you mean being able to fully channel the skill?
