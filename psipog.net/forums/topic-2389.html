			I don't really understand what you're asking, exactly.
<br />

<br />
A lot of times when I have an OBE, I don't see things clearly.  Objects are distorted, or vision is just crappy all together.  Sometimes I don't see anything, and get around via feeling.
<br />

<br />
Hearing voices in your head before sleeping sounds like hypnagogic hallucinations ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogic" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogic</a> ).  I've experienced them too - you are <span style="font-style: italic">sort</span> of close to an OBE, but I can't really explain where your mind has to move to get into the OBE state.  It's something I've learned from trial and error/personal experience, and it can't really be put into words.

			I've been trying OBE and found that my vision was blurred and sort of off-balance but I've only tried a few times so wether I was actually out of my body or not I don't know.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> I know what you mean though.

			hmm for ex: in your room you see window beside it plant and beside it chair . you done obe then you look at the window you saw it then you look at the plant you did not see it and saw it as dark space then you look at chair and you saw it . i mean missing things at your sight , maybe because as beginer and in future with practice you will see everything ?
<br />

<br />
( that dark space is like you look in dark room).

			When I had one OBE, it was easy to see. This is one I didn't try to get. And the other one that I tried so hard to get came but the vision was so crappy, I couldn't tell if I was out of my body or not. Maybe trying makes the difference to sight? <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> I don't know. Just a suggestion because I have had only two OBE's in my life so there aren't too many to be able to find chaos in a pattern or anything like that. Send a post for and for all on what you think, anyone?

			I have heared that the first times you go into an OBE you need a time to get used to your astral eyes.
<br />
I also hear voices around me when i'm halfsleep but they say things with no sense, I'm making an investigation about that  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />
Those things that happen in my opinion is fear that grows the sensations of change into the astral plane and make them scare you. Stay calm and don't get stressed or try a way without making the change like awaking consciouness in a dream and going away from that dream and start an obe  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
