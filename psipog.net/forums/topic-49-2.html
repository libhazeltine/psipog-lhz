As for the topic, yeah. I'm naturally empathic too. Heck, my first attempt at using psi (this was before I'd even found psipog, man am I glad I found here) was probably decently high-leveled empathy. 
<br />

<br />
What had happened was for a church activity we'd gotten blocks of ice and were sliding down a hill. Well, one of the girls there had gone down on the block and hit an ice block that was in the way square in the chest. She was having lots of trouble breathing, an ambulance was called, and she was taken to the hospital. Needless to say, the activity was immediately ended and everyone was taken home. 
<br />

<br />
Well, I got home and going on basically instinct I visualized her lieing on a bed and tried to draw the pain from her into me. Surprisingly, it worked. From her I got this sharp pain in the chest, around the sternum, and extreme difficulty breathing. I kept on doing this on and off as often as I could while still convincing my body I could breath until about 10:15 at night. Tomorrow morning I was told that she had died. The time she had died? About 10:15 at night. 
<br />

<br />
So, yeah. Don't know why exactly I decided to share that, but here it is.

Well well well, just look who's here. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

Since I started energy manipulation, I became naturally empathic. Only after a 3 hour training session or so, I seemed to fully unlock my empathic potential. I could feel emotions much easier, just by merely wanting it. I've stopped doing empathy for a while, so I guess I'm kinda rusted. At least for now... lol.
<br />

<br />
One should do aditional shields, even if one has natural shields. Better safe than sorry.
<br />

<br />
I have this method to train empathy, and it works very well for me. If you want to give it a chance, PM me or something, I'll be glad to help. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I'm also a natrual empath. Been happening steadily throughtout my life usually with someone I'm close to. I've picked up on their emotions over the phone and MSN as well as being close to them. Sometimes it happens randomly throughtout the day. Anyway anyother Natural empaths out there glad to hear it!

			I think i'm a natural empath too. I can't remember not having it. But for a long time i didn't know what it was. I didn't even know it was something most people don't use. I didn't understand it untill i grew older, and starting with psionics. I read some articles on psipog about psychokinese, but then i readed others and also the ones about empathy, and when i readed what it was, i was like omfg. So that's what it is. I'm glad i now know what it is and that i can learn to understand it. But i always knew how other people feel, what kind of people they are when i first met them. The emotional meanings behind messages when people say something. But i never knew that it was empathy, untill i read about it.

			Well here's a question just to keep some more interesting discussion rolling instead of hearing everyone that thinks they are a natural empath. (Not that we wouldn't love to hear that, just that the thread has already gotten like ten people saying they're a natural empath).
<br />

<br />
Anyway, the question is: Do you think it's better to be a natural and not practice as much or to not be a natural at anything and have that extra need to practice harder?
<br />

<br />
I'm asking this because I'm not a natural at anything, so I was wondering what you thought on that.

			*Laughter* Even if you are  a natural at whatever it is, you can always get better, be more controlled, etc. The true definition of being a &quot;natural&quot; empath is that you cannot turn this ability off. Which is why most of us suffer from overloads is because we cannot just flick a switch or not do it any more. We constantly feel emotions from others. 
<br />

<br />
Most people could have a gift at being empathic, but if they do not feel is nearly all the time then they aren't &quot;natural&quot;. Anybody can feel the emotions of people they are close to, because well, they're close to them. Hence the term, &quot;close&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Empathy is a good skill to practice, but it's not really solid such as working with psi or telekinesis, it's fluid, it's something to be used daily not focused on, but more over felt. Not this focused state of mind, but a state of understanding.

I didn't say you couldn't get better. I was merely asking if you thought that people who start fresh off is better practice, or do you think that being a natural is better?

			It's not like you have a choice to be natural or be practiced. So truly it can't be better, since being natural isn't the be all catch all of empathy. An empath might acess other's emotions much easier, but you weigh the pro's and the cons. No one can decide what is &quot;better&quot;

			I think some aspect of natural empathy is present in everyone. The difference is being able to differentiate between psychological empathy and psionic empathy. I'm a natural empath and used to have absloutely no control over it. Psionic empathy can be controlled- psychological empathy is typically innate in everyone. If you have no aspect of empathy, you're a sociopath. As for the better to be natural or practiced, I think it's better to have some form of natural ability but also have to work to develop it, not to get it under control.

I've never seen someone who isn't somewhat empathic.  I would go so far as to say that all psionic abilities are ultimately just reflections of our physical, emotional and mental selves manifested by energy.  So a sensitive person would be deeply empathic and a jerk would lack empathy (or would be putting up a very large shield to stop their very volatile empathy) regardless of whether they are naturals or nons or whatever.
<br />

<br />
I have a biology teacher who imparted some very interesting advice to me: &quot;Always look for the simplest answer, even if it is wrong, then expand your solution slowly until it fits.&quot;  I think the distinction of who is and isn't a psion is just an arbitrary classification.  There are those who conciously understand/try to manipulate psi but I believe we all do it with every action we do, not just when we sit down and meditate or try to move a psi wheel.  I think people simply aren't using my biology teacher's wisdom and are looking for some exotic, mysterious mechanisms that run the energetic aspect of our lives rather than seeing the very simple correlations between the physical and the metaphysical.  So yes, I completely agree.  We're all empaths simply because we all have emotions and are sensitivite to those emotions.
<br />

<br />
I think the only reason people believe in any difference between physical and metaphysical empathy is the same reason people claim to be otherkin or psi-vamps or what-have-you.  People want to feel special, to rationalize that their lives are harder or different in someway because deep down they know that they're not facing their short-comings as they should be.  The only thing they can do is explain them away as unchangeable parts of themselves...

This is an interesting perspective, yes, and as I have said previously, I believe everyone does have some aspect of empathy. Some more sensitive than others in both degrees. I can vouch however, to the fact that with powerful metaphysic empathy, it can do serious damage both psycholigical and physical. I've both seen and experienced it.

			This is pretty interesting. I seem to be able to do the same thing. After I have hung out with a person (the amount of time depending on the person) I have started to feel their emotions and sometimes even know what they're thinking. Unlike you, I have been prone to quick overloads. They seem to happen randomly, taking shape in a quick shot of depression. They have been getting better recently, though.

			I believe I'm a natural empath as well but those abilities naturally develop more when you work on your third eye. If you're not overloaded, maybe you can just handle them better, or maybe you can shield. It could go either way.

			I play in a concert band.  I have no big stage-fright, when I'm by myself. (I could go on stage by myself and play and not be too nervous.)  But when I'm with the whole band, it feels like there's a thousand pounds about to crush on me.  Is this empathy, or just a different reaction to different circumstances?
