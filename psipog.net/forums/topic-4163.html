			I, no let me say, WE have heard and read and talked about TK and it's prolong use having bad side effects on your health and etc... I am a big fan of TK and it uses and am starting to try and develop my TK abilites but and after reading this excert from a very famous article about psychics and mediums. I just really wanted to let this be know without expecting results or replys from fellow psions but, none the less, reply if you feel obligated to do so. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> [/quote]

			Are you speaking of that one Russian woman who supposedly was very skilled in PK? Or something similar? She did have heart problems, but that may have been hereditary. I doubt PK will hold any detrimental effects on your health, as long as you don't over-exert yourself. And I think that's true for most things.

			Yeah, seriously man.  There's no need to be like that, just because someone is a little vague.  Especially since Gekido did reply to the part of your statement that mattered.  
<br />

<br />
As for the topic, I agree with Gekido.  I have not known any detrimental physical or mental effects to my health when I practice, even when its for extended periods of time.  Though, others begin to experience headaches soon after beginning a session.  It may be that it is simply dependant on the person, their ability, experience, and talent.

			If anything, Psychokinesis improved my health because of DMILS, but really, if you're going to practice anything, you should keep your body in check and be healthy, after all, anything can kill your from prolonged use without a break.

			Nina is sweet.. i mean have you seen her PK video..? it beats the shit out of all these little PSI wheels here. Apparently she used a form of anger channeling/tunneling to give her PKTK a boost.

i dont know what wizana mean by that .
<br />

<br />
but all i know about angry or tensetion with pk to make it stronger , it is true it will become strong and uncotrolled it may do otherthing instead of what you want like move other thing or move what you want but on other direction and tensetion and angry with tk is bad for health and bad for your aura as i experienced (own experience). 
<br />

<br />
ok good luck all

			The only thing that`ll happen when you start practicing is getting headaches I did when I tried to move a toothpick nothing happened but I got a headache for like a day or two.
