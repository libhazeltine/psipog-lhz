			Ahoy hoy all!
<br />

<br />
Well I'm pretty raw so I'll do my best to avoid any fluff.
<br />
I've been hanging around the site for a few days, ever since I wiki'd telekinesis on a whim, and mostly out of boredom. After reading what they had there (pretty standard fare) I checked a few links at the bottom and had the good fortune of finding PsiPog.
<br />

<br />
After reading almost all the tutorials I coudl find here on Psiballs and Psychokinesis - I'm happy to say I've had some success.
<br />

<br />
The other night I sat here trying to spin the psiwheel and didn't get far. When I thought I had it moving a little (wiggled back and forth a bit) it turned out to be a draft in my apartment that, while I couldn't feel, my little piece of paper on a pin definatly could. I was disappointed but understood that this could take a while.
<br />

<br />
I spent some time at work today reading the Psionics Handbook (Great resource - thank you!) and scouring the forums for techniques.
<br />

<br />
So I got some time tonight and sat down with my psiwheel. Over the course of about an hour I didn't have much luck. My wheel was 2' x 2' and  again I suspected that evil wind.
<br />

<br />
On a whim I cut it down and now it's under an inch each way. After positioning my hands, rereading both NI, Chakra's, and the Gnomish way of doing things I set back to it.
<br />

<br />
I have to say expecting it to move may have taken a while but this time I'm SURE it wasn't a draft. Initially it would only go back and forth about 45 degrees at most and I didn't feel like I was doing it. I kept focusing (and pushing annoying songs out of my head) and then it happened.
<br />

<br />
Slowly but surely it turned a complete circle, and then another. After 4 revolutions I was getting afraid that it might be the wind again. SO I stopped it and told it to go back the other way.
<br />

<br />
AND IT DID.
<br />

<br />
My heart raced a little and I lost control a bit. Over all I spent what felt like an eternity, though all too short, moving it in the direction *I* wanted. I found that leading it with my eyes helped a lot, though after a few minutes I lost control and couldn't get it moving in the direction I wanted it to, and then it stopped all together. I tried a few more times but I'm not getting more than a wiggle so I figure it's best to turn in and let my subconcious try to rationalize what just happened - better than straining myself (see, I'm paying attention! though I do have a small headache - not sure if it's related).
<br />

<br />
One thing I did notice is that at certain points it would appear to get stuck and not turn any further in one direction. Now I don't know if that was because it's paper, or just a lack of control, but turning it back the other way or a gentle nudge from a finger seemed to get it back in shape. Anyone else experience this?
<br />

<br />
Overall I have to say that it was incredible. My head still wants to blame a draft that I know wasn't there, and I'm not going to let it.
<br />

<br />
Wow. Just wow.
<br />

<br />
And this isnt' the first time something 'abnormal' has happened to me. I have dreams about future events I end up experiencing fairly often. I don't want to say it's total precognition because occassionally the sequence of events will end differently, but I will say that I've met complete strangers and had them feel very familiar. Taken jobs where I know a coworker's reaction before it happens, and so forth. I've felt areas of extreme cold that noone else has (caused a teeth chattering chill that lasted a long time too) and seen a few really wierd things too. I don't know if any of this has bearing across the board. Has anyone else noticed a link between skills?
<br />

<br />
Well I've rambled long enough I think. I'm still pretty happy about what just happened considering how long I put into it (maybe an hour total?) because I fully expected, and accepted, that it would take months to see anything like this.
<br />

<br />
And while I look forward to the day when I can roll pencils, I'll keep practicing with my Psiwheel for a good while yet. And I should probably try making a Psiball or two for focus as well.
<br />

P.S. A big thanks to everyone involved in, on, and with PsiPog. Awesome resource and very well presented. Thanks again.

			Also as an add-on to my post, I understand what people mean by not forcing it to turn. I found that when I got the wheel to move repeating 'Keep moving' over and over in my head really did keep it moving along with leading it with my eyes as I mentioned.
<br />

<br />
Just another tidbit for anyone who may find it helpful.

			Wow. 3 days? Good job. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> I've been at it for over a week (almost 2 weeks now) and still have had little success.
<br />

<br />
Try putting your psi-wheel under a clear glass and see if it moves then. That will be the only true way to test your abilities.
