			Here's an article I recently submitted. It helps break down and answer the frequently asked question, &quot;What technique should I use?&quot;

One of the most frequently asked questions is, &quot;What is the best technique?&quot; This is constantly being asked from people regarding every field of psionics. &quot;What's the best way to OBE?&quot;, &quot;What's the best method to move the psi wheel?&quot;, &quot;How should I remote view?&quot; Several people are stuck with the notion that one method is the universal and better than all others, which is far from the truth.
<br />

<br />
The best answer to this question is, experiment. Find what is best for you. Try various techniques and when you find one that &quot;feels right&quot;, then stick with it and build upon it. If this doesn't work after a day of practice, do not give up. Keep practicing. If you get no results whatsoever for several weeks and you have strong doubts that you're on the right track, then you can try a new technique and see if it works better for you. However, people often believe they're not getting results, when they actually are. A lot of times people will disregard their results because it's not the &quot;right&quot; result. If they see the psi wheel move, they'll immediately dismiss it as wind or if they begin feeling vibrations that hint towards an OBE, they'll dispel it as shivering. Do not disregard your results. If you experience any slight results, then you're probably on the right track.
<br />

<br />
There is no best method, there is no best method, there is no best method. Just like anything you do in life, you'll develop your own style and you will build upon it. An example of this is in music. Bands will usually follow a genre, but they'll begin to develop a style that sets them aside from all the other bands. Another quick example is martial arts. There are several different fighting styles. One style can specialize in defense and tiring your opponent, while another can focus on quick movement and confusing your opponent, but each are linked because their goal is to defeat your opponent. Energy training is similar. You'll begin to develop your own style and you'll discover what works best for you.
<br />

<br />
Asking other people about their methods is not bad though. You can gain insight on their technique and maybe try it out yourself and see how it works. Experimenting is a huge part in energy training. You have to find out what works for you and what does not. It's not a quick process either. People generally want things done right away and constantly demand, &quot;right here, right now.&quot; If you follow this attitude, you're hindering your progress. Patience is key. This is the true &quot;best&quot; method to energy manipulation: <span style="font-style: italic">Experiment, Patience, and Practice.</span>
<br />

<br />
The one phrase that sums this up is: self-discovery. <span style="font-style: italic">Discover yourself. . . Don't follow another's path, create your own.</span>
