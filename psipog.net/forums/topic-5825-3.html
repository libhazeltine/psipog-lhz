They're right.
<br />
The human body is a very complex organism, dependent on a great many things, some of which we don't even know everything about (if we're honest, we don't know everything about anything in this world, but that's another philosophical speech, for another time and another topic). My point is that any imbalance of all of those chemicals and different types of energy (thermal, bioelectrical, psionic, maybe) could result in permanent injury or even death. A malnutrition of the psi could be easily accomplished if you used too much at once, and although I cannot claim to know what the consequences would be, I can't imagine it would be good.
<br />

<br />
Additionally, to tack onto my last post, another proof that your own energy can hurt you: Take the electrochemical impulses from your cerebrum and put them into your brain stem. Result: You die. Cause: The electrochemical impulses from your cerebrum interferred with the preexisting ones in your brain stem, which is responsible for a lot of autonomous body functions, not the least of which are respiration and circulation. When the impulses from your cerebrum get to your brain stem, your brain stem has absolutely no clue what to do with them, your neurons start firing erratically, and you have a heart attack and lung failure all at the same time.
<br />

<br />
Psionics is not like some lame Sci-Fi original movie. There are rules. Just because you don't want your energy to hurt someone doesn't mean it won't. That's why the utmost care must be taken in the research of this mostly uncharted branch of science. We have absolutely no idea what could happen. Clover gave us some pretty definitive proof that using psi in a reckless manner can lead to personal injury. 
<br />

<br />
So let's all be careful with this stuff, all right?

your own body is quite capable of hurting itself. Think of shock. Think of psychosomatic illnesses. The truth is, if a psion knew what he was doing, yeah, he could shove a thousand psi balls into his face and only benefit from it. But there are a lot of psions who do not, in fact, know what they are doing, and it is not only possible, but quite plausible that some psionoob could shove a ball of chaotic energy over which he has no real control into his brain and cause a massive failure.

he's right, we have the power to both create and destroy. newbies please take caution, the brain is a very fragile area that controls your nerves. If it were to fail, you could fry your feeling, or your free movment.

<br />
there is a reson why psion trainers exclaim not to move large amounts of energy through large clusters of nurves.

			Yeah, Clover. I find it hillarious that no one has presented any reliable or even logical information to back up their claims or disprove mine. 
<br />

<br />
Thing about pouring water into water... Water isn't anywhere near as complex as our bodies. You're comparing apples and oranges here. A more accurate example would be dropping uranium rods somewhere other than they belong--in the containment room-- inside a nuclear reactor room. As I have stated now THREE times, the human body is a very complex and delicate machine. Any disturbance of even its smallest functions could result in a complete failure thereof. It's not energy into energy here. It's energy into the most complex machine ever to grace the planet, and if that energy is not in the proper form or put into the proper location, there are a million things that could go wrong.
<br />

<br />
Please back up your claims with something other than personal insults and gross generalizations.

			Nicely said Wraith777. But I doubt if those idiots who can't even spell correctly understand what you wrote. They must have been power hungry bums who think psionics is just some &quot;Oooh! I have superpowers now!&quot; and they want to start showing off crap.
<br />

<br />
BTW, is this scenario preventable? Let's say I was constructing a psi ball and someone's head happens to hit it. What would be a good &quot;program&quot; for the psi ball to avoid hurting someone else without affecting physical manifestation of energy (i.e. temperature change). I just renewed my interest again in psionics.

			If you were to accidentally place your head in a psiball, I'd suggest either trying to remove the psiball again, or just ground the energy from it, since I'm not entirely sure whether the psiball would remain intact, or just deteriorate. You may want to try some healing, too. I did that for the second person in my first post (the one with the headache, not the one that passed out).

			No need for throwing insults and insulting Clover's students...that just shows how stupid you are.
<br />

<br />
Now, before you jump down my throat, i'm just going to say that psiballs are just energy, which is formed from your own energy.  This energy already courses through and around you, and if it was indeed harmful, we would already be feeling the effects without shoving it into our faces <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Psiballs are just energy, and in order for them to do something, they have to be programmed to do it.  Were these psiballs programed to give headaches?  Were they programed to knock someone out?  Were they programed for any negative effects what so ever?  How sensitive to psi are these students?  The more sensitive you are, the more suceptible you are to harmful and beneficial psionic effects.  Those are questions needed to be asked.
<br />

<br />
I have thrown psiballs at many people, and have let them flow throughout (sp) my body (and head) and all that I got in return was a trance sort of feeling, and tinglyness.  Some people are very sensitive to psi, others aren't.  That's just the way it is.  It could be that these two students are more sensitive, we don't know.  I just know that through my experience, an unprogrammed psiball isn't harmful.

			Now why would I do that? You actually contributed a worthwhile and properly spelled statement. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> Both theories contributed thusfar (merely putting your own energy into yourself, and the energy interfering with your brain) seem quite plausable. I was talking to MarcusT a while back (is he well known around here?), and he said he received headaches as well if he placed a psiball in his head. I would suggest a proper study, but that may be a bit risky.

As far as I know, they were normal, unprogrammed psiballs, so it's not as if they were purposely trying to harm themselves or whatnot.

			Hmm....well, this has to be a first that i've heard of.  I guess it just depends from person to person (maybe because of sensitivity, maybe something else).  I'm mainly talking through experience though, none of my psiballs ever hurt me or gave me a headache...I guess it varies.

I agree with you, an unprogrammed psi ball, in theory, shouldn't hurt someone. However, there's still a lot we don't know about psionics and the brain, so it's wise to use caution anyway.
<br />
Additionally, there's the fact that a lot of people feel psi in different ways... Some feel it as heat energy, others feel it as electricity. Maybe this is just how their nerves interpret it, or maybe they inadvertently (or intentionally) programmed them to generate heat or release electricity. In this case, such a psi ball shoved into the head would indeed have adverse effects, as outlined in one of my longer posts on this thread.
<br />

<br />
I agree that there's less danger posed by an unprogrammed psi ball... But there's no way to say for sure that there is no danger posed at all; it's not a formal science yet, and it's kind of hard to observe with the instruments we have right now. One thing's for sure, though: Any electrical change in the brain could be disastrous, and we know that some psi balls do in fact generate electricity, or at least generate the feeling of electricity. Electricity disrupts brain waves, no matter where it came from, and if an electric psi ball were shoved into a brain, it'd be pretty bad.
<br />

<br />
So thanks for the post, Nightshade. I found it quite polite, gramatically correct, and overall logically sound. Good job <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  Fight the powers of stupidity with me!

If a proper study were to be conducted, let's make sure we use small amounts of energy and have someone trained in healing nearby. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
A proper study would be the best course of action, though. Sounds good, I'd participate if I had any good control over my psi. At the moment I'm struggling with programming.
