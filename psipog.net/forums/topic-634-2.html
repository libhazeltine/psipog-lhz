This is why we read the entire thread, I already said that, its to the tune of 1500x more energy making it realistically out of reach for now.

i'll keep practicing cause i belive there is a way to do it...space godzilla is HUGE and he can float *here i am basing myself on tv stuff* but so you wont say that i watch to much TV after all is a monster not a human...back on topic keep practicing &quot;let go&quot; of the ground completly ignore it see this gravity was discovered when some guy droped an apple, well make the shield do the opposite with your body</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Nope, two things:
<br />

<br />
1) Shields/Constructs cannot do what you yourself cannot, so you would still have to be a master in tk to pull this off
<br />
2) Learn how energy consumption fits into things, really, shields and constructs would be actually a very bad way to do this because you'd drain out all the energy in the shield before you got close to levitation.
<br />

<br />
I've said it before and I shall say it again
<br />

<br />
Is levitation *theoretically* possible? Yes
<br />
Unfortunetly, the amount of skill and energy makes it so insanely difficult that it is currently out of most of our reach to do it.
<br />
I did a little physics math with it in another thread, you know how moving a pencil is considered advanced?
<br />
It takes around 1500 times the force of that just to lift a person, then you have to maintain that force for as long as you want to stay airborne.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Theres your more thought out proof, since you don't feel like reading the first page let me bring it to the second page. Just because you read it in an article doesn't mean its real. You're going to need to get a bs detector to sift through things sometimes.

I read an article somewhere that i could fly around and shoot beams and also destroy planets. What are you on about? Just because you want to fly it doesnt mean you can, this is was seperates fluff, from reality.

			sound a bit impossible to do that kind of stuff i belive flying is alot more valid ability then throwing beams and destroying planets,lol can you imagine the amount of energy you need to at leats ,make a ki blast far more then the necessary energy to make a psiball trust me

			Ladies and Gentlemen, I think the discussion has run it's course.  The original poster asked for some insight into his levitation-like episode, and he got it.  Further postings have been theoretical rhetoric and snappy responses.
<br />

<br />
The mainstream opinion is that, A) Levitation is possible, and B) The degree of skill required to successfully levitate is far beyond anything a person could achieve in a lifetime.  Innerfire is correct in his previous posts where he states levitation can occur when there is a upward force that is greater than the force of gravity.
<br />

<br />
Any articles you read about levitation are subject to much scrutiny.  Levitation being theoretically possible seems to give free license to just about anyone involved in psionics to write an article about it.  Ernest Hemingway never fought a bull, but he wrote a lot about bull-fighting.

			ok,starting from the beggining, you said that you read an article saying that you could actually fly around,shoot beams and destroy the planet.

i agree when you say that you may want to fly but it doesnt mean you can... and i stated my point of view i believe people might be able to fly...not fly,float... but blowing planets sounds a bit impossible

			Let's take this from the beggining. I sarcasticly stated i read an article about blowing up planets in reply to the other guy that stated he read an article about flying. Kind of like a response to him saying &quot;There is allot of fluff junk out there&quot;. Do you understand now?
