A man named Sathya Sai Baba, a sixty-four year old Indian holy man, is said to have the ability to materialize objects, and many more. Supposedly he can materialize <span style="font-style: italic">specific</span> objects at request. He hands out costly rings, jewels and objects made of gold as gifts to the throngs who visit him daily and who venerate him as a saint. (The gold and everything else has proven to be 100% real. 22k the few times it was tested) He also materializes an endless supply of Indian delacacies and sweets, and out of his hands pours volumes of vibuti (sacred ash). These events have been witnessed by literally thousands of individuals including both scientists and magicians, and noone has ever detected <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> hint of trickery. One scientist has spent over 10 years researching him and wrote a book about him. (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Modern Miracles: An Investigative Report on Psychic Phenomena Associated with Sathya Sai Baba</span>) Some of the food he produces can sometimes be so sizzling hot people cannot even hold it yet. He can make syrup and oils pour from his hands and feet without any trace of the substance on his skin when he's done. Even make rare fruit (That cannot even be found in the part of india he lives) like rice with perfectly carved pics on them, and apples that when peeled, turn out to be an apple on one side, and another fruit on the other. Everytime he walks amoung the crowds that gather, he continually pours <span style="font-style: italic">huge</span> amounts of this sacred ash on outstretched hands, buckets, heads..everywhere. In one walk he produces enough to fill several drums and Dr. Karlis Osis (Director of research, American society for Psychical research), and psychologist Erlendur Haraldsson (University of iceland) saw the ash in the process of materializing. They said it 1st appeared under his palms(turned downward) in the form of granules, that crumbled into ash <span style="font-style: italic">when touched</span>.(Eliminates the possibility of sleight of hand) <span style="font-weight: bold">They say it's not the result of mass hypnosis because everything he does are open-air demonstrations that he freely allows to be [b]filmed</span> and everything shows up on tape.[/b]  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> The production of specific objects, the rarity of some of the objetcs, the hotness of the food, and the sheer volume of materializations seem to rule against deception as a possibility. Not only that, but he's been doing it for 50 years! Since he was 14, and noone has come forward with credible evidance he's faking his abilities. <span style="font-weight: bold">Untarnished reputation for 50 years is pretty good I'd say.</span> It is said he also has the ability that shamans rarely share, to be in two places at once. It's said at the snap of a finger he could dissapear from right in front of your face, to hundreds of metres away in the blink of an eye. There have also been many other accounts of meetings with Hindu ascetics who could materialize similar objects.

Yes, this is out of a respectable book, not the net. I'd love to get my hands on some of the videos.
<br />

<br />
P.S There was also a thread a long time ago talking about sustaining yourself on psi, and I have a lot of info and actual records of it being done. Although they do not think the people are living off psi, they think they're materializing the vitamins and nutrients they need right in their body. The few people are proven strong psychics and also stigmatists. <span style="font-style: italic">One woman didn't eat or drink anything for 35 years!</span> PM me if you wants specifics about it. (How she was monitered and so fourth...In the 1st six weeks she only had one bowel movement (went number 2) and, literally, her crap was analized and proven to have no trace of food. It was all mucus and bile  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> )

			You should go to India one day in search of spiritual masters and such, with a honest heart. You will meet many people who have developed some or more (some all) of these Siddhi's as they are called. I have some friends who have seen many of these siddhi's performed by masters. Levitation, teleportation, materialization etc. India is the place to be if you are interested. This I have been told by multiple close friends plus other sources. I will go there myself next year.
<br />

Nice post Derrick. Baba is probably the most famous person to posses the siddhi of materialization, simply because he isn't shy about it and use it alot of time to show everyone that it's possible.

			lol alot of people believe its tricks. but then again you have had quite a few western scientist, and what not who have spent time with sai baba with the aim to reveal him as a fake, but none have succeeded. then these blokes usually end up writing books on what a grand soul he is. also like i said about my uncles ring, and as derrick mentioned above they are 22k rings. somehow me thinks he wouldnt be able to just give away countless rings like that.

I don't think he does <span style="font-style: italic">have</span> to do it out of his mouth. The scientist's experience I was reading about had him do it from his hands. He 1st gave him a rare nut that's looks like 2 fused into one (he did this to show the man what the nut was because there was no word for it through translation.) And when the scientist asked to keep it, Sai Baba said that was fine but 1st took it back for a second, encompased it in his hands, then gave it back to the man with an intrecate jewel incrested gold band around it, with a hole at the top to thread it through a necklace. There's hundreds(thousands?) of times he does it from his hands.
<br />

<br />
And yes, he can do it anytime.
