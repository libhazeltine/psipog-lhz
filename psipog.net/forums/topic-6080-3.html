			Imo, suffering is the vehicle in which enlightenment is attained.  Siddartha didn't leave the palace to become enlightened untill he saw suffering first hand.  It's kinda circular.  What is bad, makes us good.  We learn from mistakes.  We learn to not repeat the bad choices some poeple make.  such and such...  It is VERY important to learn understand what MA said about positives and negitives.  If you cant see past what is good and bad, you wont be able to see the underlying lesson is any given event or person.  Not talking specifically to you, just stating.

			Long article, I see you like to indulge yourself in things concerning enlightenment and such.

So are you saying if I completely ignore this article and not augment myself for change because I completely accept myself then I will be fine?

			COMPLETE acceptation is rare, but in that case, you would be enlightened instantly.

I can only partially agree with that. We do learn from mistakes, both our own and other people's mistakes. However, not always does bad lead to good. For example, let's say everybody treats you like shit. For your entire life, you've had to put up with bullshit, and deal with people treating you like a dog, all the while seeing everyone else appear happy. Now, logically, that's not going to bring you any type of enlightenment. There is no lesson to learn from that (beyond that the world is a shitty place, and that people suck). All it will do is make you feel like you're not a person, or not good enough. From what I've seen, people who feel like they aren't good enough never get any type of inner peace or enlightenment.

			Very true.  Cases such as those are kind of exception because those kinds of people weren't given chances to actually be people in the first place.  Identity was ripped from them.  If they get themselves into a livable enviroment then they can look back and see how thier utterly f-ed life made them the person they were, even with regretts.  Like my mom.  Her life was filled with her family crashing down around her constantly till she was in her 20's but now she looks back and sees that she would be completely different, a wierd foriegn faux version of herself.  When hurt, you heal + some.

			Actually this article is quite true in terms of what it says. But true acceptance is where one does not strive to eliminate his bad habits or flasehoods at all. He either doesn't know or he knows something behind them. Because if I was to become enlightened I would have to forget all knowledge read from sutras to gain it. In that case it becomes redundant. So you have to eliminate long term desires first otherwise you can't take the first step. If this entire quest is considered a gain then it will quickly be forgotten. So you have to walk slowly. Otherwise myriad things will burden you and the past will teach you useless knowledge. Focus on now, and don't make the mistake of desiring the elimination of desire in which case your heart will start to beat fast and you will become worried. Has time been spent wasting time? Don't worry of time. When you die there will be no peace yet no non-peace. For there is no &quot;you&quot; to experience it. Where are &quot;you&quot; when your brain decomposes and you rest inside a coffin? So rest your heart if you want peace, detach the mind from worldly affairs, make sure your mind stays with your body. What matters of weight and intelligence when you are just...there, simply for the purpose of existence is what you can fulfill. Does what you want matter? There are other things to want. If you want cars you can get them, don't worry how. If you want to lose weight than do so. Do not dispute what is wanted and what is not. Do things when you don't want to on spontaneous action and freedom is sought here in. What matters when you sit inside your study? Untouched by the world and you look in the mirror and hate yourself. Peace is in dispassion.
