			the link cut out for 1 of 2 reasons
<br />

<br />
1) he didnt put the small co.nr thing on the bottom of his homepage (there now)
<br />

<br />
2) it shut down that link due to lack of viewing
<br />

<br />

To get people to come to your site, you need to offer something unique.  Why would they come to your site and not psipog?  What would keep them coming back to your site?  By unique, i dont mean new articles.  Everyone knows that there are millions of ways to create a psiball, move a psiwheel, or do telepathy.  the only article up that i find particularly interesting is the &quot;Skepticism&quot; article.  Think about all the sites that are very active, to semi active:
<br />

<br />
1) <a href="http://www.psipog.net" target="_blank" class="postlink">Psipog</a> - has 70+ articles and already has a big community with an admin willing to spend his time on the site.
<br />

<br />
2) <a href="http://zhkyrl.brinkster.net/psionline/" target="_blank" class="postlink">PsiOnline</a> - focused on energy work and has the legendary Psi podcasts
<br />

<br />
3) <a href="http://www.upconline.net/" target="_blank" class="postlink">UPC</a> - Has a lot of articles that are more detailed.  Has psi games and a lot of other media.
<br />

<br />
4) <a href="http://www.fork-you.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Fork-you</a> - One of the only places to gain a lot of non-bullshit information about bending cutlery
<br />

<br />
5) <a href="http://www.psilinks.co.nr" target="_blank" class="postlink">Psi-Links</a> - The only Psionic Directory made that is kept up to date (not as popular, but there are about 500 people coming per day)
<br />

<br />

<br />
These are just a couple of the sites that are very active.  Also, all of the above sites have spent a lot of time and money on their sites.  So, you ask, what does this have to do with your site?  Well, what does your site offer that is unique?  From what i see, nothing.  It has articles, a forum, a chatroom, and a links page (plus a little more).  Your site is the same as <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/psi_training/" target="_blank">http://www.freewebs.com/psi_training/</a> and you call them noobish.  They really have not done anything different than you.  They have articles, a chatroom, and a forum.  You have to think of something that is unique.  That no other place has.  <span style="font-style: italic">Then</span> will you have your first repeating members (besides staff)

			I have the .co.nr thing on the front page, and it's being viewed, about 70 hits per day.
<br />

<br />
It's unique because it's dedicated to quality, and takes into consideration philisophy, history, and ethics(I know there isnt a whole lot yet, but I'm getting there as fast as I can), as opposed to those thousands of sites out there with 50 word descriptions out there-(that'w why I don't have a how to make a psi ball article yet... because if people want to know they can come here).
<br />
The other aspect is that it supports magick and religious discussion, which psipog and the psion guild doesn't do.  I know that I don't have a lot up on that yet, but I'm working on it(too much...) I dedicate about 8 hours a day to the matinence of the forums and to the writing of my next article(s).  I know it does not seem different from these places yet, but I am working on it, I can only write articles so fast...It takes time to get out differentiating work.
<br />
Also, I have spent money on it, I have removed the freewebs bar, and I have bought a .com name, I am working on transfering all tha material to the new host, but again, I am a 1 man team, I don't have any help...
<br />

<br />
And thank you for your input Apollo,

			The stuff you described don't make it unique. There are already sites out there like that.
<br />

<br />
Quality? You don't seem like the person to go to for quality.
