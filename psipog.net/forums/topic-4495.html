			its my first day trying it its not hard to get the pinwheel to move for me but steadily and makin it go the direction i want is hard but there is no need for ur hands distance is no obstacle i started with my hands near it like i saw in the vids and then after 15 min i finally got it to move i was amazed to say the least and then i went a few paces back no hands and made it move and then i left the room but opened the door so i could see it and i could make it move distance isn't an obstacle unless you tell yourself so the only window in the room was closed and i had my hands over my mouth breathin the other direction so i now it was for real and i can do it pretty often but any suggestion on making the directions or spins consistent also why does it matter if your moving a pin wheel or a car shouldn't it be the same please explain why something is harder then the other is it just the amount of energy it takes out of you thanks a lot

			A pinwheel is 'unstable' and weighs absolutely bugger all, most people can move it pretty easily, with not much energy, a pinwheel weighs approx. 3-4 grams, a car, weighs 1-2 maybe 3 tonnes, moving a car would take so much more energy than a pinwheel as a car is 'stable', it has 4 points of contact on the floor, and the forces acting on the car are more than your Tk can overcome, a pinwheel is unstable because it has 1 point of contact, a very very small area that it can balance on, so therefore it will be easier to move as there are less forces acting upon it.

Anyway, It's all been said before. Why is it harder to push a car with your hand, than a piece of paper? Makes sense.

and the answer your question dawg777 is simple.. the engine is bigger than your head.. you couldnt possibly operate it with your mind alone all at the same time.. otherwise gas prices wouldn't be so high.

Don't fucking give excuses about your inability to think before you type, it's fucking forum take your fucking time fucking typing.

Psi is all on it's own, plus, we don't know much about Pyschokinesis or how psi works, so it might be possible, it might be different, but so far, experience of other's show that It's not going to be simple as moving a pin wheel when it's coming to a object near over a ton.

			There are healthier ways to vent your anger then posting on forums. You could hit somthing soft, excercise, or you could also try grounding yourself in order to release the emotions. Whatever works for you, but taking it out on some unsuspecting person with bad grammer is not necessary.

Actually, i can use perfect grammar if i feel like wasting valuable time, but if you will understand me with or without comma's/periods why should i need to place them there? Oh and you have a long path to go before enlightnment if your going to flip over some bad grammar
<br />

<br />
on a different note i have been talking to a psion/genius/dr./brain wave analyst and he has explain to me why moving different obstacles is different so there is no need for this thread anymore and i never expected to move cars on my first day it simply was a curiousity as to what the obstacles would be
