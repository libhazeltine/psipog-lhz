			Actually I would never kill an insect, except when I feed crickets to my pets.  So I guess I would never kill somthing except for food. (which is just the transformation of energy)
<br />
Mabe a better quistion would have been &quot;do psi-pets have feelings?&quot;

			I think that psipets, while seemingly living, are just energy that can do something. Living? No. Why? Let's see the characterics of living things:
<br />

<br />
1. They have cells. (Psipets don't)
<br />

<br />
2. They sense and respond to change (they can do this)
<br />

<br />
3. They reproduce (Psipets don't do that...usually, unless you make one that continually multiplies)
<br />

<br />
4. They have DNA (Psipets don't have DNA)/
<br />

<br />
5. Living things use energy (PsiPets do, obviously)
<br />

<br />
6. They grow and develop (PsiPets can do this, but sometimes you must program them to do it)
<br />

<br />
Does it fit all of the requirements? No. It ain't alive guys.

Again, this is confencial definition of life on earth...what if there are aliens on some planet that don't do some of these things, or do something else 
<br />
that we don't and they don't want to classify us as living things? <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			Do psipets have DNA though? They are <span style="font-style: italic">your</span> energy.Of course that may never be found out because it would be quite hard to get DNA of floating energy that might as well be air.

Also, if it learns, feels, thinks, etc, then it's no different from us in the mind. All our minds are are computers.

			I don't care what scientists say is a alive and what isn't, just because it dosn't breathe, that dosn't mean it's not alive. Whether or not a constuct can be said to be living, I don't know, maybe I never will. We are given many mysteries in life, what we do with them is up to us.

If one specie of insects have feelings, probably most of them have, right? <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

And I think that insects are too low in evolution to have feelings... <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I think all living things have feelings. I'm sure that if you'd kill an ant on purpose in front of another ant it would get angry and sad(I'm sure of it)! They get angry when you kidnap their eggs  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> That shows they have feelings right?
