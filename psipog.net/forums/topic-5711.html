			Hi, all.  This is obviously not a very serious poll....
<br />

<br />
Any of you who live with cats have probably seen them sit with eyes closed and their thought-processes fairly still.  
<br />

<br />
There are many things aspiring psionicists can learn from cats.  This is one of them.  Focus is another.  Intent is yet another.  And, of course, napping is something at which cats excel.  Naps are good.

I also have 3 cats, and they all meditate a lot. So I voted for 1-10 times a day. And yes, I do learn from my cats, I sometimes just sit and close my eyes just like them. Yep, it's funny to just see them sitting their meditating. I have always thought of the same thing Rainsong.

You can't be serious. Why would they possibly have more psionic power than a human. That should be the dumb quote of the year. You think because they sleep a lot they're psychic. Why are cats different than any other animal on the earth? Kohala bears and sloths must be freakin guru's by your reasoning. They sleep more than cats. And your &quot;theory&quot; of them going into different world's when they sleep is even dumber. I have a cat and I bet you base that soley on the fact that they twitch and move when sleeping. It's called dreaming. And it's not even proven if they can do that (although) I believe they can. Like how can you just come up with some stupid theory like that, please tell me. I believe you think they're special because of their use in ancient egypt or the movie <span style="font-weight: bold">constantine</span>. People came up with that movie, it's not real. There's a rule in these forums to be intelligent, stop breaking the rules

			I dont beleive I saw constantine, maybe I should tomorrow. I don't have cats of my own but whoever I live with does. I don't know about unable to sneak up on cats because I'm able to do it a lot. It's funny because I see they jump up SO high in the air when you surpise them. I live with my aunt that has many cats. 4 gray tiger cats, 2 mother cats one with a turtles shell. 2 black cats, sometimes I wonder if they bring me bad luck. 
<br />

<br />
And 1 scared little kitten, he often hides and I often try to make friends with him, I try to catch him and sometimes I do (and give him milk or any other yummies), but hes always scared being around humans so he really alert when not hideing. Normaly cats are often scared of me at first sight, I don't blame them because of my large size. I always make friends with cats, and in time they become friends with me. Ever since I was a child I tend to act like a cat sometimes to play with them. Bad habbit I guess.
<br />

<br />
I like dogs to, when I live with my mother we had two german/wolf dogs. Beauiful fur they had, and one so big he can almost lick my face when he jumps on me.............almost......
<br />

<br />
Anyway I think cats have psi just like any other animal. But not as powerful as humans it seems.

What does ancient Egypt have to do with cat meditation? Cat meditation is a survival tool. They wouldn't need to have to try to survive in ancient Egypt because they were worshipped. Everything was served to them on a gold platter
