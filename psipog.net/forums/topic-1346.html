			One way is that different chakras bring about different powers. Through my experience, I found the heart chakra disrupts a computer's &quot;flow&quot; as well as bends spoons.

I doubt it's possible to do the whole Jedi force lightning thing.

Take care!

			I don't practice this 'electrokinesis' but when I do practice forms of Psychokinsis electronical devices around me have started to 'tweak' you could say <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />. I don't like it because I like to keep my electronic devices active, and working... So perhaps you could practice just manipulating circuits of electricity. I don't know... just sharing my opinion <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Instead of using the term electrokinesis, just tell us what you're trying to accomplish.  Do you want to make balls of electricity? (I would consider that fluff).  Do you want to fry your computer? (I can give you tips on that, unfortunately).  Do you want to blow up light bulbs?  What does 'electrokinesis' mean to you - what are the outcomes you're looking for?

			Ok I have a question then on this topic.
<br />

<br />
Alrighty, I do practice some charging of my hand and absorbing energy from devices, i've seen some articles around and on peoples blogs that are linked to the site. One thing i've wondered is that is it possible to have a visible flow of electricity between fingers? I can charge my hand, because I can feel a notable difference in how it feels and the after effects it gives, but is it possible to have the electiricty visible in small pencil line streaks?
<br />

<br />
Now then I am not trying to pull some off like thossing lightning at people, I just really do enjoy the appearance of lightning and i'd love to be able to produce such an effect on my hand or between my fingers.

			This isnt backed up by any theory or scientific evidence so dont take this to heart <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />. I think it could be possible but would tkae years and years of training to accomplish, honeslty to perform something like that you either have to be innate with it or dedicate your life to it. If it was something htat could be done easily i suppose lots would be doing it :S. Anyways i share the same passion as you, something like that would be great to see, and would inspire thousands (which would be my sole purpose for it <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />) I wish you luck in finding your answer and hopefully not get flamed by people :S. If you get any good info on it (by good i mean backed up hard evidence that it can or cannot be done) give us a pm <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />. Cheers.
