			So is there any shield that can reduce a shockwave from a physical attack? 
<br />

<br />
Just last christmas, some of my friends decided to have a friendly sparring session so we can see our fighting skills (don't laugh at this please. we did this just for fun). So I was up against my friend and we started. I held up nearly all his hand attacks and about half of all his kicks while I was on the defensive (he moves fasts, that friend of mine knows taekwondo). Then I suddenly lost my guard and one of his roundhouse kicks blasted my chest area where luckily my arms formed an &quot;X&quot; to block it. The shockwave was quite strong and I moved back and almost fell by 3 feet. 
<br />

<br />
Is there anyway that psi shields can reduce the amount of shock even without the skills of PK... cause I dont know how to PK yet. 
<br />

<br />
BTW, about the fight. I think I lost, even if there was no win or lose because it was a friendly match. I only retaliated at my friend and managed to give him only a few blows.

			I don't know much about force bubbles myself (just started psionics a few weeks ago) but I just got an idea for a practical use just now.  If you were ever in a real fist fight and had great concentration, you could make a force bubble around you hand/arm.  If you had to defend, it would probably weaken the blow a little.  If you put it around your hand though, when you punch it could hurt them more.  First the force bubble would hit and weaken/distract the opponent and make them vulnerable.  Then a second later your hand would hit.  Seems like a good use for hurting the opponent.  Just my two cents in a good discussion.

2: It would probably weaken your blow, rather than making it stronger, to have a force bubble around your hand.. Assuming it was strong enough to be noticed at all.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: And what's the poll about? If I personally can do it, or if it is possible? There's no doubt about it being possible, no? And I doubt as many as 19 out of 50 on this forum can do it.

			If expanding the shield causes it to become less dense, why not focus on making thin dense armor? To actually stop a punch would be incredibly hard, but maybe slowing it or bending the punch away from the spot they're trying to hit might be half as difficult.. If anyone has watched Naruto, a character called Garra uses sand to protect himself from physical attacks.. Try punching sand and see what happens XD

			I don't know if this counts as physical harm, but as soon as I learn to program and make shields, im going to definetly program one to repel spiders, the past few nights I keep waking up with spider bites all over and they are starting to get annoying cause they itch like crazy...

			Well, maybe not repel them physically through a shield, but to repel insects, i had the idea of spraying bug repellant, and use all my 5 senses to know what it does, how it works, and the what not.  Yes, i will taste bug repellant.  Then i will emulate it into a ball, and hit a spider with my ball and see what happens.
