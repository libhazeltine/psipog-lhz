			Ever since I was a kid, I used to hate it when people left the tv on, because it made a really loud, high-pitched ringing sound that was extremely annoying, and I also hated a lot of shops in the mall because I heard the same noise when I was in them, even if there were no tv's around.  But the rest of my family couldn't hear them so they just thought I was making up excuses to not go to the mall or something.  Anyway, a few years later, I found out that I was actually hearing the magnetic fields they make, and I now know a few other kids in my school who can hear them.  I also noticed that I can hear psiballs if they're too close to my ears.  So my question is this:
<br />

<br />
1)  Can anyone else hear the sounds I described?
<br />

<br />
2)  If I can hear psiballs around my head, why can't I hear my own energy field?  Did I just get used to it or is it because the energy isn't dense enough or something?  I'd like to hear people's theories and, if they have any, experiences.

			I hear it from TV's, but not from CRT monitors. It's probably (as in, this is possibly not a factual statement, this is just what I think) just sound being produced by the device, and how well you hear it probably depends on how good your hearing is.

			Its not PSI related, its a problem actully, i think it has to do with some people hearing a slightly larger range of sound. For me its terror, i cant sleep if i have a charger or any sort of computer on. Same with light... Its harsh.

			Well, this sort of topic has already been said and I don't think it is hearing energy. I was going to put the link on the already said topic but I can't find it, sorry. As for me I can definetly hear TV sound waves and other things here and there. As for you hearing the psi ball, are you putting your hands near your ears? And for me, everyone I ask says that they can hear it too but some may be lieing to make them sound cooler but I doubt it.

			Hands near your ears distorts the sound quality/etc of sounds.
<br />

<br />
For example, listen to people making spaghetti. Now, go to the next room and cup your hand slightly around your ear, and the sound should change...
<br />

<br />
I'd think that having a larger sound hearing range sucks &gt;_&lt; dog whistles, for one.
<br />

<br />
It's just a very high-pitched sound wave that's emitted by your TV, near the top of your hearing range, slightly around the 'ringing ears' effect.

I thought it was a sound too, until the incident with the psiball.  I also tried just holding my hand by my ear to see if that had something to do with it but I don't hear anything when I did that.

			It doesn't add sound, it changes the sound, it's because of the sound waves bouncing off your hand (but not all of them), and getting partially distorted by that.
<br />

<br />
If you hear the high pitched wave when somebody holds a psiball to your ear (and make sur..
<br />

<br />
Er, I'll put this into a different form, as I'm going to lose my train of thought elsewise.
<br />

<br />
Get your friend to put his hand near your ear (or yourself), and check what that sounds like.
<br />
Then, make sure you change NOTHING [as this is an experiment, and you have to have a control], create a psiball and then hold it to your ear in the same hand-shape as before.
<br />

<br />
Then come back and give results as to if you're really 'hearing' the psiball...

			I hear it all the time. Infact unless im not around any electronic equipment at all I hear it. TV and everything can be off and I can hear it, hearing it right now too. I have delt with it so much that it really doesnt bother me anymore, it's just like a subnoise. If I concentrate on it I can make it louder though, but I dont usually have a reason too. Though sometimes its a bother when trying to sleep since nothing is being heard so the noise kicks up a notch.

I am exactly the same.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

And to mattz1010: Yep, that's why I was asking if he was putting his hands next  to his ears because it does distort your hearing as you said.

<br />
That actually might be it; I can hear that noise when there's no other sounds too, I just assumed it was my brain playing tricks on me because there was no sound for it to hear or osmething like that.
<br />

<br />
So I'm guessing that the first time, it could have been anything that made the sound get louder, and afterwards, when I tried moving my hand around and making psiballs, when I was listening for it - and therefore concentrating on it, it got louder.
