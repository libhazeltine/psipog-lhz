			I don't have much experience with OBEs. I've only had one in my life, and that was about a year ago. However, a little more than a week ago I started practicing this again, and came very close to projecting the first time I tried, I think. I'm using Robert Bruce's rope method. 
<br />

<br />
Then I tried again a couple of days later and had the vibrations for maybe 15 minutes without projecting. Then when I wake up the next day (or maybe it was just a few hours later, I'm not quite sure) it feels like my entire body is filled with energy. When I get out of bed my entire body starts shaking, and my legs keep shaking for a while. 
<br />

<br />
Now when lay down in bed at night and try to sleep, I always get vibrations after a few minutes although I'm not trying to have them, as if my body wants to have an OBE whenever I lay down. Even though I'm relaxed and lying perfectly still, it feels like my body is shaking slightly. It goes away after a little while if I don't lay still. Does anyone know why this happens? Is this good or bad?

It happens to me as well. I've never experienced &quot;vibrations&quot; as others describe them; I get a rocking sensation as well that can be localized to one limb or can be whole-body. I do occasionally start rocking spontaneously while laying in bed, or sitting at the computer, or walking around. I've paid no attention to it.
