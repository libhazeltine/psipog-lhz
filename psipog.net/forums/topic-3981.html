			Yay, i got my psiwheel to spin on my first try. My door and window were closed, i held my breath while doing it, and it only did it when i wanted it to, so i know it wasn't outside interference. One thing that was strange though is that it only worked whenever i had my hand there. Is that normal?

			If it only worked when your hand was there, it might have been heat or static. Don't get attached to using your hands, it only tricks your brain into thinking you need them every time and it will be hard to do PK without them. Other than that, good job!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Nah, i don't reckon it was heat or static, because it only moved when i willed it to. Thanks, next practise session i'll refrain from using my hands.

On another note, now the front left side of my head hurts, do you think that's related to practising pk?

			That sounds like it may be related, but how long did you practice for? It probably wouldn't give you a headache for one spin. Don't overdo it. I've had one or two headaches from it before and they can get nasty.

No I don't think the pain is due to telekinesis. Though when you are starting out with exploring and trying out your paranormal abilities, you can indeed get sensations around your hear. Like a slight pressure or a tingling feeling somewhere around your head. This is normal as your body needs to get used to the use of this extra sense you are now using. These sensations will in most cases go as you get used to it. The only feeling that might get stronger is the pressure on your third eye region. But that has always been a positive experience for me, so don't be afraid of that. 
<br />

<br />
But these sensations I am talking about that you got when you still need to get used to it, should not be painfull. So if it is real pain that you are experiencing, then I would not write telekinesis off as the cause of it. This will only program your mind in thinking that it is due to telekinsesis. Then the chance is created that next time you perform tk, you get exactly that same feeling again. So I would not decide that it is due to TK if I were you. 
<br />

<br />
Goodluck on your further progression, sounds like you are doing quite well <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> .

			Thanks for your comments all. In relation to the pain, its more of a niggly annoying feeling than something thats actually painful.
