			<span style="font-weight: bold">First a little history on my psi experiences</span>
<br />

<br />
About a year ago I came to psi-pog to learn how to use TK to move objects.
<br />
I never succeeded.
<br />

<br />
Last week I got on the site yet again to learn phasing this time.
<br />
That seemed complete BS to me (some member from this site actually made that up... I mean, its not even mentioned in ancient teachings like most psi related stuff.) soon (after reading peoples &quot;experiences&quot; I decided that definitely wasn't the thing for me, I moved on to my old love: TK
<br />

<br />
So about 3 days ago I created my first psi wheel. At first I thought it was complete BS (I sat it down and it just flew around in circles even though the room was windless. Also my very subtle breathing was radically affecting it)
<br />
After totally writing it off as a BS way for idiots to think they were powerful psi warriors (It is a sail basically... dumbasses could possibly accidentally be blowing on it and subconsciously making it go into the direction they wanted {via the way they were breathing}) anyway I went online and looked up more on tk.
<br />
Out of the many obvious frauds (I won't name names here...) there were a few obviously logical people that stood out. Reading some of their posts convinced me that the reason I couldn't move the psi wheel under the glass was because my mind was saying &quot;dude, that things a solid object, you can't move that&quot; so I moved it out from under the glass.
<br />

<br />
Soon after removing the glass, the wheel began to spin freely again. Using this to my advantage I began:
<br />
As the wheel would slowly rotate to the left, I would place my finger in-between two of the sides {see example picture 1 at bottom} as the wheel kept on its path slowly rotating towards my finger I would tell myself &quot;dude you better stop that before it hits your finger or thats gonna hurt really badly&quot; (the wheel was only spinning at maybe 3 revolutions per minute at this point) after saying this I would put all my force of will into stopping it from spinning (not straining for it to stop or something, just making it stop.) 
<br />
About 90% of the times I did this the wheel stopped about a millimeter away from my finger.
<br />
After doing this for about 10 minutes I had established the sensation of stopping the wheel deep in my mind. I put my hands down and wrapped a towel around my face. 
<br />
Now the wheel was spinning again. There was no way for me to affect it with anything other than psi, or somehow accidentally jarring the table (I was extremely careful not to move any part of my body) I began to will it to stop. Guess what happens? just as I &quot;tell&quot; it to stop, bam, complete stop, I will it to go into the other direction, it does that too. After about 10-15 minute of doing it like the I decide to take it a step up. I put The glass bowl I was using over the wheel, being careful to leave enough room on the side of the bowl so I could get my hands under it (So I wouldn't feel &quot;separated&quot; from the wheel, there was a part of me in the glass with it.)
<br />

<br />
Needless to say I continued to stop it at will. It was a good feeling.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Straw</span>
<br />

<br />
This morning I decided to bring a piece of a drinking straw to school (I had cut off a piece that was about 1/5th the length of the straw) All day I tried to roll that mother, I knew how to do it, I just wasn't <span style="font-style: italic">powerful</span> enough!
<br />
Then came 5th period, sitting through a boring math lecture I whipped out My soon to be TK prover and sat it on my desk (being careful no one noticed <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />) and began concentrating, using the same method I had used on the wheel the prior night. After about 10 minutes I finally realized what was holding me back: It was an unmoving object, my sight was telling me &quot;dude you can't move that, its totally embedded in the table or something&quot; So I gazed up towards the teacher, completely keeping my concentration on that straw.
<br />

<br />
Now something strange happened, I <span style="font-style: italic">felt</span> The straw, it was like it had temporarily became a part of &quot;me&quot; (My self awareness if you will) Keep in mind that I wasn't touching it or anything. my hand was cupped over it so as to shield it from my peripheral vision but the top of my hand remained about half an inch over it.
<br />
The feeling I just described was so distinct that it almost startled me, I immediately looked under my hand and lo and behold, that flipping straw had traveled a good 3 inches!
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">So</span> theres my story, may it inspire others to try some TK themselves
<br />

<br />

<br />
PS. don't complain about the length, I mean for goodness sake, you think your gonna be able to do psi if you can't even manage the willpower to read a 2 minute long post? <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
