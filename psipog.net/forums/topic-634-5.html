B) Not doesn't work either, still energy concerns way too high to be dealt with, and you'd need a magnet of sufficient strength and stabalization to repell off of even if you wanted to attempt that, and if all that was even taken care of it wouldn't be much use because for a magnet of that strength would be rather big (whether natural or electromagnet), you'd have to drag around  a couple hundred pound object whereever you were planning to do the trick.
<br />
C) If it was possible/efficient to levitate a human by using magnets don't you think someone would have done it artificially by now? The closest thing we have to that is the mag trains and if i remember my reading right they're special trains running on special tracks probably using extremely powerful magnets.

			I may be a newbie to this site but I've been using psi for over six years.  I understand that energy consumption has a lot to do with everything.  But there is psi everywhere, not just in our bodies.  There has to be a way of pulling that psi into either yourself or your construct.  
<br />
I'm not trying to sound mean.  It's just that I do know some of what I'm talking about.  please don't take the wrong way

			If you'd bother to read the post you'd know what scope it would be taking to do something like this. Its an insanely high energy cost to the point where its not just something you can fix with a little trick, theres barely enough ambient energy around my area to fuel a few basic energy manipulation runs, so don't count on that either.

B) You know that they sell magnets that can lift several hundred lbs. and there not very big I own one that can lift near 75 lbs. and it's only about the size of a video box.

			I did read it.  and I've also read were someone tried to use Einstein's theories to prove themselves when a lot of Einstein's theories have either been changed or proven not as true as originally believed.  
<br />

<br />
There's no way to say how much psi/energy you could channel in.
<br />

<br />
How much energy is produced by the sun each min.?  
<br />

<br />
Why couldn't several people get together and work for the common goal of lifting someone?  It's already been proven that you can do more with more people, right?

			*again, edit button, its unnecessary to do it in a separate post if no one else has posted yet
<br />

<br />
One thing I forgot to address in all this, to someone's comment about this not taking pk/tk, that is almost certainly wrong. There's no other way to create the force needed to lift an object i.e. you.
<br />

<br />
A) I still hold my comment that ifs theres not an artifical system for levitating humans setup its not worth it
<br />
B) These theories are using simple mechanics of physics and gravity, stuff like that tends to stay the same unless we made some sort of error or the universe changes, and Newton's stuff has been holding for a while and been a lot more extensively proven than the laws that he corrected.
<br />
C) PK is notroriusly inefficient, so to generate any kind of repulsion, magnetic or otherwise is probably going to take a lot more work than the non-biological version.
<br />
D) Again its a matter of purpose and efficiency, theres a lot better and more purposeful things that could be done with a group of masters (and even then its going to take a good number of people), and really in the end its not really useful if it takes 20 people to lift one person. This isn't a question of proving whether its possible, it probably is, its just out of a signle persons reach in most cases due to the incredible energy needed to do it.

			that second post was a separate one
<br />

<br />
I understand what your saying.
<br />

<br />
Are there not anomolies in the grand scheme of things that allow for greater abilities and new skills?  I guess what I really mean is there has never been anyone hit that absolute limit for psi has there?  so then why push the idea that something could be done into the mud leave it behind?   I say, give it a chance and don't restrict your mind to the absolute physical realm of anit-possibility.  WHen there comes a time that a power source great enough for levitation is discovered you might find yourself to limited by your mind to attain what others can.

			Those were the shortcuts I was talking about at least in one particular case, and the one I know even its dangerous and causes possible mental trama, even if it works its not something I'd want people to go through. There's never anyone that's hit the limit that I've known of, but there are people that have been working for decades and might be able to levitate a small object or throw/nudge a large one with a lot of effort. So what I'm saying is you're not going to be able to do this anytime soon, it would take a lot more effort and time than most people realize.
<br />

<br />
It is unlikely anything is just going to be discovered, the body has to heightened to a level capable of fascilitating this activity, so you either have the option of extreme work over the span of years or risk extreme pain, mental problems, and/or self injury.

			Just to let ya know, i skimmed through most of the posts seeing the same thing.  &quot;It's impossible because of math and physics etc etc.&quot;.  I think it's better to be stupid, not know a thing about gravity, math, or anything like that, and think about nothing, you are floating. How? seems like he did it if he's telling the truth, i believe him! if you can trick the subconcious to do that, then anything is possible. You know who Chris Angel is? he walked up a building, walked through glass, and probably did alot of things like that.  My theroy is that he tricked his mind into thinking that this wall is actually a floor, this glass is nonexistant, etc. How would this relate to levitation? I didn't mean to drive off subject.. oops XD

			Please don't be stupid. That last post (that I read) is so stupid I think I'm going to kill myself. You don't want me to kill myself or everyone will be upset.

Seriously though... Criss Angel is just a street magician. Granted he's made a name for himself and he seems to be better than most... he is _JUST_ a street magician. Nothing more and nothing less.

Belief in something doesn't make it true or possible. Me believing that I can fly will not make it possible. Otherwise you'd see me flying around shooting magical psi bombs out of my fingers to blow up my enemies! and whoever else I felt like taking out.

			Well, over time people can develop things like that but we probably won't be able to learn to fly and shoot magical explosive balls in our own lifetime unfortunately.  I believe anything can be possible no matter what, but it doesn't mean i'm going to instantly gain DBZ powers and shoot lazer beams and fly around.  Train hard, practice, etc.
<br />
The &quot;stupid&quot; thing is just a figure of speech.. meaning, if i kept thinking on the physics and stuff, I would keep thinking that there is a limit.  I believe there is no limit.
<br />
I don't want to combat DanielH &gt;_&lt;, i just want to share my beliefs and opinions.

			Ive got an idea... a good idea...
<br />

<br />
In some post, or was it on the learning page, someone talked bout shelling a psi-ball so, that it pushes back the harder it is pushed. It needs PK. I believe its possible. 
<br />

<br />
So...
<br />

<br />
As we know psi &quot;balls&quot; can be made of any shape, like a rectangle.
<br />
Now I would make a psi &quot;plate&quot; the size of medium table, shell and program it to push outwards, lay it on the floor and sit on it. Guess what happens?
<br />

<br />
Theoretically, using PK, you should be able to levitate. WHich is actually sitting on a psi plate <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Logical, no?
