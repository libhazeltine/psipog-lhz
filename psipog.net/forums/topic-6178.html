			OK.
<br />

<br />
I've been practising Psionics for not very long as most of you in the Psychokinesis section of the forums know. But i've had some really good experiences, and success. i can shake doors, roll (well, almost) toothpicks and do minor healing. However, I just cant seem to make a psi-ball &quot;work&quot;! 
<br />

<br />
What i mean by &quot;work&quot; is programming, mainly. I've tried to make a psi-ball in front of my door and make it notify me when someone walks past, but it never works. I tried visualization and tactile, still no results. 
<br />

<br />
I have another problem... After i send my psi-ball, i can still feel the strong magnetic pull/push in my hands. But, i can sense it somewhere else! Maybe its some kind of after-effect, i just want to know how to get rid of it! I know most of you will say practise, but i'm sure its not just that, and that i'm probably doing something wrong.
<br />

<br />
Despite this, i can manipulate my energy in my body (charging, etc). So why do i have problems outside of it? Eh... sorry for sounding so frustrated... but yeah, its really getting to me. 
<br />

<br />
Any help/replies greatly appreciated.
<br />

			I'm slightly in your boat, I can't seem to program worthy constructs outside my body. I think it's just skill, since I never practice programming ideals other than shapes. So, practice? I don't know, I'm can't even make a successful construct since I really use psi just for focus points.

			Don't worry about it too much - your talents could just lie elsewhere <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> I'm horrible at PK, personally. Picked up psiballs fairly quick, but it's been about 6 months down the road, and all I can make the wheel do is swing a little/shake.

			maybe... but i grasped the psi ball concept pretty quickly. What i mean by this is i made a psi-ball on my first try. I can move energy in my body easily. Maybe its a mental barrier holding me back.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
