			I was just wondering what all of your methods were for spinning the psiwheel.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I try to imagine that a gust of wind is pushing it.  Or that an imaginary finger is spinning it around.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
None of these are working for me.  Is there some king of technique that could help you with this?  Or should i just keep trying?  
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Well, i have only been trying to do this for two days now.  So i guess im not doing TOO bad.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Thanks

			just do it, don't focus on it too much, just clear your mind (i focus on my breathing) and it just happens.
<br />

<br />
To &quot;just do it easier&quot; tilt the psiwheel a little, there'll be less friction, and to make it even easier, use a foil psiwheel. Eventually stop using foil and go up to paper.
<br />

<br />
Don't become dependant on the tiltage, in time make it even and work on it like that.

I have a paper one rite now and i put it on top of a toothpick.

I can't even feel my own energy, so I dont know how i am going to feel the wheels energy.

Same here. I've gotten so use to just feeling the energy go that I don't need to visualize to move it. It's more distracting to me anyways.

<br />
99redballoons, you've seen this been said everywhere, but it's not a lie; Practice. Practice feeling your own energy and building it up. Work with psiballs to work on basic sensitivity of your own energy. You've already answered your own question; how are you going to feel the object, when you can't even feel your energy? Well, you won't . You just have to try with yourself first. Read through the beginners manual in the article section. Then keep practicing what the manual says. Once you can feel your own energy, you'll be able to &quot;feel&quot; other objects. Connection with objects will help you with &quot;feeling&quot; objects. What is it like to be a psiwheel? How would it feel if your body were constructed out of tin foil? What would it feel like to breath? What would your skin feel like? What would it be like to spin? Just remember to keep practicing.

			Thanks for the suggestions Lasher.  
<br />

<br />
you said that i should work with psi balls to start feeling my energy.  but i dont know how to make a psiball....i have read the articles about  it.  and i do everything they say, but i just cant get it down.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Any suggestions about psiballs would be good.
<br />

<br />
I know this isn't the right category to be asking about psi balls.  
<br />

<br />
I already asked soem people in the psiball sections.  
<br />

<br />

<br />
thanks a lot

			Visualize. I still use visualization when building, intensifying, and sending energy around myself, but I seldom visualize sending, building, or intensifying energy in objects. It's not to say that I can't visualize energy to do PK, it's just not my preferred method. My only suggestion is to practice what they tell you. They know much more than I do, so I would take to heart and trust what they say. I know it sucks to have to practice; I was in your spot too. I didn't get it down for a while and didn't feel anything the the first several attempts either, but I kept practicing until I got results. If I had been more patient, it would have taken less time.

			Alright, when people say 'just do it' that does not tell me anything...it tells me that i should Do SOMETHING...not what to do.  i know that you of course mean the wheel....but also...i dont even know a way to just do it.

			Ok, think of it like this. How do you move your arm? Can you explain it? Of course not. You just move it. You don't even think about it, you just move it when you want to or need to. You just do it. It's that simple, but it seems complicated and vague because there's no explanation. But not everything does have an explanation, this being one. There undoubtedly is one for this, but until we learn it, we don't have one. Why don't we question how we move our arms? The answer lies in impulses from the brain to another place, but we don't question it; we just do it. So, quit thinking about all the complexities involving psionics. Let them go for now. Get your energy and send it to the object. And then you just move it. The more you practice, the more you will see what we're talking about.

			Let me try to shed some light on the saying &quot;Just Do It.&quot; 
<br />
                   
<br />
Many people use the analogy of moving your arm.  Please tell me how you move your arm.  Thats right, you just move it.  It is basically the same with the wheel if you are using that method.  You become one with the wheel SO THAT you can move it just like you would move your arm.  You dont force anything to happen, you just move it!   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Hope that helps clear it up alittle!
<br />
