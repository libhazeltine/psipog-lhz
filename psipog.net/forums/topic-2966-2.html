if you forgot how to ride a bike you wouldn't have known how to approach it. let alone ride it....

<br />
we remember everything. its just conjuring up the memory thats the hard part. dont say its crap because this is one experience....maybe you just have sucky balance?

its like i used to rollerblade very rarely. 3 years after, put the blades on and within minutes i remembered how to do it...

Yeah but this about the sub-c. The sub-c doesn't have access to the memory in the same way as the concious mind does. Riding a bike or rollerblading is nothing to do with pk. pk uses sub-c, bike riding uses concious mind. That's why it's hard to teach pk, there's no right method, but there is for bike riding, you can't start riding a bike the wrong way round, well you could, but that's not the point. 
<br />

<br />
For pk, you usually have to go back to the basics if you stop for a long time, or for some, a day. But, eventually, the mind patterns in the brain will become more indented and reflexive.

Its not that hard of a concept to walk towards it, swing your leg over it and put your feet on the pedals and push.  Balancing is the harder part and that is what i forgot.

			I just went away for 3 days.  I tried moving the psiwheel after and it worked just as well as before I went away.  I was reminding myself of how to do it, and convincing myself that when I look at it it'll move, just like every other time.
