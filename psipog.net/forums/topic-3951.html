			Navagation is kinda tough and the forums are really cluttered, and some topics have an outragous number of pages, many of them filled with random posts. may I suggest less topics per page that way old ones are pushed back, and a more close moderation of the forums, maybe get more mods.
<br />
EDIT: also you may want to purge users that havent logged in, in over a year that would tidy it up a bit.

How would that tidy things? If they aren't posting, then they aren't cluttering, and you don't have database access, so what's it to ya?

			It's not that hard to find things in these forums. There are sections, clearly labelled as to what the topics are within.
<br />

<br />
Are you perhaps used to forums with a low number of posters? They're usually neater and &quot;cleaner,&quot; simply because of the low frequency posts.

			The forums haven't been up a year...  They've been online since January of 2006.  So they are already cleaned up from people older than a year.  No matter what, you always get the basic setup from phpBB boards... so it's not like I can make it easier to navigate.  I can change the skin and number of posts on a page... how does that make it easier to navigate?

			Well I guess I can explain a bit, be aware that I did post that really late.  
<br />

Never the less; for example, since I am a noob on these forums I am trying to read some of the posts and there is over 8 pages to many of them, which dont get me wrong an active forum is awesome especially if its from the psi community.  One thing that really stands out is that the bbs pages are only full screen when viewed in 800 by 600, most resolutions are set to 1280 by 1024 (everything else is native to LCD screens)  which makes the bbs take up a tad more than half of the actual page if you made the bbs larger you could fit more posts in one page.
<br />

<br />
I subscribe to many forums with an even higher volume of posts than psipog one web site that rings a bell is <a href="http://www.totse.com" target="_blank" class="postlink">www.totse.com</a> it used to be a pretty cool site before it became full of noobs, script kiddies and kids posing as hardcore anarchists.  I see that these forums are temporary maybe that sites bbs layout could be used on the future bbs for psi pog if it is to your likeing.
<br />

<br />
By all means though if you are satisfied with the current layout leave it as is, I am only trying to offer a suggestion.
