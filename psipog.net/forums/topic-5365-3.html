You can not enlighten those who do not want to be.  No matter how many benefits you present, they will always find that their fears of the unknown (chakras in this case) will hold them back.  That fear is the cause of the anger that you perceive as &quot;looking out for the community&quot; Peebrain.  I assure you the motive for it is purely selfish.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I've now taken the attitude of &quot;Your ignorance is not my responsibility to remedy&quot; and DanielH and Roy have demonstrated why I take that view.  I've also stopped asking for proof because I, as well as everyone else on this site, lack the experience and expertise to actually be able to verify whether the literature provided (when it is provided) is in fact proof.  I know what is and isn't real because of my own personal experience, but I am certainly not the only one who is unable to find errors in a scientific paper because this is a site for psions and hobby-parapsychologists, not scientists.  Hold yourselves in as high esteem as you like, your attitudes of having all the answers and demanding constant proof to change your views are nothing more than ego trips.  Such behaviour is no doubt the result of closed chakras. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Is there hard evidence of telekinesis? What about telepathy? I know you guys know how hard it is to prove something psionic. I say leave the beliefs alone. They do not need to prove anything to you. Did you need proof to get interested in psionics in general? They believe in chakras, so what? I am sure that your lives are not in disarray because someone believes in chakras. Let it be.

I'm not being a dickhead to him. Sure, I think he's a fucking moron... but I think that's the first time I've said that in a while. I don't know why Dai (Roy) doesn't ask for proof... but I don't because I've seen plenty of it in the past.

			Psionics has never got people interested in it because they had proof it exists. If there was proof im sure many other people would be practicing it. This is a highly unknown field to everyone involved with it. There really isnt proof of anything at all involving psionics. For all you know chakras could be more real than you could ever imagine. I personally dont believe in them either. I still keep open minded about the subject. I suggest. This is sounding a lot like a hardcore skeptic debate. You guys remember some of the hardcore skeptics we have had here. How frustrating it was because we couldnt prove it. We didnt need proof because we know its real. You guys are sounding a lot like them, demanding proof and not researching yourself.

&quot;psionics has never got people interested&quot; 
<br />

<br />
ehh....what about psipog? What about the people that joined? Obviously, psionics is the interest in some people.
<br />

<br />
Psionics can be visual - some proof, maybe hard to believe proof, but proof nonetheless.
<br />

<br />
Chakras are ,so far, the invisible thing that people rely so much on.
<br />

<br />
I think psionics is able to be explained...but needs the science, so far, I think we have little known science that could back psionics up. 3 people of pog did a bit of research on the geiger counter and psionics too, erikJdurwoodII talk a sample of what the theory is, sounds quite the interesting theory, plausable at that. (me waits for the article)

People still become interested in psionics even if there isn't proof, it happens.

You said &quot;Psionics has NEVER got people interested...&quot; The way I take what you typed is that the whole fucking world doesn't believe is psionics or become interested becaused there isn't proof.

Are you sure? I got some of my high school friends interested by giving them books dealing with proof a number of years ago. I'm probably making that up though.

			It may be because the idea was interesting that people first looked into psionics, but it's having proof that it's not just a fantasy that keeps people with it.  How many people stick with PK if they can't get the psi wheel to spin?  How many people keep trying to have an OBE if they lose interest in their failure after a month and have no assurance it's even possible?
<br />

<br />
Besides, just how interesting would it be if it couldn't be done?  If I told you I could blast laser beams out of my eyes and didn't offer any proof, I doubt I could retain your prolonged interest.

I can use your logic of typing as well. You said &quot;The whole fucking world doesnt believe in psionics&quot; O you really think so? What about the thousands of people who practice it everyday? See how much I can contort what you say? Anyway when I mean proof I mean in a lab under dilligent watch of many scientists and a report filed after. Dont give me that old video of Russian trying it out either because its not a reliable source. I believe in telekinesis and I practice it everyday. But still thats not proof to someone. Everyone who practices psionics did not have proof of its existence when they started practicing it. They thought it was interesting, not because they had proof.
<br />

<br />
And Neveza your the only one I see being a dick here. You were being moronic by picking apart what I said so you can say something about it.  All I was saying is if you were to quote you should quote the whole thing I said, instead of chopping it up to make me look like im wrong. I always have seen you being a dick to someone on here where it wasnt needed. You would cuss someone out just because they dont have the same beliefs as you. In my case I understand, but ive seen you do it many times where it wasnt needed. Why dont you take a look inward before you call somone a dick?

Everyone, <span style="font-weight: bold">relax</span>. As has been said before, the concept of Chakras is belief. Nothing more, nothing less.
<br />

<br />
However, there is pretty much universal consensus regarding the location of the so-called &quot;energy centres&quot;. This makes it easier to describe certain visualizations. Which is easier to say (and type): 
<br />

<br />
&quot;move that psi-ball up to your third eye&quot; or
<br />
&quot;move that psi-ball up to your forehead, approximately an inch above the point between the eyebrows&quot;?
<br />

<br />
