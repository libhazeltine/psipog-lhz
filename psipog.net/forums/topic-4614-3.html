			Funnily enough, today was my first instance of successfully draining energy from another living thing.
<br />

<br />
I was looking out of the window and saw the usual, my patio, the potted plants...that big tree at the foot of it near my shed. And sparrows.
<br />

<br />
I drained one a little, I didn't kill it though. I only managed to get a tiny amount from it.
<br />

<br />
I could feel it collect at the lower part of my arms, it tingled.

			there are two methods I know of to 'purify' negative energy.
<br />

<br />
The first is concentrating alot of light energy on the negative energy, essentially going through a process of bleaching the energy.  It's best to first contain the energy (either in a psiball, a psi-enforced bottle or jar, or if you're careful then in one of your chakras), then just throw as much good at it as possible.  There is a problem with this method, which is that the effort usually far surpasses the yield.  It's very rare to find a situation where you need to transform negative energy into good - unless you make it your mission to cleanse the world like a great deal of spiritual workers that I know.
<br />

<br />
The second method I am forbidden from divulging on the public forums, due to rules against religious topics.  If you would like to know it, feel free to IM me.

			Thanks for the info, I don't think I'll be useing negative energy judgeing by what you said, the other reason I wanted to do that is it make an area of my house that is clear of negative energy.

			Needless to say, we all have natural protection that keeps us from drawing in too much energy, be it negative or positive. Everybody does have something that they are better at than anything else. If any of you have heard of Indigo Children, then you would know that we have naturally well developed psychic abilities and connections. Everyone has a Spirit Guide, and many Indigos have more than one. Having one that you can easily make contact with provides incredible energy reserves.
<br />

<br />
     I draw my energy from the matter around me, because everything has energy. I sense the energy within everything around, and in my Guide, and energy transfer becomes incredibly easy.

Calling youself an Indigo child just because you think you're a natural is an unnecesarry label that makes your mind feel superior than us. You're just another human. Spirit guide talk may tie into religion, so you shouldn't bring that up. Some people would tie them into guardian angels.
<br />

<br />
You may be somewhat of a natural, but that doesn't mean you get more 'props' for it. People who are naturals are usually the ones who are more open minded than the skeptics that convinced themselves that psionics are possible.
<br />

<br />
I guess, under your definition, I could call myself what you call yourself, but there is no need. We are all equal. I made a psi-ball my first time, have been aware of energy manipulation for the better half of my life, was successful with PK on my first time, have had instances of precog, and I am also a natural empath. Makes me want to develop my telepathic skills.

			u should.... telepathy is fun, seriously...
<br />

<br />

<br />
anyway, very few people have actually seen or made contact with a guardian angel.... but i have found a quite prevailing similarity between those who did the above
<br />

<br />
they &quot;died&quot; once.... ya know, those near-death experieces..... 
<br />

<br />

<br />
so i speculated (just a while ago), that guardian angels might be sent from the &quot;above&quot; to give this people a 2nd chance on Earth, and that these spritual entities might be providing the souls of these people the energy they need to stay mortal....
<br />

<br />

<br />
disclaimer: it is pure speculation......
