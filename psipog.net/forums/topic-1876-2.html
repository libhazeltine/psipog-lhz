			I have never phased but would like to, i see how it could be painfull but i would still like to try it.  i always thought of phasing as charging ervery atom with energy until all the atoms no longer exist completly in this reality so solid matter would not exist for that person.

Orbits actually have nothing to do with it.  Atoms don't orbit as far as I know except on macro scales like how the atoms in the moon orbit the atoms of the Earth.  It's simply enforcing that the selected quantum phase state be the one that is dominant (the two classifications we're concerned with when phasing are the states of matter or nothingness), not a changing of orbits.
<br />

<br />
cryo: Phasing also doesn't have to do with adding energy to reach some elevated phase where the atom doesn't exist.  It's simply a different phase that is less frequent than the &quot;existent&quot; phase.  It's like moving a stone 2 metres to the left.  Work is done, and thus energy is used but moving in the left-right directions doesn't make the gravitational potential energy change.  It's still the same distance from the centre of the Earth, just in a different place.

			All of this makes since, but what I want toknow is if you phased the atoms in the wall would it be less likely to hurt? 
<br />

<br />
Edit: Also I think phasing is alot more comon by coincidence then known. I belive not by my own powers (because my psi abilities are noob weak... Sad for all my ideas) but by chance I phased once. I reached out to grab a monkey bar when me and a friend were talking while just hanging around a play ground... and my hand went straight through and me and my firend were scared. Also another friend of mine was leaning from his hallway onto his bedrooms door and he phased through and fell to the floor in his room. He had not herd of any phasing other then fictional charecters at the time and his only abilities are meditation, RV and weak telepathy(he has recieved mental mesages from someone when I couldn't recieve it... maybe hes just alot more sensitive)

			Only if you could phase the wall as fully as your hand then it wouldn't hurt.  But if atoms are appearing in you body, you'd still feel plenty of pain, and likely more than if you phased yourself because there's no chance of the electrical signals hitting a deadend when a nerve is phased.  You'd be intact and so would feel every atom phasing back into existence, which is certainly worse than sporatic pain impulses from partially phased pain receptors trying to make it to your partially phased brain via partially phased nerves.  Holy anaphora Batman!
<br />

<br />
I agree that random phasing is certainly more common.  People who can control it are very rare.  Long before I even knew what it was, I was lucky enough to phase my hand through a glass as it shattered (while doing dishes).  Would have slit my wrist had I not phased.  Risk of death or serious injury seems to really bring out the metaphysical potential in people <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			you could also remember that atoms are mostly not there.  if you keep this in mind while phasing, you may start to think &quot;this table is mostly not here, so i can pass through it easily.&quot;  this would be a beneficial mindset when phasing.  
<br />

<br />
i have a question.  why does phasing hurt?  people have been saying it's because your nerve receptors feel the pain, but if they feel the pain, that means they weren't in the &quot;phasing state&quot;, or able to pass through an object.  if this was so, while phasing (through a table, for example) wouldn't your nerves just be lying on the table?  and if they were, they wouldn't be connected to your body anymore, so why would it hurt?  if your nerves aren't lying on the table, that means that they fully phased, so it wouldn't have hurt anyways.  maybe i'm just over-thinking it... <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			Read my posts in this thread again nightshade.  All the answers to your questions are there.
<br />

<br />
As for your &quot;mindset&quot;, you have to remember that your body is just as much &quot;mostly not there&quot; as the table, yet the two manage to never intersect without the use of phasing.  So there's not much logical basis for your mindset and I don't see it being any more useful than simply realizing what phasing entails and then creating a visualization based on that knowledge.

logical basis?  no.  creative basis?  yes.  maybe you don't see it as being useful, but i'm sure there are plenty of people out there that do.  when my physics teacher told me about this, phasing became a bit more plausible than i thought it was.  there is a lot of space between the nucleus and electrons of an atom (on a smaller scale), and in between them is nothing, like a vacuum.  if you know this, then it may seem more plausible that you can pass through objects; if you keep in mind that at least 60% of that object isn't there (again, on a smaller scale) that is what i was getting at.  using creativity instead of logic would make the visualization of this <span style="font-style: italic">a lot</span> more easier.
<br />

<br />
as for the first part of your post, maybe i overlooked something.  i will go back and re-read your posts because i was truly asking a question, not trying to be an asshole  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Generally I find visualization based on misunderstanding or ignorance leads to the creation of serious barriers that only become apparent when you try to tackle mor challenging psionic tasks.  It may seem easier to do it your way in the short term, but in the long run it will create more problems than it solves.
<br />

<br />
Also, atoms are more like 99.99999% nothingness.  That's not even counting their tendency to phase in and out of existence.  But things are still plenty solid even if they are barely there because of the repulsive forces between the electron clouds surrounding matter.  I'm not saying you need to visualize doing the seemingly impossible task of phasing every atom individually out of existence, just realize that you won't be able to just squeeze solid matter through another solid object because atoms are mostly vacuum.

			maybe i'm not explaining this right.  if a person is ignorant in understanding the physics of atoms, and they stay that way, how is that going to hurt them in the long run?  they will never find out what they are visualizing isn't logical, so if they keep doing it that way, how will it create more problems?
<br />

you said <span style="font-style: italic">&quot;Generally I find visualization based on misunderstanding or ignorance leads to the creation of serious barriers that only become apparent when you try to tackle mor challenging psionic tasks.&quot;  </span>
<br />

<br />
this theory doesn't apply to everyone.  just because YOU may be a genious in this aspect, doesn't mean everyone else is.  just because YOU don't think this is logical, doesn't mean everyone thinks this isn't logical.  do you see what i'm saying?  there are plenty of different visualizations for psi-balls and techniques for making them.  they all give you the same end-effect:  a psi-ball.  i don't think some of the visualizations i'm told are logical, but it works for some people, and that's fine.  so if my &quot;mindset&quot; works for some people and not you, what is the hurt in that?
<br />

<br />
i see what you mean about phasing being the &quot;link&quot; between what i've been saying.  but some people may find my &quot;mindset&quot; to be easier to understand and use than physics and big words  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />   we're both right, in our own respects, and some people may find your theories to be easier to understand and others may find mine to be easier to understand.

			Maybe i can provide a new perspective on this. There are tons of information stored in our sub-c. Also, supposedly our sub-c is what controls our psi abilities. If that is the case, the sub-c can do the equating on it's own with the information that is stored so that a person does not have to have technical information to do something. 
<br />

<br />
It seems to me that having large amount of technical information to attempt to use a different aspect that has an effect of producing a mental barrier.
<br />

<br />
 I can see it both ways as i'm a physics major but when I try doing something that physics really doesn't allow for, then I have to compartmentalize that information and just let my instincts lead me. 
<br />

<br />
In psionics, i've noticed that being of scientific background that it makes it much harder, it's like your to embroiled in modern reality science with sociolgical barriers. Try to avoid rationilization on psi and you may find it working much better.

			that's pretty close to what i've was trying to say.  thanks for explaining it better, i just got done with a triginometry, AP psychology, physics, and accounting exams, so i was kinda toast  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> if your sub-c knows what you are trying to do, but your logical conscious (sp?) tries to reason and make rationality out of it.  if you just let your sub-c do the work, and keep your conscious from disecting the logic of the task, i think it would be easier.
