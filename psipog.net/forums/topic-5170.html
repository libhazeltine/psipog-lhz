			Okay my girlfriend has the ability to see and talk to &quot;spirits&quot; if you will.  SHe has been able to since she was like 7 when her grandfather died.  Anyway she used to get... i don't want to say haunted but that's basically what it was.  Well any way she stopped doing psionics when she was around 10 and i just resently got her to start nit back up with the knowlage that this really is real, not just her imagination.  Also I can see into any room i have been in and see the auras of the people/things in the room, but i can't see people or objects.  So she was in the kitchen and this spirit thing started scaring her really bad and she couldn't move, i was scared so i looked into the kitchen and i saw her aura and the aura of another thing in it but it was blue so i told her ity wouldn't hurt her but she still couldn't move so I made the spirit go away.  She went to her room and we started talking and she got me mad so I told her to stop or she would regret it.  She didn't stop so I was like okay and I was thinking of this scary object in my mind and i started constructing a psiball with as much energy as I could in her room.  BTW she lives an hour away from me. I asked her to stop again and she didn't so i programed the psi ball to scare her.  I asked her if she felt anything and she screamed and went there is something in my room.  I was like okay...  and she went under her blanket to hide.  Then i stopped being mad and i told the &quot;spirit&quot; to leave and destroy itself but it didn't.  I made an astral trail back to me and told it to follow it and it wouldn't.  I tried everything i could to get it back or destroy it but nothing would work.  I told my girlfriend i couldn't do make it leave (at this point she dosn't know i made it)  so she gets out from the covers and starts talking to it and she gets it to leave.  I asked her what it said and she said it said it was lost and it didn't know why it was here or what it was.  I asked her to describe it and she described perfectly the image in my mind that i was making.  
<br />

<br />
My question is was this a coincidence, and if this was just a programmed psiball or was it artificial intelligence of some kind.  Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  And it's not like i'm some awesome construct maker... i can't make the psi wheel move to any big extent and my psiballs aren't that powerful so i'm not sure.  I would greatly appretiate feedback.
<br />

Thanks.  (Sorry for typos)

			Sounds like fluff.  Fluff thick enough to sleep on.  Maybe even fluff fluffy enough to get this thread locked.  Maybe  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> .

@Balkan: I percieve that as a form of combat (whether you did it or not..that's my opinon) .I'm not sure that's allowed to be discussed here if it is combat. Also *slap on the wrist*( <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> ) don't scare your gf like that...what if the roles were reversed eh?

			i'm sorry about the paragraphs (or lack there of) i was just tired last night and i wanted to get it all written before i went to sleep.  also it was not a form of combat, the thing couldn't hurt anything even if it wanted to I made sure of that.  I was really mad at her and I regret doing it now but it was the only way i could get through to her and I acsadently let my emotions take over.
