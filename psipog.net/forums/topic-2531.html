Well, Ill get straight to it.
<br />

<br />
I've meditated a few times before and although i entered an extremely relaxed state, it was barely fruitful. Today i started reading more detail into psychic phenomena etc.. Id read some before but never in as much detail as today.
<br />

<br />
After reading, inspired, i decided i would try and meditate again. I led back on my bed, having done it before relaxing became a fairly fast process. I led back and closed my eyes and focused on relaxing each limb and area of my body until it felt like I was 'Un-attatched' (for need of a better word). Anyway I started saying to myself in my head 'My psychic intuition is growing everyday'. I said it about 4 times, taking deep breathes and remaining in my state of relaxation.
<br />

<br />
All of the sudden from seeing nothing but black I was falling out of the sky and towards a brown building then I came to with a jolt, covered in gose-pimples feeling like i was actually just falling from the sky. This was far more than any day dream, or ordinary dream, it was so real and i was still awake. My heart was racing and my breathing was heavy.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Id read before something about a falling sensation but i never expected this. Needless to say what doubt i had is fading fast.
<br />

<br />
I want to try it again soon and try to control it, from what i read I believe I may be close to or in fact doing astral projection. 
<br />

<br />
I really want to know if anyone else has experienced this and if they can tell me what it is? Im begining to fully believe and im astounded as how quickly something like this has happened to me, perhaps im lucky enough to have had the ability naturally and now im just training it further. Whatever the case, any help would be useful.
<br />

<br />
(I apologise for any grammar/spelling omissions, Im still a bit shocked as this is the first time i have actually truly experienced something like this, im having trouble believing it happened now which is why if I know it has happened before ill know its not my mind playing tricks on me)

			Err, doubtful. It's probably either strong hypnagogic imagery or an instance of conscious REM (rapid eye movement) causing a dream state to generate. I've been flitting in and out of sleep, or in a light sleepish state (i.e. sleeping in class), or in a deep trance, and have had various things like you've described, and have suddenly awakened and grabbed on to something to catch myself. I've never associate that with OBE/AP, just with dreams on the verge of sleep.
<br />

<br />
That's not to discourage you at all from further practice in OBE! It's just that this particular occurance can't necessarily be attributed to psioncs.

			My guess isn't based on experience but rather on what I have read by Robert Bruce, who writes about OBEs and inducing them.
<br />

<br />
He mentions trance, which is the state he recommends trying to project from, is associated with a falling sensation.
<br />

<br />
You SAW it, though, so this might not be the answer.

			Ive had this phenomenon many times, and i was as scared/excited as you are.               
<br />
I asked my mum about this some time ago (shes a nurse), 
<br />
and she said that its harmfull to get relaxed too quick and that this is a reaction triggered by the brain so your body can wake up.
<br />
Its as Felix_the_Cat said, its like a really short REM.   
<br />
Sorry to dissapoint you.

			Guys I think you are confusing what happened with me with those Half-asleep dreams you get when you fall and jump to wake up. This was far from that, I actually physically felt the wind hitting me and i could hear and see it all, and though it only lasted a split-second. It was something more than normal, that much I know. Im a law and Psych student so im a fair bit sceptical but this has changed my perspective.
<br />

<br />
I should mention that I was fully awake, I snapped out of it the same way I do meditation, feeling neither tired nor like id been jumped on in my sleep, though I was startled at the experience!
<br />

<br />
Still you guys are the experienced ones. Guess im just not gifted  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

			Just wanted to add I tried it again.
<br />

<br />
I relaxed fully. I had the exact same sensation except for longer but with no sensory stimulation. I had the falling feeling but I couldnt hold the trance for more than a few seconds.
<br />

<br />
In all honesty I was afraid, when I did snap out my heart beat and breathing had increased singnificantly but this is normal human behaviour for experienceing a new sensation. I think with practice i will be able to hold it longer and will learn to accept it as a sensation and then attempt an OBE from it, if it is indeed a trance im experiencing.
<br />

<br />
Im still not sure why I did have sensory perception in my first attempt but im sure the answer will become clear to me soon.
<br />

<br />
Im amazed either way, ive never been able to commit to the belief until today, now im borderline 100% certain of it, and im sure if I continue to practice this trance state among other activities I will be 100%.
