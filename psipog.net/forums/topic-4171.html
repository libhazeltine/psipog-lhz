			Perhaps you should talk to her again and get some closure.
<br />
you're probably having dreams about her because your sub conscious grew attached to her.
<br />
If you can get some closure then maybe the dreams will stop.

			Or do an RC whenever you see your girlfriend and have a lucid dream the next dream about her. Think of it as an oppurtunity.

			I get the exact same thing. I know, it sucks the crap. I haven't done anything about it, cept just dream about it and think nothing more of it. If it's causing so much pain though, then.. distract yourself with someone else. Sure you can date girls, but i'm assuming you had your ex for longer than a few months. They stick in yer head ;P ah well.

			I think have the same problem, though mine is much more severe:
<br />
In most of my dreams (for years already) the DC's are from my junior high school, that's mean ppl I don't care about/  didn't see for 4-5 years, yet they constantly reappearing in my dreams.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />
<br />
It doesn't bother me much, but I think it's weird...

			what you should do if you wish ... is.. .close your eyes and pretend you are in a dream. maybe your memory is so vivid of the dream that you can see it again once you close your eyes.. simply get this feeling and show her the door or kick her out whatever you want... and she will leave.

			I had the same problem... lasted a long while after we broke up. First time being in love; just couldn't get over this girl. Finally, after a lot of thinking, I realized that while we were together that I gave so much of myself that perhaps that part is still attached. I did a visualization/mediation of of pulling that part of me back from her and returning it to myself. *shrug* Hope this doesn't seem to weird for you, but it worked for me. Although I wasn't able to fully recover all of what I had given to her, I have been able to find a sense of peace since then. I wish her now ill will... you said you want to torture her?   <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> I don't think throwing her out the door is the answer.. never worked for me. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> More about finding peace with yourself and allowing you let go of her. Maybe you are more attached to her than you realize.

			Hmmm, when I was younger, I always had a dream about me missing the bus <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />   I drew a picture of me missing the bus and crumpled it up, ripped it, and threw it away.  I guess it tells your brain not to dream about it any more.  I haven't had a dream like it since.  Try the same thing, except with your EX

			Make a psi ball really vividly and put her psi sig and a lot of other memories and things you know about he in it. Then like blow it up or just let it go away and forget about it. This should tell your subconscious that these thoughts and this person is not a very important thing anymore and to stop bring it up to you.
