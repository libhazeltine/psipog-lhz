			It's bin a while, but I'm just revisting Psipog when I see that it is closing down. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />  I might not be on here everyday for the time it will be still up, but I will have a look from time to time. Some of you, (actually most of you, soooo many new noobs, er..I mean people here) might not remember me, but some of you will. If you've been wondering where I have been, I've been off with another site (of which I won't say the name or it will pee off some people). 
<br />
Anyways, hello to all new people here that I havn't met before, and hello again to the members that I already know. Tis good to be back at the place where I first plundged into psionics.

			lol, I'm not sure how long it even was. Felt like long for me. Still though, I havn't been on and now I'm on here until it shuts down..hopefully. It's a good thing I heard about it shutting down or I would have missed the chance.
<br />

<br />
btw, I didn't really leave, I just stopped posting. I didn't post about my leave cus it wasnt planned.

			Well the site isn't active right now because of a certain individual. It was mpw13. The certain individual stole the admin status from the leader and tried to shut it down. Thankfully, the admin status has been given back to the rightful owner. I check it every now and then to see if any progress has been made to restore it but non so far.
<br />
For those of you who steriotype mpw13 as being too military like, it is not. It was at some point, but that was because it was owned by the &quot;certain individual&quot;. Anyways, enough about mpw13 for now, it's caused too much uproar. 
<br />

<br />
For now my full attention is on here. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Oh, I just went to mpw-13 yesterday and it was down. When I went to the forums, it just said &quot;evlmonkey sucks&quot;.....?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

And I remember you, does that mean that I have graduated from n00b to member?
