			Hi.
<br />

<br />
I have had some strange telepathy experinces lately.
<br />

<br />
First of some history. I had a mental breakdown this winter, and got problems with attacking angsieties. My doctor gave me SSRI Antidepresants as they are very effective against it. In april i went off the SSRIs and started healing myself through meditation. I now get very easly &quot;centered&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Reacently I've had some strange telepathic experinces. Often when i think about/to people that is in my vicinity, I get a lot of &quot;Did you just say something?&quot; Even from complete strangers or coworkers. Like the chick in the cash register at my local grocseries. Its kinda weird to me. I cant yet reprocude it at will. I would like some tips on how to handle/improve/control this. Im a bit afraid that some of my inner thoughts will get &quot;transferd&quot; without me wanting it.
<br />

<br />
This beeing said, I've had a few strange PK moments as a child. One speific moment that i realy remember was when my uncle died (my mothers brother). I was about ten. My parents left, i was home alone. They didnt realy tell my anything at first. (I found out later he died the previous night) I was very mature at a young age, so beeing home alone wasnt new to me. I could sense something was wrong, but being unable to put my finger on it. I watched TV for a while. And went to my room to get something. When i suddenly had a moment of trance. I zoned out for a little moment. I didnt think much about it, except now i knew that my mother was very upset. When i went downstairs, to my shock. I found the TV off and all of the drawers and cupord doors open in the kitchen. As a child this was realy strange, but i didnt get frightend. It was me.
<br />

<br />
I've sometimes tought that i might have some natural way of doing psionics. But every time I try with intent I get none or very small results.
<br />

<br />
Do any of you more experinced practicers have any tips or comments?

			That telepathic experience happens more. Don't worry, you are safe. It mostly transfers the surface thoughts, basic things we all have once in a while. Also, your PK experience... I think its known as delayed effects. Stress mostly causes these things, but often when the person is actually near the stuff...
<br />
Try to do some stuff from the articles if you want to improve from that base.

			I randomly get other people's thoughts too sometimes.
<br />
Don't worry, most people won't even pick up on your thoughts even if you tried (unless they're trained telepaths or something).
<br />
As for the things in your house being moved around by you against your will, that's called 'geisting'. Basically, you just need to practice a little bit every day or two (and relax).
<br />
Relax before practice.
<br />
Relax during practice.
<br />
Relax after practice.
<br />
I can't stress this enough. Relaxation is key for pretty much everything, imo.
<br />
Also, try talking with your subconscious. Forming a relationship with that part of your brain can be extremely helpful.

			Well, you could always try to make a shield around your head to block telepathic traffic. And if you think you are not skilled enough for something like that, ask any psion around here, you can get a lot with a kind word. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
About the SubC relationship, it's mostly positive in all aspects. I mean, you always have someone to talk to, eventhough your SubC is you, it tends to have other thoughts about different subjects and can really help out if you need a second opinion on some matters.
<br />

<br />
Or your SubC can just yell nonesense at you, like mine does. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

Just a random hypothetical possibility.

<br />
 Do you actually have a relationship with your sub-c? If it isnt a sentient entity, how can it possibly control your TK TP Sheild construction and so on, and since it can do that, whos to say you cant conversate? Saying im nuts go see a shrink for doing this kind of applies to anything posted on psipog at all seeing as many pschiatrists will simply say &quot;Telepathy is a sci-fi only thing it isnt real&quot;. Not irked or trying to piss you off, simply pointing that out. Oh also, if you do get along with your sub-c, its image to you is made of Psi so it actually can be a sentient being. Its thoughts and sayings are said thru the person/animal of coorelation you create for it.

			Your subconcious is basically everything that happens in your mind that you aren't thinking about.  If you're thinking about something in your subconcious, then by definition, it isn't in your subconcious anymore.
<br />

<br />
Of course, one's subconcious might have the capacity to store alternate personalities, but I won't get into that.

			So.. you do do that then, contain a sub-c rep.? Even if you dont realize it.
<br />
I honestly have two, but like I said theyre made of psi programmed to be what they are, look like how i want them to and contain individual thoughts, regardless of similarity to me. Thats how I have three &quot;people&quot; in one head.

			That does happen to me alot but i will it to, but their personalities are similar to mine out of probably luck, so i dont notice so much as to when they overshadow , i dont even know if they've ever done that, without my consent they both say they havent as of yet.. Ill take their word on it, im sure id notice if a part of my day was a blur, y'know?

			hehe.. it went a bit off topic, but hey, i dont mind. thanks for all of relplies! its  much appriciated. I would like some more comments on my expirence as a child tho. 
<br />

<br />
A clarification. What i mean when people say &quot;Did you just say something?&quot; I dont mean that is recived mentaly. They say it to me out loud. I think about them/they and they ask me if i told them something. Its like they recive something but its kinda diffuse.
<br />

<br />
None the less. Thanks for all of the replies and dont stop. All input is good input.
