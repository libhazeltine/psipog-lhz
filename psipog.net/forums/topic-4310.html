			I've noticed that even when I'm away from the computer (as in, can't see it) and someone IMs me randomly (I can hear the IM sound), I kind of know who it is. As in, &quot;oh, that must be Ashley&quot;. But even though it was random, I can kind of narrow it down logically, like &quot;John is usually busy, he wouldn't talk right now&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
Even so, I think it's kind of cool that I just kind of know. What do you think?

			when it is matters concerning your personal friends it is more logic than clairvoyance - of course you know how majority of your friends think its just not something you THINK about

			It's logic if you have to think about it and use reasoning. (For example, basically, just what you stated as an example) <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I guess clarivoyance of that, would be to know immediately without having to think about it. <span style="font-weight: bold">That</span> in my opinion, would be clarivoyance. Whether that applies to anybody else, I don't know, but logically, if it isn't logic, <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />, then what else?

so the answer has come to me. if it were clairvoyant your instinct would be 
<br />

<br />
&quot;ASHLEY&quot; instead of what i quoted
<br />

<br />
as an instant BANG instead of a common phrase

			i belive clairvoyance is much more of an instinct than a mere probability so it is whatever works for you.

			It can lead either way Angela,
<br />

<br />
If you constantly talk to someone and it's pretty likely that an IM is going to be a certain person, than I wouldn't think it's any form of Psychic function. However, if you always have multiple people IMing you, to where it's pretty &quot;random&quot; then it's a possibility that it's a Psychic function.
<br />

<br />
So, if you're away from your computer and there are many possibilities and for no &quot;apparent&quot; reason you think &quot;That must be ashley.&quot; Then I think it's something Psychic.
<br />

<br />
However, if you use reasoning, it gets pretty sketchy on whether or not I'd classify it as that. HOWEVER, just because you are using reasoning doesn't mean it's NOT psychic. For example if you acquire X amount of information psychically, and use that to create the rest of your logic, then it's a combination of logic and Psychic abilities.

			I think that once you have unlocked your Psionic potential, you may be prone to use it unconsiouly in small doses in instances like these.
