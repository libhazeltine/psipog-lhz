			Some say you should just jump off a high cliff or maybe a skyscraper while in a dream and that &quot;the shock&quot; would rise the level of your consciousness when you &quot;meet the floor&quot; <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> and you would astrally project. Others say you should find a mirror in a dream and walk through it.
<br />

<br />
... but ...
<br />

<br />
I've tried them both and when I was jumping off of high places in my dreams, and I jumped off lots of them, I made a hobby of it for some time to see what the results would be, anyway I always had three possible outcomes :
<br />
1) When I fell to the bottom, I was very quickly awaken to reality
<br />
2) I didn't touch the ground, I just kept on falling until I thought of something else to do (most common one)
<br />
or 3) I was awaken to another dream, which seemed to have less sense than the previous one
<br />

<br />
And whenever I tried looking in the mirror something funny would happen and another dream would begun. Also I think my face in the &quot;dream mirror&quot; was somehow scarry and gruesome and it didn't feel like me at all.
<br />

<br />
Well these are my experiences perhaps the methods work for someone else <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
peace ?

			The methods I've read about are these:
<br />
Try to fly really high and keep going, until you feel yourself seperating.
<br />
Imagine yourself floating up in water, again the surface would be seperation.
<br />

<br />
And then of course, the mirror one, as mentioned before.

Yeah but you get used to it in time you realise that you cant be hurt and the fear wears off, i just do it normally, just imagine myself coming out of body.. usually works

			that's all good info, i'll have to remember that when I try to OBE through a lucid dream...
<br />

<br />
but , once you OBE from a lucid dream, how do you reach consciousness so you can OBE awake? Just awake yourself from the lucid dream?

			I've been training obe's for about a month now and I think I have a stroy that might help you out. I havnt had a fully successful intentional obe yet, but this still may help.
<br />

<br />
About two weeks at about 6:30 am i was, as one would expect, sleeping. And during a dream I unexpectly did a reality check and caught on to the fact I was dreaming (There were these orange cans of soda that registered as &quot;grape&quot; in my mind and when i actually read the can it said &quot;America's Favorite Jewish Soda&quot;)
<br />

<br />
Instead of doing what you'd usually do if given the oppertunity to go lucid i started thihnking to my self &quot;I wonder if you can get out of your body from a lucid dream&quot; (i didnt know it was possible at the time).
<br />

<br />
This is were things get hard to explain...Basically one part of my brain was playing out the dream, another was aware of my body's position, while the other was reading from what looked like a psipog article. and this &quot;article&quot; said something like &quot;If you go lucid, dont waste this chance&quot; (this bit a knowledge could -possibly- be a &quot;helper&quot; that i've read about because it seems very similar to an experiance Robert Monroe had. I dont know, its just a theory)
<br />

<br />
So at this point I said to myself &quot;Alrighty then&quot; and decided to give it a shot. I was aware that i was laying on my side so i imagined sliding out through from behind (floating out more-or-less). I could literally feel myself being pulled out from the back from my head. 
<br />

<br />
Now here's where I screwed things up.
<br />

<br />
I remembered reading somewhere about &quot;rolling&quot; out of your body, and at the time I thought it was literal. So I rolled my physical body and screwed up the whole thing XD. I hate myself sometimes
<br />

<br />
I dont know if this was really a partial obe or not, but i feel its worth trying if you're able to lucid at will (its very rare for me to have a lucid dream)
<br />

<br />
I hope this helps.

			I agree the mirror can help. Though i used it in different way. Took an afternoon nap and I was dreaming, and in my dreams i was looking at the reflection of my friend (from the possition i was during the sleep - in my couch) in the window just above of the couch i was sleeping in. After 3 or so secs i realised it was my reflection (change of imagery in dreams) and then i said to myself i cant possibly be looking through a window because im lying down and looking at the reflection from down here. And the realisation of me being separated on two in dreams (one of me in the couch sleeping - this was conscious me, and the other me apparently standing in front of the window looking out - though i wasnt there consciously) started a proces.. vibrations came, loud thunder-like sounds etc..
