			I hadn't really thought about spoon-bending until recently, when we covered metallic bonds in chemistry. For those who don't know, here's an review:
<br />

<br />
A metallic bond is essentially, as the name suggests, a bond between several metal atoms (e.g. iron, sodium, magnesium, etc.). This bond is formed by the metal atoms losing electrons (becoming ions), and the electrons forming a &quot;sea&quot; of delocalized electrons. This is what makes metals conductive and ductile; when a chunk of metal is bent, the &quot;sea&quot; of electrons is what is really being bent, not the atoms themselves, and flowing electricity is the delocalized electrons flowing through their parent material. These bonds can be tricky to break, which is why metals are (generally) so hard to break or melt. The more electrons the bond has, the stronger the bond.
<br />

<br />
Now that you have reviewed the basics, here's my theory:
<br />

<br />
Perhaps when a metal spoon is bent, the delocalized electrons are really being removed from the bond so that it weakens. This allows the metal in the spoon to become more ductile, allowing the person attempting to bend the spoon to bend it much more easily either with their hands or with PK.
<br />

<br />
One way to test it: perform the spoon-bending trick, <span style="font-style: italic">actually reaching the stage where the metal is bent</span>, then attempting to melt the spoon. If it melts at a lower temperature than the spoon normally would have, then the theory is correct.
<br />

<br />
If this is true, then spoon-bending is actually a form of electro-PK.
<br />

<br />
Anyone with a blowtorch up to test it?

			Really, psychokinesis is just mind over matter. If your theory is right, then it wouldn't matter since it'll be called psychokinesis still, also you can probably still bend it with psychokinesis with enough practice. There are huge amounts of varibles that could be true.

			By the altering of the electrons the metalic structure itself could be changed. That is why if you do research on spoon bending all the sources tell you to bend the energy, not the metal. Know what I mean?
<br />
This also explains why you see people only bending metalic objects.

			Still, how would you check if it's at the correct temperature? How old are you btw? We didn't do metallic bonds grr. I checked wiki and they're apparently similiar to covalent.
