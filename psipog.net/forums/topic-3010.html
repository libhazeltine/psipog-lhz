			It is concievable, however, it is far beyond any psion that there are today. For one, would have to literally be a master on constructing multiple types of shields and another, would have to be a master micro pk'er on a huge scale since in 1 gram of water there are millions of molecules that you'd have to break down. Humans on the average of each breath, take in somewhere in between 25-50 grams of air per breath which equates to roughly 5-20 grams of oxygen alone and you multiply that out on the number of breaths per min as well as trying to break the water down for oxygen, the energy output would be far greater then worth attempting.
<br />
Be better off learning complete body control and storing amounts of oxygen within the body and train yourself to minimilze the use of it to work underwater.

			Nope, splitting water isn't nuclear fission. Fission is when you split an atom, a molecule is a collection of atoms. To split water all you have to do is to run a sufficient amount of current through it. But going back to the shield: You'd need more than just oxygen. Normal air is only about 21% oxygen (correct me if I'm wrong) and the majority of the rest is Nitrogen. Just from splitting water, the 'air' you'd get would be about 66.6% Hydrogen and 33.3% Oxygen (if it was nothing but water and there was no other gases dissolved in it). This wouldn't exactly be good for you. The shield itself would need to be double layered, one would be an incredibly strong force shield to keep the water out. The other would need to be able to run average amounts of electricity through it. There's no need to mention that it'd be hard. At this kind of level, you'd be using close to the amount of energy required to make an atom from psi. That's a hell of a lot of energy. Plus you'd need to be a grand master at PK. Good luck though <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			not to mention just bear in mind what happens shortly after spliting water into water into hydrogen and oxygen. if you dont seperate them soon they react again. explosively. not a process you want going on near your head.

			In theory, if you created a shield that could both send a mild electric charge (Correct me if I'm wrong, I haven't done much with electrolysis) through the water while simoultaneously pulling only the oxygen through the shield you might be able to. However, I doubt very much that anyone will ever get good enough to do this.

			Required abilities for the electrolysis:
<br />
1) GOOOOOOD PK <span style="font-weight: bold">at will</span>
<br />
2) Pretty good Electrokinesis <span style="font-weight: bold">at will</span>
<br />
3) ENORMOUS concentration <span style="font-weight: bold">all the time</span> (else the whole thing just dissolves.
<br />

<br />
 Therefore you'd have so much to concentrate on, to keep the whole thing from flying apart that you couldn't use it for somethin useful.

Cool if it worked though.

			Ack, my bad, I wasn't thinking straight. Aero_Maniac and the others are right, sorry again  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

(I'm blushing all over now, that was a total brain failure!)
<br />

<br />
So I don't make a totally useless post, a quick wikipedia search reveals that the air we breathe is about 21% oxygen, with the majority of it being nitrogen(78%). Of course, this isn't necessarily the required percentage for each element, but my guess would be that straying too far from it would leave you rather...uncomfortable...

			Also, remember, that to do something with a psiball \-shield \-construct you need to be able to do it on your own. Unless you can turn carbondioxide into oxygen on you own, you can't do it with your shield

Oh yeah, I forgot about that. It might work for a short while (like a half a minute), but after that you'd start to get sick.

			You could, however, trap air into a shield around your head, though you wouldn't be under forever and you would probably float. But this approach may be easier. ( Don't rely on me though)
