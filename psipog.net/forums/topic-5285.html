			I have had a recurring dream for the past 2 weeks since i went on holidays i get it about 2-3 times a week its not the same dream but it is based on the same thing. Vampires. In every dream i know i am a vampire i do all the things a vampire does like drink blood etc. Its all fun and stuff but the past couple of dreams have been scary, ill explain the last one. 
<br />
The dream starts in the night i am running through a town and then all of a sudden its day time, as a vampire i am allergic to the sun so it starts to burn my skin, its so painful that it wakes me up.. but heres whats wrong i can still feel the sun burning me on the backs of my hands it not a very nice feeling whatsoever but the last time it happened i had to dip my hands in water. now i know its all in the mind but how does it feel so real? i tried to make it go away but it doesn't. Any idea what this could be?

			The reason I subjected it is that part of you mite be afired of it somehow. You mite feel safter from the sun by doing it. Often I dream of zombies in the same house of my living at night makes me wonder if the dead is watching me.

			Ive had some similar experiences, and they usually scare me aswell.
<br />
I once dreamed  that I had a very uncomfortable conversation with a man, he said that i should stand back or something like that, and then he started to shout at me. I got scared and woke up, and as I sat up in my bed I felt a hand taking a steady grip around my shoulder and it draged me down to the bed again, and as I landed with my head on the pillow I heard the same mans voice whisper &quot;Stand back&quot; in my ear.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Did your vampire dream feel more real then usuall dreams?
<br />
Ive noticed that this happens to me when I have dreams that are so similar to real life that I almost cant see the difference between dream and reality when I wake up.

			Don't worry dreams are always safe. The feeling is all in your mind, maybe because it seemed so real. Just remember its a dream and you have complete control over it.

			Physical effects have been known to follow hypnotic suggestion.  Some of you may or may not be aware of a study whereby a subject, under a hypnotic trance, was told that they were going to be burned with a cigarette, but instead, they were poked with some other harmless item (i forget what it was).  Shortly thereafter, a burn mark formed where the harmless object was pressed against the skin, much in the same way one would if a cigarette was actually pressed against the patient's skin.  This may be an explanation for what you are experiencing, Mike, though, I'm skeptical.
<br />

<br />
Ephyria, your case sounds something like sleep paralysis.

In this circumstance, no.  In any other circumstance, most likely not.  The only way it could contribute would be to put you in a trance that is conducive to a suggestion that would result in a physical response.

			as far as i know. experementing with binaural beats when under the age of 18 is advised against. mainly so as not to alter development.
<br />

<br />
it sounds like some kind of sleep paralysis to me. something about your dream being so &quot;real&quot; that it stayed after you 'woke up'. my guess is that you felt this burning whilst waking up. so you became more aware of your surroundings and yet still kept something from the dream because it was so intense.
<br />
I've had something similar happen to me. where i kindof woke up. but was still Visually in the dream. despite being able to feel my awake body.

			this isnt an abnormal thing
<br />
sometimes when you wake up, your subconcious mind is still semi-active, making you believe thigns that are false
<br />

<br />
one day about 6 months ago, i woke up thinking my bed was goign to explode and it was goign to be such a big explosion it would kill my family and I, and i thought it was my fault, so i frantically ran around my room unplugging things thinking that would stop it...eventually i ran downstairs into the opposite corner of my house (as far away from the bed as i could get), curled up in a ball and started shaking and crying hysterically...after about five minutes, i came to my senses

			Oooh!! This is really interesting cos' I know how you all feel!! I'm 15 and I had one 2 years ago or something and it was terrifying.
<br />

<br />
But how does it put a physical affect on you? I once dreamt that I was on a plank with pirates prodding my back with a sword and when I woke up I started twitching with something sharp driving in my back in bed... My mum walked in on it and checked my back and it have small dent like bruises  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
All this is wierd... in a cool way. I'd try lucid dreaming if I were you.
