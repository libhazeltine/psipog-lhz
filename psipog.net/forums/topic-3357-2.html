Yes well Pyroman, people lie for a reason and there's no need to dis-respect their privacy. For people like you that is.

			02a1 - that aura site is not very good.  it is teaching you to use eye-fatigue to see auras.  That makes an eye illusion not aura vision.

			I don't really think that seeing nerve and bone structures and brain activity is aura vision, but it's cool anyway! <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  I was reading about developing aura vision, and this one site I found said to use your peripheral vision by looking to their left or their at their forehead to help see it. Also, the active psy site says to shift your focus to your third eye, but I can't do that <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> . I also read that you can take a mirror and look at yourself in the mirror in front of a plain background. then you just try to focus on the background and not really see yourself. I found that helpful.
<br />

<br />
          Hope this helps everyone who is still trying to get it, like me. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I was reading on wingmakers that children that are younger than 6 can see auras all the time (don't know if that's true, though). If you develop aura vision, can you see auras permanently without focusing? That would be unusual, but you'd get used to it by practicing for a very long time.

			I've recently been focusing on aura vision. I have figured out that when I try NOT to focus on someone (like look to the side) I have been able to see a faint color thinly surrounding someone. I basically have to focus on not focusing, while focusing at the same time. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> Bit complex...?

			I think the best thing for seeing auras, is not really seeing it at all physically, but feeling and sensing it with psi or scanning, whatever works. You can still see it physically but I believe it's all on what your eyes understand until you can see it correctly. One day I saw a japanese dude and decided to see his aura (I was in a resturant), I saw the outline, but I know that was the classic aura illusion, so I just looked on my pheriphal vision (can't spell that), and saw white string like things connected around him, it wasn't really a steriotypical outline around the person or round bubble aura, it was as if I can see energy connected to energy points in the body (I saw one from the chest to the throat, hands to waist, and other wierd spots). It kind of suprised me, I KNEW it wasn't just a stupid illusion, however again if anyone can disprove me that would be great.
