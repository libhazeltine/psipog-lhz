			Can you guys help me. (which you are good at). I can figure out how to Flare I tried a couple different methods but non work for me. I really want to see my psiball so I can have a psipet. So can you guys help me, give me links to articles about flaring or give me some methods you guys use. Thanks a bunch.

			There are a few topics on flaring, but I'll tell you what I've gathered. First, you create a psi-ball. Then, you compress it until it is as dense as possible. Then, you put more energy ito it, and compress it down too.
<br />

<br />
Keep adding energy, and compressing, and when it is powerful enough, it MAY flare. Apparently, it's not always 100%, and the more you focus on flaring, the less chance you have. 
<br />

<br />
Also, flaring is not essential to make a psi-pet. The energy used to continuously flare it would drain it of it's energy, and it would become useless pretty quickly. Since this is (presumably) your first psi-pet, how about sticking to the basics of creation, programing, and sustaining it.
<br />

<br />
Good luck! I hope your attempt at a psi-pet is succeful. I can't wait till I can make one.

			Ok so here is what i do to flare. I start making a psiball (i guess you no how to do that since you or interested in flaring) then when i have the psi ball at a normal size and density. i compress it and start to pool energy into it even more. then i start to spin it and spin it and compress in more until it flares.(it is usually about the size of a marbel when it flares)

			just a question, but how bright are they when they do flare? the way i understand, you can only see them in the dark because they don't give off much light

			Well, it depends on how much energy you put into it. Some flares are bright enough to be detected in regular light, while some are so subtle that even darkness doesn't reveal them.

			Because when you compress something to try and flare, you compress it as much as possible, so that it can become dense enough to pick up with our eyes. If it was any larger, with the same amount of energy, then it would not flare.

			ok....extremely fast reply i would say.....

<br />
i have auric vision/clairvoyance.....so i can always see the ki around me................no idea how much it would take to &quot;flare&quot; it up for others to see.........i rather train them to see the energy (lol....much easier....more uses too! <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> )

			Yep. I freakin haunt the Psi Ball forum, lol.

Auric vision would be SO useful, but some people just don't have the capacity to learn. Also, most people who want to flare want to do it so normal people can see it. If we could teach all the normals to use auric vision, that would solve the problem.

Do we call them 'normals'? Do we have a concrete term for normal people?

Was that a joke, or are you being serious? I'm going to assume the latter.

I disagree, because that would classify Psions as 'unrealists'. For now, they're just normals to me.
