			I was going to sleep like usual, with my hands above my head and legs slightly apart and then, all of a sudden, I felt my body go completely into sleep paralysis. The only thing I could feel was my torso breathing, and I also felt a cool breeze on my right hand and my left foot. And I felt like I was lifted. And I said, &quot;Woah, sleep paralysis? Hello! I'm not ready to OBE yet! Ok body, wake up!&quot;
<br />

<br />
And a few seconds later, my body went back to normal. And the weird thing about it is that I didn't even do anything to induce it. My body just did it on its own.
<br />

<br />
Explanation please and greatly appreciated!

			from what I've heard/read sleep paralysis occurs everynight, the fact that you were aware/consious is something different.  You then could've induced an obe or tried, but nothing unusual.

			Oh... Well I know it's sleep paralysis, and I tried doing it last night also, but no luck so far. I just stood still for about 10-20 minutes then I felt begging tremors in my foot but I ignored them.
<br />

<br />
Sooooo, I got into sleep paralysis without even trying to. Eh. I'll try again tonight. See if I can get the same result I did.

Very right. My psychology teacher was talking about it not too long ago. With most people there's even a period when in REM sleep (rapid eye movement, deepest sleep), you can lift/tilt a person right out of bed without them waking up. Move them around, put them in a closet (standing upright), almost anything. I was skeptical about this when he first told us, but he's right. He said he's done it many times and put people in the shower then turn it on  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> . (Ofcourse they then wake up). Your garaunteed to have a friend you can do this too. I'm a very quiet and sensative sleeper and usually wake up to any noise, yet the teach says it's proven to be able to be done to everyone. So long as they're in the right stage of sleep. Can't wait to try it out, I'm going to put my buddy outside lol.
