			Five posts an hour is twelve minutes per post.  I sincerely doubt that I could post that many times if I was taking the time to consider the question and provide a semi-thorough answer.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps you all think that 'yeah, that happened to me' is helpful?  Sometimes, yes.  But it would be more helpful to give an answer with more information in it.  If you take any time at all to back up your information, twelve minutes might be enough time between posts.  
<br />

<br />
If you're having issues with lots of edits, that should be an indication that you need to think more before posting your initial comment.
<br />

<br />
At any rate...
<br />

<br />
Thanks, Sean, for making the posts cost more, and therefore possibly increase the intelligence factor of said posts.

			I'm not discussing how quickly you can type...

I have been a professional secretary.  Two years ago, I easily typed 80 words a minute with 98-100% accuracy in job placement tests.  (Temp agencies are shiny... you can check out the employer while they check out you <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.)

The issue is how much you are THINKING about and BACKING UP what you say in your posts, not how quickly you type.

			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
I for one believe that these post restrictions are a great idea. We have some members posting not for the sake of expressing their opinion or helping out another but to build their amount of posts. Which, is exactly what we're trying to prevent. We're not interested in how many post you have, that does not impress us. What we look for in another is their ideas/statements and how you share them. 
<br />

<br />
Jael is correct. We're looking for quality over quantity. Please try to understand what we're trying to avoid. I'm sure we've all seen members posting all over the forum in a period of 10 minutes. We're trying to avoid members flooding our forums with these very short non-descriptive posts. 
<br />

<br />
Quality over Quantity
<br />

I'm just saying it's alot easier to get what you want to say across much faster when you type faster. 
<br />

<br />
And if you have to go to great lengths to explain something that could be done much simpler, all you've done is wasted time and words.

Sometimes, people get into discussions on this forum.  Discussions do occationally require short responses.  Such as this:
<br />

<br />
&quot;So if i visualize the psiwheel moving, and it moves, i am doing pk?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Response:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes&quot;
<br />

<br />
What else is there to say?

That's exactly what I hate seeing. That question alone has countless variables of what is causing the wheel to move. You can't answer that question without going over the possibilities of it not being PK. Firstly, I don't believe someone would ask that question without sharing more information. However, before I could give a proper response, I would be obligated to ask questions concerning his/her occurrence in this situation. You can't answer someone's question without going into details or hearing their details concerning an experience or idea.
<br />

<br />
You need to think about the question before you simply write &quot;yes&quot; and call it a day. That is <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> a proper response to this question. You're neglecting detailed information necessary to answer that question. Details my friends, details.
