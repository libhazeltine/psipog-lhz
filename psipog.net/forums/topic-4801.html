			It wasnt even really that much as a dream as a flash of images but it took a while to get out of my head. I woke up at 3 in the morning and I saw a flash of what looked like posters on the roof of my room and one that stood out was like a rainbow butterfly (probably a little girls room) then It had like a mixed flash of those posters but with an uptight looking older woman with a bun she still had brown hair though. Then it was just the woman looking across at me from a desk. Then It was over the really strange part is I always sleep and wake up on my side and never facing up but this time I woke up facing the ceiling which was really really odd for me I never do this.
<br />

<br />
Any imput would be helpful on what the heck it was.
<br />

<br />
Thanks

			That sounds like the textbook definition of hypnopompic imagry. Flashes of vivid imagry while becoming conscious after sleep. Some of them you actually physically see, or it appears as though you do.

Imput = Input

hypnopompic = Hypnogogic, i believe.

PLEASE! it doesn't take that long to look up these things on a dictionary website.

<br />
Hypnogogia encompasses both the hypnogogic and hypnopompic states.
<br />
The difference between the two is 'pompic is after sleep, while regaining consciousness, and 'gogic is before sleep, while losing consciousness. 
<br />

<br />
As far as grammar goes, I couldn't agree more. Please take the time to at least try to make what you write resemble English. It doesn't have to be perfect, but readable shouldn't be too hard of a goal to meet.
