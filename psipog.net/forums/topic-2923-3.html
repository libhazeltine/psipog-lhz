			Our existance is systematic. Our personalities, how we feel, how we act are choosen systematically through checks and balances.

Astrology, genes, star settings, moon positioning, date of biirth, time of birth, stars, planets,

Not surprisingly, I typed in my name and I got everythiogn accurate accept for my soul urge. But then I typed in JustOwnin (only my mom calls me by my real name)  and it was the same thing for the last one accept a more accurate soul urge.

			For the most part it will  tell you how you are now or how you were. In the beginning you were all like that but life experiences and people around you made you change. Tests such as this cannot and donot factor in such things sothey may have some margin of error but are overall extremely correct to those who have not steered from their paths. I use tests such as these to get a better understanding of people I meet to put their birthdays and such in.

			ok, this is a test to see if this thing actually works. I do think that it's one of those in general things like tarot cards so I'm gonna post what it said about and me then whoever feels that it describes them post and say so. If lots of people post, then it proves that it's a load of bullcrap. 
<br />
Here's what it said about me:
<br />

<br />
There are 24 letters in your name.
<br />
Those 24 letters total to 106
<br />
There are 9 vowels and 15 consonants in your name.
<br />

<br />
Your number is: 7
<br />

<br />
The characteristics of #7 are: Analysis, understanding, knowledge, awareness, studious, meditating.
<br />

<br />
The expression or destiny for #7:
<br />
Thought, analysis, introspection, and seclusiveness are all characteristics of the expression number 7. The hallmark of the number 7 is a good mind, and especially good at searching out and finding the truth. You are so very capable of analyzing, judging and discriminating, that very little ever escapes your observation and deep understanding. You are the type of person that can really get involved in a search for wisdom or hidden truths, often becoming an authority on whatever it is your are focusing on. This can easily be of a technical or scientific nature, or it may be religious or occult, it matters very little, you pursue knowledge with the same sort of vigor. You can make a very fine teacher, or because of a natural inclination toward the spiritual, you may become deeply emerged in religious affairs or even psychic explorations. You tend to operate on a rather different wavelength, and many of your friends may not really know you very well. The positive aspects of the 7 expression are that you can be a true perfectionist in a very positive sense of the word. You are very logical, and usually employ a quite rational approach to most things you do. You can be so rational at times that you almost seem to lack emotion, and when you are faced with an emotional situation, you may have a bit of a problem coping with it. You have excellent capabilities to study and learn really deep and difficult subjects, and to search for hidden fundamentals. At full maturity you are likely to be a very peaceful and poised individual.
<br />

<br />
If there is an over supply of the number 7 in your makeup, the negative aspects of the number may be apparent. The chief negative of 7 relates to the limited degree of trust that you may have in people. A tendency to be highly introverted can make you a bit on the self-centered side, certainly very much self-contained . Because of this, you are not very adaptable, and you may tend to be overly critical and intolerant. You really like to work alone, at your own pace and in your own way. You neither show or understand emotions very well.
<br />

<br />
Your Soul Urge number is: 7
<br />

<br />
A Soul Urge number of 7 means:
<br />
With a number 7 Soul Urge you are very fond of reading, and retreating to periods of being alone and away from the disruptions of the outer world. You like to dream and develop you idealistic understandings, to study and analyze, to gain knowledge and wisdom. You may be too laid back and withdrawn to really succeed in the business world, and you will be much more comfortable in circumstances that are tolerant of your reserve, your analytical approach, and your desire to use your mind rather than your physical being.
<br />

<br />
You are very timid around people that you don't know very well, so much so at times that casual conversation and social situations can be strained. You tend to repress your emotions to the extend that some people have a good bit of difficult understanding you. You tend to be very selective with friends and you don't easily adapt to new environments or to new people very quickly.
<br />

<br />
The negative traits of the 7 include becoming too much the introvert and isolated from others.
<br />

<br />
Your Inner Dream number is: 9
<br />

<br />
An Inner Dream number of 9 means:
<br />
You dream of being creative, intellectual, and universal; the selfless humanitarian. You understand the needy and what to help them. You would love to be a person people count on for support and advice.
