			Ok I have a bit of a crazy idea, I hope this hasn't been posted before. I'm no expert but in an article I read atoms consisted out of energy. Well if this is true can't we create atoms out of this energy by manipulating it? We could create molecules out of thin air. Could solve lots of problems. I know it's a crazy idea. But theoretically it could be possible. Tell me what you think of my idea.

			Dun wanna burst your bubble, but theoretically, it isn't possible. Matter can neither be created or destroyed. Same with energy. And, you must have read wrong, because last time I checked, matter could become energy, but atoms are not only energy, they have a mass.

			Actually nuclear bombs make matter into energy that is why they are so powerful but to actually create matter you would need massive amounts of energy.  The formula that just about everyone know E = MC squared is how this realization came about way back when and the first nukes were designed.  And as for matter not being created or destroyed it is only transferred into energy which is all by the rules.  Look at here for more explanation <a href="http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/emc1.htm" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/emc1.htm</a>

			This is something thats always interested me, and I've spent many of my spare moments churning this around in my head. The conclusion I've come to is that it IS possible, but wouldn't work (if you catch my drift). Like SilentObserver said, it would most likely take a hell of a lot of energy (take the mass of the item you want to &quot;materialise&quot; and multiply it my the speed of light [300,000,000 m/s] squared. Not sure what units the equation is speaking in but thats a load of stuff). This could probably also happen in reverse, i.e. you can dematerialise an atom by stealing energy from it. But I think that eventually the atom would reach a certain mass that it would fall apart (perhaps like a radioactive particle but maybe like an atomic bomb). This would also mean that when you were &quot;assembling&quot; an atom from energy, you would need to get a certain amount of energy in a certain space in a certain amount of time (likely on the scale of picoseconds) to make the atom stable enough to actually become a full-blown atom. So, like I said at the beginning, its possible but wouldn't work (well, if what I think is right anyhow).

Anyways, let me put it this way:

<br />
The sun shining for one day on earth is equal to a 2.2 Kilogram weight. Solve for that, and find how much is in one atom (Lol, I sure can't).

			Atom bombs are turning matter into energy, and it doesn't take that much matter. 
<br />

<br />
To make matter we would need to take the energy of an atomic bomb and turn it into a small amount of matter.

We could get every psion and we still couldn't conjure up a cup of beer...

			Amount of energy required to lift a 1 kg (kilogram) brick 1 m (metre) up in earth's gravity: roughly 9.8 J (Joules)
<br />

<br />
Amount of matter you could create with that energy: roughly 0.000000000000000109 kg
<br />

<br />
If it were possible, another way could be to have some source matter (sand, for example), change that into energy and then back into a different kind of matter. Then there's the question - how much energy can anyone direct, even if they don't have to produce it themselves?

Damn, I was gonna say that.  I've actually been thinking about the same thing for a while.
<br />

<br />
Another idea I had was to find an insanely abundant energy source (like the sun) and convert some of that energy into matter.  I have no idea if it would work, and I'll probably never try it, but if someone else wants to figure out how to do it I'd love to hear about the results.
