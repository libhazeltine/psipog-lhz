No I don't think you can do it lol. Consider this a challenge  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> ....But I hope you do because there's no way I got time to even try to go for a whole day.

			I've been doing this method, unknowingly, off and on for a while. I use this method to try to OBE, and I manage to get to the complete numbness stage, but I'm always willed out of it. &quot;This isn't working, I'm sick if it. Stop&quot;. The most I think I've gotten in that stage is 1/2 hour though, so it's not too terribly long or short.
<br />

I do it laying down, usually before bed just 'cause it's a convenient time.

			24 Hour Goal--Failed. 
<br />

<br />
I started off very nicely experiencing some cool feelings. But after 1 hour and 16 minutes my mom came in for the 4th time talking to my cat about me, and I laughed. And that was the end of it. I failed. I spoke to MartialArtist though, and he said 24 hours is too much as it is. He gave me a smaller goal of 3 hours which I will try for some time soon.

P.S I think it's best to set your own limits. Only you can know your limitations. (No criticism to MA  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />)  I will do a 12 or 24 hour meditation one day when I actually have an entire day to do nothing.

I can't let you beat me! When I have another holiday I must try once again. But this time...I won't tell anyone that I will be meditating! The reason my mom bothered me so much was because I told her. And she didn't like the fact that I was doing it so she decided to put a stop to it. 
<br />
But first I should get that 3 hour goal done first. I understand what you said about MA giving me a goal. But he was only suggesting a goal, and I agree with it is all.

			I think I'm gonna get started with this. I've seen this topic floating around for a while but never really read it. But the 24 hour thing would certainly be something, wouldn't it? Man. I'll do it some day.

			There is alot of talking here, but who really pulled off a 24 H meditation? It is close to impossible unless you attain a state of Samadhi in which a trained yogi, or however you'dd like to call yourself after alot of practice, can remain for several months in a row. If you only have the experience of an hour or two in meditation, without attaining any real, deeper state of consicousness, you won't be able to sit in the same position for 24 hours belief me  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> . Your mind will never have the patientce to sit still for so many hours. Your entire back will start to hurt and collapse. If you guys really want to pull of a meditation of that nature, you should first practice Sense withdrawal. In Yoga science they call this practice Pratyahara, and this practice is not just any practice, it takes up one entire step, of the in total 8 steps of yoga towards Self-Realization. This is because sense withdrawal is absolutely imperative if you want to reach any kind of Samadhi, or superconscious state in the first place.
<br />

<br />
So what is the practice about?
<br />

<br />
Sense withdrawal means that you withdraw the senses from the outside world, so that outside impulses can no longer trigger your mind's attention through your senses. In other words: you cannot be disturbed by whatever happens, if you don't want it to disturb you.
<br />

<br />
Many of us are too often disturbed by whatever happens in the outside world. If I may take your example Somefatguy, your mom came in talking silly words about you to your cat because she wanted you to stop your meditation. This is of course, a highly disturbing factor. However, someone who is trained in Pratyahara (Sense withdrawal) would not be disturbed by this and would retain its consicousness aimed upon itself, or in other words, that person would be able to keep his attention turned inwards, without any struggle or trouble whatsoever. If you were to be in Samadhi, you would not even have noticed your mother. Perhaps she could even slap you in the face and you would not have noticed a thing. You see how imperative it is to posses the skill to keep your attention one-pointed, and inside whatever happens in your environment? If you cannot do this, after two hours your back will disturb you so much that you won't be able to retain meditation. You will try to sit out the time in meditation, but you wont manage the resting 22 hours, because now you are no longer able to get in meditation. Your mind has been seriously disturbed and you are thinking alot and very bit of pain comes to your attention. This is very unpleasant and disturbing. It creates an inner struggle and you wont be able to retain your patientce. Without a proper level of one-pointedness of mind, and practice in sense withdrawal from the outside world, towards the inside world and keep it there, none will really reach 24 hours I promise you that. Of course it also depends on your posture, but if you are lying down, I bet you will fall asleep, if you are in a sitting posture, which I suggest you practice, you will break your back.
<br />

<br />
Not to sound negative, but stop aiming for 24 hours when it does not come to you automatically. 24 hours is a time limit that is not healthy to be forced upon yourself. After alot of practice, preparation, mind-taming etc, you will automatically attain complete one-pointedness, and then meditation becomes pleasant. After this stage, you will be able to get into the states of Samadhi, then meditation will even become blissfull and 24 hours will be a piece of cake. such a goal should not be forced. Three hours can be forced, or rather: aimed at, Thats ok. Thats why I told you Somefatguy, put your aim at three hours. If then, you somehow get into a deeper state of consciousness, you will increase that time. If we are too obsessed with, and caught up in the mind, 24 hours will be a total torture. 
<br />

<br />
Before you try anything of this nature, be it 3 hours, be it 24 hours, make sure you have done the proper physical excersice. Do some tai chi, or yoga, some stretching etcetera. The body must be totally flexible and relaxed. It will make your attempts alot more comfertable and much easier for you to go beyond the mind.
<br />

<br />
I wish you goodluck. If only you stopped saying, and started playing, you would already have attained a three hour meditation <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />. Belief me, you don't need 24 hours to reach amazing depths. Three hours will do just fine... <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Goodluck, and perhaps somewhere in the near future we can arrange a meditation for three hours or something similar, in which we all participate at the same time, and afterwards share experiences in a chat or something, and form a little article of those experiences together.

The chart is boring. I am, however, documenting my experiences/observations along with it. I'll post them when it's all said and done.
