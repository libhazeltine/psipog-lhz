My personal opinion is that we haven't sold out to the media and started bullshitting. Like the idiots who have their own show to 'speak to the dead'.
<br />

<br />
I can't gamble or go to casinos, therefore, no 'income'.

I'll ask you this then - how would you propose to make money off of your abilities?

Depends what you can do. 
<br />

<br />
If you have ability with precognition or micro-TK (while watching the live drawing of the lotto numbers), the lotter presents the best choice. As I said, you don't even need to win. 
<br />

<br />
To be honest, I have very little to no experience with RV, but it seems to me that you could assign coords to, say, a lost $100 bill, and proceed to attempt to find the nearest one. Again, that could be impossible, I really don't know.
<br />

<br />
Telepathy and Empathy are more devious, and less morally acceptable. Influence your boss to get a raise, for example (make him/her more appreciative, or whatever you will). I've used empathy in a way near this (not for monetary gain, but close), but never telepathy.... so I'm not clear on its particular uses in that regard.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Those are all the fairly uncreative options... you could just let it be known amongst your co-workers that you'll find stuff they lost for a tips. Or, supposing you work as a waiter, you could amuse a table with PK to increase their later tips. To be fair, though, the best option still has to be the lottery. 
<br />

<br />
Is it simply a lack of motivation to turn skills into green paper? Or is that just my economics-major corrupted mind going to work again?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			Most probably the fakers get the money (except for the lottery idea of course), and the real ones get dismissed for fakers... The fakers get too much while the real ones get laughed at and called names. Happens all the time.

			I used premonition to win $50 on one of those box chart sports things, for baseball I think. (I don't really know what it was for... my 'rents just told me that if I put my initials in the box and the score aligns with the box, I win money...) so I just &quot;sensed&quot; the winning one and threw my initials in there.
<br />

<br />
Next thing you know, 50 bucks.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I would have to assume that most lottery winners ARE psychic, or atleast are subconciously using those abilities. But obviously they aren't gonna go &quot;hey, I cheated!&quot; because they'd be on about 20,000 people's hit lists.

			&quot;Someone should do the Randi thing. If they don't want the money give it to starving kids or someone else who needs it. FEED THE KIDS AND STOP BEING GREEDY.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I don't know them, and even if I did, I wouldn't help them unless they were very close to me. The human species will only get smarter and stronger if people go through hardships, conflict makes people stronger. 1,000,000 dollars would feed many for a few weeks, or a few for many weeks, after that, they'd be no better off. I only help my friends.

That much money can also feed a lot of people for the rest of their lives. Sure, there are a lot of poor people in America (or wherever you live)... but there are some people who are off a lot worse than they are. India, Afghanistan, etc for example.

			Whoever said &quot;why doesn't Criss Angel or someone like that try to win the lottery?&quot;, he actually predicted the lottery numbers on one of his shows. It was probably fake, but just stating what happened on the show.

			i know i'm replying after 4-5 months after the last reply, but i just don't get it. why is it that pk or psi has to be related with money? first things first, this is done as a way of personal achievement or exploring new boundaries, but hell, if you want more money study harder and take another job. guaranteed results after one month <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
if you work hard enough for your money, no matter what the amount is, you'll realise that there is a lot more in life than having this and that. damn consumerism.

A simple photoshop job could whip those up. Also, if he called the school for confirmation, the son could have payed off one of the teachers to lie.

<br />
Also, he hacked into the computer system as a failsafe so that when they try to print the real one, it prints a picture of a monkey wearing aviators.

^^^^ That is but one of the many likely possibilities running through Randi's head.
