			Have you ever played a video game and wanted to cast the spells in it?  I have thought about it and I believe that this is possible.  All you would have to do is make a construct, give a purpose (i.e. rain ice and chill the target to the bone), and flare it.  It would be fun to make rain fall on people randomly in class.  Of course, the maniacal laughter might tip them off lol.

			^lol.  it might be possible, but from what i understand (from psionguild) magick and psionics use different types of energy, which makes this harder...not to mention that this type of manipulation and programing is pretty advanced.

			Heh, I love that concept. I'm seriously considering such ideas, but trying to create a way that it does not require any sort of material posession, or hinders my performance. You could also call it Anchoring (see article about anchoring in psipog)

			In my various explorations of t3h intarweb  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" border="0" />  (I spend too much time in front of the computer) I found this site which I like and is more about practical non-fluffy magic; it sounds sort of similar to what you're talking about&#058;

Yeah I know well enough about that stuff.. however I didn't want to even think about the fact that i'm using magic. I think all of that stuff is merely a visualization, relevant to my interests to cause a fun way to manipulate psi with knowing that it isn't anything else but psi.
<br />

<br />
For example, try to look for the psion class in D&amp;D, they have some cool sounding spells, but seriously, if you think it's actually magic and spells, then you're not a psionic XD take yer magick elsewheres.

			Slightly off-topic, but I've always been of the opinion that theres no difference between magic(k), prayer, psychic power, prayer etc blah. It's all just different ways of focusing your mind to manipulate energy in a particular way, to obtain an effect. 
<br />

<br />
I don't see causing it to rain in a class being very probable, but I won't say it's impossible. Visualise it, give it energy and see what happens.

Fair enough I suppose. However, I hardly feel that you grouping all things that bear the name magic under this &quot;D&amp;D&quot; fluffiness is wrong. If you actually read that site, (and I doubt you did) you would see that it is hardly &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. It is, IMHO, and objective attempt at showing how energy constructs might be used as a means to an end. In fact, if you had read even part of it the author goes over his choice of words; and explains that though he may call it that it has other names, one of them being PSI. 
<br />

<br />
I agree with him; I believe that there is one sort of &quot;energy&quot; that we manipulate and it is that belief causes me to not care what he calls it; I care about the content, what he means by that word and how what it represents functions. Though his various &quot;castes&quot; seem foolish; the various &quot;beginning magic&quot; sections, in my opinion offer a good introduction into ways to use energy towards an end.

			spells and constructs are just the same... 
<br />
1. in making a consrtuct, you program it or give it instructions on what you want in to do.. same goes for making spells.. except that you have to make up those fancy poetry..
<br />
2. pooling energy in making constructs is like power raising in making spells.. and then when you've gathered enough energy it's time to send it to it's mission or whatever.. 
<br />
3. both also needs sources of energy like fire, earth etc... in magick they have goddess or god for source.. but hey it can be done with constructs..
<br />

<br />
the only difference between these two is that when making a construct you shape it into a ball or something.. in magick no need for those, as long as you've raised enough energy it will work but of course you can also give it shape if you want to..

			I suppose this thread pretty much answers my questions on as to why it is that I say Lightning, the person im talking to says ow and spazzes like their being shocked. Or the TV turns off or their monitor fuzzes a bit.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> but anyway &quot;Psi with the programmed effect and action&quot; seems like the best answer for that happening. Thanks for the unintentional explanation.
