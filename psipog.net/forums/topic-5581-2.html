It's sounding like a bullshit theory, a stupid one. Useless to argue now.

			'The two realities are &quot;Individual reality&quot; (Dreams) and the &quot;Ultimate Reality&quot; (The real world). '
<br />

<br />
Dreams arnt a reality. They obey no laws (At least from the perspective of being in one.) and have no defined rule set which is pretty much a prerequisite of reality. 
<br />

<br />
Given that much your whole theory is deeply flawed. Rules in dreams dont apply to reality because they are two entirely different things. It would be much the same as saying because superman can fly in the comic books and movies that means all of us can fly.
<br />

<br />
There is no connection there. 
<br />

<br />
Even if there were, the second part of your post claims that we wouldnt have full control of the reality we are in because of other people. This isnt a rule of dreams its an arbitrary rule you have created. This has no real connection to the first part of your post.
<br />

<br />
There is also the fact that as vast as the universe is and the potential for a multiverse making it even greater your control as a part of a larger group would probably be non existant as others have pointed out. Saying each galaxy is its own reality is again another arbitrary rule you have invented.
<br />

<br />
'Are psychotic people trained psychics? No.'
<br />
Lucid dreams are manipulated by your will so by that logic a psychotic would also manipulate reality by their will. So the poster has a point. To say that you have to be a trained psychic as well as lucid would be another invented rule. 
<br />

<br />
Im afraid this doesnt make much sense, there are a lot of wild speculations and holes in the logic. If you are content to fantasise about this then you probably need to think it through more and iron out the flaws. If you want a more concrete theory then you should find some papers and sites to back you up.

			The Theory is a theory. Theories suck. Every theory that has not each possibility in it, or so to say has not all factors in it,  is wrong. But theories that don't want to to have everything in themselves are good, especially when they make sense.
<br />

<br />
I think your theory isn't worked out or formulated very well, but the idea behind it is nice. Still i think it is far away from truth. There's no difference between &quot;Individual Reality&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Reality&quot;.
