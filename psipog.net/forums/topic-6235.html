			I had an interesting thought, and I've decided to post a challenge:
<br />

<br />
I've noted how that after a failed OBE attempt, I cannot get to sleep for quite a while because my body is 'rested', in a sense. At least, that's how I feel.. I don't feel tired at all.
<br />

<br />
Now, I figured--if this is possible, that the body rests, and under the ASSUMPTION that the mind can go on without sleep itself, and just relies on the brain getting rest (huh? I don't know what I'm talking about) to function properly, then what would happen if you were to stay awake in mind for a week? Your body would sleep regularly, but your mind would be awake for a whole week.. What would happen? Would you go insane? <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Myself, I think I'm going to try it.. good luck to me not waking myself up for 7 hours. :\
<br />

<br />
It'd be cool though, if others tried it too and posted results/conclusions/progress checks/etc. Or just comment on it with what you know already. Maybe some warnings?

While I've never had this experience (that I recall, and I think I'd remember it), I'm 100% confident that the worst that will happen is that you snap back to your body and are disoriented and confused for a couple of seconds.
<br />

<br />
There are no confirmed cases of lasting physical harm during OBE. I'm about as certain as I can be that you cannot be physically harmed during OBE. Well, I mean, a tornado could hit your house in reality and obviously you'd be physically harmed... but that's unrelated to OBEing.
<br />

<br />
Interested to hear how the OP's idea turned out. For a couple of days I meditated for a couple hours at night and successfully replaced sleep, but found that I was less alert and physically less responsive the following day.

Let's just hypothesize here for a minute.

<br />
I don't really care what's resting when you sleep. What happens if your body is killed/dies?

How can you expect someone to have that answer. Anyone it's happened to is dead. Anyone's guess is as good as yours.

			It's not unusual to have trouble sleeping after an OBE attempt becuase you have just been resting. And your assumption isn't true, at least for 99.9% of our population. The brain needs time to rest and dream.

The same thing that happens if you die in ordinary sleep, I would presume. For obvious reasons, we don't have any reports of what happens if your physical body dies while you are in OBE  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
