			Has anyone ever been out side and when you?re looking up at the clouds you see the swirling little things in the air? Well i'm sure most of you have! Has anyone else has tried to bring this swirling light into their energy body? I tried this last week out side was a great feeling. I started with a psi ball about 2-3in from my head for this psi ball I did use my hands to for it I just cleared my mind and started to use my feelings and my focus to keep its shape. Next I tried to get the light in the air to enter it but it?s a lot harder then I thought. After a few seconds of trying to get the light into the ball and found that it moves randomly and fast I had to focus on slowing them down or speeding up my perception of them what happened to slow them down i?m not sure. all I do know is that the longer you concentrate on the light the slower they move also when you expand you awareness with your eyes open you can see that they are every were at one point I could see them on the brim of my hat its all so interesting. While I tried to pull some into the psi ball I found they move randomly and I had to come up with another way of pulling it in so then I had the idea that on of you showed me I?m sorry I can?t think of the name off hand but it consists of. feeling the psi ball and see the ball as a clear round object that has a in word pull kind of like a black hole but still keeping its round form after a second of focusing on the psi ball and this vortex in this construct the light started to get concentrated in the center and started to spark because of the large amount of light that was being drawn in. this spark appeared 2 time at this point my psi started to run short so I started to pull the psi ball toward me to pull one of the oscillating lights into my 3rd eye. This was the easier part then the vortex or the maintaining the psi ball and trying to make it flash. with my last little bit of focus (I say my last little bit because at this point my kidneys are starting to hurt on both sides from the strain and the energy work) I guided the oscillating light to my forehead and when I tried to pull it in I got this huge flow of energy the soothed the pain in my kidneys and instantly healed a part of my back that was bothering my I say healed because I saw the pain or spiritual mucus flow out of my 3rd eye. This was by far the most energy I have used in conjunction with a psi ball. Just for the methods I used. 1. Visualization to get the ball into place with conjunction with felling. 2. I used thought to help the sub conscious get what I?m trying to do followed by a visualization to manifest it inside the construct. 3. To maintain all this was just keeping the feeling with my sight. 4. Will play a factor in drawing it into my 3rd eye.

<br />
I wrote this so I could know if anyone else has tried anything with this light that is only in sight  in the daytime.....well I think it is given off by the universe and I can only perceive it in the daytime even if its cloudy you can see them.  This has been a 1 week long study so far. I will keep you posted of the data I gather please try looking at them and give your point of view. Thank you for reading this and have fun with your energy.

This is 100% true. The organisms just float on top of every persons' cornea. They're not very noticable unless you're looking for them and they account for that occasional movement out of the corner of your eye.

This is not entirely true. Since those &quot;things&quot; are living, they can be used as a source of psi (Even if they were non-living, it wouldn't matter, but I've found living things, like plants, have more energy than something like a chair). I think that you &quot;believed&quot; they were pure energy, so you &quot;believed&quot; you could aquire large amounts of energy from them. So you did. 
<br />

<br />
Just goes to show what belief can do for you. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

They do nothing harmful to you if that's what you're asking, since they're just bacteria. They just exist.
<br />

<br />
Actually, I think they help your eyes in some way, but I can't remember how.

			Most likely they're feeding off the nurtients in your tears the same way the cells in your eyes do, but that's just a guess.

			They help you see in the dark. The bacteria affect the light inside of your eyes. Also, there are things called &quot;floaters&quot;, which are pieces of your eye that broke off soon after birth, allowing you to see properly. Its nothing magical or anything like that.

			Well I think it is interesting that everyone that replied to this seems to think it is a dilution my eyes are playing on me.  Well sorry to inform you that they are not bacteria in my eye because they move at a fast rate in addition they are light and plus you can't see bacteria with the naked eye. I know they are light because they have the effect of light on the energy body. When you pull one into your 3rd eye you feel a rush of energy and any fatigue you may be experiencing will be healed by the oscillating light. Ok just to humor the skeptics if they were bacteria and I some how could see them with my naked eye then I could see them at any point in time even at night. The orbs i'm referring to can?t be viewed at night, only when the sun is present can their presence be perceived. From the study I am doing on this, the sun has to be present. Just the sun in the sky is fin. The orbs are present when it?s raining when its fogy even snowing. The weather conditions don?t mater as long as the sun is present. Ummm I can?t speak for tornadoes or hurricanes. I suggest everyone that has replied to this article at least look into the blue part of the sky unfocussed eyes and concentrate on the substance in front of you. A big warning do not look into the sun this will cause eye damage even blindness. The sun is not what you are trying to view it?s the light in the air around you. With practice you may be able to see all of the light around you.

I would also like to thank you all for your replies it shows me that you realy doe care about helping me solve this mistory. take a look and diturman for your self what they are. i will keep you posted

			Sorry if you don't really want to hear this, but here it goes.
<br />

<br />
There really are these bacteria, cells, and floaters (or whatever they are) on the surface of your eye. You say they are present whenever there's strong sunlight, so try this: Try and find those lights when there's another big source of light besides the sun. The easiest way I can think of is get your hands on a microscope (this is how I found out about them). Turn the light on, stare into it (without something actually under it), and see if there's any movement. Also, if you wear glasses or contacts, take them out. One last thing: the things move quickly because when you try to look directly at them, they just appear to move away, since they would move along with your eye.

			Shisei, do you mean like when you see a ray of light come in through the window, and these little things are floating throughout the ray or up towards the light? If so, to be blunt, it's dust. I don't know if this is what you are tlaking about, but I'm pretty sure it is what you are explaining. i'm just trying to help.
