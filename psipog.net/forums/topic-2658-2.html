			I appreciate the responses; however the question i proposed is very simple. Seeing that most think other wise let me rephrase. Is the sweet spot in meditation (where you have silence ie no thoughts) the opposite of attention?
<br />

<br />
The_Musician silence would be a benefit to any situation from the standpoint that it is a ruthless army that is invisible. 
<br />

Now michellethemit about the coma. If one were to have a silent mind and then decided to focus on one thing do you think the power of intent would be increased?

Uhm.... ya? Thats the whole point. Clear your mind, then project your intention. All of this could very easily be read up IN THE ARTICLES. Mabye not on meditating perse', but the concept was grasped, atleast by me when i read almost all of the articles. (psycometry, and a few others i havent read yet) Beleive me, it is difficult enough to get some decent results from your psi without having to ask questions on the help that is basically handed to you!

just to point out that some people would have probably got alzimers from it too, which is very far from what your asking. I was thinking of trying to disect it like michelle did, but she beat me to it....

			Well imma have to get a score keeper for all these intelligence points. You started to talk about clearing your mind Musician then alzimers. Integrity musta jumped in front of the intentional train. 
<br />

<br />
Shifting your perspective was all you needed to say. That would have basically answered the first post (however you read all the articles so you knew that). Helping the mind make connections is the answer to your why. 
<br />

<br />
Then another person would bring up that visualizing is a good way to shift perception. blah blah Then I would tell them you can relate visualizing to the Direct Question With Shield Advice. Bringing us full circle to the reason for this. Well in a day to day sense I dont have many friends and reactions always get the better of me; the point being when you accomplish the task of making silence your friend there is a new confidence to handle anything.

Now that makes a lot more sense, ty. 
<br />

<br />
A coma, however, in medicine (and in most casual conversations) is defined as 
<br />

<br />
'A profound state of unconsciousness. A comatose patient cannot be awakened, fails to respond normally to pain or light, does not have sleep-wake cycles, and does not take voluntary actions. Coma may result from a variety of conditions, including intoxication, metabolic abnormalities, central nervous system diseases, and hypoxia.' - Wikipedia
<br />

<br />
I highly doubt that's what you'd want to achieve lol. If you're looking for a term, try 'trance' <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I'd have to say yes, if you meditate on one thought, the intent would be more powerful. If I remember correctly, that is pretty much the basics of psionics (don't quote me on that!). A psibally is created by focusing your attention on a certain spot to pool psi. I think it's safe to assume that the more focused your mind is, the stronger the psiball. 
<br />

<br />
I wouldn't say that the 'sweet spot in meditation' is the opposite of awareness, however. You are very much aware of that one thought that you are focusing on <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />
The above is my opinion on the subject, meant to be delivered in a non-offensive manner. If anyone has different views on the subject, post away!
<br />

<br />

<br />
PS. The other posters do make a good point. Reading the articles will probably give you a better grasp on the subject than my post.

It appears that you always know the answer you are looking for. So, why even ask questions? You are merely looking for a way to provoke other people into &quot;Answering Intelligently&quot;. There's no point in doing so. If you want to play games, go somewhere else. If you want to learn about Psi, meditation, and any other subject: Stay, Ask questions people can EASILY understand, and be prepared to here SOME people say things you're not going to like without getting offended.
<br />

<br />
Ok, I know you enjoy speaking in a some-what nonsensical, or non-standard manner, that's great and creative and all. But if you want to communicate you have to &quot;speak the language&quot; of the person you are communicating to you. You don't speak english to someone who doesn't understand english.

Get it, sly?

			SheepKing I am impressed with the amount of words you could make a remark with. Now going to great lengths reading all the post shows your a responsible reader...let me rephrase...you read well.  
<br />

<br />
michellethemit brought the good word of trance into this flow. Others just make connections easier by posting when the have a positive way to add information. Now we know everyone does this so Ill just step away as a cinderblock lands on who doesn?t.

Getting back on track with the folks who can still walk let me ask if anyone is proficient with mantras.

			They seem to be a tool for quieting the mind. Now on the topic of silence let me mention that breathing is very important to a quiet mind. If anyone knows how exhaling can represent yang please say.
<br />

<br />
Now to give this cage an animal of substance a new logic has caught my attention. The two selves (higher and lower) both serve us equally. When using the higher self we focus on teaching the lower self. 
<br />

<br />
Would there be positive consequence from teaching the higher self while in the lower? The higher self seems to have an understand of fluid thoughts, however a lesson in solid permanence might tilt a favor in your direction.
