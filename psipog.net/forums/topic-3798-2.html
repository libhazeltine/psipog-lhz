nice then, well, the thing was:
<br />

<br />
i was thinking about cons. and sub.cons, that everybody says we got no acess to sub.c, and stuff. then, if we got no acess, it means: barrier.
<br />
what i did then: i thought: well, ill undo this barrier.
<br />
it came to my mind an image like a dark space (i think) that would be the espace that my both minds are in, and the both minds. but don't get attained to this so much, cause it was not solid you know. it's kind of an idea of black room, but not as a real black black black room. sometimes the idea comes, but it's not solid. cons in left, sub in right side. cons was somewhat white, and sub was darker, like black or grayed black.
<br />
they could be like some espace far from each other, or like some fluid, or even &quot;solid&quot; stuff very close OR not, just separated by a barrier, which was somewhat black too. like this:   cons||sub cons--1
<br />
or like this:  cons    ||    sub cons  ---2
<br />
this || means barrier 
<br />

<br />
ok, then what i did: ill take this out. first i thought that both ones were kinda liquid, so f i took the barrier, they would be realeased and would meet and mix with each other. then i thought it wouldn't be very nice (visualization i think) and thought: no, they are kinda boxes on each side, not liquids.
<br />
remember that they weren't always like 1 above neither like 2, they would change between both
<br />

<br />
then, i started taking barrier off. i don't know about you, but i'm not ale just to think: it's undone - and see it undone. i think things like them being REALLY done, and it takes time. i try to imagine all stages.
<br />
then i started trying to undo like an energy field, not like a glass that you can shelter to pieces (i thought of that but didn't like this idea).
<br />
so tried to leech it's energy, ground it, or just make it get weaker and weaker. after some time it would start blinking, fading i should say, stronger, weaker, stronger, weaker, you know, and would do that first slower, faster, slower, faster, faster, faster, until it was blinking fast, and looking like &quot;desacelerating&quot; until it &quot;poof&quot; completely faded.
<br />
after i did that, i sometimes thought of my own energy being sent to my head, from outer head to center, and it would go to that barrier and consolidate it undone, melted. like when you get a hot metal and put it into a wound. sometimes the barrier would try to come back, and i instanly made it weak and didnt let it come back.
<br />

<br />
ok. after that i thought: oh, now there is no barrier, but there is no CONECTION also.
<br />
so i imagined a first string, which looked like a, hm... you watched some cartoons alredy didn't you, with moving roots, or vines, or strings, controlled by someone, that would cling to someone else, and stuff. so, this first string  (which was white/ milky white) originated from the cons.
<br />
and went growing and waving (like a snake movment) until it reached the sub.c, and conected to it. then it got stabilished, and a lill thicker. NOW it was conected, the first and major conection. after that, a lot of other little strings started to do the same as the first one, and i strated to conect to my sub.c more and more strongly. sometimes this strings would be repelled you know, but then more one created and went on the conections. 
<br />
THIS took time, for the secondary conections to start to be created. yeah, it took me time to establish the first one. i was watching world cup game and it took like whole game, or at least half of it, to do it. don't remember exactly. again i used energy that would come to the white &quot;box&quot;, make it kinda bright, as it had absorbed it, then it spread all over the conections and would go through them and making them stronger. done this some times, and i still do (impressive how the memory of the first conection was always on my mind... i didn't forget about it) sometimes now, to mantain it.
<br />

<br />
then i thought: well, i think sub c will conect to consc now. and it started with one conection (blackened one) then another several ones, but this time i didn't make much effort on it. it went by &quot;itself&quot; now for me it's all wired cons -&gt; subc and subc--&gt; cons
<br />
think i didn't forget anything, and I tried to describe the best as possible...
<br />
ah, and after that, i really felt like something was actually happening, very interesting... and felt like it was real, and i was more able, very nice indeed.
<br />

hope you enjoyed reading ^^
