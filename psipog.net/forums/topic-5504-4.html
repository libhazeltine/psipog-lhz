			im sorry, i didnt know that the line didnt bend....
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://www.arkansasstripers.com/images/knot11.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Its called strong line.  Maybe not exactly fishing line (although there is fishing line that could hold an entire boat suspended in the air) but there is other kind of line out there.
<br />

<br />
Yes, i am sorry.  There is a difference between bend and bow.  Here is the definition of &quot;bow&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
That is <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">COMPLETELY</span></span> different!  Even though the definition has the same word in it!  I forgot that the dictionary lies to me.
<br />

<br />
My main point that you dont seem to get is this:
<br />

<br />
When Criss Angel has done his levetation acts, many poeple in the audience actually thinks he has levetated.  Therefore, when asked if he does levetate, if he said &quot;Yes&quot;, he would not be labeled as anything.  However, he has said no and has shown people how to do his levetation.  I think you might be the only one here that does not understand this.
<br />

<br />
I am done argueing.  There have been many Criss Angel threads and I have argued in almost all of them.  Bottom line is that Criss Angel admits he is an illusionist and has shown people how he does his tricks.  Is he fun to watch?  Of course!  He is another magician!
<br />

<br />
If you do not know what an illusionist is, please refer to the dictionary entry below:

Or something similar.... well if you look at that, there is a flaw, you see... actually two... first off it would still bend in the middle, unless they were really close... but then people wouldn't be able to swim under it... also people wouldn't be able to swim above the surface infront of him... because last time I checked people can't go through plexi glass, unless they have some powers...</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Log my whole point is that no it probably wouldn't look like that if a bridge is the case....My point is that it was built in a way so that all those things you talked about could be possible (swimming around it and so on) and that's the whole point to it...You don't know how it's done so you can't picture it in your head and say, no that just can't work...if you knew how it worked we wouldn't be having this argument and criss would be poor...anyways I too am done with this thread[/quote]

Sorry, I read this entire thread, and realized how idiotic people really are.  It brought me to the point of insanity, but then I saw the above post, and forgot all the anger I had, and how much I was going to pwn log2.  Log2, I'm going to give you some things to ponder:
<br />

<br />
If chris is for real, why isn't the government researching him?
<br />
If chris is for real, why does he have to have his back to us in <span style="font-style: italic">most</span> of his levitation tricks, and when his back isn't turned, why is it next to a wall?
<br />
If chris is for real, why does he have paid actors?  (trust me, I have acted for many years, I KNOW when someone is acting.)
<br />
Why did I see the same audience member picked for his tricks in two different cities if chris is for real?
<br />
If chris is for real, wouldn't levitating be enough?  Why does he have to do card tricks and other illusions as well?  I mean, if the paid actors standing around him didn't see the secret behind his levitation, wouldn't they already be amazed?
<br />
If chris is for real, would certain religions see him as a returned messiah of some sort?
<br />

<br />
You're right though, you do have the right to believe in what you want to, and we all respect that.  It's when you start irrationally thinking, and attacking respected members of this site that we get hostile and attack your intelligence.  If you wouldn't have attacked apollo, and started to actually think before you posted, we wouldn't be in this giant arguement now, that will probably get locked soon.  If you wish to talk about chris angel, there are about 20 other threads already with chris as the topic.  Just read the words above the &quot;post box&quot; when you reply.  They are big, in bold, and state Be Intelligent.
<br />

<br />
As for walking on water, isn't it possible that he is on some sort of clear, plastic, moving platform?  The clear plastic would keep you from seeing it.  Since the platform is small, so people could swim in front and behind him without running into it.  Since the platform moves, it would give the illusion of chris moving, he just has to walk in place.  And, since the platform moves slow, this would keep any wake or waves from being created.

Yeah cept if it were a moving platform he couldn' actually walk forward on it, he would go off the edge and fall into the water.  Trust me.  I can do magic tricks, some things where a card instantly changes right before your eyes.  Yes, it looks like &quot;magic&quot; and impossible but it's one of the most simple things I know.  Chris Angel is an illusionist.  Illusionists create illusions to make their audiences believe that they can perform supernatural feats.  All he is, is a very GOOD illusionist.  I'd like to believe he can do those things, doesn't everyone.  But seriously, those levitating ones on the side walks and stuff, magicians have been using cranes and pulleys and crap like that to do that.  Personally I watched it a few times, Chris doesn't just float right up.  It kind of looks like when he leaves the ground he wobbles a bit in some of the clips.  I don't think you would wobble if you were levitating &quot;naturally.&quot;  But anyway.  If you really want to believe a guy can float across building and walk on water go right ahead.

*cough*  You do know that I know chris is fake, right?  Because the way you worded your post seems like you are telling me that he's fake after I said he was real (which I didn't).  Also, I did say he could walk in place on the platform...I don't think you move forward when walking in place.
<br />

<br />
But yeah, everything else you said I agree with, and you have a bit more reliability on this issue since you are in fact a magician.  You know the tricks, and are fammiliar with set ups and misleading eyes.

			Sorry to break it to you, but if you search hard enough you can find vidoes of &quot;Criss Angel&quot; (not even his real name) showing how he does all his hokus pokus. He doesn't do tk, he is an illusionest, that is it.
<br />

<br />
Say what you want, but it is a fact that he is a fake.

</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">Well I didn't want to keep going, but if you force me to, why does not only levitate and do card stuff and illusions, because well, if you see a person levitate 300 times, wouldn't it get boring. Also that's not true that he is always near a wall, look at the video that I posted earlier, it's a compilation of criss angel levitating, only one of them is near a small wall (the vid apollo posted could explain that) and there's also one where he's near a wall, but there are two where he's nowhere near a wall, and he goes pretty high off the ground, also the people are not paid actors.. I've never seen the same person twice, I've looked many times... and if they were actors, don't you think some people would be posting it all over the internet, the &quot;actors&quot; would say it all over the place... also I know some of the tricks are illusions, I can do some of his tricks, they're usually not hard... Lastly, people wouldn't see him as a god, because a lot of people can actually do it too, maybe not as well as him
