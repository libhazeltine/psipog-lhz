When it's a group that thinks they can move an asteroid out of the way of the earth... I think there is a problem.
<br />

<br />
I could've sword we were all about destroying fluff. I mean honestly, it could be possible over decades but not 6 years. I don't care how many people there are, and I doubt you could get more than, one thousand people. Not to crush a dream, but honestly, how succesful would this be?

I'm partly referring to 2012 here. I don't believe it will happen, but would it hurt so much to just be prepared for what does? I have assembled an idea here, sporting the world's favourite: DEMOCRACY! There will be 5 squadrons. Each squad will specialize in a different thing and each will have 13 members including a captain and vice captain.
<br />

<br />
1st Squad: Remote Viewing
<br />
Captain-
<br />
Vice Captain-
<br />
Members:
<br />

<br />
2nd Squad: Psychokinesis
<br />

<br />
Vice Captain-

Members:

<br />
3rd Squad: Dreams

4th Squad: Manipulators

<br />
5th Squad: Healers
<br />
Captain-

Vice Captain-
<br />
Members:

<br />
Descriptions of each squad and their function.
<br />
1st squad- in charge of remote viewing, job is to predict and search.
<br />

<br />
2nd squad- in charge of pk, they are the ones who can move objects, and the ones who will train in pk incase a meteor does head near earth.
<br />

<br />
3rd squad- in charge of dreams, the people who can walk the plane of dreams and seek information hidden to the physical world.
<br />

<br />
4th squad- in charge of manipulation, these people will be incharge of psionic defense, they are the guardians of the physical world.
<br />

<br />
5th squad- in charge of healing, if a psion is hurt, they will be in charge and expected to help them.
<br />

<br />

List Of Interested People:

<br />
1- FrostBitten

2- Soullurker

How to get into a squadron, you will be elected, if you interested, post, and I will add your name to the list of interested people and you will be elected from there. Elections will be help in a few weeks.

Alright, Big Roy is gonna break it down for you:
<br />

<br />
1) The premise is babbled and poorly connected, but it seems like you want to create a group of psions to train for an impending doom in 2012 or to regulate the psionics community where combat is concerned.  Correct me if I'm wrong.
<br />

<br />
2) No offense, but what you don't know about psionic combat could probably fill the Atlantic.  How are you going to moderate something you don't understand?
<br />

<br />
3) Speaking of paranoia, how are you going to be able to tell the difference between a psionic-n00b who's actually been attacked and runs to you for help, and a psionic-n00b who's been doing psionics for a few weeks, feels a little tired, and FUCKING FREAKS OUT THINKING THERE ARE SCORES AND SCORES OF PSIONIC-VAMPIRES WHO ARE OUT TO GET HIM, SUCKING HIM DRY OF ALL HIS PSI AND HIS SOUL ?  I felt like emphasizing that last part to better reflect the mindset of the aforementioned person.  So, said n00b goes to you for help, picks a random name/person out of his head because he &quot;feels&quot; or &quot;thinks&quot; that it is the person who is doing it, and then you and your &quot;squadron&quot; dish out all the psi-nukes, flaming psi-swords, and artificial intelligence psi-pet sabretoothes on some unsuspecting kid.  Or say you even shield the kid tighter than a drum.  It doen't matter what you do.  God forbid any influence you put on this UNPROVEN attacker has an abnormal effect on him.  You'd be guilty of the same thing you are trying to regulate.  The same goes for the kid you'll try to protect.
<br />

<br />
4) I'm seriously sick of hearing all this unfounded speculation about 2012.    Everyday I hear a new 2012 theory: &quot;OMFG, I just read that on 2012, a race of flaming 20 foot tall monkeys with battle-axes for arms will rise from the Rainforest to destroy mankind for its hubris and anti-environmentalism!&quot;  Give me a break. 
<br />

<br />
5) It's nice to see that you're trying to organize a group of psions for a beneficial purpose, don't get me wrong.  As much as I bash the idea, I enjoy the spirit in which you propose it.  It's just that you're trying to create a group of self-important, fledgling psions with an overexaggerated sense of self-responsibility toward the conservation and protection of the earth from astronomically-improbable disaster scenarios and the rarely occurring behaviors of idiot psions that seem to be so popular in online circles.  Most people come to psipog for self-improvement and discovery, not to save the world from meteors.
