			I was practicing my tk with my psiwheel and had  another one about six times the size nearby (about 1 foot away). While working with the little one, the bigger one would began to shake. I know it wasnt my breath or anything becasue the smaller one is way more sensitive. Unfortunatly when I tried to make the bigger one spin it would only shake. But I could get the smaller one to spin quite easily. I was wondering if this might be the fact that the TK has like a shotgun like spray and im kind of moving everythin nearby. Or maybe its the fact that im trying to move a psiwheel and my sub -c says, oh psiwheel  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> , well he wanted me to move it &gt;.&gt; soo ... (begins to move)
<br />

<br />
I also thought this was what caused my poltergeisting to happen. I would move random things that I couldn't even if I practiced. One time my TV even turned on <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> . 
<br />

<br />
Could this wide range tk cause the poltergeisting or is it the other way around? And might anyone know a why to kind of decrease the spread range? Then I could like double my TK powers!!!!!!!!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

			The same thing happens to me. Sometimes, I move an object attached to a string and I see an other object attached to an other string move.

2 things:
<br />

<br />
1. Keep your focus on the object, dont let your mind wonder, like (incoming example);
<br />

<br />
NeoPsychic:' Hmmm, this bloody psiwheel doesnt seem to be moving much.'
<br />
Sub-c: 'Getting bored already.'
<br />
Neopsychic: 'Still wont budge'
<br />
Sub-c: 'Sooooo bored, hey look, over theres a challenge, a big psiwheel'
<br />
Neopsychic: 'Holy shit, that big psiwheel is moving!'
<br />
Sub-c: 'Who da man, who da man, *points at self*'
<br />
Neopsychic: ' Now back to the mini wheel'
<br />
Sub-c: 'Dude, are you insulting me? i could move this with a mere thought'
<br />
Neopsychic: 'Good lord its moving, with more control!'
<br />

<br />
The more focus you have on your particular object, the easier and faster it will be to move, since youve moved the big psiwheel, your sub-c thinks, 'oh that was f*cking easy, i can move this mini wheel with a mere thought.' As our mind seems to think that if youve moved something larger, moving something smaller will be as easy as pie.
<br />
Also, if you did focus on a particular object, i shouldnt imagine that your Tk abilities will double, that comes with time, practice and focus.

			Just keep practicing, then you will have more power and control, if you wish to learn more aboutpower and control, read N_I's thread, amazingly entitled 'power vs control'.

			the problem is that i have the focus but not all the energy is going where my focus is !!!! <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />  I've read NI's thread a few times, yeah time takes care of everything and what not. What happens if it's something natural. I think that &quot;spread range&quot; is what causes geisting (not THE factor, but a major player non the less). Then again might it be the other way around?
<br />
If this problem persits would there be a way to &quot;fix&quot; it? (I doubt you can though   <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> )

			'geisting is something you cant control. Thats why its geisting. As soon as you have control over it, by definition it is now Psychokinesis.
<br />

<br />
But if you learn more control, and keep your attention on one thing, and only that one thing, you will have better results. One exercise some people like is you put a picture in your mind, and see how long you can hold it there. Then try something else, until you get bored or headache or other signs you should stop.
