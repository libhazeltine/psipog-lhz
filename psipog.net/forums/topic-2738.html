			Alright so I was in school the other day and my frined who is also a psi user and telepath, told me he senced some kind of wierd presence in the school, and of course I put up my psi sheilds and had energy building up in my body incase I got into trouble, but what im asking is, is there any real definite way to sence the presence of spirits? because apparently my friend can, and I havent figured it ot yet. So if any of you know any way to sence presences, spirits or any other malovlent entity, please share the wealth. Thanks much.

			no sense in asking here... they will just throw that religious bs at you. Seems that psipogs rules are only stepping on their own feet. Sure it keeps the intellegence level up, but you have to understand that intellegent debates about these kinds of things can happen. It does all the time. I would say dont be so broad and moderate by topic, instead of lumping everyone in one basket.

			The rules are there for a reason.
<br />
when trying to sense &quot;presences&quot; i use a kind of psionic radar, it's probably remote presence, but i just send a 'wave' out in all directions or a certain direction and i'll usually be able to sense something if there's anything there.
<br />
there is no definitive way, mind. just like constructs or RV. there's no set way of doing things.

			I have had eerie senses of like what it feels when i pick up empath/telepath things from people, but coming from people i know are dead... I pass it off as my sub-c &quot;recalling&quot; memories. or my mind playing tricks on me. I don't know if I believe in &quot;spirits&quot; but i have had I have sensed some things I can't explain before.

If you do not agree with our rules, then please leave. Calling our rules bullshit is not only disrespectful it's also stupid. The rules are made for a reason. If you have any common sense then you'll know why we made these rules and why we enforce them. The next time you feel like being disrespectful, you and I will have a little chat in PM. Use your common sense kid. 
<br />

<br />
This topic is locked. Read the rules. I thank all the members who took it upon themselves to enforce the rules. You guys are great.
