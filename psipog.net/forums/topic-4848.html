			Anyone ever hear of this? I just watched the news tonight and seen about it. Then I read up abit more on it. While I usually would brush something like this off for its flaws. Flaws being that the children that are supposed to be special, the idea is a double edged sword; sure it makes them feel good about themselfs, but it can also make someone feel superiority to anouther. The only thing that kept me interested was there serious use of the word Chi(which I have always been interested in) and a list I came across for the reasons a person might be indigo- I was every one of them. And althoe I have seemed to have lost whatever it is I used to have as a kid, I still see it in other people.  
<br />

<br />
My younger cousin, only 5 years old really makes me feel happy when I see him. It's wierd because I usually hate kids, and can't understand them anymore at all, but this kid just seems so cool to me. It's because he kinda reminds me of myself when I was akid. He's just really differant. And while most kids are playing sports and talking about commen things, this kid is building stuff, talking about the 'force' from watching star wars lol, thinking of creative ideas, and acting like an adult in someways. Hes really calm, and has these 'wise eyes' as it has been said for a Indigo kid to have. When I read the article I instantly thought of this kid.
<br />

<br />
The idea still sounds kind of rediculous in some ways. I think some parents bring there kids to these special schools because they really want there child to be something unique. And if the idea was taken to the extreme it could potentially mess a kid up, and make him even more alienated to other people.

ill fill you in on something, we dont want the lable, we actually hate it, the name Indigo is because our core aura is made of the indigo color which is a term created by the english... in asia, we are not called indigo's. we have been here since the late 1800's, not 1960's like that other topic said... all of us know we are not superior to anyone else, we have pure love for ALL beings. we do alot of the times seem arrogant or egotistical but thats only because we know what we are talking about  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> . and the lables that we are given is only for understanding of our agenda.
<br />
as with &quot;crystal children&quot; and &quot;starseed&quot; ect...
<br />

<br />
the main point and reason why we are all here is to protect and raise the frequencies of the earth; protect, teach, and assist in ascention of the human race.
<br />

<br />
so, even if you doubt the fact we exist, we still love you and will protect and help you.  enjoy the information <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
p.s. please dont refer to me as being an &quot;Indigo&quot;; sure, my core aura is indigo and violet but im not different than you. would be like if someone with a yellow aura always got called a yellow child  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			heh, I remember when people knew that Indigo children are just fictional bullshit. Now people use the term as if though it actually means something real.

   Really people... Indigo Children are NOT real. Stop thinking you're one of them. They were just created by some set of idiots.

well your post doesnt say much besides the fact that your OPINION is that people do not possess the color indigo (purplish-blue) in thier core aura... and you have no documention or information to make your opinion credible besides the fact that it is what you think and what you think is what the fact is. now, how are you determining that people are not able to possess indigo in thier core aura? random burst of blissful ignorance possibly... but i think its more than that... i think you yourself think that the lable indigo means that ones that would possess the color in the core aura would be considered superior to you. which infact is not true... its only a color which is determined by the rate at which your body is vibrating (aka frequency) and of course, the amplitude of the vibrational frequency determines the shade of the color (that was previously determined by the frequency) that your body emits. People may place other meanings on the lable &quot;Indigo Child&quot; but in actuallity, that is the basic meaning of the lable. so now you have 2 choices:
<br />

<br />
1.) accept the information ive given you, and learn something new within this subject.
<br />

<br />
2.) deny the information ive given you, and be dormant on increasing your knowledge upon this subject.
<br />

<br />
i dont mean to sound rude about the two options but thats basically all that there is to choose from. so now the choice is up to you to choose what you wish. and i wish you well on your choice as i know its hard to accept something you once denied. so good luck, and be well <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

   I don't believe in auras in the traditional sense. I do not believe they have colors or mean much. Colors don't really mean much to me. Colors are colors. The times that colors do mean something to me don't really care about my interpretation of what they mean. If you have hard evidence for auras please show me. I've yet to see any that shows that auras are real (in the &quot;traditional&quot; sense).
<br />

<br />
   A lot of these Indigo Children things just seem like ADD/ADHD or Autism. It sounds like people are trying to give a positive spin using a different name explanation to those &quot;disorders&quot;. Do you have anything saying otherwise?
<br />

<br />
   You have two choices.
<br />

<br />
   1.) Give me some proof/evidence and show that you're not just talking out of your ass.
<br />

<br />
   2.) Refuse to give me some proof/evidence and continue talking out of your ass/quit talking about this.
<br />

<br />
   I don't think I sound rude giving you those two options, but basically that's all there is to chose right now. You pick which you want. I doubt you'll respond to this. Oh well.

thanks for the mockary to show your immaturity, but unfortunately, i cannot take pictures through my eyes so unless you develope the ability to see the energy EVERYTHING in the universe emits, i think youre screwed <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> and its not about refusing... theres just no electronic equipment that i personally have that can allow you to see auras. 
<br />

<br />
and as you have chosen, im sorry you chose what you did but freewill is what we all have <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> and your opinion and my opinion are both legitament towards both of our realities. so ill make light of the note and say neither of us are incorrect when it is pertaining to our individual realities. so all i can do is wish you well on your path that you have chosen.

I do not believe the colours in aura (if there are any) have any sort of meaning. I do however not believe its ADHD or Autism that makes Indigo's think differently... I am autist myself and do i think that differently? Also, frequency of your body vibrations is, to me, because of body temperature. Sure its average is something like 38.something but there are people whose temperature is a couple degrees off... To me, its just not important. Some kids just cant get any piece of a puzzle to fit, the other one saying: Buzz off with that puzzle, i have better things to do at home. Indigo is a senseless term for a nicer category of the last one.

lolol, but see, i didnt say the colors had a certain meaning... people make too much fuss over the lables, when all i said was that its just means its the color in the core aura... thats all ... hmmm, think daniel is the one that reitterated what i said. but anyhow, i guess if you are not able to see it, then i guess it would be hard to understand what im talking about. the aura has 7 different layers, ive seen auras since the 3rd grade. and again, i was always told im lying when i was younger... no one believed what i was saying i was seeing around people... so its not like all this was taught to me at an early age to where i just think i see it... i saw it before i ever knew what it was. not to mention the other things but i wont go on that road even though this discussion has turned into a discussion about auras, instead of what the topic subject says. heres an easy thing... to do, and very easy to see... to me anyways... look directly at something brown.... now take your two index fingers (and if for some reason youre missing an/both index fingers, use any two fingers (one finger per hand) now...  put them between you... and the brown background you are looking at...  put your fingers about 1-2inches apart... and start moving them up and down slowly while looking inbetween your fingers (left one up while right one down, right up and left down and so forth) you should say the aura/energy that is being emitted from your finger go into each other... which would make the two overlapping parts be denser than the rest... (although you are able to see it without it overlapping)... its actually quite fun to see <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> but thats the easiest way ive found to see your own aura (that whole white bg thing doesnt work very well because of course depending on your skin color, it will effect the negative image that is burned into your eyes... so if you are white for instance, the skin is pretty yellow, so if you were to move it by accedent, you would of course see blue (since it is the negative image). the part you see should be about or a little over an inch thickness all the way around your finger... not just when you move it... and with a brown background, its less likely to burn an image into your eyes to cause &quot;ghost colors&quot; i guess you could call them lol... well, try that and see what ya get... is the only way i can think of for people to prove to themselves

(although you are able to see it without it overlapping)... its actually quite fun to see  but thats the easiest way ive found to see your own aura (that whole white bg thing doesnt work very well because of course depending on your skin color, it will effect the negative image that is burned into your eyes... so if you are white for instance, the skin is pretty yellow, so if you were to move it by accedent, you would of course see blue (since it is the negative image). the part you see should be about or a little over an inch thickness all the way around your finger... not just when you move it... and with a brown background, its less likely to burn an image into your eyes to cause &quot;ghost colors&quot; i guess you could call them lol... well, try that and see what ya get... is the only way i can think of for people to prove to themselves</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

   Paragraphs please. Ignoring that...

   So having an indigo aura DOESN'T mean you're an Indigo person? I recall you saying this:

   I'm kind of lost here.

<br />
   heh, as for the aura things... seven layers? Lots of other people say it has one layer. Or two layers. Or three layers. Or four. It goes on and on.
<br />

<br />
   As for that eye thing... a lot of &quot;aura&quot; stuff can be any number of things. Dust, glare, after images, eye problems, etc, etc.

			So-called 'Indigo Children' are not special because of some mystical aura.  To quote George Carlin, that's &quot;New-Age hippy bullshit.&quot;  Indigo children are simply kids who have a brain mutation that results in a higher understanding of the world at their age.  Most young children simply do whatever they can to seek short-term sensual pleasure.  (No, not THAT kinds of sensual pleasure!  Ewww!  You sick-minded fiend!)

daniel... yes i did say that... but, i hold no meaning to the lable of indigo child... to me it only represents the color of an aura... where as say, if yours is green, then so be it yours is green, mines indigo... whats the big deal that you are making out of it? lol

well sure, i guess the eye problems and dust or glare would be an explanation if in fact the haze did not go completely around your body (not only where light is) and it moves with your finger... not like...laggy... or kinda like a whip when you snap it, it moves with it...  like steal rods would be sticking out of a concrete ball...

   Did you contradict yourself? Anyway, why apply that term? It doesn't mean anything. Right? Should we start calling people with a &quot;green aura&quot; Green Children? Should we maybe assign something to them? Like being mean and angry?

if you read all my posts word for word, you would find that i did not contredict myself... unfortunately, i think you only read the first 3 sentences lol...  
<br />

<br />
but im not the one that invented the name indigo children, blame them, not me lol... im just the messenger... but as i said before, they created the name for a better understanding of the agenda and or awareness coming into the world.. but if you ask anyone that has indigo in thier core aura, they will till you that they hate the lable and it means diddly squat to them...
<br />

<br />
for how ever many posts ive replied to you. thats basically where i was trying to get across to you, but since you dont read all my post, i guess that is why it took so long... is the fact that its just a color of an aura... nothing special... and no, not everyone that has indigo in thier aura has been diagnosed with a disorder lol, thats a huge missconception.
