			I think this idea of a bunch of people getting together and trying to learn how to phase, but I think personally it will be a while before any of us get results. 
<br />
Rainsong said in the article she had been studying psionics for about a decade before she would randomly start phasing. I don't mean to offend anyone's skill, but I think a lot of us really aren't prepared skillwise to achieve phasing yet and even handle it if we do manage to phase.
<br />
Keep tugging though, I just wanted to say, like I said before, it will probably be a long while before we begin to see results.
<br />

<br />
Another thing too, what if instead of trying to phase yourself or parts of yourself, try to phase other objects into each other. This might be much harder, but this cancels out the risk of injury and once you learn how to phase other objects without getting them stuck then maybe you should start training with your body. This is an approach I would personally take just because I don't want to be phased into a penny, but hey like I said earlier go for it guys if you're willing.

			An idea for phasing imagery/visualization... imagine that what you're phasing through is made out of water, as well as &quot;fluffing&quot; out your field like rainsong said to pass through it.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I'll be trying this out aswell.

			Well whenever I try to phase I get these weird feelings in my hands and It feels like I'm about to go through. I'll expereement a little more and tape the results. Ok its burning when I concentrate on putting my finger through paper.

			derricktheone, 1. My mum doesn't go to bed until 2 am and she's witnessed me doin it a couple of times 2. Yes, it does wake me up, what do you think? and 3. My subconscious does a lot of things. Why didn't I stop phasing half way through my bed? Or on the living oom ceiling? There you go

			Phasing sounds very interesting but I think its smarter to learn shield wich prevents me from phasing and try to make one object go trough another one. This is more dangerous then anything Ive seen on this site, careful please

			All about the shields... I don't even know much about shields. I'd say a toothpick through paper should be a good start or water through a cup?Never tried that one just thought of it.

			Wow, lots of support and whatnot thanks guys, I'm sorry I haven't been on in a while. I spent a half a week in Lilydale researching telikinesis and astral projection at the Marion Skidmore Library, lots of good, old books there. And then school started, and I'm in all honors classes so I've been loaded up with homework.xD I haven't really had much chance to try phasing, although some wierd things have been happening to me lately, and I couldn't think of anyone to tell them to. I guess I could post them here but... I don't know. Ok, well I'm going to keep trying to phase, and everyone keep up the support and good work! <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I'd like to be apart of this. I've never done phasing, but from what I hear, it's basically about doing stuff with atoms and matter. I can be a good help when it comes to studying, and I'm trying out Phasing myself.
