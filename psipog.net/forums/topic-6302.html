<br />
I have studied the subject in their original scriptures called the yoga sutras.
<br />

<br />
Siddhis are by-products of progressing on the spiritual path. They are indeed divided into eight major categories. But there are many many more siddhis. When you are performing PK, you are using your siddhi's albeit at a very low level. Your powers will grow significantly once your mind becomes one-pointed and consicousness manages to reach deeper states of matter. 
<br />

<br />
As they are explained in the yoga sutras, their is only one key element to using these siddhi's that one needs to obtain, which is called <span style="font-weight: bold">Samyama.</span>
<br />

<br />
Samyama is the mastered combination of <span style="font-weight: bold">Concentration; Meditation and Samadhi.</span>
<br />

<br />
Concentration being the part when you are focussing the mind on something, aka tuning in (to..). Secondly: Meditation, which occurs when alot of practice in concentration gets rewarded by a one-pointed mind, which enables you to focus without effort, this is, according to Patañjali: meditation. Then after experience is gaine din meditation, consciousness will obtain the skill to emerge with the object or subject of meditation. Which means that Consciousness <span style="font-style: italic">becomes</span> the object.
<br />

<br />
There are four different states in samadhi, and depending on which state one reaches, a significant amount of direct knowledge about the object or subject of meditation is acquired. When you reach the deepest state of samadhi in that certain object or idea, you will know everything there is to know about that object. As a result of that, you will be able to manipulate its mechanism in any way you like.
<br />

<br />
That is pretty much the theory behind the practice of siddhi's.
<br />

<br />
So the practice means that you should master Samyama. In chapter three of the yoga sutras, siddhis are explained and examples are given. Pretty much each of those examples start with: &quot;By samyama on...&quot;
<br />

<br />
To take a few examples you guys might like:
<br />

<br />
A simple one:
<br />
Sutra #3.25:
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">By samyama on the strength of an elephant, one obtains that strength.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
So you won't turn into an elephant (unless that is your intention perhaps) but you will acquire the strength of the elephant.
<br />

<br />
Here is another nice feat:
<br />
Sutra #3.21:
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">By samyama on the form of one's own body and by intercepting the light from the observer, the body becomes invisible.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Here is an example of a sutra concerning the siddhi's that is an exception in the sense that it does not start of with: &quot;By samyama on...&quot;
<br />
Sutra #3.40: 
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">By mastery over the <span style="font-style: italic">Udana</span> nerve current (the upward vital air) one accomplishes levitation of the body and can thereby hover over obstacles such as water, mud and thorns.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Mastery, however, is obtained through much practice of samyama on that nerve current. When you recieve all knowledge of the udana nerve current; when one realises all its aspects directly in samadhi, you gain mastery of it.
<br />

<br />
So samyama is the key-element. In western translation you could say: Focus, concentration. However, both these words do not comprehend the true meaning of samyama.
<br />

<br />
So how long will it take you?
<br />

<br />
Depends on you, and you alone.

I cannot answer your first question because the succes of alot of things, but especially growth in a spiritual manner, depends on the persons mind and past lives and discipline and determination, trust, faith, stuff like that.
<br />

<br />
Your second question is a very good question in my eyes Rahmid. 
<br />

<br />
Is there any point in practicing these siddhis besides being fun for the ego to show around? Yes there is. There are thousands of siddhis which can be divided into higher and lower siddhis. Lower siddhis, when misused, are for the ego yes. Higher siddhis, take you closer to enlightenment and can help you alot in reaching new heights. You just have to be careful with the ego or you'll cuase pain somehow. But I guess it can't hurt if you fly around your house from time to time just to enjoy it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

So what would you do to attain this?  Or do you think I should just google search it?

Rahmid
<br />

<br />
edit:  What sutras should I get, there seems to be a few of them(http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/103-8808061-2717442?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=yoga+sutras&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go).
<br />

<br />
also, from what I've read, they are said to impede you from enlightenment, whats that about?

			Well they are obstacles yes. Some of these siddhis are tools to get your consiocusness higher, but eventually all siddhis stop you from reaching full enlightenment. Well not the siddhi's, but your attachment to these siddhis.
<br />

<br />
As for the sutras, try one of those books I recommended you. Either the one written by Swami satchidananda, or I.K. Taimni.
<br />

<br />
You could also try the version of Alice Bailey (sp?)
<br />
I have not personally read that last one, but my yogi master often uses that one together with Taimni's for the lessons.

			@Damien,
<br />

<br />
I don't practice these siddhis, but while progressing on the path, I do ofcourse notice some changes in my potential power. You will start to feel everything like the Force. Energy becomes much easier to manipulate because you get a much better grip on the universal energy at deeper, subtler levels. I don't use much powers at al on the physical level, I use them much more to heal other people and influence or program situations so people's deepest wishes will be granted. There is one aspect on the physical that does appeal me however, that would be the levitation of the body. I feel i am getting closer to achieving that. Even though I do not practice it, at times when I try, I feel very confident, the body becomes light and lifting of the ground feels relatively easy to do. I have moved doors through PK and you could consider those phenomena as powers, but they don't interest me that much. As I said before, I use them for other purposes.

			This is starting to grab my interest. Let me briefly tell you why(briefly cause I'm about to go over to my friend's house to theorize/practice psi).
<br />

<br />
I see myself as a good guy. I don't go around starting fights, don't do drugs or drink. I don't run into troble with the law much, and when I do it's because I'm usually out past curfew on weekends. But I like to lead an easy life, and reading through this topic and a few others looks like, if I practice these things, then I will obtain that easy life. It's sort of a goal, really. I just want to be in situations where I can be happy, and this looks like the right place to look.

			The siddhis were obtained through yogic exercises, chakra work and concentrative meditation. It was a theme prominent in Buddhism, Hinduism and Taoism. Buddhists, Hindus and Taoists all emphasized this one-pointed concentration as a ways of obtaining these powers. There were 9 levels of concentration for Buddhists, the 4th at which you obtained certain powers. Taoists did not really categorize levels as far as I know but they frequented elaborate descriptions of how the experience felt (in the meditation) and the Hindus I'm not sure but they named the powers siddhis, the name is only used by Hindus. Tibetan Buddhists were good at these powers too, I consider them almost supreme at these things. They stood naked in such high mountaintops in freezing temperatures, walked through walls etc. It is not uncommon for people to practice yogic exercises and samatha meditation simply for the purpose of these powers but religious and ascetic history is abound with tales of people who were afflicted by the use of these powers as a ways of showing off. Mainly because it was hard to show off and enjoy it without losing your concentration. Some people say that the siddhis or psychic powers had nothing to do with enlightenment, it is true. You could gain them simply by means of certain ancient exercises and etc. Many yogis and &quot;normal people&quot; possess them, in fact thousands, even people I know. Though they don't necessarily go flying around to show it off I've never heard of such a recorded case in which that happened in recent times. The idea that all the guilt of showing off might get to you while flying or teleporting and you might screw up. So there are enlightened people who do not possess these powers at all and have no knowledge of things psychic or of astral worlds etc. But still Buddhism, Taoism and Hinduism enjoined in saying (well I'm not sure of Hinduism) that when one became Enlightened he did have these certain powers. Powers such as not being trapped by life and death and leaving the body, travelling to different heavens etc. The idea and study of these powers has led to this confusing world of knowledge and a paradox that really confuses you. If you want to obtain these psychic powers/siddhis there are several people and groups on the net and books (I suppose) that will teach you into learning them. Another thing to remember is that the siddhis were definitely not limited in what each &quot;power&quot; was. Basically you could anything which involved physical manipulation (note: not just matter manipulation). There were powers which involved taming animals and making them friendly, and in the news of new creative powers there were powers which involved putting you into somewhat a slowmotion scene so you could dodge bullets etc there are also powers involving charging weapons and clothing to be more effective etc. Basically whatever you want.
