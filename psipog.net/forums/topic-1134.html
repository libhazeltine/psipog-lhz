			I was thinking, that it would be possible for a extremely experenced telapath to transfer knowlage from person to person (i got that from Lackey's Heralds of Valedmar). If the telapath was willing, s/he could teach other people (or her/hisself) how to do something from someone else. this might be able to be done without the telapath, with &quot;zipballs&quot; (psiball zip file)(random name)sent to the person wanting the knowlage.

			I think it all depends on what you think &quot;intelligence&quot; is. It's such a vague term, and the essence of intelligence varies from literally person to person.

			Well...anyone going to answer this question? Cause I'm with them...boy would I love to transfer some sports star's skills into my noodle and become a star myself.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />

<br />
But seriously if it is possible this could be the beginning of soooo much improvement and not just individually but as a whole....the whole human race's evolution could shift I believe. Just think....Transferring skills and balancing them....grand power.

			i think its possible but there are so many things that could go wrong, lets think how a computer transfers over a network.
<br />

<br />
it reads the information it wants to transfer
<br />
requests permision from the other computer
<br />
then sends the information to the other computer
<br />
and the other computer writes it.
<br />

<br />

<br />
first problem would be to issolate exactly what you want to send,
<br />
the second would be wether you want to send it to the other person or &quot;write&quot; it straight into their mind. obviously if u try to &quot;write&quot; you coulld screw them pretty bad if u &quot;misspell&quot; so to speak.

			..psirus?
<br />

<br />
and, it still all depends on how you define intelligence. for instance:
<br />

<br />
- does thought contain matter / is thought matter?
<br />

<br />
- is the soul/spirit/essence/etc the main source of thought, and if so can you affect someones core like that?

			okay now you've lost me as well.........
<br />

<br />
I don't think its possible to transfer anything like that.....for example if you want to transfer some skill its impossible because it invovled modifying the dna and the only thing you can modify is memories with telepathy or certain knowledge but you can't modify the rate of intelligence or the skill....maybe the confidence at it but nothing more I think.

			1-knolwage!!! not intellegence. knowlage is what somebody learns.
<br />

<br />
2-A forien language yes,  playing an instument no(look below)
<br />

<br />
3-i dont mean TAKE knowlage, and skill is also partly muscles knowing what to do. although if that star was a psion, then i would partly be possible.
<br />

<br />
4-yes,you would have to know what to send, ans this does sem alot like what computers do. I mean unles you are skilled at this, i would write it to a psiball and &quot;spellcheck&quot; it (misspell is spelled correctly you know). although if people used internet &quot;shortcuts&quot; to write it, that could also mess it up (nothing against you, i just never saw the point in useing shotcuts when you have all the time in the world to write it)
<br />

<br />
5-The psirus(i like the name) would not work. I myself keep up a telapathy shield 24/7, so you would have to break the sheild to get in (after you go though my other shields), and why would you be saying that? if you wanted to, you would just stay under our &quot;psidar&quot; untill you have the knowlage to strike.
<br />

<br />
6-where have i said intellegence? intellegence is what the air force(army, marines, coast gard, navy) uses to plan missions.(kidding, partly) thought is electrical impulses. no matter is involved. And im not talking about infuenceing someones thought, i and just saying have your brain copy memories from another.
<br />

<br />
7-Have you ever played shapes and colors? (you know, where you try to make someone know what shape and/or color you are thinking up[using telapathy]) it is the same thind pretty much, only you are sending knowlage instead of a shape and/or a color.
<br />

<br />
My comments on your posts, numerical order ( sonkiova's is #1, and on from there)
<br />

<br />
 -Lancefighter
<br />

<br />
P.S. where do you get all these weird ideas? taking skill from a star, grand power though transfer of knowlage? where??
<br />

<br />
Edit- nobody has said no to the poll yet-that is good.

			Well since nobody seems to know how to do it, and the only person who knows for sure that it can be done is rainsong, you're all doomed. It's probably extremely advanced. If you want to learn, continue with your telepathy training, and when you are advanced enough to do it, you will do it. It's that simple.

I doubt that....I think it can only be done by what they call &quot;biokinesis&quot; or something like that. You can't change the way you were born by contact with another person.
