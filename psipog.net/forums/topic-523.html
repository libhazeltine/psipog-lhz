			Hello everyone. This is about card exercises. I didn't create this exercise this is just my own in-depth version of my experiences and my tips about it. I think I'll be posting this in my blog the moment I finish writing this article.You can do many things with it such as practicing pk, precog, communicating with subconscious and some other things. The exercises and techniques I'll be talking about is similar to Peebrain's psipog micro pk article here:
<br />

<br />
<a href="../art-introduction-to-tk.html" target="_blank">art-introduction-to-tk.html</a> 
<br />
props to Peebrain for making a fantastic article
<br />

<br />
-and also similar to gotpsi's card games here:
<br />

<br />
gotpsi.com
<br />

<br />
I suggest you read Peebrain's article before reading any further. I also strongly suggest you to play the gotpsi card games to get to the correct mindset when doing the exercise. I will be telling you guys about my techniques and then some. This is all experience so don't get mad at me if you can't do it. But then again its better than nothing heh?
<br />

<br />
All right. Here's the lingo you need to learn. 
<br />

<br />
Deck = A pack of 52 cards
<br />
Shuffle = mixing the cards
<br />
take-out pile = #/pile of cards you take out of the deck
<br />

<br />
--------------
<br />

<br />
Part I: Instruction
<br />

<br />
First I will explain to you what the card exercise is. I'll be talking about only one and that's the one on Peebrain's microTK article. But more in-depth.
<br />

<br />
Step 1-You shuffle the cards, then as you are shuffling you think about your target card (The target card will be in effect throughout the whole exercise.)
<br />
Step 2-You take out a number of cards from the deck- making sure the target card is not there.
<br />
-After taking out the number of cards you wanted, you shuffle the deck again and repeat Step 1 (without thinking of a different target card) then Step 2 until you only have one card left. That one card must be your target card in order to successfully complete the card exercise.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Part II: Probability
<br />

<br />
The second thing I will tell you is this: There will always be probability in cards. It's almost used in any kind of card game there is. My point is there is a chance that when you are just starting out, your subconscious will be thinking of the probabilities and chances throughout the whole exercise. I believe the subconscious is always thinking about this whenever one is playing cards the conscious mind just doesn't know it. You can ignore this whole section if you want.
<br />

<br />
So I am going to give alitle bit info on probability. Why? You may answer that it is best if you do not know about it at all since you are not going to be working with it in this exercise. So to answer your question, I am trying to make you know about it consciously, that way you can eliminate any thoughts about it throughout the exercise.
<br />

<br />
How many cards are there in a deck? There's 52 cards. 
<br />

<br />
1 Target card out of 52 cards. What are the chances? 1 out of 52.
<br />
For example, lets say your target card is the SIX OF DIAMONDS, there's only 1 six of diamonds out of 52 cards so its 1/52.
<br />

<br />
Get it? Easy? Next one...
<br />

<br />
On Part I Step 2- you take out a number of cards from the deck. Lets say... for starters you pick 5 cards, What are the chances that your card will be there?
<br />
We are not thinking about one card here. We are thinking about five cards... Five cards with different suites, faces, and numbers. First off all, we are not rolling a die here, so the chances that the card will be in the take-out pile is not 1 out of 5. It is not 5 out of 5 either. There are many things to consider since we are working with 2 different probability sets. 52-5=47. That's 1/47 cards to go to 1/5 cards. The problem here is you have to consider every single possibilities and outcomes of the draw. Now the probability that the target card will not be on the first of five draws is 51/52, second draw 50/51, third draw 49/50, fourth draw 48/49, fifth draw 47/48. That's 47 out of 52 cards your target card will not be in the take-out pile! Sounds easy huh? Well when you are going to use microPK probability means nothing anymore so you won't be needing any of that stuff I just said. 
<br />

<br />
Now you may want to know the probability of the ones in the higher levels... But its not really necessary since you won't be needing it once you get there <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I mentioned all of that to kick your mind to start thinking about this stuff as you read over the next parts. You'll notice that you won't be relying on probability at all. 
<br />

<br />
Part III:
<br />

<br />
Here's the part you are expecting. 
<br />

<br />
I'll be guiding you step by step on this one for the guys who have no idea whats going on. No offense to you guys just trying to help. If you already know the steps of the exercise just skil this part.
<br />

<br />
Shuffle the deck and think of your target card. Keep thinking about it as you shuffle and make sure you don't forget about it.
<br />
Take out 5 cards. 
<br />

<br />
If you see your card start over. If you don't then keep going. 
<br />

<br />
Part IV:
<br />

<br />
There's a trick my friend and I   developed on practicing 2 skills at once with this card exercise. When you deal the take-out pile, deal it face down so you can't see it. Why? I'll get to that later.
<br />
When you make a mistake and have to start over, think about how you were feeling when you were shuffling the cards and dealing them out. If your card was in the take-out pile then its probably because you were thinking in the opposite way. There is a possibility that instead of trying to keep your card in the bottom you kept it on top instead. There is also a possibility that you are not doing it at all. Although at first it'll seem like you are not doing it. 
<br />

<br />
You will notice when you actually start doing it when you play with 5-card take-out pile rule and you get to the last 10 cards. When you do get there, increase the number for the take-out pile. Why not finish the game? You can't finish the game that way. I think its like cheating. If you really want to finish the game you'd have to have only 2 sets of take-out piles throughout the whole game, 3 at the most.
<br />

<br />
Now when increasing the number of cards. If you are just starting out increase by 1 or 2. I know what some of you are thinking. That's alittle bit too low and you'd rather have it at 15-20. So why 8? Start slow. Your subconscious will be thinking differently and have to change its thinking style when you increase the cards from 5 to 20 (your subconscious is also at work here you know) . Increasing it from 5 to 10 is already A HUGE STEP. I did from 5 to 8 and worked my way up by 3 cards.
<br />

<br />
Remember why I said its optional that you keep the cards dealt face down? If you ignore the cards being dealt face down and keep on going. I think you are practicing your psychic sense of feel. When you start feeling alittle bit different take the face down cards and look for your card there. If it was there then your prediction was right. If its not start over.
<br />

<br />
When I did this exercise I get frustrated because the target card always surprises me when its drawn. I kept doing the exercise and for some reason I kind of already know that the card is going to be in the take-out pile. I think this will happen to you too but I am not sure though.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Part V:
<br />

<br />
If you get the urge to look at the bottom card, do so. Also if you've been practicing enough, add this to your exercise as well. Try to think of a different card and predict when it will be in the bottom. Sometimes when I am in the middle of my game and I discover my card in a take-out pile, I look at the bottom card of the deck... and sometimes... almost sometimes... the card I predicted was there.
<br />

<br />
--------------------
<br />

<br />
Remember you are trying to do a card exercises that utilizes many skills (micro pk, subconscious, intuition, precog... I don't remember the rest). All of those skills you can learn from the card exercise but I'll say it now that it is very hard when starting out. I mean starting out is easy... Most likely you'll get to the half of the deck and then discover your card in the take-out pile. That's why its frustrating. What I am trying to say is the learning curve is easy but its all trial and error. When you are working with your skills you'll be relying alot on your concentration and your  'gut feelings' ALOT. When you do the exercise you'll notice that you'll be more aware of your gut feelings and soem otehr stuff I can't really explain in words.
<br />

<br />
Even if you don't understand it and is confused... don't worry. Just get a deck of cards and start playing! You don't even have to memorize this article to do it since this is just my own experience.
<br />

<br />
--------------------
<br />

<br />
I know its a long post and all... But if I only posted a paragraph I think I would just confuse you guys. The main idea of this post is not a how-to but some things i've found out while practicing this. I've only reached up to 20-card take-out pile and most of the time I get screwed before I reach the last 10 cards. I rarely successfully finish the exercise. I remember finishing it once or twice so I am not that great at all. I'd appreciate any kind of feedback on what you guys think. Thanks!
<br />

PS: I've been using the word 'you' alot for some reason. I don't know why but pardon my english. I really mean to be polite on my sentences and all but I am sorry if anybody finds it annoying. Nothing personal.
