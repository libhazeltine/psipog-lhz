			Peebs has moved on. All of the oldest members have left.  And for a while, I stuck it out.
<br />

<br />
But now is my time to close the PsiPog chapter in my own life.
<br />

<br />
I have been here since the very beginning, before PsiPog was even PsiPog.  PsiBall Station was my first experience with peebrain's work.
<br />

<br />
There has been a lot of history here.  Some good, and some bad.  I learned all my basics here, and I am eternally grateful to ALL the authors who contributed to this project.  Sean has put a lot of work into this place, and his work will continue to influence people after PsiPog's community is shut down.   I remember theh bad, too.  Fights with Psion Guild and  Veritas, goings on with Myriad and such.  But it was all part of the experience.
<br />

<br />
The community has been a big part of my life, espesially 3+ years ago.  Everyone was like a second family to me, that's how tight knit the community used to be here.  In recent years, the community has grown apart, and the oldest of the old members began to disappear.  It saddened me a great deal.
<br />

<br />
Now, the final &quot;oldies&quot; are leaving.  I am probably one of the last to go.  I will keep in contact with some people, but PsiPog is done guys, at least for me.  It is time for me to sail on from here, and do what I need to do with my own site.
<br />

<br />
Peebrain, if you still read here, I want you to know, I consider you a good friend of mine. You showed me how to be a good webmaster, how to write a proper article, and how not to be such an asshole in the chats.  Thank you for showing me another aspect of myself that I would not have found as easily without your work.
<br />

<br />
This is for you &quot;oldies&quot;.  You know who you are.  I've feel blessed to have met such wonderful men and women here.  You guys made this place what it is, YOU made it famous.  I hope I see some of you at my place or just around online.
<br />

<br />
For anyone who is left, I urge you to carefully read the articles here.  Get what you can from the Q&amp;A and the forums here, there is SO MUCH STUFF!  And when you're ready and you feel full, come join and contribute to a living community.  We will be waiting for you all.
<br />

<br />
It actually hurts me to leave here, that's how much PsiPog has been to me. Its been an everyday thing, and I'm going to miss it deeply. I am glad to have been a moderator here.  To watch this place grow from a few dozen, to a few thousand members. 
<br />

<br />
It's been a hell of a ride.
<br />

<br />

			Goodbye Stony. 
<br />
Your words carry my feeling towards Psipog as well. 
<br />

<br />
Why is it so sad? Why is it so hard to move on? 
<br />
Ehh, I don't even want to think of those answers. 
<br />

<br />
See yah around man.

			I couldn't agree more, stony. I remember when I could have fantastic conversations every night with the old Pog crowd. It was great how close everyone used to be. But everyone is moving on, and though it's sad, everyone is moving on because they're ready too. I'll probably see you on the Guild every now and then, but best of luck to you!
