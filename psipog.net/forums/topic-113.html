			Energy flows where attention goes. The truth is that you get what you work for. You set your goals, you invest some effort into it and you finally succeed.
<br />

<br />
What are my goals when it comes to telekinesis?
<br />

<br />
To be honest I?ve been working towards being able to move bigger objects. And I made other people do the same. And as I stated in a previous post, this policy has led a lot of people into frustration. I recognize now that it was a wrong path to take. This approach never gave me a better understanding of telekinesis.
<br />

<br />
So shall you work for control instead? Maybe. My exerience though is that people who stayed with the psiwheel until achieving a better control finally couldn?t even try to move anything else. Their subconscious was so fixed on the wheel that in their deepest self they created an idea that ?only psiwheel telekinesis is possible?. Such a person would try to move a pencil, get frustrated after 5 minutes and stop. The reason is that once you know that you are ?so good? with the wheel, you?ll get quickly pretty frustrated if something else doesn?t work.
<br />
These people never got further.
<br />

<br />
So what is the answer to the telekinesis dilemma? Power or control?
<br />

<br />
Hmmm?
<br />

<br />
Neither.
<br />

<br />
It took me some time to realize that telekinesis is just the tip of a huge iceberg. The truth goes so deep into your own self that you can?t really apply such rediculous terms like ?power? or ?control? to its complex mechanism.
<br />

<br />
What you should do during your telekinesis practice is free yourself completely from your conscious mind. Let all objectives, thoughts, desires, everything disappear. Power or control? It doesn?t matter. Everything will come with time. Power and control are very superficial aspects and if you focus on them you get superficial results. So get them out of your mind when you are into it. Let yourself submerge into the depths of telekinesis. Don?t worry about not being able to move bigger objects or not being in total control. There shall be no hurry.
<br />

<br />
Let yourself discover telekinesis in its purest form. Get all the superficial conscious things out of your mind and ?just do it?. When I start to do telekinesis I use to get into a mood where I don't feel like a person but a power of nature... like for example ?the wind?. The wind has got no thoughts, no conscious or subconscious mind, no emotions, no objectives, no desires, no physical form. It just does its thing, it?s forever, it?s everywhere. Free yourself. Free yourself and you?ll experience telekinesis in a more deep and beneficial way. The key is to be free. Free of everything. Let your mind enter a state of complete void.
<br />

<br />
You?ll see benefits of this aproach quickly (maybe I shouldn't say this hehe). First of all this objective, non-judgmental approach to telekinesis will help you to open yourself to it like you never did. It?s hard to explain in words, but you will understand it better. And with a better understanding you?ll be able to do telekinesis on a larger and more controled scale.
<br />

<br />
Power or control? Neither.
<br />
Work for a better understanding.
<br />

			what about both?
<br />

<br />
why can't you aim for bigger objects yet, practice on objects you know you can move to get better at control?
<br />

<br />
that is what I do, when I am school, I try to move big objects, trash cans, desks, papers, and drinks on people desks.
<br />

<br />
as at home I practice with a paper ball, toothpick, and peice of a led pencil to practice control.

			Great post. Approach/mindset is, beyond a doubt, very important when it comes to PK.. So if everyone adopted the approach from the more experienced psions, we would all see greater progress.

			Very good post. Now I know how to do my TK better (forcing the psiwheel to move is HARD for me). Freeing yourself sounds like a good strategy, similar to grounding in my opinion (of course, I am just a novice <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> ) Thank you!

			NI, I find I enter that state (well, at a less developed level anyway), but when I hit the right wavelength (the point where it starts to move spontanously and freely), I quite often switch mindsets and start forcing it to move, will it, direct it, etc - ultimately I am no longer in that objective frame of mind (but it still responds). The whole aim of which is to develop the control / strength.
<br />

<br />
Do you keep that objective, empty, silent, &quot;I'm having no part to play&quot;, &quot;no interfering&quot;, &quot;allowing&quot;, &quot;letting it happen&quot;, &quot;free&quot; mindset throughout the wholetime when the object is moving? If so, do you find that the control just starts to come of itself, without conscious effort, or do you switch into a more of a &quot;directing&quot; and controling mindset in order to develop the control?
<br />

<br />
The problem I have is that I have experienced so many different sensations, perpectives, mindsets, etc where it actually worked that I don't know, in order to develop control / strength, whether I am meant to consciously move it or whether the control comes on its own - automatically by &quot;playing&quot; with it. I guess if it comes on its own, then its development would just start to appear over time, much like when something just &quot;clicks&quot; and they can all of a sudden just do it. I do the latter mostly (and would prefer it), but I get a little insecure about whether it's actually productive at achieving my aim and so I focus on developing the control and strength purposefully (with mixed, frustrating results).
<br />

<br />
The best sensation I have experienced when moving it is in that mindset you described, where it just moves perfectly in sync - like its apart of me. But I feel I just wont learn how to &quot;control&quot; it or develop any strength by doing it that way. Doing the method you described above, have you noticed the control developing automatically? Your post suggests an answer but I am after some clarification / confirmation on this issue in particular, if possible.
<br />

I've been doing rolling on a can these last 2 weeks... and I'm using the &quot;Free mind&quot; mindframe. And I can say that it really helps you develope telekinesis as in control and power. 
<br />

<br />
So just clear your mind... and as said allot of times, your subconscious mind knows what you want to do. And imo I think that's the way telekinesis works... with frequency tapping. 
<br />

<br />
Oh and btw... remember, power is nothing without control, and control is nothing without power.

			Wattigi, very nice post.
<br />

<br />
I understand what you are saying. It's easy to lose the focus once the object starts moving, just because of that simple fact that you want the object to go <span style="font-weight: bold">where you want it to go</span>. You want to control it. 
<br />
Now think for a moment what &quot;control&quot; means. It means you actaully <span style="font-weight: bold">tell</span> the object <span style="font-weight: bold">how</span> to move, you try <span style="font-weight: bold">to influence, to force it's movement</span>.
<br />

<br />
Now, you start forcing the object, and you lose your &quot;right&quot; focus.
<br />

<br />
What you have got to understand in telekinetic control that it doesn't come by actively &quot;controlling&quot; the object. It's <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> the same like driving your car: you want to go left so you use your hands to move your steering wheel in order to make the car go left. Telekinetic control is <span style="font-weight: bold">results focused</span>. <span style="font-weight: bold">YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CONTROL ANYTHING IN TELEKINESIS IF YOU FOCUS ON THE &quot;HOW&quot; YOU CONTROL IT.</span>
<br />

<br />
When you want your object to go left, you set your goal into your mind and <span style="font-weight: bold">let go.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">LET GO</span></span>. The result is important, not the how. It's not your conscious mind after all who controls the object. It's your subconscious mind. If you try to control the object with your conscious mind a whole lot of nothing will happen. Instead you have to set your goal into your mind and let your subconscious take control. That is done pretty easily if you are into that mindstate we described above. Just let go.
<br />

<br />
Come on, people, that's the beauty about it! That's why we call it &quot;just do it&quot; method, because we don't really know the &quot;how&quot; (notice the word &quot;just&quot;?). And we don't know the &quot;how&quot;, because we do tk subconsciously, not consciously. So why in hell do you try to move/control your object with your conscious mind?!?
<br />

<br />
Chill the **** out and let it go. Let it go goddamit! <span style="font-weight: bold">Set your goal, clear you conscious mind completely and stay in that void, then <span style="text-decoration: underline">let</span> it happen. LET IT HAPPEN.</span>
<br />

<br />
Keep your mind clear and focused or you'll never progress any further. That't the biggest mistake and a problem 95% of people out there have when it comes to their telekinetic progress. 
<br />

<br />
Example: You can move your psiwheel. Cool. Now with practice you don't need that initial focus anymore, becuase your subconscious is used to this movement already and can perform it without your conscious mind's permission. Result: you lose your focus ability and basically start all over again from nothing when you try to move pencils. Now you can move your wheel with no focus at all, but can't move a pencil with that kind of focus. Sure. You get frustrated, you wonder what the hell is the problem, you give up, end of the story. The mistake you made is that yout mind &quot;got lazy&quot; once you've started to have better result with the wheel. 
<br />

<br />
Solution? You shall train your focus and keep a state of complete void each time you do tk. No matter how easy something is or how good you already are at it.
<br />

<br />
Again, <span style="font-weight: bold">SET THE GOAL, CLEAR YOUR MIND, LET IT HAPPEN.</span>
<br />

<br />
Hope that helped.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
