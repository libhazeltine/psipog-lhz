			hey all, so my question about empathy is this.you know there are those times when you are sat around or doing whatever feeling fine and then you become annoyed or upset about nothing, nothing you can think of anyway.well could this be empathy but on a subconcious level so u dnt no that you are pickin up others emotions?i ask this because so far today it has been really bad, i have just recently started practicing in the art of empathy as i think it is very useful!well earlier i was just sat at my computer fine and all of a sudden i felt really depressed and really bad, just a minute ago i was nearly about to cry i felt that bad.surely this cant just randomly happen it must be coming form somewhere?have any of you had this happen?is it an empathic overload? well i leave you to discuss. thank you

			its almost like people send emotions and are unaware..an example being, a friend of mine was feeling horribly sad because a friend of his was having bad emotional problems. I would sit at my compute and feel instantly sick. I put up a few shield(I'm not the best at shields) and the feeling broke through them after a while...when I learned about how he was feeling I knew what was doing it, informed him, he apologized but of course I couldnt hold anything against him......I would talk to some people over IM on your buddy list(if you have one) or talk to your friends about how they're feeling....unless you were linked to me since I felt the same way about 1/2 - 1 hour ago <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			yep I've had a extremely bad overlode before it was back when I was little.
<br />

<br />
Being a naturally born empath I never learned how to shield other emotions
<br />

<br />
the day of the overlode was 
<br />

<br />
9/11/05
<br />

<br />
it was the day we where told it was safe to go back to school after the 9/11 attacks. the consuler came in a started talking to us about what had happened. Then a girl spoke up telling about what a repporter had said about people jumping out of windows. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />  I tried to close everything out and began to meditate. I know now what happended was the extreme emotion from my classmate brought forth a tiny bit of telepathy. The only thing my telepathy good do is widen the range of my empathy. I began getting emotions of terror, depression, and confusion from the entire school. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />  I felt awful and started thinking of ways to commit sucicide. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />  The last emotion I felt was that the counsler was more depressed than all the kids.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> My head felt like it was going to explode I saw darkness creeping from the courners of my eyes. And I colasped <img src="images/smiles/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" border="0" />

			Before knowing how to use psi, or shields; I went through a long depression.  Without knowing, i think i was sending off some broadcast that i was super depressed.. got a bit more attention than usual, but even more so everytime i saw someone, they were sad too.  I almost got one of my friends to break up with her boyfriend..
<br />
I think it all depends how strong the signal is, and how others interpret it.  The signal would probably come from someone else secretly uber depressed.

			I'm sorry, but I dont think thats the awnser, I read people I didn't even know. For I know it would be a awkward coincedence for at least 15 kids to be worrying about a single parent and if they got out alive. Yeah you could say that they all might be friends and they care about what their friends do. But from what I felt I don't think one parent had 15 kids

			I also experience some other things in empathy. I have leared to set up a shield. But I have gotten I knew skill. It is really weird. I'll look at something with not much detail (exspecially clouds) and I see a picture of an eye built into the image I'm seeing.  It gives me a basis on how the person was feeling. But what I'm really intriged by is that sometimes the eye is looking right at me. I think this mean I picking up another empath or a sensitive. Just a few seconds ago I looked at the screen and saw the eyes of what I percived to be a caucaison, girl, who looked like she was a high schooler or just started college and had to be an empath <img src="images/smiles/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" border="0" />   <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			<img src="images/smiles/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" border="0" /> Wait I think I might have been a telepath all along and as a telepath I could read the minds of others (only there feelings). Maybe all those who are an empath are really telepathic but not the other way around

			I was born as an empath, so my entire life i've been able to sence other peoples feelings and even i have had a few overloads. The first time was when i was 5 years old, when i moved from south-africa to the netherlands. The negativity i felt all around me was that bad that it made me extremely depressed, untill i kinda lost it and tried to top my self for a period of 10 years. offcourse it all failed otherwise i would not be talking here. after that i learned to control it a bit. the second or third  time was when i was 20 i think, my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend at that time and the emotions that where involved along with it from all parties, caused an overload that bad, that my heart nearly failed on me. 
<br />

<br />
So could you be an empath? perhaps it is possible, but most of the time you either are or you are not, meaning your born with it or not. its most likely that you are just sensitive to negativity and positivity from around you.
