Well I thought of something while i was working on psiballs, What if I could programm a Psiball to collect energy from everything else but me all day and night. You could send it to your stomach and when you do your normal Psi practice you just collect from that! No more collecting from a source like the sun, moon,ETC ( Lol this is starting to sound like im selling something) 
<br />

<br />
To do this you must know how to: 
<br />
make a basic Psiball 
<br />
Programm 
<br />
Shell 
<br />

<br />

<br />
1st: Make a basic psiball,weak, strong, it doesn't matter. 
<br />

<br />
2nd:Programm it to collect energy from every thing but you(Or anything/someone you want) And to give a flow of energy to you when you touch it 
<br />

<br />
3rd: Shell it! 
<br />

<br />
4th: Send it to where ever you want(I choose my stomach) 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Well its pretty simple, but i didn't know if any one thought of this yet. 
<br />

<br />
And another thing. If you had it in your stomach, Be sure to take it out before you go to sleep or you wont get to sleep easliy. 
<br />

<br />
I forgot about it and I was up at 1:00Am thinking &quot;Why do i feel like its 12:00PM?&quot; Then i remembered and i took it out and i fell instantly to sleep. 
<br />

<br />

Slap yourself on the wrist, if you want a storage construct, especially something that you're talking about its going to have to be more than a basic psiball, weak or strong it DOES matter.

Dude give yourself one big slap please,
<br />

<br />
1) You are likely to leech energy from people and living creatures.
<br />

<br />
2) The energy that the construct will collect will not just be psi. Itll draw other types of external energies that may not be compatible with psi.
<br />

<br />
3) Why the fuck would you want to store the construct in your stomach?! it defies logic <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> It is not like if you put it there itll stay there like a nice psiball...itll still disperse, also you are likely to interfere with whatever process is going on in your stomach, it would be seriously uncomfortable, yet that isnt the worst part...The fact that you are taking external energies into your system like that..without even depatternizing the energy. You are just begging for trouble. 
<br />

<br />
furthermore: 
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">No more collecting from a source like the sun, moon,ETC ( Lol this is starting to sound like im selling something) </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
You do not actually gather energies from the sun or the moon or anything of the sort, You produce the energy yourself the theory is that psi is a byproduct of your nervous system. You either generate it from yourself or you collect ambient psi energy.
<br />

<br />
baaad noobie baad,  you are advocating potentially dangerous and faulty techniques. What beats me is someone says something ludicrous and you have other people with the equivalent IQ of a bean praising it!

			yes it will get stronger i think litewiz should slap his self or let me do it for him. He needs to go look at some basic information about psionics before he starts critasizing other peoples work. <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />

Not meaning to cause a flame war here, But I'm pretty sure Litewiz knows &quot;some basic information about psionics&quot;. Maybe I should learn some basic english before I start &quot;critasizing&quot; your spelling, Yah?

Leeching is bad kiddies, If some random construct started leeching from me, I'd have a &quot;word&quot; with the owner.
