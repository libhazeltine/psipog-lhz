<br />
So I OBE'd!  I didn't realize it until mikev explained to me that I wasn't aware of my astral body.
<br />

<br />
What happened was while doing the Intro to Focus 12 (which i had done many times before), my consciousness started floating away from me.  Basically, right after I got into Focus 10 (mind awake/body asleep) my consciousness floated away, right above me about 7 feet or so.  This floating consciousness lasted through the countup to Focus 12 (mind expansion) and then ended during the first countdown to Focus 10.  It was neat, to say the least.  Monroes voice (the guy doing the narrating) was distant, but I could still hear him.  it was very odd.  
<br />

<br />
Thought I'd share!

			Now grant you, the session I was on was not for OBE's.  It was for mind expansion/awakening.  Yet, because of how much practice I had put it, right when my body was asleep *poof* i was out.  Also, don't forget your affirmations!!  I had been singing at work to the beat of some madonna song that came on &quot;I'm gonna OBE! I'm gonna exit my bodeeee!&quot; lol, it sounds stupid, yet, that night I obe'd.  Do it all day long, everyday, in the back of your head, out loud, whatever you can do helps you along.  
<br />

<br />
But of course, you would have known all this if you were still frequenting mpw13 <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  Post in this topic your progress with TGE!  And what you think about the exercises and different states of mind...

			Practice Practice Practice is the best solution anyone can give you...
<br />

<br />
Or!  You could become passive about it.  I.E. acknowledge it the itch, but instead of thinking of it as something that will bring you out of trance, make it throw you deeper into your trance...
<br />

<br />
Hopefully you have luck ...

			Thx for the answer.The thing is i enter in trance without the tape before.I done that many times.I like more with tapes because the natural sounds are extraordinary.I gone to beach and stay for hours there to listen the nature.Unfortunetly is not so quiet.I need to go to mountain or anywhere where ppl don't go too much.I need quiet and lying down in the middle of the nature...Tape is like nature at home.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> ..anyway is great.Usually in my house only during night is quiet and during day is hard to enter in trance.I am staying in a big city and intersection...

			YES! i finally have it!
<br />
I'm going to listen to it tonight. and i've been reminding myself all day that i can leave my body.
<br />
YAY!
<br />

<br />
EDIT:
<br />
WOW! i've only done the exercises up to Discovery 3, but it's great to be able to get to focus 10 so easily, usually, my mind's all over the place, but the tones realy help with that. i'll write more when it happens <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
