			Wish granted. Aura Vision and Precognition are two of your very best skills. But you have very little control because of your lack of practice. Constant Aura Vision makes you see entire astral entities that arent there, making people thing that you are crazy, putting you in one of those places... &quot;Insane Asylum&quot; i believe it is called <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. Precognition gets to you and you know everything about the future. However, this includes the end of the universe, and the precognition is so realistic that your body is ripped to shreds by your telekinetic powers, splitting your atoms apart. Nice going einstien. You invented Human-Powered Nuclear Fission, with yourself as the first Human.

I wish that i have awesome regenerative capabilities, able to fully regenerate in under one second. Like if someone chops off my head, oh well, i'll just grow a new one. Oh then i have a severed head on the ground! i'll just grow a new body for that.

			wish granted you are so powerful that your government starts to get worried about national security so they invite you in for some tests.  Soon things start to turn ugly for you and you escape the sterile cell they keep you in that's hidden two miles underground.  Very worried now the government finds you again, drugs you, drags you back to your cell and takes out your brain and puts in a jar.  You become missing person #5418998419.

			wish granted.  unfortunantly the buried treasure was located in fort knox, and knowing the government, they claimed it was their gold, and that you're a terroist.  now you spend you're entire life behind bars, and in front of a big guy named bubba.
