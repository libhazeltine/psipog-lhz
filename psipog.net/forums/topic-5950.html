			To give a little background info about myself and OBEing:
<br />
- When I first came to the forum I tried to OBE about three times in four months. It wasn't the best practice schedule but it still discouraged me from continuing to practice OBEing so I stopped and decided to concentrate on telepathy.
<br />

<br />

<br />
So now that I've provided a bit of background information, you can get a better glimpse into my point of view about OBEing and make better sense of my latest experience (which happened last night....or rather this morning.) 
<br />

<br />
Last night, as I was trying to fall asleep I began to feel these strange physical sensations. I am not a stranger to these weird sensations and I always thought them to be a heightened sense of blood pressure in the body. I never really paid too much attention to the feelings, but this morning the word VIBRATIONS popped into my head and I made the connection; I was experiencing the vibrations people describe before they OBE. This excited me because for the first time it seemed truly possible for me to experience an OBE. (I realized why I never made the connection before; the sensation always felt more like a pulsation rather than a vibration, but whatever you want to call it is fine with me, they both point to the same thing.)
<br />

<br />
Now that I have made the connection I decided to look into OBE's a little deeper. I tried to recall ANY information I remember learning about lucid dreams and tried to make certain connections. One piece of information that caught my attention was the term REM Motor Atonia (a term I learned randomly in Zoo class. You can find a more thorough definition at <a href="http://www.sleepnet.com" target="_blank">www.sleepnet.com</a> and search their search engine.) REM Motor Atonia is when your body disconnects your motor neurons to your consciousness keeping you from acting out your dreams. (On a side note if you're wondering about sleepwalking and it's connection to REM Motor Atonia, sleepwalking ONLY occurs during while you're in a deep Non-REM sleep. If you would like to know more about sleep cycles, go to the National Sleeping Foundation; <a href="http://www.sleepfoundation.org." target="_blank">www.sleepfoundation.org.</a>) 
<br />

<br />
So lucid dreaming is where you are consciousness during REM sleep ---&gt; the cycle where your dreams occur in. During the REM cycle breathing becomes irregular and shallow; eyes move in various directions; if conscious, one will experience temporary paralysis due to REM Motor Atonia. 
<br />

<br />
With these connections, one doesn't necessarily have to put the body to sleep in the way in which it is explained in the articles on the main site. Instead just try to induce REM sleep by causing REM Motor Atonia to occur on command. This would of course require some skill in DMILS, but you can develop your skill with practice. If you don't know what DMILS is you can find out more by clicking this google link: 
<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=DMILS+&amp;btnG=Search." target="_blank">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=DMILS+&amp;btnG=Search.</a>
<br />
I truly believe that the subconscious knows exactly how to acquire and use psionic skills but I do also firmly believe that you can acquire these skills quicker if you understand what is going on at a conscious level. 
<br />
So hopefully these connections will help you improve your skill quicker and understand what is happening better. If you think my thought process and connections are faulty, just say so and we'll talk about it. Other than that I want to know if this helps people understand OBEing better, because I know for sure it has helped me.
<br />

<br />
I know this isn't really a technique, but this can definitely lead the way in developing newer techniques so I that's why I just decided to place it here.

			i said it wasnt really a technique. just more of an explanation of what might actually be going on with OBE's, or at least that's what i meant.
