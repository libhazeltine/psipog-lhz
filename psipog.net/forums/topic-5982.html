			Eventually I must turn 18 and I was wondering what do I do? I have no help from my parents and they are going to kick me out almost immediatly. I was just wondering what some of you guys did so I can get some real life advice for what I should do.

(I'm 15 right now, but still, it will happen  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />)

I think he wants to know how a person who gets kicked out with a low-paying job (if he gets one by then <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />) makes enough/saves enough money to survive in an apartment or something (while going to college). As for me, I've only got to the end of the year to think up something! I only get $6 an hour and I worry about school so I only work 3 days a week, but I'm hoping to get a job that pays a STARTING salary of $7.25 an hour. I've got a friend who works at the place I want to go to. So I've basically got the job <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />. Any suggestions for finding a place to live anyone? As SFG's older brother I could also use some advice <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />.

			The reason I made this is because I get bothered about my future almost every day by my mom's boyfriend and he always talks about kicking me out. Generally, I have absolutely no thoughts on future, but when it is thrown at me all of the time I just needed something.

			Once your parents kick you out, go out onto their front lawn and sit there in a lawn chair with a sign that says, &quot;$5 psychic readings&quot;. If you're good at telepathy, like I will be when I'm 18, then you can make $100+ a day if you're in a fairly big city. Just tell ppl their names and crap. 
<br />

<br />
That's if you really are lazy and good at telepathy. If you want serious advice, then I don't know why I'm posting, but here's my best: start mowing lawns and saving up a lot of money right now. I have a brand new computer, $138 in my closet, and somewhere around $600 in my savings account after mowing a lawn each summer for only two summers. That's right, only 1 mowing job a summer. I only put in an hour or so a week and came out with $1000+ worth of cash and computer. If I do that for the next four summers and get 2 jobs instead of 1, then when I'm 18, I'll have a fair amount of money to get me going. Not enough that I won't get a job of some sort, but enough to tide me over when I can't pay the bills and eat at the same time.
<br />

GreatWhiteNinja, I dunno what you're going to do. I'd say you're pretty much screwed.

			My sure fire advice.....start saving. Your going to want money and you don't want to be wasting it on stuff now at your age. There's a lot of stuff I wish I didn't buy so I'd have more money now. BUT, the other comments are good advice when they tell you to have fun. Your going to remember your days now as some of the best in your life (whether you realize it now or not) but don't be irresponsible. You don't want to get kicked out at 18 with no job or money, there's not too much options for you after that. I'd say get an easy part-time job, work a little bit a week and just save that money up and enjoy yourself.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

It sounds like you're really stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'd say 15 is waaay too early to be worrying this much about this kind of stuff. My dad has gotten 3 paycuts, and one was a 33% paycut, so I'm starting to gain insight on what it means to not be so well off as I used to be. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

One thing that's always interested me is using the internet for financial gain. I mean, most of the world is connected to it, and it's incredibly easy to earn loads if you have the right tools and some perseverance. Since you're a teenager and have lots of time on your hands(maybe), then you could learn some coding, make a fairly decent mmo, and get tons of paying players. It doesn't take much to make a great game, just a bit more creativity than most and some luck. There's also many more ways of earning money over the internet, does arizona have lots of tumbleweeds? We have a few out here in kansas. People will pay $50+ on ebay for one for decorations or whatnot.
<br />

<br />
    Anyway, you're a psion and strange and magical things happen to us, lol. Just keep working with psi and charging with energy. If Celestine prophecy has an ounce of truth to it, (I think it does) then it will help you. If you can't use telepathy or other skill to make a job opening for yourself, then just do what martial artist said and go with your heart. Just play it by ear and do what sounds right.

			Like plenty of others have said, don't worry about it yet.  I started worrying about my future in third grade...needless to say, it ruined my childhood.  By the time you are 18, you will be a different person, and you will know what you want to do by then.  Besides, your life may change completely by then, you never know.  I'm 18, in college...my dad always said I had to move out when I turned 18, but he ran off to Florida, and now I'm living at home with my mom, and will be probably until next year.   I have held different jobs (about 8 ) since I was 14, and have developed a good sense of &quot;financial smarts.&quot;  I know how to save, and the whole scha-bang, so that's an advantage.  I suggest you learn how to as well.
<br />

<br />
Also, try checking out the book called &quot;Nickel and Dimed.&quot;  It's about [not] getting by on minimum wage here in America, and is very informative and interesting.  It also may show you what to do, and what not to do.
<br />

<br />
Bottom line:  Don't worry about it just yet.  Yeah, it is good to plan ahead, but don't obsess over it.  Things change, and you will too.  Unless you are a master pre-cogger, there is no way to tell exactly what will happen in the future, so just go with it.  It also may help to take an accounting class (which is hell, by the way) and start learning how to save and budget, as well as other life skills that will aid you in the future...But, try not to worry about it too much.  You're still young, and need to live out your childhood (adolescent-hood lol).  Trust me, don't end up worrying too much about the future and missing out.  I did.  And I regret it.
