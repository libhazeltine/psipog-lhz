			Somebody has to know enough about precognition first. Then, they have to be convinced to write an article about it. It's not like there's a machine that Peebrain has that automatically spits out articles on any given subject they need info on.

You see, that machine is in the faaaar future where we're expired <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

An article on precognition has been somewhat made in one of Peebrain's PK articles. Is says to predict dice rolls by feeling it. Even though it says that is the wrong result for Micro-PK. But once PsiPog staff has someone who can do it on average, we will have an article on it (probably). If not, wait for the machine.

			Precog is also a very tricky subject to write about while staying on-topic. But if you ask around and ask politely, i'm sure youd be able to find someone willing to make an atempt at an article. Whether it is any good and/or gets posted is another matter.

			and if you can't find an article on precog, you are always be free to experiment yourself and possibly even write an article or even a simple forum post to share your ideas to others, I personally strongly believe I've experienced many many moments of precog, although I've never dove into the subject, at very random times I will get into this very weird state of mind where I just completely feel like something is going to happen I can't really explain it, it just happens when it happens <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />, it happens on larger scale and miniscule scale things, such as having a strong feeling of knowing what song will come next on a randomized playlist on my ipod, to a carcrash I was feeling might happen that I saw at the beggining of my school year. Its just too hard of a thing for me to describe, and this probably isn't the best forum to discuss this fully on, maybe I'll start a topic on it somewhere else in the future.
