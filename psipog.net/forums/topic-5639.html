This is me pushing it off.  While watching this vid, I noticed that when I was trying to push it off, only one corner of the paper was going up, no other parts were going up, just one corner.  I carefully watched the whole way through and I found out that the corner that was going up was the one that was pointing towards the pulm of my hand.  While doing that, I remember a technique I was doing was to visualize the aura of an object to be the same as mine by visualizing both the object and the psi in my hand blue.  So i'm thinking that I only didn't spin the psiwheel and caused it to be pushed off the pin, I think I actualy levetated that corner then stopped as soon as it fell.  What do you think?

			Sorry if I sounded alittle confusing. ^^;  What I was trying to say was the corner that I lifted up was the only one that was lifting.  Before the wheel started turning and that corner kept lifting with each turn it passed by my palm, I kept thinking about pushing the wheel off.  So I thought all corners will go up one by one then suddenly push off, but I then remembered that I concintrated on that corner and I visualized that corner being the same as my aura, etc.  I decided to push the whole thing off but that tip was going up instead of forward, or it was just tipping that way due to me pushing it.  Anywho, I was thinking if I were to instead focus enough to visualize the blue aura to cover the whole object, I could be able to move it freely in the air.
