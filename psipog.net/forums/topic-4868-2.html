			I read somewhere that if humans had wings that were large enough to actually get our bodies off the ground then we would need huge shoulder muscles giving us an upper body span of about 4 metres!...of course that could be hear say...

			Oh boy.. I'm very suprised no one has got to this thread before me..
<br />

<br />
At any rate changing you systems on such a massive scale would not only be very unfeasable but even if possible it would require high amounts of food, mostly the nutrients in it. You're adding A LOT to your body in those, if not adding in new limbs, which your body would need a crazy amount of nutrients to make, not to mention it would be incrediably painful, suffice to say your body wouldnt even register how to use this new added part.
<br />

<br />
Also you're suggesting we change our DNA to an extent to grow abnormal things, if not change our species, and these traits are based in our genes, it would be possible to altercate ourselves by slight things, but a complete revamp, well thats requires medical science, such as plastic surgery. Also to mention once more the pain, if any of you remember or are going through growth spurts, well imagine that pain if not even worst.
<br />

<br />
Also for that 6'7&quot; thing, umm trust me you dont want to be that tall, i'm 6'2&quot; and I sort of wish I was shorter, I mean I want a spouse who I dont have a head height difference with, I mean I can deal with it, but a preferable is a person about my height.
<br />

<br />
As for mythical creatures, well hey that answers itself, 100% fluff. Genetic abnormalities such as 'wings' or otherwise are something you have to be born with, such as the three armed baby from China, amazingly that wasn't a bunch of lies, it was an official mutation, most likely caused due to radiation.. China is one big happy nuclear country.

			You have misunderstood, after my first post, i realised that it was unfeasable, so i turned it into a game, so ShadowWolf, what would you change yourself into if you COULD DMILS on a scale of epic proportion.

			Wings?  Boring.  I'd grow a closable tube from my stomache to outside my skin.  At will i'd be able creatre pressure and spew my stomache acids at people.  I'd sort of be like bubble bobble but a lot less PURE EVIL.

			I'd just like to mention at this point that everybody who would want red eyes and are actually trying to attempt it take a look at the changing eye-colour post I made, I think over in Personal Techniques.  In a nutshell, very bad for your eyes.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, if I could change the way I look, I would, like everybody else have wings <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.  White angelic ones... although I suppose my wings tattoos will do in the meantime (see avatar &lt;-----)
<br />

<br />
Next comes the eyes.  I have heterochromia, but my eyes are so similar in colour anyway that I would make it more pronounced - right eye blue, left eye green.  Then I'd make my hair very long and red, because it's annoying and expensive to dye ones hair all of the time <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Nothing major except the wings, I suppose <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

I always thought that the sub-c was computer-like. I don't think that computers have the capacity to be evil on their own (contrary to everybody's personal experience) I don't think that your sub-c does either. I think your sub-c is just acting on pre-programmed suggestions and instincts. So in my opinion, if your sub-c is evil, its probably through something you did, or some way you influenced it.
