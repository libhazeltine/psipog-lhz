			i had an idea on empathy. instead of attempting to read their emotions by a tendril of awareness, why not attempt to feel the residual psi &quot;excreted&quot; by them? 
<br />

<br />
i've been running an emotional psi experiment to see what can generate more psi. happiness and depression create a lot. anger produces a lot too, but not on the scale as the others. on top of that, each emotion has it's own psi signature. happiness is fluffy, depression is heavy, anger is, well, flamey, (find me a better way of saying it!) etc, etc. the only thing is that a lot needs to be generated to be coherent. therefore, strong emotions need to be present.
<br />

<br />
perhaps if we are able to sense the small output from the untrained, (IE those who cannot shield and/or therefore control their output,) then perhaps we can extract emotions more efficently and coherently when combined with other methods.
<br />

<br />
questions? comments? pm me if any, or post here!

in fact, anyone who tries this, would you be willing to tell me what you experience when you try this? it'll help greatly as my experiment is still ongoing.

			Passive empathy, such as that demonstrated in natural empaths and telepaths, does not involve tendrils or scans or anything like this. For this reason, I can say that at least the first part of your theory is correct - that is not the &quot;only way&quot; to go about it.

			I agree with Elliptic on the passive empathy.  I don't &quot;do&quot; anything to feel other folks' emotions.  I have to shield to not feel others' emotions.  Every day.  Literally.

I have found this distinction to be different with passive empathy as well.  This is possibly because if you are trying to &quot;do&quot; empathic broadcasting, anger is not felt in the same way.  Even the other emotions are different when I try to &quot;make&quot; that emotion emanate from me.  My understanding has been that anger tends to be stronger even when manufactured, however.
<br />

<br />
My experience has been that &quot;passive&quot; broadcast anger is rather stronger than other emotions.  I have never made anyone sick by being happy or depressed.  Unfortunately, I have made people physically ill by being angry.

i never said it's the only way to go, and i agree that there are more and possibly better techniques for empathy. i did however think this up as a possible verification and/or complementary skill in addition to the others that people use. as so many before me said:
<br />

<br />
&quot;do what works best for you.&quot;
<br />

<br />
as for anger, there is a certain uniqueness with it's feeling. the psi is not billowing from the person as in happiness or depression. it is forced out. i could be wrong, but because it is forced out in such a fashion, it gives an impression that there is a lot of it under &quot;pressure.&quot; like i said, i could be wrong. i haven't had much of an opprotunity to study a REALLY angry person as they are ether rude as hell, or violent, therefore hard to study. if anyone has any useful information to give i'd be happy to listen. thanks.

			I believe that when people show stronger emotions, that creates a stronger energy signal from the person. For instance, you may not be able to tell EXACTLY what somebody is feeling but if someone is in a bad mood, you're going to know it from all the negative psi energy. Same if someone is in a really good mood. For the most part if someone is in physical pain that you feel, maybe they're thinking about it so much that it sends a telepathic signal. Also, if you put yourself in their position, empathic or not, it's pretty easy to tell what somebody is feeling.

			while that is true, the goal of this theory is to detect the MINUTE changes in a person, and use that to our advantage. of course, the large emotions are obvious, but the little ones are not.

			I use passive empathy and have since I was young, it is only recently that I have began refining it more directly. I have a good sense for envy, greed, hatred, and other negitive emotions(perhaps my bad childhood contributed to that), of course I have found that empathy helps best when...You guessed it &quot;talking to someone&quot; so I look into the persons eyes(as a meditative kinda focus) and visualize me &quot;draining&quot; emotions out of them for me to sense but I also get a ton of thoughts that way too, I also focus on their third eye sometimes for you chakra believers out there...
