			Ok, so Slinger (got the name from me 'caz I own) told me to come here and post why I don't believe this stuff, and what I do believe.
<br />

<br />
Why I don't believe it-I haven't seen anything to make me believe it.
<br />

<br />
What I do believe-Lots of stuff.
<br />

<br />
How to make me believe-Post some linkys to videos showing the ENTIRE persons body while they do this psi junk, and a crowed of people watching in the background would be helpful to. And have the camera zoom in and out. Prove it isn't bullshit.

EDIT: You seem very up your own ass, 'Prove to me this isnt bullshit', so you really think people are going to waste their time on you, there are many more people like you, thinking Psi is shit until proved otherwise. If that is the case, then you will never learn psionics, and be an utter and complete failure.

			Do all skeptics get treated this way?
<br />

<br />
Gunslinger, do I what I did. Try it. Everyone can do it (or it certainly seems that way), so why not disprove it for yourself?
<br />

<br />
Let's look at this logically: If dozens, if not hundreds of people are doing this, then it is pretty unlikely that it is false. Therefore, there is a good chance that it <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> real.
<br />

<br />
If you're willing to try, then <a href="../ebook.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">here</a> and <a href="../articles.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">here</a> are good places to start.
<br />

<br />
At least accept that possibility that if so many people claim it exists, and have given instructions on how to reproduce it, that it could be real.

<br />
Maxus is merely frustrated, which is understandable. Many people often come doubting the things that we claim we can do... And with good reason. However, none of them ever take the effort to attempt these things for themselves. 
<br />

<br />
It is very easy for someone to come and say &quot;prove it to me&quot;, instead of actually making the effort to prove it to themselves. After all, does it really matter to YOU if it's real or not? Would you start practicing it if you where proved it? CAN WE, really, prove it to you with a video over the internet? Or maybe even in person?
<br />

<br />
The only way you can prove it 100% to you, is to try it yourself.
