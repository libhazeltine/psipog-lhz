			I presented my evidence in this thread: <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=1394" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1394</a>
<br />

<br />
But you're lazy.  You're not going to click that link.  So here's a summary.
<br />

<br />
I was in middle school.  Around thanksgiving time in 2004, when I was in eighth grade, was when I found the wonderful world of the paranormal.
<br />

<br />
There were a few people in middle school who seemed like they could be psionicists, but it wasn't like, &quot;OMG I think there's another psionicist in the school!&quot;  No, more like &quot;Ha, that person seems like they could actually be a psionicst, but there's no way in hell.&quot;
<br />

<br />
But I realized that it wasn't just personality that made the case.  It was physical evidence.  Mostly mind reading.  Click the link if you want examples.  And unfortunately, I realized this at the end of ninth grade.  I never saw any of the &quot;suspects&quot; again after eighth grade.
<br />

<br />
Now what?  I eventually sent a letter to one of them, actually my best friend in middle school.  Yes, my suspicions were true.  All too much.  But he wasn't the only one.  There are five others, according to him.  But he's not saying much.
<br />

<br />
But I was always too determined to find the truth.  I asked him who they were, but he didn't answer, of course.  I told him I wanted to know so I could find out if any of them are in my high school.
<br />

<br />
I had no evidence at all for anyone in my high school.  But I'm always on the lookout.
<br />

<br />
Now, I don't practice psionics much, that's not my job.  But sometimes I just know the answer to something inexplicably.  Sometimes I will know exactly what someone is going to say.  It doesn't happen often, and it never actually matters.  But this time it did.
<br />

<br />
I knew that someone in my school was one of them.  I don't know how, I just do.  Not necessarily someone from my middle school, just another psionicist.
<br />

<br />
Last Saturday, 10-28, was when I think I figured it out.  I was lying in my bed, and I closed my eyes.  I saw a bunch of pieces of paper with a single word written on each one, all jumbled together, overlaping, unreadable.  But there was one piece of paper that was apart, the other papers moved aside for it.  It was the only word I read, and I only saw it for a second.
<br />

<br />
It was a name.  The name of a person I know at school.  A person who went to my middle school.  A person who seemed like they could be a psionicist.
<br />

<br />
Now, my logic is sure to be biased, maybe the word just looked like a name, maybe this isn't the person, who knows.  But at least I have something to work with.  Now I just have some research to do.  What do you all think about this?

The correct word is psion <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. And on the link you should use telepath.

So from this I can tell that you are a pretty gifted psychic intuitive and a very gifted clairvoyant. Pretty much like myself except you seem more skilled. Are your experiences with these uncontrollable like mine or do you tap into them? I've read most of a book that teaches this but I prefer to hear other people's techniques. Anyway, if those experiences were genuine (especially the clairvoyant one), you may have something there. But, be warned. Clairvoyance, unlike intuition, can be misleading so you may want to check out you visions carefully before claiming what you think they mean to be the truth. Some clairvoyance is symbolic, remember that! Also, from your link, if you want to find out if they are a psion you could just go with the person's suggestion that said talk to them about it carefully and reel them in until you get to the point. I did this with a friend of mine (as a result of my careful conversation he became a member of psipog). I told him to do an energy exercise without letting him know what it was all about and then when he felt it I explained to him what just happened and told him about the website. Prior to all this I asked him if he was open minded and stuff like that. Unfortunately, I can't remember everything I said. Sorry. Good luck with your sleuthing friend <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.

@GWN- Yeah, a bit of reverse psychology.  These things are mostly uncontrollable on the large scale, but I can tap into it minimally to do stuff like &quot;reading&quot; a face-down card.  And SpellCheck does not recognize &quot;telepath&quot; but it does &quot;telepathist.&quot;  I've heard that psionicist and telepathist are the correct terms, but maybe not everywhere.  Thanks for your help.  I'll see what I can do.

Odd <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />. My brother just told me to tell you to just ask them if they are a psion or not instead of doing all the detective stuff. Of course, if you're shy about looking wierd then don't do it, but I've got a better idea. Just draw the psipog symbol on a piece of paper and ask him/her what it means, stands for, or represents. If they answer &quot;Oh, that's the symbol they use on psipog!&quot; then you get an easy win, but chances are they won't be that unsecretive. If they say that they don't know what it means or say that it's a letter in the greek alphabet (which it is; as was mentioned on a thread a long time ago) then ask him/her if he/she knows what web site/secret society uses that symbol and tell him/her that you are a member so that he/she feels more comfortable. You would have to treat this like an offering of membership to the site or something to make it seem less conspicuous. That is all I have to offer that does not relate to honing psychic senses, good luck.

But just to point out, PouncingKavu and I share the same name anyways, so I am confused of which person you are speaking about.

I haven't gotten to analyze what everyone's said but it sounds like Niushirra was dissing me or something.
