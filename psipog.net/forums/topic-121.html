			I suppose many of you may have heard of Indigo children, if you haven't check it out here =&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_children" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_children</a>. So what I was saying, is that could Psi be a side effect of most of us being Indigo children (since the first indigos appeared around 1960 ). Most people here seem to be in the early teens to 30s ( I am 15 ), so I was wondering if psychic phenomena were a side-effect. Also , this may be due to the internet and TV, but haven't reports of psychic phenomena been rising. What do you guys think? That would also explain why a lot of psi practitioners are programmers or some other field which requires abstraction, knowledge and an innate understanding of things, or that we are soaking up and spreading knowledge that most people wouldn't want to believe.

			I think its an interesting theory and idea, and is definatly worth some research and thought before making a decision.  However, I am inclined to believe everyone has these abilities, its just the preconditioning of our minds which makes them difficult or impossible to some.
<br />

<br />
For instance, I have come to understand that the general concensous around here is that if you believe you can do something, then you can, and if you don't think its possible, then you won't be able to.  So, if we are preconditioned from childhood to believe that gravity is an irresistable force, and that things cannot hover on their own free will, then we won't be able to induce things into hovering.  This is just an example, I do not claim to be able to do anything.  I am still trying to tear down this mental blockade.  I firmly believe that once I do manage to, my abilities will expand dramaticly (currenty I have some luck with psiballs and the like).
<br />

<br />
Just my opinions though, who's to say that I'm not totally wrong and it is these indigo children who are the only ones with the power.  I certianly hope not, because in that case I'm out of luck, but only time will tell I suppose.

			I think the reason we're all geeks is because a geek has no life, and if they come across psionics on the internet, they won't have anything better to do than test it.
<br />

<br />
As for indigo children, that's a New Age belief. New Age is fluffy. And cults aren't good for your health.
<br />

<br />
In response to your &quot;only chosen ones can use psionics&quot;, you'll notice that everyone psychokinetically geists from time to time, and that those who happen to have natural skill in psionics usually inherited it through genetics, rather than divine intervention.
<br />

<br />
There are also individuals who take other people's energy for their own psionic endevours, and that the people they leach are usually non-psions.
<br />

<br />
So, most people have psi energy in their bodies (I say&quot;most&quot; since there is a possibility that there are some people born without psionic abilities, due to deformation, etc etc.)

			I do not believe in the Indigo theory.  I think it was created to give psychics an excuse for their anti-social behavior.  I.e., &quot;I'm not anti-social... I'm a unique creative individual who has been chosen to blah blah blah&quot;.  Well, no... You're anti-social, face it.
<br />

<br />
People don't like admiting that they aren't perfect and need a lot of work.  So they construct mental prisons where they are king.  I think the Indigo theory is one of these prisons.

			Nice post. I think this theory of &quot;chosen ones&quot; is garbage for one reason: if it were true, there would be A LOT of chosen ones on PsiPog. And as NI stated it once, that is a pretty large coincedence(but it probably isn't because all people have it <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> ). That's my 2 cents.

lmfao, the &quot;weirdest&quot; looking thing i've ever been associated with was a squirrel or a gerbil or a chipmunk. and in accordance with the &quot;top ten indigo child attributes&quot; i share all but one, the last one. And that could easily be attributed to my upbringing. And the only real psychic-advantages i seem to have, (thus far into my psychic experiments - i.e. not very far at all) is being able to easliy achieve the state between sleep and wakefulness in which rem activates and i dream whilst being almost asleep. the slightest sound or whatever will easily deter me out of my state of mind.
<br />

<br />
edit: i'm not saying i AM an indigo child nor do i believe in any one religion. Although the only metaphysical or supernatural thing that i have experienced thus far IS psionics and experimentations with my subconscious; I also have a very hightened ESP 'sense' i guess it could be appropriately titled.

no really the idea is kinda fluffy. But I must admit I fit that description to a T. The interesting thing is psi attracts psi, and metaphysical types seem to run into each other in life all the time.

			I think this theory is wishfull thinking. I believe everyone has the ability to use psionics with some determination and practice. I read up on this a little, appearantly the percentage of &quot;indigo children&quot; has gone up in the past years, guess why? People are becoming more &quot;aware,&quot; a lot of people seem to be waking up or discovering psionics or something alike. I think it's for people who just don't feel special enough and decide to be saviors for our world using their &quot;powers.&quot;

			The Indigo theory is fueled by parents who would rather hear their kids are special than face the fact that they really have a problem such as ADHD. They can believe what they want, but imo they need to face the facts that their kids just need a little help thats all.

			Personally, it seems the symptoms also overlap with byproducts of a high IQ (or being a 'Gifted' student) but even then, I don't think there's any sort of parallel between IQ and psionic activity since the majority of practitioner's I've ever met I'd venture to guess had average or slightly-below average IQ's.
