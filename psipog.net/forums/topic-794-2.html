Chris,
<br />
I am uncertain that animals are capable of thought transference. Some of my attitude is the result of a study of anthropology, some of it is purely conjecture on my part. 
<br />
I think humans can be very aware of the feelings of some animals as some species are more likely to exhibit emotions. But...<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">IMHO</span></span>... Thought as we know it, the abstract action of summarizing ideas and feelings together to synthesize a new idea, is unlikely in most animals. 
<br />
I do think some animals can develop instinctual reactions for humans. Good or bad, some animals seem to understand if our intentions are good or not (which is more likely to open as bebate on the meaning of good vs. evil). Memory and cognition have been proven in a variety of species. Some can even be taught to respond and learn minute parts of a language. Some animals show the ability for problem solving if it driven by reward or survival. Animal behavior can be controlled or taught in some species. Usually, these are the animals are on the high end of the intelligence spectrum. The expression, &quot;herding cats comes to mind.&quot; There seems to be a minimum requirement in native intelligence. 
<br />

<br />
When I call my dog &quot;Kowboy&quot; he will come regardless of what room in the house he is in. Usually, he associates his name with getting positive strokes of attention, or the treat of a piece of food. Do I think he actually understands the word &quot;Kowboy&quot; as a name, associated with his identity? <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">IMO</span></span>...Not really. He knows that the sound of that word is associated with &quot;positive strokes&quot; so he responds. He also responds to the <span style="font-style: italic">way</span> I say it. A sweet or condemning tone evokes the appropriate reaction in him...but I think it is learned.  He <span style="font-style: italic">senses</span> my emotion. I think if I said &quot;I'm mad at you Kowboy...yes, I am. I'm really mad!&quot; but intoned in a sweet. baby talking delivery...he would respond as if I were his best buddy in the world. He hears the intonation, not the language. 
<br />

<br />
Pet owners are very inclined to project their own thinking onto their pets or assign human attributes to animals, anthropomorphizing them. I would be cautious to persue the idea of animal telepathy as being valid but I am not telling you to think that. Telepathy is thought transference. I do think that some animals can be very empathic and responsive to our feelings. Some poeple say plants are capable of the same thing.   <span style="font-weight: bold"></span>

			well, my dog an yorkshire terrier,and i've alwasy communicated with it the same why i communicate with humans...i talk with it the same way i talk with people..the point is (its a female dog btw)sometimes i got the feeling she is actually thinking and she understands what we say quite well,she understands what &quot;pointing&quot; means, i point somewhere and she understands what it means.
<br />

<br />
when she wants to play or something she comes to us with the ball and puts it right in our hand, runds back into a distance and expects us to throw the ball then she gives the ball to us willingly i never told her to bring the ball she just brings it so i throw it again i didnt teach her that...and when i say &quot;put the object between my feet&quot; she goes and puts right it there it just might be her instinct but this species are known for being quite inteligent and and the fact that she understands portuguese (im portuguese)quite well,makes me believe there is some more then just a little inteligence,

			Well.. I am not sure if this was animal telepathy or not, but when my dog had to be put down ( <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> ) I was at work (so I wasn't actually next to her when she went). But I can tell you teh exact time that she went, because I felt a very STRONG pain in my stomach. Like someone had punched me about several times with spikes.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />  But I think that was telepathy....

			I think what you're &quot;hearing&quot; is your subcon trying to interpret your mouse's emotions and thoughts into words.  Mice don't think in words like humans do.  They think in emotions and body language and feelings.  Whereas you think in terms of words.  You could probably interpret your mouse's thoughts in words but you may be wrong once or twice.  Because every word no matter the launguage can be traced to an emotion or a signal of body language.  Or an object.  I have heard many stories of people using telepathy to comunicate with animals but I don't know if they're true.  I haven't had much experience in telepathy but have read several articles on it.
<br />

<br />
If I'm wrong then will someone who has more experience please correct me?

			they are, mine doesnt have a very accurated smell but she can recognise people,i know this because i place meat on the ground and she snifes even a few inches next to the meat and cant find it.

<br />
but i cant surprise her when i try to pet her by surprise she realises it most of the times, she has a great ESP but she cant smell like most dogs

but there is something really interesting, mine sometimes assumes postures,its like shes actually thinking, i even cought her in some moments i belive she was actually rationalising and this aint bull****

			Being a newbie, take what I say (for now) with a grain of salt.
<br />

<br />
The subconscious is an element more primal and base in all of us, which evolutionarily speaking is much older and common to most animal life.  That we have a conscious that interprets and tries to understand the subconscious is convenient, but perhaps in telepathy that's exactly what we're doing anyway.  Maybe we're just reading another human's subconscious, and using our own consciousness to interpret it.  
<br />

<br />
So if we're only reading the subconscious, then it follows that we could read (and interpret) any subconscious, be it animal or whatever.  The fact that the dog doesn't have the presence of mind to interpret or understand its own feelings doesn't preclude us from doing so.
<br />

<br />
Of course, it's just a thought.  I'm inclined to believe that if somebody's using telepathy to communicate with animals, no amount of other people saying it's impossible will change that.  &quot;The world is moving so fast that often the person who says a thing is impossible is interrupted by the person who's doing that thing.&quot;  I forgot who said that, but the point it that, although we can't for sure say that reading animals is possible or happens, it's very premature to say that it's impossible.
<br />

There's only one way to find out:

			I think what some people seem to be mixing up here is that telepathy can convey concepts, not necissarily words. I've picked up concepts and emotions from animals before, but never words. Most animals are quite capable of grasping a concept. How complicated the concept does vary though from simple to very complex depending on the species and individual. (So if you try and communicate something that would mean absolutely nothing to an animal in all fairness you can't expect a response). Most animals understand few words as such (There are a few exceptions where certain animals have been taught the meanings behind hundreds of words, but its not the norm) so if you do want to try tp on an animal, thinking words at them isn't likely to be successful. You're far better off thinking about the concepts behind the words. 
<br />

<br />
For example thinking &quot;Don't bite me!&quot; (probably with a panicy empathic broadcast attached) is unlikely to work because if you are sending anything at all, it's probably the concept that you're expecting them to bite. If on the other hand you try for a calming empathic broadcast while trying to send the concept of you not being a threat and say the image of you approaching and nothing bad happening, that'll generally work better. (That's a pretty simplistic example and I'm well aware that many animals read body language very well which would easily complicate an example like this, I'm just using it as an example). 
<br />

<br />
I believe there have been some studies done on mice where one half of a group seemed to know when the other half was being killed off, or something pretty unpleasent like that. It was a long time ago that I saw it though so I don't have the reference. If I ever find it again, I'll put it up here.
<br />

<br />
Edit: 
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">&quot;Thought as we know it, the abstract action of summarizing ideas and feelings together to synthesize a new idea, is unlikely in most animals&quot;.</span>
<br />

<br />
That's actually not true. Many animals have been shown to be able to problem solve. It's been seen in everything from dolphins to birds to octopus. It's not a purely human trait although you're right in that the more &quot;intelligent&quot; animals are often the ones that are seen to have more complex problem solving ability. The ablity to problem solve is usually driven by reward or survival but that's true of humans as well.
