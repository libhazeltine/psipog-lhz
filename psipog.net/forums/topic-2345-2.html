			Never heard of nos, or monster. Iv'e heard of powerade, but some of them taste wierd. The only one i like is the blue one. But they don't have as much energy in them. Lucazade I find too sticky, but it helped me off my feet when I had food poisoning recently.

			powerade tastes that way due to the sodium and potassium that is in it. another natural way to replenish the body, but not get that caffine fit, is propel fitness water... goooood shit.

			To spread a little more diversity into this topic...I personally think energy drinks are one of the worst things created. Do you honestly think all of this kids around the world need more energy? Caffiene, sugar, it's loaded...if I had any I would probably have a heart attack. Do you know how many calories a bowl of cereal has? A lot, and that's just your cereal...imagine everything else you eat throughout the day...your body is abosolutely loaded with energy you don't need anymore. Thousands of calories...you've heard things on the news &quot;Oh, American kid's obesity rate has gone way up&quot; blah blah, it's shit like that, that creates more fat kids, like me. &quot;But fat guy, the real problem is McDonalds.&quot; Yes I know skinny kids, I will get that damn McDonalds, but those energy drinks are just adding to their power.

			Why don't you just do some exercise and lose weight? You're just killing yourself slowly.

EDIT: I like some energy drinks. I never feel the effect though. I'm pretty sure that's not their fault though

			Not all energy drinks are bad. Some of them are crap in the amount of energy that they supply. Powerade doesn't seem to have any energy in it compared to lucazade and red bull. Although, I too don't seem to feel much when I drink red bull. 
<br />
However, when I tried making a psi ball a couple of days ago, I couldn't for about 15 mins. Nothing. Not even a single tingle. Now some people could argue that this was a coincidence, but when I drank some red bull afterwards, 10 mins later I could feel tingling and some heat. Of course I know that it couldn't have been the red bull since I'm sure that Iv'e got tons of energy packed up inside me and one energy drink isn't going to add much, but it was most probably more the belief of it.
<br />
I am trying to stop drinking via meditation whenever I can.
<br />
btw, I don't know why the topic was moved since at the start of it I clearly talked about red bull's and other energy drinks effect on manipulating psi. Not energy drinks in general. But nevermind.

Yeah. I had a Sobe Energy drink the other day, didn't taste that bad.
<br />

<br />
And Bawls is the greatest energy drink evar. ^_^
<br />

<br />
But I had like...a bottle of Bawls, a can of Shark, and then half of my friend's can.
<br />

<br />
And I was like, &quot;So...what do you think of the economy?&quot;
<br />
And after his half-can, he was like...twiching and shit.
<br />

<br />
It was kinda hilarious.

Bawls rules! So does...The new Jolt, Full Throttle, Vault, and our good old friend Surge (the ancestor of Vault and FT...they taste the same.)
<br />

<br />
The problem with energy drinks, is that they make you dependant on them (imagine stimpacks in starcraft, or steroid kids in Madison Connecticut). They do boost things quite a bit, but the next day you try, without caffeine, you'll feel like crap and twice as bad as before. Energy drinks are cool on occasion, but on normal days just get some Green Tea. (I broke some bones way long ago and caffeine killed my bone density. I cant have energy drinks for a loong time.)

			Most caffeine I've ever had was at an anime convention in CT (connecticon. GO THERE! Haha)
<br />

<br />
I was dressed in a pirate hat and drank
<br />

<br />
1. Some of my Girlfriends Jolt Blue
<br />
2. About 10 bottles of Bawls over the night (we hadnt slept for like 2 nights...and you can prolly predict what happened &gt;&lt;)
<br />

<br />
So...after this, we were going to sneak some hentai into a screening room cause it was like 4 am and we were bored. I got into the room and started hearing a song that appeared out of nowhere that sounded slightly ethereal...very odd. I actually think It was my brain singing me a lullaby to put me to sleep. It relaxed me but I stayed awake. I went to hang out with my friends after the screening and was talking really hyper on a couch. I passed out like a rock in about...30 seconds. This was the biggest sugar/caffeine crash ever. Staff were poking me all night and I didnt get up. I woke up and my muscles were dead. It was a comalicious. Haha. Stupid too...
