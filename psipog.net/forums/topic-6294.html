			Okay just last week i couldn't do anything with pk and yesterday i read the compilation of theories in general forums and read something about changing from faith to mind, so i went to school and i got really bored in computers class so i had my friend watch the clock and i tried to stop it, guess what? i stopped it with barely any practise and that was a few months ago, i stopped it on the 9 for 5 seconds and my friend verified it wasnt my eyes messing up what is going on here???

			You stopped the clock? So what? You were bored, you're more able because your mind is willing to do anything to kill boredom.

			If you focus on a clock and think about it slowing down, it will seem to. I don't know whether it REALLY does or whether you're just speeding up the rate at which you percieve reality by concentrating. (yes, speeeding up perception makes things slower).
<br />

<br />
 If it stops you're either crazy and hallucinating (or drugs) or you're actually stopping it with pk. If it slows down, the chances are, you're just &quot;imagining&quot; it. If you try to slow down the hand anyway, there is only a small line between enough pressure ot slow it and enough to stop it; they are quite light to stop with your finger so not much pressure needed in physical terms.
<br />

<br />
Although I've never actually seen the hand stop after I have been watching it, I've looked at a clock a lot to see that it takes ages for the next tick. I don't know whether that's because I look at it just as it ticks, so the wait seems longer, or whether I stop it just before I look at it and then my sub-c sort of realises I'm looking at it and covers it up by letting it go again.

			I remember while playing Final Fantasy 7 on my computer the FF7 seconds were around 2 and a half times slower than the normal second. My friend thought I was crazy but I timed it and I was right. It was riddiculous. I played all day and it said 5 hours played.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />
