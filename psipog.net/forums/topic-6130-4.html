			I believe Micah (blond mom's son) can sort of, mess with electronic things. I don't remember his exact words, but I remember within the first two episodes I think he talked about fixing his computer. I guess it would explain how he did it when he's like... 8 years old XD I guess it can be done but I wouldn't expect ... whatever. 
<br />

<br />
I think EVERYONE likes Hiro. He's just... pure ownage. Wouldn't you love to stop time? Go forward and backward in time? <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />. Although I guess, like future Hiro mentioned, I wouldn't go through time much (or at all) &quot;risking a rip in time&quot; or whatever. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> I mean, just being able to stop time alone gives you a helluva lot of possibilities.

I know you can see 'em again on Fridays on the Sci Fi channel, as well as online (I think they still show the most recent episode of shows on NBC.com).

			Awesome episode...The picutre with Hiro and the girl? That is simple... They didnt have any pictures taken b4 she died...he went to go back in time to save her---that is where the photo comes in...his buddy at the restaraunt didnt notice the photo on the wall--was because HIRO saved her..and because he saved her--that photo was taken--so it was kind of like the past was molding back into place now that he saved her...Also It was strange, it was the first episode that the blonde mom wasn't involved <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

kick ass episode tonight, cant wait til the next week <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

neither was the brother of the hot polotician! and the cheerleader was barley there too. the show mainly focused on Mohinder and his crap. but why didnt hiro come back? if he could travel through time like that he should have been back in the blink of an eye no?

Yeah, Peter and Nathan weren't in this episode, but it seems Peter will definitely show up in the next one.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
And hey, I thought the stuff with Mohinder was interesting.  I'm thinkin'... how his mom said his sister was &quot;special&quot;... she might be talking about... you know... THAT kind of special....
<br />

<br />
Which might lead to something interesting.
<br />

<br />
Also, Hiro mentioned to count to five and he'd be back... which he didn't do... so now I'm worried about him.
<br />

<br />
Though this shouldn't particularly mean anything bad will happen... I mean, this event would have still happened in Future Hiro's timeline, right?  Meaning he'd be okay?
<br />

<br />
...I hope....

That's not much of a power, though.  You can do just about ANYTHING in your dreams.

lets see... thinking back it would explain why his father had the picture of the kid in his drawer. but then again wouldnt you remember what you looked like when you were younger? especialy if you were that ugly.
