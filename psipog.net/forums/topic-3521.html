			Everyone I've ever met who I took an immediate disliking to upon meeting them has had an extreme dislike of me.  This tends to hold despite common friends and interests.
<br />

<br />
A possibly related phenomenon is my immediately realization of my ex fiance being interested in two people, one who she later told me she was mildly interested in and one who she is now dating but says she didn't develop the interest until after our break up.
<br />

<br />
Could this be me sensing or projecting these peoples responses or am I simply a good judge of character?

I would say this is probably because of either your behavior, body language or it could be possible that you broadcast negative thoughts when you see someone you don't like.  You'd be suprised how well people react to body language but how little we realize we are giving certian signs.

My thoughts on this are that they are not related phenomenom.  Theres a chance that its coincidence, or that you are able to read a person's motives or at least react to them subconsciously.
<br />

<br />
Honestly most things have a normal everyday explaination to them, and if not...does it really matter?  By becoming more sensitive you will be able to control your energy, and keep yours in, and other people's out.

I personally don't really believe in precog, I haven't seen any conclusive evidence that it exists.  The best I have had experience with is knowing when phone calls will come hours to seconds from when they call etc.  But most of these are me picking up on people I know that think of calling me at a certian time, and thus I don't really consider that true precog.
<br />

<br />
To me for precog to exist you would first have to prove that time is more than just an idea (physical in some form of energy).  Then you could theorize how psi could potentially affect this substance (time).  Until then it is just telepathy.

			ideal, this happens to me all the time.
<br />
i think it's telepathy, but parts of it may be tied to precog in some way.
<br />
i get 3 different kinds of 'precog' experiences at random times, and this is partly one of them
<br />

<br />
simply...pay more attention to your feelings, and the feelings you get which seem unfamiliar or foreign
<br />
don't jump to any conclusions about anything
<br />
stay objective; observe; analyze; collate; repeat;
<br />

<br />
anyway, good luck with figuring it out. i haven't yet been able to
