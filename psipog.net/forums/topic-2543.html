Otherkin think they know what they are, skeptics think they don't. Its upto you to decide what you think about it, really. There's no simple answer to it  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			*ahem* why is this in the applied psionics forum?
<br />

anyway, why does it matter? Otherkin believe, for whatever reason, that they have the soul of a mythical being, okay, now, unless you are one, how does that affect you? I'm of the believe what you want mentality, hell, for all I care, you can believe you are a giant fire snail, it really doesn't affect me in the slightest.

			I believe otherkin falls in the same category of psi-vampirism.  I.e., people sitting around who identify with an idea, so they think that the identification must be REAL.  Well, no, just because you find something cool and interesting doesn't mean it must be who you &quot;really&quot; are.

We're all human.  That's just how it goes.

			IMO, original and polite people are at least worthy of being called interesting. As soon as I saw the new otherkin guy (the dragon), I went straight ahead and googled otherkin. I think most of them are pretty reasonable.. Not all though.
<br />

<br />
About otherkin vampires.. I believe that if someone wants badly enough to get hurt by sunlight, they *may* actually get hurt from sunlight. And whether or not this person believes he/she is inflicting it upon her/himself, he/she might actually get ill from going too long without drinking blood, if he/she wants badly enough to be a vampire.
<br />

What do they do anyways, buy animal blood?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

How is that hypocritical?  Just because I believe in one paranormal thing doesn't mean I have to believe in everything paranormal under the sun.  There is a lot of scientific evidence for things like PK and telepathy...  On the other hand, there is no scientific way to test whether someone's &quot;soul&quot; is really a &quot;dragon&quot; or not.
<br />

<br />
Making an untestable claim is a way to completely sidestep a way to be proven wrong.  It is impossible for me to prove an otherkin wrong, because there is no way to test their claim.  I could claim that I have an invisible pink elephant spirit that floats around and follows me around, and only I can see him.  The elephant can't interact with the physical world, and if you want to talk to the elephant, you have to ask me questions - and then I'll relay the message to the elephant.
<br />

<br />
Now: that claim is untestable.  I've designed it in such a way that you can not prove me wrong.  But c'mon - it's just silly.
<br />

<br />
This is why we have a rule that says: <span style="font-weight: bold"> 6. Present reasonable ways for others to validate your claims</span>.  Could otherkin be real?  Well, by definition, yes... because it's impossible to prove wrong.  Could my invisible elephant be real?  Well... yes.  But it's pointless to argue about because there is no way for a third party to validate the information.

Well, it's quite possible to percieve if you're lying. As for finding out if you are delusional.. Maybe possible for a really experienced psion? I don't know, 'cause I'm not one. Also, I guess one could use logic to defeat your claim, observe how you respond to that, and go from there with psychology to see if you are making up lies for yourself in your head.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The point is, someone doesn't have to be right for me to have an interesting discussion with them. I like talking to many people with different mindsets, simply for the purpose of seeing how different people have different opinions on stuff. Even if I think otherkins are delusional, I don't just go about say that and pose a challenge of proving her/himself (by logic or whatever) as soon as I meet one.
<br />

<br />
I like to talk to original people just for its own purpose, and I think we all should. I try to maintain respect for those who in my eyes haven't understood what I in my eyes understand perfectly. If only all those who are sceptic to psionics were that way.. But meh, whatever floats your boat. I'm not telling anyone what to do. I think you, peebs, are a man with a good supply of respect. I'm not saying none of this applies to you.

<br />
As long as people aren't persistant in trying to get people to take their claims seriously, they shouldn't need to follow the sixth rule, right?
<br />
Posing a claim, but saying you don't expect people to take it seriously should be okay IMO. Improves peoples understanding of others
