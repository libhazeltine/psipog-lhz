Hmmm. Do you always and have you always slept about that many hours a night? If not, this may mean that you simply aren't used to it. Most people call it &quot;over sleeping&quot;. I seem to be an exception, lol, but I guess it affects alot of people since I hear about it occasionally. Maybe you should cut down on your sleep <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. Then you can slowly increase your sleeping hours until you're comfortable.

			If it's a bad week in school, 2-3 hours of sleep a night with probably one all-nighter. Normally I get 3-5 hours. It's a private school and I have a 2 hour jiu jitsu class each day, so there's my excuse. =(

I've never heard of that. I think it has to do with how you are raised.

What part of how I was raised? The 6 hours thing? I just started doing that... 5 years ago and 'grew into it', so to speak. so if I ever need to rush or something, I can grab 4 or 5 and feel the same.

<br />
Or do you mean the second half of my post? Since it's true and all, it has nothing to do with how one is raised.

I mean that if your parents make you go to bed, you will be used to that schedule and therefore sleep on the appropriate time.

If I go to sleep early, I end up waking in the middle of the night, so I'm pretty sure it works.
