			Yesterday I showed my sister (12) and my mother me spinning a tinfoil, 
<br />
My sister wants to learn it too but my mom said she should wait with that for a few years.
<br />
They were both like WTF??
<br />
Although my parents are Christians they don't see it as devil worship or witchcraft, they see it as a natural skill.
<br />
My mom thought it was strange that parents ground their children for practicing it, they should be supportive, she said.
<br />
Now my sister comes in wanting me to show it again so here I go.
