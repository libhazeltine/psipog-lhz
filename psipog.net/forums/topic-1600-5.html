			You guys just don't get the point of revealing or how to do it. No shit everybody has revealed to some friends or stuff. All that does is give you a bad rep though. You gotta reveal to the strangers. Not just spread it to people who you think can &quot;handle&quot; it. If you protect yourself and keep yourself secretive then there are NO drawbacks. I already explained the NUMEROUS advantages too. This has been good research though. It gives some insight into why psionics is so small.

			ummm who do you think the people who think you're insane when they here you? people who dont actually know you....but my point is that we should reveal slowly...like have small debates on how stuff like psi is real or how humans aren't fully understood so it could be possible....when the people ask you where you get yuor info then you can say &quot;psipog.net of course!&quot; so they actually see the proof...you've partly convinced me that it could help to prepare people for this but I'm still with waiting until we try to spread it on a more widespread level.....the numbers are still growing no matter how slowly <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

You're right about one thing, I don't have any idea what the point of revealing Psi is. You want to impress people or something? Or let them tap into the &quot;vast&quot; *Chuckles* amounts of powers and usefulness *chuckles again* it grants you?

Not necessarily, I've had several friends, and currently still have them, who are quite impressed and think it's cool that I can do psychic stuff.

Ok, why do I have to reveal it to strangers? I think you have a very fucked up view of what kind of responsibilities we have for tampering with our psychic abilities.

This is where you have misconceptions about &quot;us&quot;. I quoted it because everyone on the sight is different, and your sweeping generalizations are quite stupid. No one I am aware of is HIDING, or AFRAID of what someone is going to do to them because of Psychic abilities.

			SheepKing, you're completely SERVING this guy.
<br />

<br />
He's got it backwards. You don't go &quot;revealing&quot; Psi to complete strangers, because it makes you seem too much like those crazy street preachers who shout &quot;Repent, for the end is nigh!&quot; in the middle of downtown.
<br />

<br />
Rather, if you think someone might be into it, tell them the straightforward truth. It just makes more sense.
<br />

<br />
And nobody I know is afraid or hiding the fact that they're a Psi either. They just go about their lives, not caring who knows. It's how I live, and how my Psi friends live as well.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I think this topic has more than run its course. But that's just my $0.02.

			Good job, sergeant.  That's how I think, and these edgewalkers; those who could be easily pushed into believing, are the ones we need to look for.  Demonstrations work in convincing people, it only creates people who are aware.  Demonstrations demoralize people and so they don't practice because they can only think of how they will never become as good as the demonstrator.  You have to talk it out!  Demonstrations are bad!  You have to find these &quot;edgewalkers,&quot;  they are the only ones useful to those who want to reveal.  I have experience here; I am not making this up.

And I don't know, sheepking did some damage to him, it seems.  He's definitely not on anyone's side, it seems to me.

By the way, Niushirra, I told you to stop saying, &quot;recruit.&quot;  It's how I find your accounts on any forum.  It's whoever has said &quot;recruit&quot; the most.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  Find a new favorite word, and this time, have it make sense.

Ah, the smallest measurement of time is an 'attosecond'....a billionth of a billionth of a second.
<br />

<br />
Yeah, that small. The shortest lifespan of some molecules is 42 attoseconds.

Yeah, short.

			Wow, I really overestimated all of you. Every psion is just a conservative fool. You all think psi should be a selective thing for selected people. Everybody knows psi can be done by everybody but it seems it can't Only selected people can practice psi because they are the people who are &quot;ready.&quot; I guess the point of revealing psi really dosen't have a purpose though. It just feels like the right thing to do. Don't tell me a feeling is bad, psionics is based on feelings and instincts. The truth is clear now about psi's popularity. It is not well known not because no one cares but because psions are reclusive, conservative, outcasts. This topic really has run its course and served its purpose.

It isn't well known because making psi well known is a stupid idea.

Well, so far as I can tell, you jump to conclusions a lot. So, your opinion on &quot;Every psion&quot; doesn't really count too much to me. Not to mention your sweeping generalization is quite wrong. So, let me get this straight. We are fools because we don't find it necessary to &quot;Share&quot; psi with other people to get them into it? Like I said before, I have &quot;shared&quot; psi with many other people, 90% of them where not so interested.

We are not missionaries, we are not an army, we do not &quot;recruit&quot; people. We do not activly seek other people to show them Psi because we want to share our great &quot;gifts&quot; with the world. No one every said only people who are &quot;ready&quot; can practice psi. Another great generalization about our attitudes from you.

You're right, there really is no purpose. And, though, sometimes things feel like they are the right thing to do it is not always the &quot;right&quot; thing to do. I'm not saying sharing Psi is wrong, it indeed is not. Rather, we must not maintain an attitude like we must share it with the world, simply because, if they where interested, there are sufficient resources to find out about it. And for Psionics being based on &quot;feelings and instincts&quot;, this is true to a degree. But it is not the same feelings or instincts that makes us say &quot;Yes this is right.&quot; or &quot;No, this is wrong.&quot;

I think you are wrong... And maybe you don't notice, but it seems to me that Psi is becoming slightly more popular over time <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />. It is not well known because it's on the fringe of science, and nothing &quot;Sprouts up overnight&quot;. Again, I am not reclusive, I am not so conservative, and I'm not quite an outcast. Another great generalization from you, that is slightly offensive. Perhaps not only to me, as well.

I do not intend this post, or any of my posts to offend you Niushirra. I only want to provide you with sufficient counter examples to show you that your logic in this argument is flawed.

Since i got into Psi, i started talking about it alot to everyone.  My friends think i'm a little weird, strangers or acquintances are rather skeptical, as they've only heard about it, but never seen it. i've gotten some people to making a psi ball for starters.  I don't think showing strangers psi is a good idea, i think actually being friends with them would be a much better idea. If i were to ever show ANYONE how to use psi, it would be my close friends.
