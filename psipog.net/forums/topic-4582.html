			children are born telepathic as well.. thats why you cant understand why they cry sometimes, but they are tying to cry out something its only in their brain since they havent learned a language. how would we communicated without language?

			Who knows? We haven't really figured out this energy and how it works, so maybe, maybe not. Although, I feel that, maybe, everytime we use psi, our bodies finds a way to adjust to it, so in my mind, our DNA may change a bit this and that, which can be transferred through children allowing them to adjust to it faster and more effecient then us, but that's just my idea, probably not anywhere able to be backed up with facts.

			I can see the genetic thing; however it would be difficult to test. I personally believe that a huge portion of what skills a child develops and so on and so forth comes from the environment they grow up in. (I vehementley oppose the notion that there is a &quot;crime&quot; gene) 
<br />

<br />
That said it seems likely to me that the child of a psion is more likely to develop some form of TK because they are growing up around those who can do it and are open to it. I would be interested to see if a child with telekinetic parents would develop the skill if the were not brought up in a household where the thing is accepted and present.

			I would think it is genetic to some extent. Since I don't know alot about genetics and the mind, I can atleast say that it seems to make sense only to the point where our brain is used to performing such things in general. Don't strong people make strong children? if two people with high IQ mated, would they make a high IQ child? givin that it's mentally healthy of course.
<br />
I would only think it's disproving when it's not the physical body that is inherited, but the mind from personal experience and spiritual development. I don't think children can inherit any of that. Does anyone have a family of people that is experienced in such a field, it is naturally given to you without any knowledge of it being there in the first place? It would be interesting to know how much of it is genetic. I would also like to be disproved.

			Ok this becomes REALLY personal to me, also there are a lot of rule breaking I do if i do say it so i wont.
<br />

<br />
I had my thoughts of psi passing through genetic brainwaves. I totaly disagree with the DNA being the information card. But I do know nerves commicate with each other often, with tells me a combind body uniform. 
<br />
Or the fact that seeing your body girl or boy (should) be on your mind. Some of that energy may travel there.
<br />

<br />
I'm not a expert pleace dont take my words serious im just a beginner. I just a wander of wonder. REALLY DONT

			Your type of thinking is called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought of the theory of evolution before Darwin but not natural selection. He said that an individual organism would have a need for something like a horse needing to eat leaves at the top of the tree. So the horse would spend it's whole life trying to stretch to eat the leaves and finally be able to do it at the end of it's life. It stretched so much that it's neck got longer. Lamarck said this trait would be passed on to its offspring. The horse's offspring would keep stretching in their lifetime too and thus a couple generations later we get the giraffe. This is obviously not true just as if you chop off your arm you will not have one arm babies. You cannot change your genetic code in your lifetime at all. Also, this is a mental trait anyway not controlled by your alleles. Genetics is the information card completely for the biological aspects of us. Proteins are directly constructed from our DNA and proteins make up everything that we are. The reason people can have children so much different from them is because of two factors. One is that heridity is much more chaotic than most people think. In meiosis there are all sorts of crazy things going on to mix up our alleles. We get a completely random half of alleles from each parents down to the single genes. The second factor is that mental traits are, I think, almost entirely made by experiences in the organisms life time. Our personaities come directly from our enviroment. This includes psi. Psi is an ability we gain from experience not biological factors. bam.

You forgot to consider that if psychic ability originated in one brain structure, or several brain structures, then abnormal sizes in these brain structures can serve as genetic fodder to be passed from one generation to another.  This one example illustrates the fundamental flaw in your argument: that you assume psychic abilities only comes from the &quot;mental realm.&quot;  Certainly psychic &quot;will&quot; is manifest mentally, but the mechanism through which it acts could very well be physiological.

			The reason a reason why this is personal to me....you see my father was a bit of a cult leader. All I will say is that he believed himself to be a prophect and have spiritual energies greater then anyone. I know of this as false. And so did my mother which toke me and my bothers away from him. Hes dead but the people he left behind are brainwashed. My mother is a computer genius in the U.S military. She had got a letters of thanking her from Clintion and Bush. Of cource she is not directly link to them, but rather a civilion worker.

<br />
If you were to take genetics greatly, you would find I have the genes of a &quot;mad genius&quot;. I highly don't see psionics pasting from genes to genes, If psinoics were to exist in a form it would exist in the human neurocellure form. After re-reading this post I thought of something I should have in the first place about babies having telepahic. I learn a while ago that a baby watches people pass him because of primitive instants. The reason why this stops is that when the brain cells of the baby grows (I forget the real number) about a millions cells a day. Some of the other nerve cells overcome the &quot;1&quot; nerve. So I came to thinking..if babies did have telepahic powers, perhaps while they mature it would be block by the ever increase of the neruocellure level?
<br />

<br />
Also....did you know the brain evolues untill the age of 25? Infact most of the body stops till then...not unlike the bones which contuine to grow till the age of 36.

My mother told me I didnt cry either, she said it was hard to tell it I wanted food or not because I didnt commicate. She told me I didnt talk much untill the age of 3. But as a boy I was a big cry baby. I was simply told if you don't cry as a baby, it catches up to you. Also that I tried to walk before I crawled. And that I was a big prefectionist, I wanted my walking to be so prefect I gone down hallways with my hand up on the wall for balance. It drove her crazy and she put me in the middle of the room. But I crawl over to the wall to walk again.

I guess its why it annoys me a lot when people drag there feet..........the haunting...the haunting of the dragging feet taunts me.....

I know the current trend of thinking here is, &quot;anyone can use psychic ability,&quot; but we don't understand how exactly psi works, how exactly it manifests from whatever physical locale in our body, and therefore we cannot accurately say that everyone is capable of such feats.  We can generalize that this is the case, but it's not a fact.  Claiming that everyone is born with the same physiological tools is a claim that doesn't have evidence to support it because we _dont_ know what those tools are.

One day we might find that oversized frontal lobes, an abnormal brain structure, could be the physiological tool necessary for psychic ability.  Then I could accurately say that I was right, and you were wrong since oversized brain structure is genetic and therefore passed from generation to generation.  However, I can't say I'm right and that you're wrong because we don't have the necessary information.  Regardless, you can't dismiss this fact.
