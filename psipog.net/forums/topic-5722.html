			No doubt this has been covered many times before so i appologise for that.

I have been doing PK for a while now after a friend introduced me to it. I haven't done it for a while with it being the summer holidays and stuff. I finaly got round to trying it again today.
<br />

<br />
Simply spinning a psiwheel, I managed with little trouble and got it spinning very fast. I thought i would be adventurous and try moving an upside down watch. I tried and tried but it didn't work. This left me with a pretty annoying head ache.
<br />

<br />
Are there any ways to relieve yourself of these kind of head aches? I remember when i first tried PK after a friend told me. I got a head ache then and my friend said 'let me try and get rid of it' ...he failed. 
<br />

<br />
Many Thanks,
<br />

			Just relax and drink some water.

That's the only way to recover from a headache without a chance of causing more problems.

			choose what you like or do them all , it is up to you.
<br />

<br />
1- try to forget the headache and try to be busy but not busy with mental work because it will increase the headache .
<br />

<br />
2- eat and drick something you like and want it .
<br />

<br />
3- think about something out side your body , i mean change your will or look at something and think about it little then try to remember something that make you happy after you become happy change your will or your thinking to your brain because you there have headaches and go on calling the happy things that make you happy and your headache will be removed , at least it will be removed for some little while if you did not succed.
