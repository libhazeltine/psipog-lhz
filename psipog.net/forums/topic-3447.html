			Ive been working with telepathy recently... so far i could ping people and make them notice me even without talking... now my problem is... scanning... I've been practicing scanning... where I would let my energy on my forhead reached out to their minds... what I experienced is that, it's like my consciousness likewise followed as I extend my energy and when I visualized entering someones mind I could fairly see pictures and some random visions but no words or that of anykind... I couldnt hear anything... is there a problem with what I'm doing? and also is that ok for scanning? the procedure that is.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I just have doubts whether I am doing it right that's all...

			yes, that sounds fine.  the reason you may be picking up pictures, is that different people have different ways of recieving the information, and pictures may be the easiest for your brain to understand.  now, don't get me wrong, you won't always see pictures when you scan, but for starting off you may.  you just have to train your brain to find words and to listen.  i would delve a bit deeper, but telepathy isn't my forte'.
<br />

<br />
another method for scanning is the &quot;sonar&quot; method.  just send out your energy, much like your doing now, but instead of leaving it there, make it bounce back to you and relay information.  i use this method, and i think it works quite well.

			thank you for the reply... it help me feel better a lot. So my scanning technique is fine, so Ill just continue on doing it. and for other information like words and sounds, maybe it'll come later. I guess with practice it'll eventually come. Thanks that's all I need to know..

			btw I have another question, would it increase my telepathic skill if I gave time on increasing my psi energy, I mean like taking an hour or two to focus and increase the energy on my forehead. Would it help to increase telepathy?

<br />
I don't recommend focusing lots of energy on your forehead - we have no evidence to demonstrate what part of the brain, or even the body, is responsible for telepathy - we could do it through our skin. Focusing energy in any area of your brain is somewhat risky as it carries the chance of disrupting neuroelectrical activity.
<br />

<br />
As far as psi workings influencing it, I'm unsure there, too...there's little evidence that telepathy works along the same pathways and channels as normal psi workings - shields do seem to influence telepathy, but so do power plants. Also, typical psionic shields don't seem capable of blocking telepathic intrusion or reception, instead it requires some specialized programming.

I don't have much evidence that it would...it might, in the whole &quot;mental arts&quot; gestalt help out, but I don't have much evidence that telepathy is directly related to energy work. You can hack telepathy with energy, though.

			While scanning, pulling and probing information I usually receive in pure thought.  It can be described as your own thoughts before they are formulated into words.  I can't speak for other people as I have heard this is not the way everyone receives.
<br />

<br />
The problem arises separating your thoughts from your targets...no-thought trance helps this tremendously.

			yah Ive experienced that I have been having that problem lately, on how you could distinguish and separate your own thoughts and theirs. It's like I got this thoughts in my head and i thought that it is mine but when suddenly the other person spoke of it, it wasnt mine at all. I was just having problem on separating thoughts on scanning.

			man, on that topic, it took me a long while to separate my emotions with others, but if you learn how to control and be balanced, anything is almost possible.
<br />

<br />
question:
<br />

<br />
like i could heal through water and it enhances my empathic abilities too but is it possible that i can move it. i've tried and it didn't work because i was currently in a spiritual battle with a demon of mine. it seems possible but impossible?

			ei Droshi, your non-thought trance worked for me, thanks. I was trying to calm my mind and put it into silence. As I practiced receiving TP i got a hard time lowering the voice that seems to go on and on, i thought it was mine. then suddenly I realized, it was my neighbor's, I even got a glimpse of whom the thought came from, and when I went out of the  house. The mental image of the guy was the same as I saw him outside. It was great, only that I still have a lot more practice to do it again but it did helped me progress one step further. Thanks... could you suggest anything else?
