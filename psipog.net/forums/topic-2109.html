			I've been trying to perform OBE for a while, i make my body still and let it fall asleep, and keep my mind awake, but I have some problems. Sometimes my mind will fall asleep and then wake up, but I can't leave my body when my mind is awake, I feel my body asleep but how do i leave? And is there any other techniques I could try? any ways to improve what im doing?

			My post in <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=1812" target="_blank" class="postlink">this thread</a> has a lot of advice.
<br />

<br />
I'd also add one small bit:
<br />

<br />
The &quot;clear your mind and let it happen&quot; technique is pretty common. However, I see that there is a bit of a problem of semantics here. To say &quot;think about nothing&quot; is a bit inaccurate, while yet being accurate.
<br />

<br />
The trick here is that you have to think about nothing - and you <span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span> think about thinking about nothing. You'll default to the latter state, which is the problem. It's like the difference between the null charachter '' and the space ' ' in programming - they're bothing &quot;nothing&quot;, but one is more &quot;nothing&quot; than the other.
<br />

<br />
The good part is that if you don't understand this, you can probably come to understand it. Next time you try to have an OBE, lay down, calm your body, do whatever you need to do. Then lay there and think about nothing - or as I'd put it, think about thinking about nothing. Consciously clear your mind and don't let any thoughts in. This is difficult to do; took me several weeks of practice just to get this part down. Now hold that for as long as you can. If thoughts start to creep in, mute them; ask your subconscious nicely to help.
<br />

<br />
Now do this every night. It doesn't require any extra time. When you lay down to go to bed, lay in a comfortable position (use the same position every time), go through whatever relaxation exercises relax your body, and lay there and consciously think of nothing. Eventually, one of those nights, you'll slip into actually thinking of nothing - and a sufficiently deep trance state that you'll start getting those annoying hypnagogic hallucinations (voices, noises, etc.). You will of course wake completely up once you get the first strange noise, but you've taken the first step toward OBE. And you'll see what I'm talking about.

			Hmm. Perhaps try a breathing exercise before attempting to OBE.
<br />

<br />
Do this:
<br />

<br />
-Lay down. Do whatever you need to do to get comfortable. I generally allow myself 1-2 minutes to do whatever needs to be done to get comfortable - adjust sheets, adjust position, scratch, cough, get up and turn the fan down so it doesn't clatter, etc. The important part is that after this time you are completely comfortable.
<br />

<br />
-State firmly and clearly in your mind that you intend to have an OBE. Keep that idea fixed in your mind for several seconds. The idea is to get it impressed into your subconscious so you don't have to do as much of whatever conscious exit technique you may want to use, or even don't have to use a conscious exit technique at all.
<br />

<br />
-I personally also visualize a simple symbol that I have chosen to represent the intention to OBE. This is sort of like Pavlov's dog: it is a signal to your body and subconscious mind to get into &quot;OBE mode&quot;, a trigger of sorts. If this sounds too mystical/magical/idiotic/distracting to you, skip it. (It's not at all mystical, by the way - it's psychology at work.)
<br />

<br />
-Lay still for a few moments until your mind is more or less clear of thoughts. Now take a slow, deep breath in and mentally count &quot;one&quot;. Keep it in for whatever amount of time is comfortable, then exhale slowly and deeply and mentally count &quot;two&quot;. Breathe in again and count &quot;three&quot;. Exhale and count &quot;four&quot;. Ignore everything else. Put your focus in the breathing. There is nothing but the breathing. Do this until you get to 50.
<br />

<br />
-When you breathe out and count &quot;fifty&quot;, breathe in again normally, but don't count. However, don't start thinking about or focusing on anything else. This is the &quot;nothingness&quot; state that you want to be in.  This won't work the first time, by the way: you'll start thinking by trying to remember what to do next. However, once you remember, you'll already be relaxed enough that you could probably breathe for another ten counts and then stop counting and hold the nothingness for a little while longer.
<br />

<br />
Hope this helps. Let me know if you want any more clarifications or suggestions.
