			I'll try to put it plain and simple.
<br />

<br />
Has anyone ever tried blindfolding him- or herself in an attempt to shut one of your more &quot;common&quot; senses down?
<br />

<br />
I've been thinking of an experiment; Spending a lengthy amount of time being blindfolded. Try and experience new sensations. Improving my focus on my mind.
<br />

<br />
Just closing my eyes doesn't work too well for me.

			I REALLY thought of doing this, I really wanted to try and get ear plugs, blindfold, and walk around to see if I can only use this 6th sense, so to speak. I wouldn't know what to call it.. third eye? It fires up if I try to see things when I close my eyes <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I have personally never done that. Though one of my trainers, (perhaps you know him: Roy Martina) has spent half a year of his life blindfolded. It was an assignment he got from one of his jiujitsu teachers. He said that he experienced and has learned ALOT in those six months. I can only imagine you become extraordinairily sensitive.
<br />

<br />
I have been thinking of attending one of Mantak Chia's Darkness retreats. You can choose between 1, 2 3 or 4 weeks in total darkness. Its a facility where they guide you through meditation and where you get on a healthy diet in total darkness. When you get blindfolded, there is still alot of light that reaches your retina and your visual cortex. But in this facility, there is no light whatsoever. When one stays in total darkness for a longer period of time, your brains produce a hell alot of melatonin and some other hormones. Your Crystal palace, (center of the head, including the four important glands: Pineal Glad, pituitary gland, thalamus, and hypothalamus if I am correct) will be flodd with melatonin. the first couple of days in this total darkness your body and mind will come to total rest. All the sleep you missed over the past couple of months/years will be yours to catch up. Aftyer those couple of first days, they say, you can sleep for 3 hours, and it will seem like you slept 12 hours. So you need less sleep also. After a day or 6 or so, you start to have visions of past and future and you will be able to see Ultraviolet. You can see someone acros the room in total darkness. There are some other cool feats to attain after a longer time in total darkness. It seems to be a short cut to enlightenment or something along those lines. They say everyone who comes out is spiritually way mor advanced then alot of people are in 10 years of practice.

			i had wondered about this but i started to think in is better not to and to use my senses when in meditation, to use my hearing to focus it to any one sound and focus only on that, and then shut out my hearing and focus on my sense of touch and so one. it took me time but it works for me.

			Is there any damage that is known to occur to your eyes from having them deprived of light for so long?  My thoughts were always that if your body doesn't use something for long enough it may permanently &quot;turn it off&quot; so to speak.
<br />

<br />
Not that I'm really asking for medical advice, but I was just wondering if anyone has heard from anywhere reputable about that.  I will do some research and post what I find here as well.

			i may not be a doctor but i'm pretty sure you would have to go for a very long time before your eyes would deteriorate, but after a hour or so your eyes would probably hurt but thats all.

			back in 1998, I had a rare disease that affected my nerve system totally. I was completely blind for about 2 weeks and then 20/50 vision for years but now my vision is at 20/15 so shortterm blindness probebly won't really hurt your eyes, it'll just be ultra sensitive to any light source for awhile.

			I would find it a great idea since, you don't know what you truly see until.. poof, you don't see anything for weeks. This would go along with the other senses. If you went deaf for months, you would most likely savor hearing alot more, touch would be a weird thing to deprive yourself from...

			been a while, but I'd like to say something on this. I did a little test with a few friends, and I discovered that if you use noise cancelling earplugs, sunglass swimming goggles painted over in black and duct taped over, a blindfold over the goggles, and earmuffs over the plugs, your pretty much set for sensory deprevation. The only thing you feel is your breathing and your own voice (vibrations). Been testing that a bit and I can say it's been fun.

			I've never gone in for sensory deprivation (though I do close my eyes during telepathy practise).  However, this idea is being used very successfully in the scientific world for testing ESP.  It is called 'Ganzfeld' (A German word meaning 'whole field').  The eyes have halved ping-pong balls on top of cotton wool taped over them, a red light is shone on the ping-pong balls, 'white' noise is played through headphones and the subject lies on a comfortably-angled chair.  Someone in another room then sends a set of images and the subject speaks out loud all the thoughts that enter their head.  At the end of the sending period, the subject is brought out of sensory deprivation and shown a series of pictures, including the ones sent, and is asked to identify any (s)he saw.  The results of the identification and the content of the subject's thoughs are analysed to see if there is any correlation.
<br />

<br />
Incidentally (though I can't remember where I read this) musicians score on average 50% higher than non-musicians in Ganzfeld testing.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
