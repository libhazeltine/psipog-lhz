I visualized a link between us and pictured the words going through the tube telling him what to do. After a few minutes he came! He said he came to the library and said I wasn't there so he went to his class. This is where it gets weird. He said after being in class for a while he felt a random impulse to go to the library probably around the time I sent the message!</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Sounds like pinging or just normal telepathy.

Stop talking about TS.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

That doesn't make sense. . He didn't say anything about hearing me telling him to go there.
<br />
And by the way, you can't stop me from talking about TS (not against the rules as far as I can remember). And about the bank robbery it was an experiment that the teller didn't know about. It happened in Russia. I think Joseph Stalin put the telepath up to it (Stalin scared the crap out of him when he pulled up next to him in a car telling him to get in). Here are the details: Stalin tells the psychic to steal a certain amount of money from the bank by using a blank piece of paper as a check! He commands the teller to believe it's a check and the teller gives him the money. The psychic comes back later, gives him the money, and shows him the piece of paper he passed off as a check, then the old teller gets a heart attack but still lives. They also performed other experiments. To Apollo: I guess I agree that it was more of suggestion than commanding. And I didn't mean to hint at warfare. I just wanted at least one person's opinion on the occurrence.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

&quot;I mentally SUGGESTED that he go to the library.&quot;

Yeah, no shit Sherlock, that's telepathic suggestion.
<br />

<br />
&quot;And by the way, you can't stop me from talking about TS (not against the rules as far as I can remember). &quot;

Um, yes I can.  And yes, it is against the rules.

That experiment you described involves Wolf Messing, perhaps the world's greatest telepath.

			that is of course if you see TPS as sort of a mind control which it really isnt. I mean think about it. The person does have the choice not to obey. People disobey surface thoughts like that all the time. Its not like they are &quot;forced&quot; thus the S for suggestion.

			Alright, I'm going to put it down for you all here and then I'm going to lock this thread.

<br />
Telepathic suggestion is the use of telepathy to persuade a person, below their level of awareness, to perform some action or think some thought.
<br />

<br />
Since it is below their level of awareness, then there is a very strong argument that it is a combative technique, despite whether or not you think it's a gentle persuasion or a forceful push.
<br />

<br />
The magnitude of telepathic suggestion's effect is determined by the natural or developed defenses (shielding) on behalf of the person being telepathically influenced.  Therefore, telepathic suggestion is an act that PROVOKES THE DEFENSE of the person it is being used on, and therefore it is a combative technique.
<br />

<br />
Take a hint.
