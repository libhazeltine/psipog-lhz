			im not sure if this is the right section... mods feel free to do your thing.

ive been wondering. lately, ive got back into practicing psi, but ive noticed something. ive never been able to get past the basic psi ball, and even then, i am only aware of it when it is in contact with me.
<br />

<br />
ive realised something now. when i thought i was directing psi out of my body and in between my hands, i thought i could feel it forming in the ball shape, and could feel it on my hands. but ive discovered that im not actually directing psi outside my body at all. im directing energy into my hands, but its never leaving my skin. the only way ive been able to direct energy outside of me is by storing it in an inanimate object (and im still not sure about that)
<br />

<br />
thats got my thinking. without trying to sound stupid, ive always had above average control of my body functions. (not going to the toilet!) i can make myself feel hot or cold. i can also simulate the effects of adrenaline, by working myself up mentally, i can pump myself up to beyond my normal physical levels. i can also make parts of me go numb, or possibly more sensitive than normal.
<br />

<br />
so, without me waffling, i was wondering. is there anyone else out there who only seems able to work with certain kinds of psi (if it is even psi im talking about in this case)
<br />

<br />
interested in your responses, and also wondering if any of you guys could give me any advice for working with energy directly outside of my body (id particularly like to get the hang of PK and TK)
<br />

<br />
thanks for your time.
