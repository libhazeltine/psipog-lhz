			Oh my ...never mind... People if you don't like what people are saying about religion then just ignore it... Is that so hard? It's not like he's saying everyone needs to believe in Jesus. He just simply described what works for him. Go ahead and say what works for you wether it has to do with your religion or not. Obviously this thread is being locked anyways... I mean come on. If something on the internet offends you get over it. What works for them is not going to affect you in YOUR life so just get over it. Is that so hard? Heck just ignore this too if you want.

			Most people call this an incubus, which is basically a fancy word that means pressure on the chest, and it's nothing but a creation of your own psyche in the dream state. It's completely under your control. What your feeling is not physical, it's psychological, which explains why it diminished with you will. From now on, if the feeling attacks you in a dream or you have frightening sleep paralysis, just remember; it's a dream, it's not real, and there's nothing it can do to hurt you.

Ya all of these experiences sound like they are just hallucinations. Whether it is yourself or someone else causing these hallucinations, they are <span style="font-style: italic">still </span>hallucinations. All you have to do is cast them aside and ot allow them to 'take hold', if you know what I mean. 
<br />

<br />
I know a lot of this is sounding a bit fluffy, but anything is going to sound fluffy if there's no evidence. For those of you who are skeptical of these experiences, I think you just need to realize that a) there really isn't much way for them to prove the phenomenon anyway (and get over it) and b) stay a skeptic, but keep an open-mind.

			The reason I made this thread wasnt to figure out a way to &quot;Fight this off&quot; or whatever. It hasnt caused me any harm, so thats not my concern.
<br />
The reason I made this thread is because I wanted to see if I could find out for sure WHAT it was, be it simply a sleep disorder type thing, or something more in depth.
<br />
And what prompted me to make a thread this time around was the screams moreso than the presence. Every time in the past there has been no sound associated with it, but this time there were eerie screams and I did NOT expect them.

			No actually incubus does not mean pressure on chest. It is the male orientation of a creature that rapes you in the night, sucubus is the female one that rapes you in the night. Originally they were legends to explain the occurence of wet dreams but this pressure on chest phenomenon does actually exist. There are several well known similar descriptions of things that rape you in the night, although this one doesn't seem to rape you. A description of one is called the green ogre, which puts an enormous heavy feeling on your chest and however hard you try it doesn't seem to come off, also noted is the fact that you can't hear yourself if you scream, you are basically in a dulled senses state. People who have been raped by this creature state it has grey hair and a scaly green surface. Also it is noted that if you don't believe that it exists than it comes and rapes you. Although not all forms of these pressure on chest creatures or whatever seem to rape you there are some that actually just seem to drain your life force, namely one woman who believed her house was haunted opened her eyes before some spirit like substance attacked her with fangs. Once again there was a feeling that it's intent was to suck or drain life force from her. The most famous incident that I recall was the one on some island in the caribbean. It occured when a creature began to mass rape several men in the night and warned each man that was a victim that if they did not spread news about him and claim that he was raped than he would come back for them. The creature was actually believed to be male was described to have wings, a large single eye in the center of the forehead, and a dwarflike body. Victims of rape could not see nor could they really be aware of what was going on. They could hear the creature speak to them but they could not hear their own voice nor could they do anything about the raping. Interestingly enough other members of the family could easily hear of the rape and they also saw the creature fly through the window and begin to rape, the entire rape scene was also clearly visible to all spectators and they could easily see and hear and percieve the creature as it continued it's work on the chest of the man, after when it was done it would fly away. When the family of the victim saw the creature they would immediately start screaming that the creature was at there house and dozens of neighbours would come watch the scene and try to help but to no avail.
