			Hey folks im 21 years old and I just recently started to try Telekinesis, and im trying to move a pop top thing off of a POP CAN that i have laying on my desk..now im wondering about a few things!
<br />

<br />
Ok when im trying to move this, i feel like a pressure inside my head and my right palm--the hand that i use--almost like something wants to jump out or something..I get this feeling and it intenses to where my arm will shake and my mind gets like more &quot;Pressurerised&quot;... In the end nothing happens..
<br />

<br />
I'm wondering what this might be, because today i got my first headache from it..I'm wondering If im trying to hard or if its a normal thing during the process of learning.
<br />

<br />
Also what can i do to better myself and maybe seem some results?
<br />

<br />
thanks
<br />

			Well those are normal feelings whilst doing psychokinesis, but one thing to fathom and for the sake of confidence building is are you starting to big? The psiwheel is a great tool because it builds confidence as well as light training (Light depending on how skilled you are).
<br />

<br />
Also patience, for most it takes a good while before something happens, you have to have patience and meditate on what you've done in your sessions. Usually once you've achieved to move something or hit your goal slightly your own drive will give you a second wind to get the rest done, remember once you've done it a few times it starts to become rudimentary.

			I agree with Shadow wolf but I also want to add a few things.  First of all, you said your palm hurts on the &quot;hand you use.&quot;  Most people seem to think that you need hands to move in object.  You dont.  I am not saying that you cant use your hands but dont become relient on it.  Also, the pressure might be you overworking you psi muscles or it could be that you are trying to hard to slide/move/spin the object.  Let it happen naturally. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I'm no expert, but whenever I do really successful PK it's kind of instinctual. If it feels forced to me it doesn't really work, but that's just how it works for me. I do agree with shadowWolfx that you're starting to large. I began practicing PK with scraps of paper, moving them across the surface of some water.
