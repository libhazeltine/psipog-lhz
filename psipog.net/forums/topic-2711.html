			erm, there's no option on the pole for &quot;havn't the foggiest&quot;. I havn't actually gone on it yet, so I don't know, but I can imagine the havoc that can arise from it. The thing about this is that some people will love it and some will hate it completely, and then the ones that don't give a shit. If it goes, people will be pissed becasue it makes it harder to commmunicate with people off psipog, but if it stays, certain characters will probably pollute it somehow.

			Hmm well let's see.  Since you (Nahilouh) are the douche who was in Gabbly impersonating me, then I guess you fall under your own definition of &quot;idiot&quot;.  I was debating just banning you, but I think a better solution would be to put a bigger warning on the home page.  Also, I'll obviously eventually remove the gabbly link, but I'm going to keep it for a little longer until more idiots like you finally push it over the edge and force me to remove it.  Thanks for being one of the few who will ruin it for everyone else!

			I can?t really see it being any use at all, with the amount of trolls and fluff bunnies around.  If it could be moderated, then it would be a good idea?. But why not use the regular IRC chat?  Isn?t that what its there for?

			I said no. Hey, if you don't like it on Gabbly don't go on Gabbly. I personally like it. I thought our forum would be one of the most well behaved since we are all quite mature. A little of immaturity dosen't harm anyone (ehh, maybe a bit). I think it is great...it can't destroy the website, because technically, it isn't part of the website...more like an attachment to it. And if people are being meanies to each other on there...let me please ask you to be kind and considerate and follow the same rules on this website (forum).
