What I get from this is that your not supposed to become 5, but do what he did by changing your cells that exist now into pure energy that did not exist before you were 5 years old. I could be wrong, but when I read that, thats what I felt.
<br />
As for gaining enough psi, well you could try something I learned a few yrs ago. What I did was lean against something out in the sun then I asorbed the sun's energy and I kept asorbing untill I saw a bright light under my closed eyelids, thats when I knew I had enough. Just visualize pure energy, from something relatively high, in energy being drawn into your body or your body sucking it up. Well I hope that helps you out a bit, as far as I know no one has done this, but I could be wrong. I would like to see the results myself as well.

			About the absorbing the sun's energy idea.  It's snowing here lol.  So I can't really do that.  Right now, i'm using the earth's electromagnetic field to talk to the other me.  So, no psi is being used there, at least, not my own.

Hyper is good  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> , but unfortunately I don't go to a regular school.  I go to an online school, but I don't think i'll need to go to a physical school to absorb the energy.  I live in the suburbs, so it should be easy enough.

weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!  Sorry about that.  I'm feeling quite random today.

			Oh and cells die all the time, so you probably don't have the same cells you had when you were 5. Unless you mean certain brain cells.

Why dont you go to a regular school with regular kids?

			At least where I live, a lot of crap happens in the regular school that my mom and dad do not want me exposed to, and of course I don't have the same cells as when I was 5.  I don't think I implied that in my post, or at least I didn't mean to if I did.  I know cells die all the time and are replaced by new cells, and I know that brain cells do not normally die under normal circumstances.  I believe the process would go as the following: Most of my cells would become pure energy,
<br />
Other cells would become either pure energy or or stay as they are and reassimilate in either case.  The end result would be me looking and feeling like I was five years old, but I'll still be the age I am now, just with a whole lot more energy to deal with (possibly some kind of outcome unknown at this point?).  Right now, i'm trying to refine a method of maintaining my current Memories in the process (as well as still biding psi).

			I do have a social life.  I have numerous friends whome I met when I did go to public school.  I guess I forgot to mention that I did go to public school up through 2nd grade.  I've maintained friendships since then.  I met my best friend while I was in kindergarten.  (He moved away about 6 years ago, I think,  and we talk through im now.)  And I have some friends through my online school as well.  Before last year, I was home schooled, and what most people do not know is that there are gatherings of home schoolers that people can attend.  I met several friends there.  I go to church (sorry to bring up a religious subject, but it is part of my social life).  I am a Boy Scout as well, and I am going to a physical school next year.

			Usually when cells die, they're disassembled into the organic chemicals that made em in the first place (usually a load of amino acids, and the components of DNA - ATCG sugars, deoxyribose, some phosphorous) by the bodies various enzymes. Sorry <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> I don't think they turn into pure energy just yet.

			hmm... that 5 year old version of yourself sounds a lot like Viet XD no, Viet is not a past/future self, he's a spirit, he knows a lot, but he never tells anything until it is either absolutelly neccissary for me to know, or i've already figured it out and he's answering if i'm right about it.

<br />
oh, btw, due to your discription, it seems he would only know what it would be plausable for you to learn in the future. with all the branches, he probrably knows a whole hell of a lot of stuff, but not everything. be sure not to rely on his knowledge to a letter, as intelligence does not automatically mean he is without mistake.
