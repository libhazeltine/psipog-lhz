			I've been a pretty active member of the PsiPog community for around 5 years now, and it's a real blow to me that the site is coming down. But I read Sean's blog and I understand why it needs to happen. I've made some pretty good friends on this site, and hopefully I'll be able to keep in touch with them, but if not, I'll still have the five years I spent at Pog. I can also say through my experience, that most of my learning was done through carefully reading and following articles, which will be staying in the archive. There are also tons of different, good sites for both beginners and those a little more advanced. PsiOnline is very good, and I enjoy the things that the Guild brings out for the most part. While I will miss Psipog, it is a good opportunity for new and old members to expand their horizons and find new places and ways to learn. Who knows, maybe some old Poggers will find some places fit them better than Pog did.

			As much as I would hate to see psipog go i cant disagree with peebrain. He has his reasons and he feels what he is doing is right. Trust me psipog has been my virtual home for the past few months and Im just as upset about it shutting down as anyone but we have to respect peebrain's decision.

WOW.  Let me say that again.  WOW.  I skimmed through a lot of these posts, and I am shocked at how attatched (sp) you all are to this site.  No offense, but, just move on and stop crying over spilt milk.  Peebrain is doing what is best for him, what interests him, what <span style="font-style: italic">inspires</span> him.  He created this site through inspiration and seeking the truth of psionics.  Now that he found the truth, he has a new inspiration, and it is selfish to try to make him stray away from that.  
<br />

<br />
Like he said, this site has been without forums for around 6 years or so, and a lot of the &quot;advanced&quot; people here didn't have forums to become &quot;advanced.&quot;  You don't need the forums to continue your psionic journey.  Believe in yourself.   All the information on the main site will still be there for you to study.  That is all you need to get better.  If you absolutely have to have forums, do what 90% of us are saying, and join another forum.  There are plenty of great forums out there, you just have to look.  Apollo has already mentioned a few.  
<br />

<br />
Am I sad that this site is &quot;closing?&quot; Yes.  Do I absolutely need the interactive parts of the site to continue?  Of course not.  <span style="font-style: italic">You already have all the tools neccessary to get better, you just need to believe in yourself.</span>  
<br />

<br />
This isn't the end of psionics my friends, this is just a small bump in the road.  Don't be discouraged by the bump, simply go over it.  Once you clear the bump, everything will be fine.  Please stop this &quot;rebelling.&quot;  To be honest, it is immature, and a bit pathetic  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />   Sorry, but it's the truth.  We all know that Pog will be missed, and we all are a little sad.  But we need to move on as well.  You have forgotten you goal, which is understanding/accomplish/controling/getting better at psionics.  Not getting attached to a website.  Yes, Peebrain was a good teacher, but there are plenty out there that are just as good, and will suit your needs.  This is just like when you pass onto the next grade (in school) and get new teachers.  They will (might?) be missed, but it isn't the end of your education, and it certainly isn't the end of your life.

Though I hate to see this site go down because it's one of my favourites and I learned a lot from it and for that I am grateful. And I'm sure I'm not alone on this one.

			Nightshade, I agree.  I was a bit shocked myself when I felt like writing my long post in 'the end of Psipog', but having written it and got it out of my system I can move on now, and I fully support Peebrain in his decision.  Maybe it's the same for other people here.  Sometimes showing the fact you are upset about things is OK and necessary.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
