			I recently saw the movie Silent Hill, I thought it was pretty darn good and kept true to the game, even explaining some things the game did not. I'd have to still say the freakiest part of that movie, to me atleast, was the first time the darkness came when she was chasing after Sharon.
<br />

<br />
All in all a pretty good movie, though after talking with a few of my friends it seems some of them really didn't get the end fully and with that extent the begining of the movie either. If you honestly didn't understand it send me a PM and i'll give you the low down, but I dont want to spoil the movie for those who havent seen it, but I will tell them this, pyramid heads are just as scary in the movie as they are in the game.
<br />

<br />
For those who only got a jist look at these factors, the school when it was in the darkness and the husband was there, the start when she woke up remember all the details of the car and motorcycle (damage), also the end when they ended the movie at the scene of the drive way. A side note, it takes a little biblical knowledge to fully understand the ending, if you couldn't tell zealous religion was a big plot point of the story.

I saw alot of reviews and most of them say that it sucked crap, because they had no idea what was going on, and others that have said they had to think about it alot before they got it.. they hated it.
<br />
I love movies that make you think far after you watched it. It makes you watch it the second time just to get it all down.  I hated it when most people I know thought it sucked -.-

Oh god...There is a bad memory, I saw that 'movie' too... Though, trust me, this game movie was awesome, the extent of how accurate it was and the things they changed to make it actually work with Silent Hill 2 (1 and 2 originally didnt sequal well at all). It breaks the fad of bad game movies.
