			I know i am not one to normally do this but i just got a video from someone who i really trust and it is freakin awesome.  Spoon bending.  At the beginning, it is meant to show that it is a real spoon.  Anyway, here it is:

I was absolutly sure it was fake untill the soft spoon and breaking part at the end.  THe first part looked exactly like the magic trick you buy from the store, except your suposed to hold it concave down and it didn't bend exactly the right way, but it looks like the magic trick kidna.  Idk about the end...coulda been the trick where you bend it over and over and over, but that doesn't exactly explain the spontanious breaking.

			If it's real, then why does he have another video there called &quot;magic&quot;, which clearly shows a magic trick? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK25KL8UqLk" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK25KL8UqLk</a> I've looked at other, fake, spoon bending videos there, and they look similar. Since he's a magician, it would make sense if the video is fake...

			Another thing that is a little suspiscous is that keywords such as &quot;mentalism&quot; (which is about performing fake psychic tricks) and the name of mentalists are used as a description of the video. Of course it may still be real, but except from the fact that Apollo trusts the person who made the video, not much points to it being real, IMO.

What made you think it was real? Magicians can easily fake PK.

			I personally say it's fake, look at it this way, it may appear real, but try playing the video at ultra low speeds. The trick that he was using was friction by rubbing his fingers very minutely and fast along the spoon. Also the type of spoon that he was using is a very cheap steel alloy that doesn't hold up worth a damn in anykind of heat. 
<br />

<br />
As for the tip breaking off, in the video it shows as when it bends he wiggles it back and forth with force which greatly weakened the metal structure, his fingers were close to that weakened spot and when he heated it up, by shaking it back and forth while in the weakened state and friction still being applied, perfectly natural for it to have broken off. 
<br />

<br />
Sorry to bust your apple Appolo, but sometimes requires common sense on material types and movement types. Also the placement of the spoon was pretty much a dead give away, if I was going to do a spoon bending video I would be holding the spoon between two finger tips at the base of the handle. Thus that would not allow for any doubt at all unless get into the doctoring of these things.
