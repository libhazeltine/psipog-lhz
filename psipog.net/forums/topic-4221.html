			The other day I was at my last day of school and me and my friend were playing a game of Mastermind. It was my first time playing, too. So I had no skill whatsoever in playing this game. Let me start off by explaining what Mastermind is.
<br />

<br />
There are 2 people playing at once. The &quot;Mastermind&quot; is to put 4 colored plastic balls into 4 little ball platforms in a place blocked off from the Guesser's eyes. The &quot;Guesser&quot; tries to guess the exact colors, position and order of the Mastermind's set of balls. Anyway, I'm too lazy right now to explain it, it's like 12:13 AM right now I'm so tired.
<br />

<br />
Now looking into my friend's eyes, I tried very hard to read his mind before I made my first guess. I don't think my friend knew I was trying to read his mind, but I think he thought I was looking for a reflection of his set of balls. Haha I'm not that low.
<br />

<br />
My first guess was 1 ball off. Which means I guessed THREE out of FOUR correctly colored and positioned balls. &quot;Youre off to a great start,&quot; he says. On my second guess, I beat it. I beat the game on my second guess on my first time ever.
<br />

<br />
Is this a case of mind reading/telepathy or this just coincedence?
<br />

<br />
Thank you, I gotta go.
<br />

<br />
Serge

			You would need to do it more than 2 times to get an idea of whether its a coincidence, or telepathy. Larger sample size basically.

Or I might be wrong about you, maybe you just want to help your fellow psions ^_^.

If i know of some information on a topic of some kind that somebody wants help on, i feel guilty if i dont respond to it, and most of my posts went into the games they play in the general discussion forum, like 'the user above you is in jail', 'continue the story thread', and many others. I doi not spam, my information is useul and you know it  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
EDIT: I also very bored sometimes, and since im totally into psionics, and this is my favourite website, i just come on here, and post. Yes, i dont have a life, but i enjoy it  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> , as one famous dude once said, 'you only have one life, do not waste time, proving yourself yourself to others'.
