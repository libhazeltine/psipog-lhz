			Ok my theory is, to move a car or any object that seems impossible to lift, you must overcome your beliefs in gravity, and weight, and believe everything is as light as nothing. If you can do this, you can accomplish anything.
<br />

<br />
Overtime, with people practicing on the PSI-wheel, this is what they learn, gravity and weight ect has nothing to do with TK. It is what you believe and how much u believe in it.
<br />

<br />
I think it is a proper theory that answers questions as to why tk practice = you get better.

Now that's a little farfetched, energy doesn't appear from nothing, if you can't lift a car with your hands I doubt you'll be able to lift it with your mind because you don't have enough energy to push it up with.

			There is a strong truth in what Flames is saying, and I agree. If you believe you can't spin a psiwheel, it's a fact, YOU WON'T. Confidence is everything. And just telling your sub-c that gravity doesn't exist isn't going to do jack shit. You can't erase a whole life of truth and knowledge with just a simple sentence that has a different opinion to it. You have to brainwash your mind into that. And that's what, in theory practice does. The more you see, the better you get at it. It takes time and repetition for the brain to discard all those other beliefs and stuff that people have told you. If you are bought up knowing that pk is possible, you can be really good at it first hand. If you aren't, and are bought up by skeptics, you will have a harder time doing it. Take Joet's experiment, with the girl who was blind and thought that she was doing pk on a psiwheel, when in fact she was doing it under a glass, she did it just as well simply because she belived it was not under a glass.
<br />

<br />
However, you do need <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> practice to control it. I rest my case.

God damn you people! If it was fact, all the skeptics would have never had success at all! Why can't people get that through their fucking heads?

Sure believing you can do it helps, but it's not going to solve every single fucking problem, you have to practice to achieve not blieving you will, therefor making Blief not everything.

But was the girl trying to move it harder? no.  She was moving the psiwheel at first and therefore <span style="font-style: italic">was</span> able to move it.  The problem with putting a glass over it is not belief, it is the level of stress that the person gains when they know the glass is blocking it.  Naturally, the person knows that normally when something is blocking the way, they have to &quot;push&quot; harder.  Therefore, when the glass is put over the psiwheel, they become more concious of it and trying harder.  Hence the raised difficulty level and unablility to move it.

Well your first parapraph is no proof either, because most sceptics do not fully believe that they cannot do it. They are just sceptical. The &quot;believing = truth&quot; theory, I would say, would be correct only if the person fully beliefs it with every bit of his conscious and subconscious mind. Mostly we belief something consciously, and partially subconsciously, but never fully, do we actually belief in something. 
<br />

<br />
In the same way, the sceptic who still manages to move the psi-wheel, does not belief subconsciously that he cannot do it. It is just one part of his entire mind, in most cases the rational mind, which disagrees with the fact that it is possible. So when he practices with the intention of moving the psi-wheel, he moves it.. even though consciously he doesn't belief it to be possible. 
<br />

<br />
The mind, and also the sub-conscious mind, has alot of levels. Some levels are very deep and actions and reactions and impressions that influence our lives from that level remain unnoticable. The levels at the surface are filled with impressions and conditioned ideas that <span style="font-style: italic">are</span> noticable. So we cannot fully comprehend what would be possible if all the levels of the mind fully belief in something. My best bet would be, that every ability of perception becomes possible, and almost everything in the area of projection.

			I did not say that belief was everything, although it plays a huge role. Having confidence and belief improves performance immensly when doing everyday tasks. You need practice. I said that. You need to practice to get better, but believing in it in the first place will give you a gigantic advantage. If you are raised by skeptics that always tell you that it's not possible, you will face a huge mental barrier. And going even further, if you truly, truly believed that it could not be done, do you think there will be a difference? Of course there will be. Believing <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> the first step into doing it. Just because what you conciously believe is that you can't do it, doesn't mean that your sub-c is going to mimic that. Your sub-c can make it's own decisions, do it's own thing, (mostly, almost all the of the time, what you want it to). Your sub-c can even do the laundry while you are off in a dream world. But if your sub-c doesn't believe it and has never even seen it, practice may not be the solution. I agree that both practice and belief are not the solution to everything. To suggest that either were, would be ridiculas. All I'm saying is that take for example, the people in this world who claim to have never done pk, even though they have tried for years, Peebrain even said it on the psipog website, this may be because their sub-c did not believe. The reason, I don't know. How should I?
<br />
The point is that I don't want a huge scale arguement over this. And I won't go preaching &quot;the truth&quot; style. Don't worry. We have to meet each other in the middle. We are entitled to our opinion, and crunching those of others can disrupt their beliefs. So I'm not saying anything against the perspective of practice is the key or belief is the key. I am in the middle, in my last post, I only stated what I thought on the subject. I wasn't going against anything. Neveza, was.
<br />

<br />
Just to clarify, I re-read my post and I'm sorry that I said it was fact. I was in an arguementative mood. And I take it back. I change my opinion.
<br />
And Apollo, belief is included in the experement to an extent. Your sub-c puts doubt in you that it's harder to do it. Maybe not full on belief, but it's near enough. Anyway, that was my point on that, that your mind believes/thinks that it is harder to spin it under the glass, when in fact it's not.
<br />
I'm probably gonna get so flamed for this now. *feels stupid*. (I have strong views on stuff, sorry).

			My thoughts: 
<br />
The brain is an amazing organism capable of making dreams and thoughts into reality simply by a whim. Most of us are told all our lives that we are not able to do something, because it is against others ,who are nears us, beliefs. This put a metal barriers up every time we try to do something that we were told we can't do. It was not difficult for me to understand the concepts of Psi because the subject was never brought to the table of discussion, but when I brought it up one night a year after I had started really training forreal. I was devistated mentally when my parents said that it was not possible and I was just daydreaming. I began to doubt my powers and so intern I became extremely difficult to use them. In the back of my mind my parents had planted a seed of disbeleif the flourished and inbedded itself deep within the sub-c of my mind. But is my concsious part of my mind I believed that I could do it. Belief plays a big role in my opinion. Practicing is just another way a strengthining belief in what you are doing. When a skater skates he/she continually does things that he/she knows to know it even better. He/she also does new things so that there body may get used to it and there mind may believe they can do it. Just recently a man near our town was found dead in the back of a broken icecream truck, he was repairing the truck when the doors shut and were stuck. He was found huddled in he corner with a blue face and was freezing cold. The truck was still broken when he was found. So this mans belief was so strong, that he was going to freeze that we actually froze to death. Grusome story I know, but one that supports my beliefs. Finally I believe that yes practice is a key element to being able to do something, but with belief alone you are able to do ANYTHING you desire, because we live in a universe built on rules that our mind has given power to. It is difficult to believe to such an extent the you are able to do anything you please, but it is possible.
<br />

<br />
Please don't be mad at me for stating my beliefs if they contredict your own, this is just what I believe from experiences in my own life. I respect your opinions please respect mine. Thanks for reading. -Salem
