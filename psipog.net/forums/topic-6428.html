			I am practising TK 3-4 years, moved just the wheel <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
For so long I have the feeling I can control the objects, but I fail, it's strange I can get in the object I can feel it as if it would be a part of me, i am confident in it, I believe in it and I know I have the power to move it, but it seams I miss something, because I can't move anything.
<br />
I am even thinking that i didn't moved the wheel ether, never used a container. I just dont know how to go further, I am allways visiting this page to look at new topics, some of them are a big use for me, some makes me more confident, but still no luck :/
<br />
I am aware that with time comes all and I whont stop my trainings in TK, but there are times where you have a need for new words witch gives the strengh to go on. One thing could be that I am not practising regulary, I just practise like 3-4 times in a week and so long till I get the od feeling, the feeling that I dont whant to practise more so there I just stop, it's like 1 hour or 2 with pause, but still I believe it's not in the practise time I do, but somewhere else, if it is, than tel me right away, if it's the lack of practise time, so be it.
<br />
This topic doesnt make big sense but I am asking for something whitch I cant describe, it could be some comments or words whitch gives me again the motivation.
<br />

P.S Sorry for bad speling, I am not good in English.

			Well Dayana, maybe you should just relax and just go with the flow. Kind of experiment with what works until you find what works for you and your english is fine. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			yea you need to practice, but you also need to practice on other objects, your mind is so asfixiated on the psi-wheel.  You need to start practicing other object seriously, the psi-wheel for more then like a few months is even bad enough... you need to ... bad spelling streak ... brawed your horizons.  Practice on blinds, flags, haning mobiles... all easy tasks, do it disregard the wind your breath. Imagine it is you and only you moving it.  Hopefully it can build more confidence and all for other movement from other objects!
<br />

<br />
Good luck on your psychokinetic journy.

			I practiced on lot of objects, I don't practise the wheel like 2 years.
<br />
I go with the flow and I am relaxing, just thats so vierd, so much time spend on this but no luck, used lot of techics, I really tried all, I can say for shure that I did all, but it seams there is something what I miss and what it is I have no idea.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for the replys

			hm, well, I'd have to say this like I always do.  The only successful method or universal method is the Just Do it Method.  You simply focus as hard as you can and block everything else out.  You have your intent and let it happen because it will.  
<br />

<br />
I took the SAT's and well after about 3 hrs I was very focused and my pencil started violently shaking.  I'd have to say that's because I was so focused it just started moving.  Focus is key.

When you were a baby, you became aware of your legs. That doesn't mean that you automatically knew how to walk.

			lol no, you mis-understood me, I took a very hard test and about half way through (3hrs) I was very focused and my pencil was shaking violently due to my level of focus.  1 hr a days is fine, even 45min.

			Depends if you have that mental block &quot;my head hurts after an hr.&quot;  Because it shouldn't.  I'd say practice focusing, that would benefit you more in the long run.  I think that's why most think meditation helps.
