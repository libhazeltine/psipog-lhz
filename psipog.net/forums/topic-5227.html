			Hello. I'm new here, and for those reading thid, feel free to call me kenshin, or w/e u wish.
<br />

<br />
i've just started to be intrested in the practice of psionics, and last night was my first attempt at a psiball. I 'm not asking &quot;Did i make one !?&quot; as i completely believe i did, and have no doubts. But i'm curious as to how others felt their first time(s).
<br />

<br />
Well, i began using the sensation method listed in one of peebrains articles. Except  i also drew a spiral kind of shape in both of my palms to help focus on those points.(those of you whom are fans of naruto should remember this focus exercise from the manga.)
<br />
Anyway, i proceded to  focus energy into  each palm individually, and over time i felt  my fingers being pulled inward slowly, as i visualized a ball forming. So cool, i did &quot;mini ones&quot;,As i called them.
<br />

<br />
Long story short, i eventually focused on both palms simuntaniously(type probably), and then put them together,  leading them to be pushed outward and then sucked in  before settling  forming my psiball. After this i felt light-headed, and needless to say was shocked, it was like a door was opened, cause i just felt completely  empowered for the rest of the night and couldn't even sleep until the early hours of the morning.
<br />

<br />
Has anyone else felt this before ? Just curious, nothing more. Also as a second question, would it be possible to spin an object such as a toothpick in  the palm of a hand generating a psiball ? Cause this sounds like another exercise I would like to try in due time. 
<br />

<br />
Also thank you for taking the time to read this. I really appreciate it.

			Well I've never heard that before but maybe you charged but didn't really focus it to a certain point? I'm not sure though. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			I actually heard from wingmaker's site that if you get light headed, that means you get too much energy.  I always thought it went like this:  
<br />
Light headed-full
<br />
Headaches-empty.
<br />
But that's just how it works for me. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

The Wingmakers site is largely seen as fluff on these forums, so many take what it says with a grain of salt.

			I was attempting to send more and more energy into the psiball over time, at which point I felt density increase.
<br />
so i quite possibly exhausted myself. It would make sense, especially sense it was my first time.

Not necessarily.  I just heard that they have weird &quot;-kinesis&quot; terms on that site, which many consider fluff here.  Psiwheel and psiball directions should be fine, but I am not sure.
