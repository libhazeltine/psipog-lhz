			Here I will attempt to explain to all of you how words like &quot;vitakinesis&quot; are considered fluff.
<br />

<br />
The word Psychokinesis means this:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Dictionary wrote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">The production or control of motion, especially in inanimate and remote objects, purportedly by the exercise of psychic powers.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
As you might notice, &quot;inanimate and remote objects&quot; means everything.  Therefore Psychokinesis means moving anything via psychic means.
<br />

<br />
Ok, now why not the other terms?
<br />

<br />
When you say, &quot;I can do vitakinesis&quot;, many people will laugh at you for sounding sci-fi/very unreal.  However, if you say &quot;I can heal psychically&quot;, you have eliminated 90% of the stuff that the person would laugh at.
<br />

<br />
Using the term Psychokinesis is a lot more understandable than words like geokinesis.  These are the reasons:
<br />

<br />
1) When you say &quot;I did geokinesis&quot;, what did you do geokinesis on?  A rock or dirt?  Well, then you <span style="font-style: italic">could</span> say &quot;I did geokinesis on a rock&quot;.  Well, then you have eliminated the need for the term geokinesis and so it would be better to evolve into &quot;I did psychokinesis on a rock&quot;.  When you say that, then people will know that you have moved it. 
<br />

<br />
2) Most of these terms come from sci-fi movies.  Yes, thats right.  XMen, Star Wars, Sky High, and many other movies have contributed to those terms.  People use it because they think it makes them sound cool.  And, unfortunately, when you first learn about psychokinesis, you see all these terms and believe that they are widely acceptable.  Well, thats wrong.  Some sites do allow talk like this (like here) but some do not.  If you ever wish to go to those other sites, you need to know to not use those terms.
<br />

<br />
3) When you use those terms, you lose all credibilty that you started out with.  When someone says &quot;I did aquakinesis and levetated water&quot; people's first thought is that you are lying.  How ever, if you say &quot;I did psychokinesis and levetated water&quot;, some people will still think you are lying but some will believe you and ask you for a video.
<br />

<br />
I hope from reading this post, you have thought more about using -kinesis terms.  Obviously, the choice is your on what you will use.  Just remember that some sites allow -kinesis terms and some do not.  It is a lot easier to use one way instead of changing your way every website you go to.
