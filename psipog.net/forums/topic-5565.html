what do you think? should they really take a planet off the map even though its been around for the past 76 years as a planet?

			The definition makes a lot of sense. 
<br />

<br />
The only reasons to consider Pluto a planet are sentimental. It exists in a fairly cluttered part of space. Indeed, from what I have read it is more than likely that there are bigger objects than pluto nearby that orbit. (Pluto is very visible in case you were wondering why it was singled out as the 9th planet.)
<br />

<br />
If Pluto was considered to be a planet these would have to be as well. As would many many other objects in our solar system. Initial estimates were 20 to 50 odd new objects to be considered for planet status right off the bat. These will now join Pluto as Dwarf Planets.
<br />

<br />
The planets have remained a simple list of the major bodies orbiting the sun. I think for the sake of clarity this was a solid decision. Especially when you consider the tremendous number of planets that you might find around some stars.

			I read about findings of what could be called the 10th planet. The astronomers who found it nicknamed it after Xena the warrior princess and its moon after her sidekick. The rock is much bigger then pluto, I havent look much on it recently so I don't know about the discussion on it.
<br />

<br />
I guess the real question is what makes a planet. When we thought the earth was the center, the sun was a planet. In a after time period we counted every little rock or piece of ice a planet and we had 1000s of planets in our solar system. I heard of large rocks about half the size of pluto living in the kpyler belt.
<br />

<br />
No I don't think pluto should be a planet, Xena mite be a planet.
<br />

<br />
[Edit] Take that back, im not sure when ever to call pluto a planet, Ill do some reasch and come back to you on it.
<br />

<br />
[Edit] Some reseach I already done, Think some of you like to see.
