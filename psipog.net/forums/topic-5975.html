			This is a fairly primitive method of creating a mesh of psi, but it is phenomenally useful.  Will someone else try to perfect this?
<br />

<br />
This construct can use any form of energy that does not conflict with the fundamental laws of general psi, or modify them too seriously.  It turns a continuous stream of energy into a flat mesh.  How you want to use this is up to you.  I bet it would make a hell of a shield, though I have not tried it.  I have used it to ward a room, however, and to do a number of other interesting tasks, like fixing it overhead like a tarp, and placing parabolic collectors on top of it.  It is also constructed of nothing but G, which may be part of the reason why it is not particularly efficient.  A more specifically tailored energy with an ingenious mechanism would definitely help.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, the loom is simple enough that it does not require a diagram.  I will describe a bare-bones loom, though it would be possible to make a more complex one which creates more than a single strand at a time from more than two input strands.  The basic loom is a torus of structural energy (two concentric rings, one inside the other) which has a continuous circuit of quad-compressed G moving through the torus in both directions.  The interior of the torus has two inputs connecting to one action, which connects to one output.
<br />

<br />
The action ties one input stream to one of the spinning energy circuit elements, and the other to the circuit element rotating in the opposite direction.  When this has performed a complete circle, it will have crossed itself.  It continues to do this indefinitely.  The end product of the simple loom is a braided strand of G, or whatever energies are functioning as inputs.  I have experimented with various energies, but have not gotten any notable outputs or uses for the products (yet!).
<br />

<br />
Note that this thing's continuous circuit spins at the speed of G, which I guess we have to consider as infinite since it is not constrained by the speed of light.  However, since the input strand can be considered to be infinitely long regardless of its physical length, this fact only means that you can control how fast the loom works absolutely.  You can produce a LOT of stuff in a minute, you just have to feed the energy through that fast.  I strongly suggest adding a designation detailing exactly how fast the loom works.  Changing speed changes the density of the weave, like having them really bunched up in one place and sparse in another.  Make the designation in some sort of module and you can remove it at will and replace it with a different one if you like.
<br />

<br />
If you want to make a circular fabric, you need two components.  Firstly, you put a single strand of psi through the loop, and connect it to itself at the end to make a circle.  Then you feed a second strand through the other input.  This second strand will be woven onto the circle as you feed it through the loom, so you have to keep feeding it.  This will make the circle thicker and thicker until it meets in the middle.  Then you can go in there and connect it by hand in the center, and you have yourself a fabric made of psi.
<br />

<br />
P.S. If you guys are confused, I will make a diagram and post it after this.  Just ask me.
