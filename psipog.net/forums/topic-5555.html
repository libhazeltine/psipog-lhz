			Ok I had been practicing for a while but hehehe I hadn't used hands... oops, so I put my fingers next to this blue stone I was trying to move and I think I saw it wiggle numerous times, tried to jump around in my chair and could not make it wiggle by doing so so, so it appears to be real. Anyways, when I did start using my hands I noticed that the tips of my fingers started tingleing when I put them close to the stone. Is this the sensation that I should be trying for ?

Good that you're making progress.  Wiggling seems to be the first step for most forms of macro-PK.
<br />

<br />
As for the tingling, well, it's not a sensation I've personally experienced while doing PK.  It's more something I've felt when doing energy manipulation (or at least trying to), so it could be that you're using psi to move the stone.  Or what I think is more likely is that you are simply more aware of your fingers while doing this and are merely 'feeling' them - feeling the bloodflow move, and simply being more aware of any part of your body can make it tingle.
<br />

<br />
IMHO, keep practicing, and just remember while it's okay to use your hands, try not to rely on them and the feelings in them when doing PK.  As I've read on this site and as I know from personal experience, PK really doesn't feel like anything at all... it just happens.
