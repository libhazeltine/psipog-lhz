			I have a question. Ive been pratcicing TK most of the day and like 30 minutes ago i meditated a little and then started practicing TK again. After a few minutes or more of practicing i started feeling pressure at the third eye. So is this a sign meaning i should stop and continue practicing the next day?

			Means you should stop?
<br />

<br />
Means your getting somewhere!  I emulate the pressure to get my Pk skill workin.  Works for me at least.   Chakra wise thrid eye is where pychic energy is stored, and that means your using it.  good job.
<br />

<br />
To any mod:
<br />

<br />
Is talking about chakras crossing religion?  Of what i know it isn't anylonger attached to Eastern religions, it's more of a theory now.  But idk, you tell me

any mod

Look through the threads you'll see more about it and theorys on why it happens adn the such.  Stuff about frontal lobe stuff.  I dont really know anything about that, all i know is that it works.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Chackras or whatever the fuck it's spelled, is a belief..so yeah, it's crossing it.

<br />
There isn't a proof of it..now then.

You are getting some where, just keep doing ot, drink some water and rest after a 30 minutes of practice (not including meditation).

			just to point out, i dont think of the third eye as a chakra as such (as i haven't studied chakras) bur more of a psionic receptor. like its he most sensitive spot, which you can do wonderful things with....
<br />

<br />
anyways, point being is that we all look at it different in different ways. you could class psionics as a religion, because we are a community with the common beleif and practices....
<br />

<br />
to answer the original question, usually if your using psionics, you may feel slight pressure there, or anywhere in your head. its your mind ;D

I agree with you, genjo. I don't know if there any any &quot;chakras&quot; (anyway i'll keep an open mind), and I usually feel pressure when I concentrate too much on PK, or when I'm programming constructs I never constructed before (i'm pretty new to this, anyway).

			Well yes, that's actually correct, but not in a whole. Pk would be classed as a belief, purely because of the whole believe/expect it to move thing. Also, when I get doubt in my mind (even for a split second) about my psiwheel moving, it stops.

			I get it almost all the damn time now, I don't find it annoying at all. In fact I find it nice. It feels as if the PK part of the mind is active, it wants to move something, it's alive!

Has Pk have proof beyond personal experience?  Not really, nothing famous or accepted anyway.  So why is it different for Chakras?  I beleive in them because i can see them if i try.  I have shitty aura sight, but i can see somethings and misty gooey stuff and chakras sometimes.

			Yea, activating your third eye is what makes all that stuff possible! Don't stop now! Well unless you get a headache more than you could handle. I'd tell you to take an advil or something but that would be advocating drug use  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />
