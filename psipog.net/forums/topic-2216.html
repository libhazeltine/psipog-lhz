			disclamer: bad spelling and grammer ahead!
<br />

<br />
some people have asked about my natureistic training. so i desided ill start releaseing
<br />
a small series of training helpers. we'll start of with plant training.
<br />

<br />
First, get a plant, this is easy just get something cheap from the store, dosnt have to 
<br />
be fancy, just something that can sit on your desk, or were ever you do you psi things.
<br />

<br />
ok now that you got your plant lets get started. first i want you to look at your plant,
<br />
study it, medatate on it, and keep doing so until you can feel its essence. this will take 
<br />
longer for some people. its hard to describe the feeling but you will know once you have it.
<br />

<br />
once you can do this we can start working on drawing energy on it, it will become a great
<br />
sorce of energy for you. this shouldnt be that hard, becuse by this stage you should have 
<br />
a great connection between you and your plant. pretty sure you will be able to feel this 
<br />
out of all plants instantly, you will feal a great rush of energy from just from steping
<br />
outside.
<br />

<br />
well this is just the begining stage, ill get the next stage going soon...
<br />

<br />
comments and suggestions will be greatly appreceated.

			Aw, pyro, he wants you to make friends with your fern before you rape it of it's vital energies. Doesn't your boy- or girlfriend ask for dinner and a movie before you start groping him/her? A plant is, after all, a living thing- capable of responding to stimuli. Naturistic training, from the sound of it, involves understanding nature as though it's a friend. Sure, you don't need to know a person before you love him or her. But nature isn't a whore.
<br />

<br />
If I misunderstood, berate my lack of intelligence. I crave beration.

			lol, that was probably one of the wierdest explanations of something ive ever heard, but it made sense. To tell you the truth though, ive never tried drawing energy from living things, ive only drawn energy from electronics such as my tv or an outlet to keep a shield from collapsing, or the earths core (Which is FULL of energy I might add). Why use energy from the living when theres so much non-living things to take it from?

			the resion i want you to have this relationship between you and your plant is becuse when i write part 2 (whenever i feel like makeing it) im going to tell on how to use this relationship to make the plant grow in odd ways and other things. yes plants are probablly the more boring parts of what i have but wants we get to air things are alot more interesting

			Sounds cool. I'll try it out on the plants I have to grow for Bio.

Any chance you could get the next chapter out within a week. The life of our plants are only about 30 days.

			Not if he doesn't take all of it.  I had this idea about a year ago and made the mistake of taking too much once... I didn't kill it but it got sick and died a few days later.

			well, i was thinking... 
<br />
first, as guys alredy said: i think leeching a lill sapling's energys would kill it, and it wouldn't give you much energy at all. just the hartred of all vegetal world. (i don't know if they would feel bad for the sapling but it is possible)
<br />

<br />
anyway, wouldn't it be better, in a long term basis, for you to GIVE energy to the little sapling, so it would grow better, faster, healthier and it would actually LIKE you, as you were taking care and feeding it instead of acting like a wicked energy sucker who kills lill plants just for fun. then it would grow, grow and grow, and you could plant it on your garden or somewhere, and when it woud come to a good size THEN it would have enough energy for itself and would even be able to give others (you) some of it's energy. and, as alredy said, it would be happy to help you with energy, as you cared for it for all this time.
<br />

<br />
of course, im not talking about a 30 meters high tree, as most of em take years to reach this. once you see it was alredy stabilished and strong enough, it  would share energy with you.
<br />
plus, along the years, it would become bigger and bigger and stronger , and would have much more power in it. it would be like your mate, your energy source for all you life. wouldn't it be nice???
<br />
i have the impression that trees gets more &quot;powerfull&quot; and strong as long as they grow older. don't you guys see some very very old trees and feel like: &quot;ew, this guys kick ass&quot;
<br />
well, i do ^^

<br />

<br />
why suck energy from a plant?
<br />
---when it comes to using the energy of the planet---
<br />
 only take what is required. only give what is desired. but dont be greedy or tainted youl be.   you guys know the whole half half give and take thing right? delicate balance and harmony with the world around you is essential to keeping your (beautiful?) energy levels as they are...
<br />

<br />

<br />
and what if i decided to grow you near my 'psi practice area' and leach your life.   wouldnt that be fun now   = )
<br />

<br />

<br />
but natural training is a very good idea,
<br />
itl teach you things so basic one may have overskipped them.
<br />

<br />

<br />
oh.. and by the way.. if you can 'shift' your presence to a slightly altered plane and connect to the ground.. all trees talk to eachother. the ground is their conductor. interesting eh?     (yeah im canadian)

			sorry its been forever since i got back to this, ive been relly busy and my computer died on me.
<br />

<br />
so ill try to answer some questions: so you dont relly take much energy for it but, have a relly good since with it, i almost want to say relationtionship becuse thats what it kinda feels like, once you do get a good feeling with this plant, you can get were you are able to feel it with all plants, actully most energy that i take i take from the air around me, well i dont relly take energy, lets say i want to make a psi-ball i just use the energy in the air to move to the spot were i want to psi-ball its kinda diffrent.
<br />

<br />
also about what is naturalistic trainng, its kinda new, im not saying i made it up but im just trying to relly focus on it, once you get better at it you just relly feel like you have some kinda of connection to every liveing thing, and later even non-living things, its kinda neet but can be a little overwealming sometimes
<br />

<br />
and about he sorrow feeling, um i dont know, i had that happen to me maby once or twice, that might be becuse the plant is struggleing or needs watter or something, i havent investegated much in to it
<br />

<br />
agian sorry for beaing gone for such a long time
