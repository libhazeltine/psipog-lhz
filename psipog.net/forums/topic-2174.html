			Hi i'm new here and i want to know if anyone can help me.
<br />

<br />
I have studied a lot of psionics telepathy empathy etc. But I've not noticed too much results, it's true that I can feel psiballs rudely move the psiwheel and notice emotions and things. But the practice that has had the bests results its telepathy. However, I started &quot;reading minds&quot; for two years more or less but I only can read little things and in a spontaneosly form, like who is going to call me now or what is going to tell someone. I have no control of my &quot;ability&quot; and I maked some exercicies with a friend. When he maked me questions like &quot;what its the number that i'm thinking?&quot; the results were really low. We changed the exercicies and he eventually asked me: &quot;say a number from 1 to 10 now!&quot; if i answered in more than 3 seconds the answer is invalid. But the other answers all were correct, i sayed 4 (for example) and he showed me a big 4 that was in his notebook. After that i practiced and concentrated in my mind. telepathy reads were like a fast car that cross my brain. It only stays here by a moment, they are really clear but then it gets lost, but you can distinguish them from normal thoughs.
<br />
So my question is has had anyone this problem or anyone knows how to make those telepathy thoughts to stay longer before they get mixed with normal thoughts? And also how to produce voluntarily this thoughts?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

Srry if my english is bad, but i think it's understandable  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			I pick up random stuff from people's minds <span style="font-weight: bold">all the time</span> and have to keep shields up if I want to shut it out. 
<br />

<br />
 I'm never able to shield all of it, so I always have the background noise of people's thoughts in my head, but it really is something you get used to after a while. I've been empathic/telepathic for as long as I can remember.
<br />

<br />
I do have some conscious control over my telepathy/empathy, even though I pick up random stuff all the time. I can focus in one one person and pick up their thoughs, or send to them. I used to play a game with playing cards with a friend where I would get the card she was looking at from her mind without seeing it, and had very good results with that.
<br />

<br />
I really found the telepathy manual on this site very helpful. One of the things I had a lot of trouble with for a long time was figuring out which thought and emotions were  mine and which  were'nt, and alot of that is just knowing yourself better too. 
<br />

<br />
I still have trouble with projecting when I am startled, or afraid, or angry though, and that is something I am working on currently.

			I have the same problem. I want to learn to control it, or at least learn to scan people reliably. Right now, it's pretty much &quot;my mind scans whoever it wants to scan, and I have no choice in the matter.&quot; However, I can get a better grasp on the gist of someone's thoughts if I focus my attention (not my eyes, my attention) on their head, and just relax and let it come.
<br />

<br />
Wait, maybe I just found the answer to my own problem! W00t!
