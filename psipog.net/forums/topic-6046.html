			Dude, please get videos of that. The reason why you can't move a chair isn't necissarily(sp?) because it has more dimensions. Some people can move large things but not small things. Perhaps your sub-c just doesn't want to move the chair yet.

This sounds great. I think we'd all greatly appreciate hearing about your techniques. Not just for the PK but also the meditation. (I'm very interested in that <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> )

			Well you seem to have come along way from your earlier topic. If I am correct you were having trouble just moving the psi wheel. So my only question is how did you advance so fast and what was the key for your success?

			ok that is too much to make someone believe. for what im reading you look like talk about magic lol , you go sleep and get lucid dream then you wake up and can do that all and you want us to believe that lol , tk is not magic and there are alot of things to take care of it to be good in tk , it is not easy to master tk but it is easy to learn it . you need to know the embedded energy , how to focus not to concentrate , how to produce emotion for change where to look at the object , how to controll your will and where it should be in and so on ..............  .
<br />

<br />
but you said you learned tk in egypt O.O lol im in egypt and no one talk about it and they think it is something like superman or something like gifted to rare ppl , only 1 magazin talk about man here in egypt and his family using tk and he said he and his family can move the pyramid lolz , i might believe that little because it was in the magazin but untill now they hide things because we never see that things in tv or in the news because they fear from what they dont understand.
<br />

<br />
so where are you from? egypt?
<br />

<br />
last thing lucid dreams , we all get them and i get alot of them and about doing strong tk moveing big things and so on and we wake up it is like nothing more .
<br />

<br />
you said that lucid dream unlocked your tk power to the sub-conscious and conscious mind , do you understand what you are talking about lol? that is make no sense .

			Yes, I too have had very vivid dreams about using my PK powers and when I woke up I thought it would be easier to do now, But it was still pretty much the same. Moved the same stuff as usual in the same way. (It wasn't any lucid dreams, I've only had that twice but I was partly lucid in these ones.)
<br />

<br />
Not sharing your methods because &quot;there was too much research&quot;  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  is pretty selfish and makes you sound like your telling a fairy tale. How hard is it to list sources you've read, or just describe the technique? Your as fluffy as my sidekicks mashed potatoes.

I'm not familiar with the term &quot;geisting.&quot;  Damn my noobiness.
<br />

<br />
I'm pretty sure I used to lucid dream, but I kinda lost it... but I did gain some cool abilities (at least, in my dreams).  I'm now like a superhero in my dreams.  Problem is, it usually is part of a &quot;storyline&quot; in them, and I take it for granted.
<br />

<br />
I still can barely do a thing in the waking world... psychokinesis is one of my greater goals, though.  I'm hoping to gain it via lucid dreaming, though... I'm determined to get it back.
<br />

<br />
I've had many dreams where I've been able to use PK.  It's really fun then... I want to manage it as effortlessly as I do there, but I doubt it'll ever be that easy in reality.  Heh.
