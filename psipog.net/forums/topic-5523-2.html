Same movement? I would love to see it then. And if it were to have the same movement, it still doesn't have to mean it is fake. Phoenix is from Norwegen and he has been on a norwegian forum too. You haven't heard of Phoenix? About who are we talking now then? You know him now anyway.

Jack ( <a href="http://freesailing.com/" target="_blank">http://freesailing.com/</a> ) is fake as well, in my opinion.  If something is too good to be true, it probably is.

Awesome pic of NI levitating a knife using telekinesis! This pic is really cool - go click on it now and check it out! It is 100% real.

Yes, it is the same movement.  Its the movement of a pendulum.  If you don't believe me, please try it yourself.  Obviously I have seen his video NOW otherwise I wouldn't be able to discuss it.

I suspect he doesn't screw the top down very hard, and that the jar has enough breathing room around the edge to allow the string to still affect it.  A tell-tale sign of this, is to watch how the foil ball doesn't really levitate - all Jack does is move the container AROUND the ball.  And the ball stays in one spot.  This is a red flag indicating magic trick.
<br />

<br />
And I do know about magic tricks.  I studied magic for 6 years, and focused a lot of my time on levitation tricks.  So I trust in my own sense of what is a trick and what isn't.  Not that I'm always right or anything - I'm capable of being wrong as much as any human - but I might have a sharper eye than others who see it once and flip out that it must be real.
<br />

<br />
To genjo - not sure what you're point is.  Because I believe that NI's picture is real means that I have to believe that Phoenix's video is real?  That doesn't really make sense.  I judge each situation on an individual basis.  When I watch Phoenix's video, the bullshit detector in my head goes off.
<br />

<br />
If you disagree with me, then that's fine.  Lots of people disagree with me on lots of different topics.

my point is a video is better than a picture. i beleive fully in phoenix, i and others have achieved the same types of movement using psistrings. different methods = different movements.
<br />

<br />
as you can see in that video, using the string theory is very rudementary and usually mimics hand position. true, it can be done without hand movement, but using hand movement (in my experiences) greatly hepls overcome subconcious blocks. imnot asking you to beleive this video, im just explaining why i think otherwise.
