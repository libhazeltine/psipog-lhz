			Yeah...I'm sort of a noob at anything having to do with psi.  I saw this site about a year ago (maybe more), but never really got into it, because I was focusing 100% on Lucid Dreaming.  Well, since then, I've succeeded in my LDing skills, and now I want to move onto some higher level mind controlling.  
<br />

<br />
Because I've had Lucid Dreaming, I think it's easier for me to believe in the unbelievable, such as this stuff.  So that's no problem..  But aside from that, I do have some questions on what I should do starting out.  So hear it goes..
<br />

<br />
I've read up on psi-balls, but have never really made one because of lack of interest.  To my understanding, psi-balls are near useless and cannot even be seen.  I've tried to make one, but don't know if it was actually made (I felt heat between my hands..).  Anyways, I came to the conclusion that psi-balls are not what I am aiming for.  What I really want to do is TK/PK.  Not only would it be fun to show others, but just the idea of unlocking more functions of the mind is amazing to me.  With that said, do I have to start out small and work with psi-balls first?  Or can I go straight to the PK category?  
<br />

<br />
Also, I've searched this site pretty thoroughly, and cannot find instructions on how to make a psi-wheel.  I did find one that was in an article, but the pictures the person drew didn't make sense..lol.  I can never make mine look like the ones I see in the video.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Another thing with the psi-wheel...what should the dimensions of the square you cut out be (in inches)?  Also what is the best thing to use as the &quot;stand&quot; for the paper/foild?  I keep hearing tacks, but those are way too small to hold a piece of paper.  The paper will just hit the table..  Would a nail work?  or is that too big of a tip?  
<br />

<br />
I guess it would just be easier to ask how you guys made your psi-wheel.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Two more questions  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  Have any of you been able to move something bigger than a 3-hole-puncher?  Also is it possible to do TK in front of friends..or would they take away from your concentration..
<br />

<br />
Thanks to whoever answers some or all of my questions.  Don't bother saying &quot;use the search button&quot; because I have, and found nothing I was looking for.  Also this thread is already here, so might as well post helpful information <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I'm a noob here, but I've got a psiwheel going without making psiballs.  So, give TK a try.  For a psi wheel you need a square piece of paper folded in half diagonally both ways.  It's not going to be any easier to put into words than draw it, so perhaps ask some one else to look at the pictures and show you irl.  I' wouldn't make it more than 2 inchs square for your first.  Make sure your paper is smooth, you can also use foil.  I use a sewing needle not a tack.  It's much thiner reducing points of contact, though a pin works too.  Tacks have a wider diameter which increases the chance of the wheel dragging on it creating friction.  Move on to those once you have good spin on your small psiwheel resting on a needle.
<br />

<br />
The rest of your requests are on threads and found in most articles so I doubt you'll get more than this.  Remember, use the force  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

Time to go make a psi-wheel and get started with macro-tk!  I'll post back (maybe even with a video) once I get the hang of it.  Who knows how long that will be though..

Sorry...wasn't my intention to insult you or anything...
<br />

<br />
Anyways, back to TK, I just had success!  I've been talking with a friend online who is also in to TK, and he gave me helpful tips, including to start out with a cup over the psi-wheel (so that I won't have a mental block saying it isn't possible).
<br />

<br />
Ok, so I made the wheel itself out of foil and it was 1.5 inches by 1.5 inches.  I used a needle through a styro-phone plate as my stand.  And of course I had a clear plastic cup around the wheel so no air could affect anything.  Also all this was done on a solid floor, and I was laying down (because that felt comfortable to me).  I did test to see if the thing would move if I stomped the floor..and it didn't.
<br />

<br />
I then pushed the cup as close to one side of the wheel as possible without touching the wheel itself.  I then took my hand and got it real close to the cup (again not touching the cup or plate).  I focused real hard on one &quot;wing&quot; of the wheel, and it didn't seem to budge.  I then took my hand and moved it in the motion that I wanted the wheel to move, and it started jolting!  I can't make it spin all the way, but I can make it move just a little so that it's noticable.  I can move it left or right too!  just as long as I have my hand doing the motion.  
<br />

<br />
I don't want to sound extremely noobish..but this is fucking amazing!  My motivation and confidence just went up by like 600%.  Gotta keep doing this...
<br />

<br />
I'll post a vid as soon as I can get the wheel to spin a full 360.  
<br />

<br />
woooot!

			Ok...now I'm getting a little confused.  I don't know if it is placebo effect or what...  But I can't seem to move the thing unless my hand is right next to the cup.  So I started to think, what if it is heat that is the cause of it's moving?  So I took a match, lit it, and put it next to the cup, and sure enough it started moving.  But then, I took a stick (no heat whatsoever) and I put it next to the cup as well, and it moved!  So now I'm thinking, what if it has something to do with the &quot;personal areas&quot; of each object.  I don't know if saying each object has it's own outer shield would be the right thing..but something like that.  
<br />

<br />
OR could it be me this whole time limiting myself to only being able to be up close..

			Hey Ben, good to see you here! 
<br />

<br />
As far as the placebo goes:
<br />

<br />
From the little TK I've done, I've noticed that as well. If you honestly think something will move it, it probably will. There are a lot of different views on TK, some involving energy as the component for force, others using the just do it method. I've tried both, and the &quot;just do it&quot; gives me better results. 
<br />

<br />
As far as psi balls go:
<br />

<br />
They aren't useless, far from it. They can be used for basic versions of other advanced skills, once you learn how to program them properly. You can bounce then off of somebody and have them do a scan, or have them effect force on an object. Sometimes this route takes longer then learning the skill, because of the way programming works, but psi balls are what you make of them. Not to mention the fact that they teach the basics.
<br />

<br />
Once again, welcome!

			Once you can turn it, it will turn.  As you said, you brought a match and a stick to it, but in doing so you also brought your hand as well.  I've found that if I bring a finger to within half an inch my wheel will turn very fast from it.  Physical closeness seems to help, so however the energy being used is applied it seems at least in the begining the sub-c seems to want to exert a direct force.
<br />

<br />
If you wish to test your heat theory I would suggest you ask some one you know, who doesn't know what you are trying to do, to hold the match.
<br />

<br />
A bit on the science of using heat.  Heat goes up (or more properly the heated air above the heat rises).  Maybe a bit to the side, but mostly up.  If you held a match under it, it would heat air making it rise.  This rising air would make the wheel turn.  If you bring a match to the cup it will heat the air near the match causing it rise.  Because the match is not under the wheel, and because the cup would redirect the moving air preventing it from affecting the wheel, it was not the match that caused your psiwheel to move.
<br />

<br />
I'm sorry to have to say this, but you were actually using PK not heat.  If you want to move it using heat you'll have to put the match inside the cup and beneath the wheel.  I hope I haven't shaken your belief in heat.

<br />
Ivan, you did everything but hurt my beliefs..lol.  I'm glad that it was PK and not heat!  if it was heat then I would be much more limited for what I want to do.  But since it's PK, it seems like I am starting out in the right direction.

			Don't care if anybody doesn't care...but I need to tell somebody!  I have overcome what my problem was earlier today.  Now I can just cup my hands around the wheel and it starts moving.  I find when I make certain slow gestures, that the wheel starts going faster and faster.  I've been able to get it to spin for 10 seconds straight!  (big deal for me <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> )
<br />

<br />
So yeah, now I am really happy that I've gotten this to work in just my first day.  I remember reading not to spend too much time on it in a day, or else you get mentally exausted, and I now know what that meant..lol.  My head is starting to hurt and I'm tired.  It's just amazing though!
<br />

<br />
I also tried rolling a round pencil on a table, but had no luck.  I'm not quite sure how to go about it yet.  It's almost as if certain gestures do certain things for me..  
<br />

<br />
Anyways..back to the psi-wheel..  I had to remove the cup from the wheel and try and perform this task somewhere in my house that has 0 movement in the air (my closet...lol).  Reason why is I found things a bit harder with the cup, because it wasn't really 100% clear.  I found myself focusing on the cup, rather than my psi-wheel..and that made things go bleh.  So I covered my nose and mouth with my shirt and moved to the closet  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> .  This is where my great success came because I could focus all the way on the wheel.
<br />

<br />
Anyways..thanks for the help everybody <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  
<br />

<br />
I'm going to read more on the articles to see if there are any helpful tips on moving on to bigger things (like pencils).  But if you guys have any tips on that...that would be awesome   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Also going to post a vid tomorrow as promised so that I won't get flamed.

			Great!!
<br />

<br />
I too have gotten past a block, and it's sorta thanks to you.  Rather than using a glass, I desided to use a small plastic dixie cup.  I can now move the wheel covered almost as well as uncovered.  I think it would have taken me longer to think of using a plastic cup if you hadn't mentioned it, so thanks.
<br />

<br />
I saw a vid of a kid moving what I think was a nail.  To cut the friction he had it propped against something.  I've gotten a pin to move about 3 mm and a toothpick to wobble a bit.  My suggestion, keep your items small and think of ways to reduce their contact with surfaces.  If nothing else it should boost your confidence when they move.

			cheers <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  I'm glad it worked for somebody.  I guess part of my problem was that it was a reddish cup.  Still clear though..  I guess I just need to go buy a plain one..
<br />

<br />
As for the moving on to sliding objects..I've also heard people saying it's easy if you push the pencil yourself with your hand, and then try and use TK to stop it.  Then you work your way to being able to move it from a stopped position.
<br />

<br />
Anyways good luck to you...post back if you have success with something large!

			Sorry for all my consecutive posts...but I have more to share on my psi-wheel  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Ok..so it's around 1 am and I am still awake, and even though I have done a lot of TK today, I decide to push myself and do some more.
<br />

<br />
I take out my psi-wheel, turn off the fan, turn off the AC, cover my mouth and nose, and begin.  Almost instantly, the thing starts moving.  I made a continuous gesture (which you will see in my vid tomorrow) and the wheel started spinning faster and faster the opposite way of which my gesture was going (dunno if that makes sense..but yeah like I said..video.).  The gesture I make is like moving the tip of my fingers forward and backward.  Little to no wind comes off of the gesture, but even if it did, the wheel is clearly going the opposite way (like if I push my fingers left, the wheel goes right).  
<br />

<br />
It's really cool though..because each hand makes the wheel go a different direction...most of the time that is.  
<br />

<br />
I feel that I have somewhat mastered moving the psi-wheel up close with my hands.  So I then decided to do something different.  
<br />

<br />
I sit back about 4 feet away from the wheel, and I just stare at it.  It starts jolting a bit, so I put my hand out right in front of me (still very far away from the wheel), and I start making the same gestures as before.  The wheel started moving!  Only thing is, from a distance, it seems as if I can't get the wheel to go as fast.  I couldn't even get it to do a 360 because it would keep changing directions.  I think part of the reason why it started acting up is because I'm really tired right now and I've been doing this all day..lol...so I'll try again tomorrow.
<br />

<br />
But yeah...this is really cool  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> .  Hopefully if I keep things up, I wont have to use my hands anymore..and then I can just stare and move stuff  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> .

			I have the video uploaded <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  I made this early last night...so it isn't the best I've done, but I was too lazy to make another one.  I also get into hand gestures in this..lol..rather than just having my hand around it staying still (which I'm starting to get much better at).  I do however get the wheel to spin without stopping for about a minute <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> .  I tried my best to get the wheel to go both ways, but sometimes it didn't want to cooperate with me..  Anyways...here it is!
