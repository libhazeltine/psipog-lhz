			This only happened a few times that I can remember, and only two of those times do I remember what the voices were saying.  I would be asleep each time, and then sort of &quot;semi&quot; wake up. Like, my conscious, waking mind seemed to be at around 90% capacity, with a little bit of confusion in the back of my mind, but calm regardless.
<br />

<br />
One time of those two, I didn't even open my eyes, I just became aware of my five senses again (could feel my body lying on bed, smell what the pillow smelled like, hear clock tickin, etc) And I heard a voice, that seemed to be right by my ear (but not in my head) and it said &quot;soooon. Sooonnn the 12 years will be complete, and we will have it&quot; Not sure about last lines. The &quot;soon&quot; and &quot;12 years will be complete&quot; im positive of.
<br />
This voice sounded extremely menacing, deep and booming and non human sounding.
<br />

<br />
The second time I remember, it was the same voice. It sounded like it was coming from over by a shelf in my room. I woke up, and had my eyes closed, but I could see the room I was in through my eyelids. I think it may have been a mental copy, because when I looked around, it seemed to take an extra split second for the scene to alter the position correctly, and the visuals seemed not quite like when my eyes are open. More washed out looking.
<br />

<br />
The voice said &quot;Foooocuuuusss... Foooccuuss... Yesss.. Foocusss.. *evil maniacal laughter* yesssss. YESSSSS.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Well after hearing that I realized I wasn't opening my eyelids because I couldn't. It seemed like I was being held there like that. I struggled, and instinctively concentrated on my midsection, in the solar plexus. I'm not sure what mental process I went through to do this, but I felt a huge welling of energy form there and I sort of &quot;burst&quot; awake. I was sweating, it was fucked. Especially considering prior similar life experiences.
<br />

<br />
Anyone want to comment? Even Flames are welcome folks. I don't care if ya'll think im whack-shit.

			This isn't really a comment on your post, but more of a general question. How the hell do you get over your fear? If I were to ever encounter / experience something like that, I think I would stop pursuing OBE's and the like.
<br />

<br />
But yeah, my question, how do you not for lack of better words, freak out from experiences like this?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

			Uhhh.... wierd! i cant help you in the spirit category, but someone i know knows someone who does pregognition. About a month ago he said that she predicted some sort of &quot;prophecy&quot; about some kind of war. (spirit n psychic stuff, not normal.) I forget when they thought it would be, though. all i know is that its a long time from now, like more that 7 years or something... DARN MY FORGETFULLNESS! lol

			Xiou, I do believe you heard the voice. I obviously can't say I believe it's anything beyond your own head playing mind games with you- it happens.
<br />

<br />
I've heard voices saying specific things to me. The one that popped into my head after reading your post was a voice telling me I was going to be dead by the time I turned 24. I'm 26 now. I've seen critters, felt sentations that just aren't wholesome, heard things that aren't right.
<br />

<br />
I have encountered a /thing/ at night, more than once, that had a malevolence about it. It seemed to enjoy the fact I was anxious. I tend to ignore it and think on other, more pleasant things, like kittens that haven't had their heads torn off. Once the anxiety was gone the /thing/ was gone and I could sleep through the night.
<br />

<br />
The end.

			ya the voice you heard i'm pretty sure was real, my personal opinion was that it was a entity, one of those entities, like a psychic entity. Can't be seen etc etc etc. A lot of those entities are probably talking about their own personal things, they probably talk nonsense, it most probably doesn't concern the world and just concerns themselves. Ummm, I don't know, but there have been recorded cases about voices talking of complete BS, sometimes they might say they will kill you, but they fail to fulfill that saying.
<br />

<br />
Several several times they might say that, they will never do it.
<br />

<br />
I don't like them, but don't hate them. Ask them: &quot;What are these 12 years you speak of?&quot;.

			I have had an experience similiar to yours before, maybe sharing it will bring some form of enlightenment to one of us lol.
<br />

<br />
I was asleep, and i woke up like 3 am or something, and the light in my room was on, i layed back down and suddenly i felt a &quot;power&quot; or force of some kind come over my body and i couldnt move(AT ALL) i tried to scream and i couldnt even speak, then i felt in my back it felt like there was energy swelling up and it exploded all over my back, tons of explosions all over my back, then i managed to put out a pathetic scream, which was nothing more then a moan, and then it all wore off in a matter of seconds, no voices but i felt the whole time that there was a presence above me to the right, just behind my head where i couldnt see.  It freaked me out to the point where i couldnt sleep the rest of the night.  and before this on a couple of occasions i was laying in my bed and i heard this mennacing ticking noise that would repeat itself, and my mind would fall into some strange trans and i would always have to fight to get it to wear off. let me know if there is anything you think these could be related                p.s.  i have never actually heard a voice, but other then that seemed like a similar experience

			Have you ever heard of an EVP? It stands for electronic.voice.phonomonon, and it is basicly the voice of a ghost/ spirit/ entity caught on a recording. One day if you want get a recorder and just ask questions, in your case what the 12 years means or what ever. I first thought it was just hypnagaic voices but if it happened twice and sounded the same something might be there. But its nothing to worry about <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> , they wont hurt you, some just like scaring people. (like some people on this fourm while OBEing lol) The best it will do for you though is give you some answers. If theres nothing the maby you just ate a bad hot dog before you fell asleep  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			That is interesting. ive never heard anything like that. and i just had to read this almost right before im about to go to bed too. like what was said before, it could have been E.V.P., or just a psion playing around with some radio channel you were on. (i have turned on my tv once withought a remote, so i assume it is possible)  about the 12 years thing, its supposed that on 2012 dec 21 the world will end (the mayan calender ends there, and it is pretty acurate.) i have a nice page for you all that explains it. i dont know if that is what &quot;they&quot; are talking about though
<br />
<a href="http://www.greatdreams.com/2012.htm" target="_blank">http://www.greatdreams.com/2012.htm</a>
<br />
or it might just be some random psion who is annoyed and is playing tricks on anybody in the area by messing with the radios. your choice.

			It happened to me once too... I was trying to do obe.. then I heard some kind of knocking on the wall behind me... like someone was knocking on a door. I listened to it, then I heard some voice from my left, then from right.. then a pause.. and I heard a loud BOOO!!! just over me.. Damn it so freaked me out... It sounds very mundane but it WAS scary heh... I calmed myself and then I heard someone speaking again.. it told me, you are now on the dark side (yes, it does sound like in Starwars, and I'm not fan of jedi <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />)
<br />
Then I felt myself fall down very fast and I had a vision... A vision of a monster it was so damn scary I found myself back where I had been and I slept with the light on <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.... Something I read in Monroe's book about astral projections... Everyone must confront their fears, it is one of the last barriers to prevent people not ready to get out...

			I feel like I should throw in mention of a person?s very own way to scare the hell out of itsself. (and the opposite.)
<br />
All day we?re actively responding to whatever remains getting through unfiltered to our conscious part of the mind. We tend to pick things up quite quickly, apply new filters and lead thoughts down a path usually based on experience, anxieties hopes or wishes. A quick example would be an image of a cheeseburger triggering a rampage for food whereas without seeing that image you might still be reading these forums or whatever. Now attempting OBE?s by evading sleep basically requires you to stop responding to whatever your mind throws at you, but remain in the observer?s state which is a pretty powerful one no matter what you do.  Everyone halfway successfull on consciously resisting loosing control over dream states knows how quickly the mind seems to lose all constraints and bombards you with sounds, images and feelings. I?ve heard my name beeing whispered since my childhood, and just a couple of years ago stopped freaking out to look for people in my room. What seems to be reoccuring for me lately is seeing faces, which then morp into all kinds of other faces. Sometimes, utterly utterly disturbing and very scary stuff, keeping me on a &quot;bad track&quot; (leading down the pathway I had just set).  On a positive note I also start hearing all kinds of music and tunes never heard before, which have a weird but very interesting feel to them.
<br />
The point is, your mind is starting to do things differently else the dream state wouldn?t differ so much from beeing awake. Your conscious part of the mind over the day has what I like to call a &quot;critisism-aspect&quot; to it. Whatever you see is beeing compared to fit into your established reality model. If it?s not fitting in slightly, it?s usually &quot;argued&quot; to fit in, if it doesn?t seem to fit in at all it?s beeing marked as utter nonsense if it even gets through to your consciousness. When the body starts to sleep this part is beeing turned off very quickly, allowing your dreams to breeze through without your questioning mind interfering with anything (because it?s apparently just not what your body / mind is looking to do during sleep).
<br />
What happens if you try to stay awake whilst starting to dream? That?s right, your filters are all the way there, and you just start freaking out over anything that doesn?t usually work in the awake state. Usually that?s most intense over dangerous matters that you?d be sure to run the hell away from to save your life when awake. Now I can understand why this part of the mind is beeing turned off then during sleep, as well as why sleep paralyzation sets in additionally. Because the things you experience in at least the first parts of dreams most of the time aren?t  what you are supposed to respond to as if it was real.
<br />
I?m not trying to dismiss any theories about whatever some of these encounters could be, but I thought I?d share my experience on what the mind is actually doing during that state and maybe calm some people down when encountering voices and images or feelings. I know it can be scary, but appart from looking out for interesting informations, let the mind do it?s work and don?t interfere by identifying yourself with the content too much. You?re watching and waiting to get past, allow your unconscious part of the mind to do what it needs to do and be passive about it.

As far as evil spirits and the such... I believe they exist but I think there are certain conditions by which they can effect people. I believe that for evil things to effect you, you have to be afraid/looking for them. Like in meliak's post, he said as soon as his anxiety went away the thing did too. I have felt the same type of anxiety and can easily imagin something behind me or in my room, but as soon as I get rid of it, nothing ever happens. There is no monster standing there, its all in my imgination. Not to say that it always is peoples imaginations, but I think they play off it if that makes sense. I think that if you are fearless of them, then they wont bother you. Don't worry about evil things and you wont be bothered.
