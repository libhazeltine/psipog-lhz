You can't argue over points that aren't objective, only the concrete technical specs.  Anyone can say 'OMG THIS SYSTEM ROCKZ0RS' because he had a good <span style="font-weight: bold">subjective</span> experience, but that is still only his opinion.  I'm personally going to buy a PS3 because of the game library that has been set up and its amazing technical specs.[/b]

			I'm going for the Wii.  Why?  Because of it's highly innovative controller, awesome graphics (I'll concede the point that the 360's are better), the fact that it has more than one or two popular game series, and it's very cheap price tag.  You could buy 2 Wii's for the price of 1 PS3.  And to whoever says that Nintendo exploits their characters to hell, look at <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464037/" target="_blank" class="postlink">this</a>.  At least Nintendo doesn't make movies of it's stuff.  And as for Sony fans, lookee <a href="http://img222.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ps4stolen9jd8ux8by4rt.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink">here.</a>
<br />
Sony creates nothing, they just take it, dumb it down a notch or two, and say it was their own idea.  
<br />

			Here's an opinion on the 3 systems that doesn't suck, unlike all of yours.

<br />
My view on this E3 are as follows: 
<br />

<br />
Xbox 360 has shown us that coming out a year prior to the other systems can help you in some ways. Good games will finally arrive, support is doing well, and xbox live is showing how cool it can be. For people who have an HD TV, downloading things like HD trailers for games and movies is a really good idea. Downloading demos before you buy it is smart. Having an arcade of games such as classics, or even things like Texas Hold-Em Poker and Uno helps diversify the field of gamers. Soon enough I'm guessing that 360 will find a way to make the machines cost less to make, and thus cost less for us to buy. The price will be even more appealing than its competitors for what it offers and things will continue on their merry way. 
<br />

<br />
The PS3 is way too expensive for many people. Even though a lot of people do have a job and they will set aside 600 dollars (for just the console alone), a lot of people find that ridiculous. And it's true. It sort of is. However there are plenty of things out there that cost a lot in the world of technology. A good computer costs a lot, a good television costs a lot, a good dvd player costs a lot... Speakers, stereo system, lighting, etc. etc. When put into perspective, PS3 costing what it does makes a lot of sense. I mean an ipod can cost up to 600 dollars. However here's the big problem, PS3 games also need to be bought. A video game system with no games makes no sense. Now being able to buy them or rent them down the line is fine, but right off the bat those 600 bones go up. Also... All those stores are going to force us to buy bundles. Not bundled deals, cause if you look at the prices, they cost the same as if you bought them separately. So you're FORCED to buy games, more than you might want, and ones you never would play. This has happened for the past decade. I think it needs to stop. The PS3 otherwise would be a no brainer. Games make the system and you will have tons of support. Graphics whore? This system will look awesome. Many people state that ps3 looks better than 360, but you know what, I bet in the end you will not be able to tell the difference. The graphic differences will be way too minute. So it's not really the graphics they should focus on, but what people do with the blu-ray disc, which destroys the storage space of a DVD. 
<br />

<br />
Nintendo Wii. You know what. I am really excited about this. I am growing up and I know that graphics do not make a game. And I gave myself a scenario. I pictured myself getting all the systems at the same time. I play xbox 360 and PS3 and love them both. Having fun with the games, and then after the eye candy of the graphics wear off, I might go &quot;Wait a second, these are just lousy first generation games.&quot; My interest grows thin, and I turn off the system until games I want come out like MGS4 or Dead Rising or something. Yet with the Wii, the game list astounds me. A new Mario, the next Zelda, a Warioware, which despite being sequels, they are from a line of games I love. But the twist is the controller. I have not played games like this before. I will not grow tired and yawn saying &quot;I have played this before.&quot; And that thought of actually whacking at my screen with the remote, and getting up and playing tennis (I used to have tennis lessons), to learn that the tennis game is sensitive enough to tell the difference from all the strokes out there. so that means I can kick your ass at virtual tennis. So what does that say? I am pumped the hell out of my mind for the wii. I want one now. I do not care about not having a major graphics upgrade. Why? Because I'll have one or both of the other systems anyway. I can get my fix there. But Nintendo I can go &quot;Hee hee hee! It's like I'm steering this truck and I have to land correctly or I don't get points by actually steering!&quot; 
<br />

<br />
The DS has a ton of games that look great. The DS is on a roll. 
<br />

<br />
And then the PSP... Yeah it has a MGS game coming.. That's about it. :c 
<br />

<br />
So what do you think we should do? Buy all the systems and just not think about any of this war bullshit. Just have fun with whatever you buy.

			Well, as a loyal Nintendo fanboy, Wii! I love Nintendo's games, they are the best, and Nintendo's approach makes games heaps more fun! That hilarity in the arcade when you see somebody playing virtual boxing is being taken into the comfort of your own home! And I can't wait for Super Smash Bros. Brawl! With the Nintendo WFC, it can't go wrong!

			I voted WII! New controller and gameplay, and also it uses the old GC controllers in some games. It will in super smash bros brawl...
<br />

<br />
And Xbox 360 only has better graphics and better online play. Bah. And you can get some games for that on PC.
<br />

<br />
Ohh its storytime...
<br />

<br />
My friend was once going to sleep at another friends house and he just got an xbox 360. They played it for about 6 to 8 hrs and guess what happened? KABOOM! IT EXPLODED! lol. Not from the inside an stuff either, it was the kind of explosion that you know... sends pieces flying. nobody got hurt though... that was lucky.

			Man, can't wait for Wii. Some people dismiss it as bad just because it's Nintendo and it's wierd. They should play it and then make up their mind! Well, in Australia at least. Nintendo has a bad reputation in Australia. I don't know why...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />

			I think one important point needs to be made about the cost of the 360 and PS3.  You guys may find the prices ridiculous but I remember that at PS2 launch, Canadians were definitely paying over 650 for a PS2.  Xbox was equally unreasonable at launch.  To the Canadian market, we're seeing no price increase for the PS3 due to a rising dollar (and a falling American dollar) and so cost really doesn't factor in as anything more than the norm for us.  Keep it in mind that (while my example is relating to Canadians because I am one) changes of values of currencies can significantly change how people view the price of consoles.

			Of course most people are going to vote for playstation. Its geared towards a younger market anyway, and since the majority of people on here are under the age of 18, playstation statistically wins. But for me, ill stick the xbox and Wii. The playstation will have 5 or 6 good games, then 5000000000 japanese rpgs that need to die. Playstation is just riding the coat tails of its former success in being the first of the old generation. Playstation will fuck up, and when they do it will be a big fuck up.Wii is innovation, Xbox is amazing shooters, and playstation is soggy Japanese Role Playing Games.

			Ok, I don't know what the fuck is with the guy that made this but he is completely delussional. It's the exact oppposite of what he says in the video:http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3310458736017513204&amp;q=wii 
<br />
And...the bit at the end about the playstation controller. Ha! What bollucks! Just pause it and read all of them. They all apply to the wii remote aswell. It's like someone edited the movie and replaced the sony with nintendo etc.
<br />

<br />
(edit) Also, the pic of the wii remote is wrong, it doesn't have an analog stick at the top, it's a d-pad! And the console he was comparing it too I have never ever heard of!
