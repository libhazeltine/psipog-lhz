			I have a fairly late bedtime at my house, and late at night (about once every 3 or 4 days, or less) I can hear a man screaming &quot;HAAA!!&quot; or &quot;HIIIDE!!&quot; or something like that at what I would estimate at about 3 or 4 building away. In fact, I just heard him a little while ago, and I am posting this at 1:20 AM. I also asked my dad if he could hear him, and he said yes, so that proves it isnt just in my head.
<br />

<br />
By the sound of his voice, I would say he is (was?) a 20-30 year old. I have heard him cough before too. Also, His voice sounds very crisp, like a real person actually was saying that.
<br />

<br />
So far, everything I have listed could have been performed by a living breathing human. The question is though, WHY on EARTH would someone wake up (or is he already awake?) at midnight-1:30 AM and yell at the whole neighborhood?
<br />

<br />
oh, and one last thing. I live in the countryside. It is usually very quiet here, but we have a small (read, SMALL) town here whitch I live in.
<br />

<br />
other note: There is no sound of a car or a motorcycle or anything when he does this. It always comes from the same area. Aside from the cough noise from that one time, the &quot;HAAA!!&quot; thing is the only thing he yells, and it lastes about 1-1.5 seconds.

			Well huh maybe it's the only hour he has time to play hide &amp; seek?
<br />
Seriously, at first I would try to pay attention to see where the sound comes from. Does it come from the same direction? That would be a neighborhood. Now if it comes from different directions, a ghost, probably someone that may know you or you father and it is just together with you, some of them don't know what to do and just stick around.

			Do you have any neighbors with mental conditions that would cause them to scream out in the middle of the night?
