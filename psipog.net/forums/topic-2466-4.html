Obviously you didnt follow up on the internet.  If you went to X-Plays website, it said that the XBox only broke because it landed on the top corner which popped out the On button.  They later took a pen and pressed the little thing that the on button normally presses and it turned on.  So, in conclusion, that test proved nothing except that it depends which side it falls on.

Reminds me of a flash animation called &quot;The Decline of Video Games&quot; in which there was an entire sectin of video games devoted just to him, doing everything you can think of. Even the RPG's look childish. All the Zelda games look way to weird, and the sound tracks and sound efects just sound way too cartoony for my taste.

Why is it childish to jump on your enemies, people act like jumping on peoples heads and throwing fireballs at them is some big purple dinosaur thing, sorry, but where I come from, jumping on heads and throwing fireballs ain't friendly. Them's fighting tactics.

I agree, not just based on tech, just on the fact that X-box Is enormous and heavy, I would need an industrial crane to take it to a friends house, and the controller was made for a giant octopus.

I'm not sure if this has been mentioned yet, but microsoft has also copied nintendo with their 'secret' handheld, the Origami. IT HAS A TOUCH SCREEN! It looks absolutely gigantic, judging from the video i got off google. It's about the size of a closed laptop <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

All right, i will go through it.
<br />

<br />
The XBox is not heavy at all!  The only thing wrong that i see is the brick sized power adapter.  If you have trouble picking it up, then you would have trouble picking up my school book.  I (and others) would rather have a comfortable controller than a very small, squished one.  The controller is not very big and it feels good to hold.  Size isnt everything.  I see that you probably suggest Mac over Windows, eh?  When you want a mac to shutdown, hit the save button....  The reason Windows has more viruses than Mac's (and yes, there are a few Mac viruses out there) is because Windows has been the leading PC and that is what virus programmers aim for.  Soon, there will be just as many viruses for Mac.  People dont have a want to learn programming.  If all they want to do is type up something, they should not have to learn how to program.  Lazyness has nothing to do with it.  If you are going to argue, argue well.
