			I dont supose it is imposible, but i doubt you can increase your speed by much.  If anything you are just alowing your mind to work at a greater speed than normal.  Concider That your muscles are capable of producing far more force than they normaly do, but because it harms them your mind bottlenecks how much you can exhert safely.  by increasing your perception of time i wouldn't doubt the posibility of causing damage to your brain or nervious system

I don't know where to put this so i put it here. Anyway, i found this on a site and i think it's possible so anyone wanna try?

Chronokinesis is the power to slow down or speed up your perception of time. If you slow it down you will appear to others to be moving at superhuman speed and your talk will sound like gibberish but to you it will be like everything is slow motion. If you choose to speed up time, everything around you will seem fast and you will appear to be in slow motion.

			The majority of people here have made a serious error in explaining why they don't believe &quot;chronokinesis&quot; is possible.  They claim that because our perceptions of time can change that time's flow cannot be changed.  The two things (time's flow and our perception of it) are mutually exclusive and in fact we know that time's flow can be changed by significant gravitational forces and other anomilies.

			I remember reading about a test to prove that at faster (eventually relativistic) speeds, time slows down(or in the case of relativistic, all but stops.) I don't have a link, but the test went something like this:
<br />

<br />
They synched two watches and sent a man into orbit with one of them, and had the other on the ground. Because the man in orbit was traveling at several hundred miles an hour, time was slightly different in its flow from the way it was on earth. When the guy from space got back, his watch was several seconds behind the watch on the ground.

You do realise that a theory is only a theory because it has already been experimented and no evidence has been found that does not prove it false.

If it had no proof it would be a hypothesis. Basic science.

			No, laws aren't something that has been proved. Laws are something that is observed and that do not attempt and explain something. Theories try and explain the mechanics of how something works. Thus, any theory, can never be proven, becuase there is always the chance that something will disprove it.
