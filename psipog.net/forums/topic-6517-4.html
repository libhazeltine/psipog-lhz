Well seeing that my answer was &quot;Because I can&quot; is pretty much the same meaning of what you said...I can understand how someone would come with it.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

Ya...I seem to get that a lot.....I been wondering if its me.

No Spirit your answer was not correct because you said everything happens for a reason...but you failed to say why nothing happens for a reason.

			'Because' is an incomplete answer, and provides little justification. It gives the explantion that, it's just how it is, thats how things go, yet those things happen for a purpose and reason. 
<br />
Actually I think that, why and because are too close to being the same. &quot;Because why?&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Why? Because&quot;. They all seem to fit together, but don't result in an answer. Por qué? Porque. 
<br />
My instinct was to simply say 'because'
<br />
However I do not believe that
<br />

<br />
Why?
<br />
Because somewhere, somehow, there is a reason for it. 
<br />

<br />
Nothing is a lack of reason.
