			Hi.
<br />

<br />
I would like you to know that there will be a SyncCreation course in Portugal, on December, given by Dr. Joe Gallenberger, considered an expert in manifestation and psychokinesis (PK), who is a trainer at the Monroe Institute and author of other amazing workshops like the Vegas Adventure Workshops (where he successfully teaches how to influence dice at the Las Vegas casinos).
<br />

<br />
The course is about learning how to influence our physical reality. It goes from influencing physical matter to achieving abundance in one's life (at many levels). Participants will do Hemi-Sync meditations, and watch and learn how to bend silverware, grow seeds in their hands and influence dice (among other exercises) with the use of non-physical energies.
<br />

<br />
For more information please check the event's site:

			Hi.
<br />

<br />
Actually 1500 Euros = 1042 British Pounds Sterling, not 1400 <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
And if you sign up before 3 months of the starting date, total cost will be 1400 Euros = 972 British Pounds Sterling. I just checked the rate using a converter widget on Mac OS Tiger.
<br />

<br />
It is a standard price, as compared to the courses given in the Monroe Institue (in USA), as it is given from a Monroe Institue trainer (althoug this is not a course from the Monroe Institute) with a similar course format.
<br />

<br />
Although one might think at first that the price is high, the fact (I.M.H.O) is that the contents given in this course (observed, learned and experienced by participants themselves) are quite hard to find in courses (I might say quite rare indeed). I might even say that in Europe this is the first time such contents will be delivered in a course like this. See what the course has to offer for yourselves (you might check the link I posted or my own web page link for that) and be the judges of that.
<br />

<br />
In my opinion, it's about making an investment in our own lives.
<br />

<br />
Best regards,
<br />

You did not include the 500 euros they make you pay for a hotel reservation, therefore, yes it is ?1400 pound sterlings, or ?1387.87 if you want to be exact.

			Oh, I see where the confusion came from. The 500? is a reservation fee for the course itself that is included in the total cost.
<br />
Thanks for bringing that up, other people might get confused on that. I'll make it clearer on the webpage as soon as I can.
<br />

<br />
TinyMage,
<br />
I understand your question and what I can tell you is that, from what I know from Dr. Joe, he is commited in teaching other people how to practise PK and how to live an abundant life (in many of life's aspects), and he makes a living out of it. I do know that the Las Vegas casinos were his labs to develop more and &quot;fine-tune&quot; PK, and then successfully started to teach people of how to do it (besides teaching at the Monroe Institute). If you want to know more about Dr. Joe himself you may listen to this interview he gave, where he talks a bit about his background, his workshops and his work at the Monroe Institute: <a href="http://www.controversialnewsnetwork.com/bios/guests/joegallenberger.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.controversialnewsnetwork.com/bios/guests/joegallenberger.html</a>
<br />
You may also want to check his web page and Monroe Institute's webpage (in case you don't know, the Monroe Institute is an acclaimed institution in the USA in expanded consciousness matters; try and google for it), the links are on the last page of the SyncCreation in Portugal course's webpage. You may also google about him to try to get more information about his work.
<br />

<br />
I hope this helps clarifying things a bit.
<br />

<br />
Thanks,
<br />
   Ricardo

			Hi.
<br />

<br />
Just to say that some people already signed-up, and that there are still places available for the December course.
<br />

<br />
If anyone has any doubts about the course, just let me know and I'll try to answer. The SyncCreation website has my contact info.
<br />

			Hi Dawu.
<br />

<br />
I'm sorry if you can't afford to participate in the workshop...
<br />
No, there are no videos available.
<br />

<br />
There is, though, a cheaper alternative available in Dr. Joe's site (for 700 USD): the SyncCreation Manifestation Home Study Course.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The SyncCreation workshop (the one in Portugal) is designed to be an intensive 5 days course where food and sleeping is also included in the price you mentioned.
<br />

<br />
There are, of course, other ways of learning psychokinesis but the SyncCreation workshop is a kind of unusual one, given by a psychokinesis/manifestation expert, together with specially designed (by the Monroe Institute) Hemi-Sync meditation exercises, where participants will do, during the 5 days, unusual exercises (illuminate light bulbs, influence the outcome of dice, bend silverware, grow seeds in hands, just with the power of their minds), learn how to use psychokinesis to influence our reality (our daily lives) so we can reach abundance (at many levels) and also how to use psychokinesis to heal ourselves or others.
<br />

<br />
You are getting what you pay for.
<br />

<br />
Best regards,
<br />

			I understand that that the course is worth the price but the price is too high.
<br />
What are the requirements for taking a course? What level of TK/PK do you need to master in order to attend such course?
<br />

<br />
Is this SyncCreation course going to be held somewhere in Europe next year?
<br />

<br />
You were talking about Dr. Joe's website (700USD fee for SyncCreation Manifestation Home Study Course).Does it teach you everything the SyncCreation course (Portugal) has to offer?

			The only requirement is that you speak English <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
This workshop is designed for the &quot;regular person&quot;, for anyone that might never have meditated before. There are no requirements (besides the English language) for participating in this course.
<br />

<br />
This is where the Hemi-Sync technology comes up. Summing it up, Hemi-Sync is an audio technology (patented by the Monroe Institute) that allows for the &quot;regular type of person&quot; (someone that might have never meditated) to reach deep levels of consciousness (meditative states), during the Hemi-Sync meditation exercises, not regularly reachable by the &quot;ordinary person&quot;.
<br />

<br />
The SyncCreation workshop will be, most probably, held in Portugal, again (my objective, is that it will happen 3 times, then), next year. I do not have any information about it happening somewhere else in Europe, next year.
<br />

<br />
The SyncCreation Manifestation Home Study Course is the home version of the Synccreation workshop. It is designed to be done at your own pace, at home (sharing some of the workshop's exercises), also with the Hemi-Sync meditations.
<br />

<br />
Best regards,
<br />
