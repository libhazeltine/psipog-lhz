			Well it wasnt really a BAD experience but, i thought to myself on the bus; all the people i have tried empathy on have been fairly young i think ill try it an older person, so anyway this old lady came on to the bus and sat right in front of me, so i decided to connect to her, a few minutes went by and i started to get a really sad feeling, i was starting to cry a little, i imagine that she has a lot of grief, i suppose this is the downside to empathy i have only just started prcaticing a couple of days ago, is their a way to shield from such negetive feelings?

			I usually close my empathic receptive state by cutting the emotions from the outside... I usually just close myself by visualizing the energy or emotions outside slowly constricts as if there is a metal circular valve closing in, cutting the energy.. and after that I would first calm myself. I guess this what as they called as centering, meaning focusing first of yourself. Just focus your attention first at yourself and get rid of the unwanted energies or emotions.

You know what I got the same bad experience as yours but on my situation, it was with my classmate. I get the feeling that there is definitely not right between us and when we were taking a test, i decided to take a peek on his mind telepathicaly (yah I know cheating is bad <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> but i cant help it, i was just testing tp anyway) and so when I tried to well... read his thoughts. Emotions came flooding in and some jambled up pictures of thoughts that I couldnt make out of but there was somethin certain, at that time he was feeling a tremendous amount of emotion of envy, anger, which I dont know why by the way. It was really sophocating that its like you want to shrug it badly off you. Somehow I manage to get rid of it... hmmmph..

			Well allthough this might not be the right way, since you interfere with someones life, but sometimes when i sence someone who is depressed or sad/angry, etc i just talk to them, with strangers i am more carefull since you don't know how they will react, but with people i know or for example saw at school/work, etc i just talk to them, trying to find out why they feel that way. See empathy is a powerfull gift, so why not use it for the greater good, meaning help someone else. Sometimes all it takes is a simple word to make people feel better or a listening ear, especially if you understand them better then anyone else concerning feelings.

			I totally agree, I do help people also with empathy and may I say it really feels good to help someone. Like for example, I have a classmate whom I sensed that she was totally depressed. So I went to her and talk to her and sometimes I use a little bit of empathic projection as well to lessen what she was feeling. And after that she felt better and somehow the solutions or answers of her problems just fell right into place right after I talked to her.. weird but I like helping people. And heres another instance when another of my classmate felt sad and depressed over her relationship, at first I talked to her, console her and gave some advices, likewise a little bit of empathic projection. After that I asked her, &quot;now thats good your smiling.&quot; and she said &quot;I dunno I just felt smiling and I dont feel dpressed anymore.&quot; after hearing that, somehow I felt that there is some use for my empathic ability... However, Im still stuck with in improving my telepathic skill... kind of depressing really <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Yeah, empathy comes with an awesome side and a really annoying side. Especially when you are in a big room filled with sad/angry people. AAAAA!

If you could switch off your compassion/pity then &quot;bad feelings&quot; would not &quot;hurt you&quot; [or more accurately, you would not hurt yourself because of them].
<br />

<br />
Some people tend to be quite damaged/corrupted/poisonous [depending on who]. For this reason, it's good to avoid these sorts.

Be careful with your connectionz.
