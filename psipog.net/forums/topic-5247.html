			Howdy,
<br />
Erin Pavlina e-mailed me about her recent blog entry, located here:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.erinpavlina.com/blog/2006/08/welcome-to-naptown/" target="_blank">http://www.erinpavlina.com/blog/2006/08/welcome-to-naptown/</a>

She's curious what people in the PsiPog community think about it.  Her post is about a place she would &quot;wake up&quot; in when she went to sleep at night, and how it felt like she was living a completely seperate life there.  It's pretty cool sounding.
<br />

<br />
Personally, this type of experience isn't new.  I've never done it (that I know of), but Robert Monroe reported something similar to this in his book Journeys Out of the Body.  Monroe labelled it as &quot;Locale III&quot;... let me see if I can grab a quote...
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Monroe wrote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">11/5/58 Afternoon
<br />
The vibrations came quickly and easily, and were not at all uncomfortable.  When they were strong, I tried to lift out of the physical with no result.  Whatever thought or combination I tried, I remved confined right where I was.  I then remembered the rotating trick, which operates just as if you are turning over in bed.  I started to turn, and recognized that my physical was not &quot;turning&quot; with me.  I moved slowly, and after a moment I was &quot;face down,&quot; or in direct opposition to the placement of my physical body.  The moment I reached this 180degree position (out of phase, opposite polarity?), there was a hole.  That's the only way to describe it.  To my senses, it seemed to be a hole in a wall which was about two feet thick and stretched endlessly in all directions (in the vertical plane).
<br />

<br />
... <span style="font-style: italic">[Monroe goes on to experiment with the hole, until]</span>...
<br />

<br />
2/23/59 Night
<br />
The hole is populated!  This evening (seven-thirty), I went through vibration and 180degree rotation, and this time without much hesitation, I pulled myself through and stood up.  I immediately felt myself in the presence of someone standing there.  I sensed his presence rather than saw him (impression, male).  For some unaccountable reason that I do not yet understand, even recollected now in tranquility, I dropped thankfully in front of him and sobbed.  After a moment, I calmed down, carefully backed away, went through the hole, rotated back in to the physical, and sat up.  Who was it?  And why did I act so emotionally?
<br />

<br />
2/27/59 Night
<br />
Determined to find some more (or even one!) answers about the hole, I went through the vibration and 180degree rotation pattern, and deliberately went through.  It was still black and dark, but not unpleasant, no hands, no presence.  I could feel something solid under me, so I tried very hard to open my eyes and &quot;see&quot;.  I did, and everything came into view.  I was standing near a building (more like a barn than a house) on what was a wide meadowlike area. ... I help up my hands and arms in the stretch-out position, and went up easily.  I moved slowly over the meadow, enjoying the view and exploration...
<br />

<br />
...
<br />

<br />
That was the beginning.  A series of experiments followed that were remarkable in their consistency of data, and defied any historical explanation.  The curious intellect cannot dismiss the colelctive experience as hallucination.
<br />

<br />
Locale III, in summary, proved to be a physical-matter world almost identical to our own.  The natural environment is the same.  There are trees, houses, cities, people, artifacts, and all the appurtenances of reasonably civilized society.  There are homes, families, businesses, and people work for a living.  There are roads on which vehicles travel.  There are railroads and trains.
<br />

<br />
Now for the &quot;almost.&quot;  At first, the thought was that Locale III was no more than some part of our world unknown to me and those others concerned.  It had all the appearances of being so.  However, more careful study showed that it can be neither the present nor the past of our physical-matter world.
<br />

<br />
The scientific development is inconsistent.  There are no electrical devices whatsoever.  Electricity, electromagnetics, and anything so related are non-existent.  No electric lights, telephones, radios, television, or electric power.
<br />

<br />
No internal combustion, gasoline, or oil were found as power sources.  Yet mechanical power is used.  Careful examination of one of the locomotives that pulled a string of old-fashioned-lookoing passenger cars showed it to be driven by a steam engine.
<br />

<br />
...
<br />

<br />
The streets and roads are different, again principally in size.  The &quot;lane&quot; on which vehicles travel is nearly twice as wide as ours.  Their version of our automobile is much larger.  Even the smallest has a single bench seat that will hold five to six people abreast.  The standard unit has only one fixed seat, that of the driver.  Others are much like living-room chairs, placed around a compartment that measures some fifteen by twenty feet.  Wheels are used, but without inflated tires.  Steering is done by a single horizontal bar.  Motive power is contained somewhere in the rear.  Their movement is not very fast, at something like fifteen to twenty miles per hour.  Traffic is not heavy.
<br />

<br />
...
<br />

<br />
In spite of early indications, the people there were not aware of my presence until I met and &quot;merged&quot; temporarily and involuntarily with one who can only be described as the &quot;I&quot; who lives &quot;there.&quot;  The only explanation I can think of is that I, fully conscious of living and being &quot;here,&quot; was attracted to and began momentarily to inhabit the body of a person &quot;there,&quot; much like myself.
<br />

<br />
When this took place - and it began to be an automatic process when I went to Locale III - I simply took over &quot;his&quot; body.  There was no awareness of his mental presence when I temporarily displaced him.  My knowledge of him and his activities and his past came from his family, and what was evidently his brain memory-bank.  Though I knew that I was not he, I could feel objectively the emotional patterns of his past.  I have wondered what embarrassment I have caused him as a result of the periods of amnesia created by my intrusions.  Some must have brought him much distress.
<br />

<br />
... <span style="font-style: italic">[Monroe goes on to talk about the entire history of &quot;the other guy&quot; that he has figured out]</span>...
<br />

<br />
[Local III] might be a memory, racial or otherwise, of a physical earth civilization that predates known history.  It might be another earth-type world located in another part of the universe which is somehow accessible through mental manipulation.  It might be an antimatter duplicate of this physical earth-world where we are the same but different, bonded together unit for unit by a force beyond our present comprehension.

The only difference I've noticed between Erin's experience and Monroe's experience is that Erin has decided to create a huge mansion and &quot;fight&quot; whatever the &quot;darkness&quot; is.  Monroe's &quot;other guy&quot; had a much more boring history, that sounded like a normal life (which I didn't type out).
<br />

<br />
So... overall: who the hell knows?  Bizarre stuff.

			Very interesting dreams, I must say. I would have quoted Monroe if you hadn't, but since you already have...
<br />

<br />
I'll go for the more controversial Castaneda:
<br />
Don Juan, in the art of dreaming, claims that there are almost infinite &quot;planes&quot; or &quot;levels&quot; of existence. He says that each human being is a luminous ball of fiber, and that the way we interpret reality is based on which luminous fibers our awareness is intersecting. Depending on which threads and where on those threads it touches, different realities result. Through normal life, it is behind the shoulder blades by a few feet. He also said that dreaming is a natural way of &quot;loosening&quot; the point of awareness, and that you could move it around the luminous fibers. However, your interpretation of what you saw wouldn't be useable until you reached &quot;cohesion,&quot; which is the stabilizing of the point of awareness. Once that occurred, it would seem as real as any other day, namely because it is. 
<br />

<br />
While not a quote, thats a pretty close paraphrase. So according to Castaneda/Don Juan's theory of reality, you achieved cohesion at another point, and now visit that point by default, because it's easier to get to then other places. (That has to do with cohesion; it takes a lot of energy according to Don Juan) Also according to this theory, this reality is as real as normal life. A bizarre theory to be sure. I think it fits what Erin is describing though. Although not everybody thinks Castaneda is for real. I've also read about somebody else outside of Monroe and Castaneda who described this. I can't remember who it was, unfortunately.
<br />

<br />
As Sean said though, who the hell knows?
<br />

<br />
I know I don't.
