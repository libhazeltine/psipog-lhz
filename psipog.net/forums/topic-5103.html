			The Guy has just one post, and that was used to create this thread. He cant possibly call us 'pricks' if he hasn't spoken to us, and its just this 'farewell' that sounds manipulating....</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>TaterMySalad wrote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">I guess i can't even find solace in you guys.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>TaterMySalad wrote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">I can't keep living if i hurt the people around me.

It might just be me, or does that sound really manipulating, he'll probably come crawling back with a different account. I mean really, he has one post, and he used it to post in this here thread, and 'he can't find solace in us'?, well if thats his only post, he can't find solace in us if hes never fucking posted on the Forums before. We're always here for people when they want help, but if they don't ask, they dont get an answer for the questions they havn't asked. Not to mention the fact that he joined just 3 days ago, and is so eager to leave, just let him bugger off.

			Actually, I was replying you but as soon as I submitted the reply, the post has been cancelled (dunno why...).
<br />
I hope you will read at least this reply, what i wanted to say to you is: NEVER think about dying because it was an accident, take it this way, if you have these ability, you can learn to controll them, so without making harm to anyone.
<br />
Keep this in mind, the life is a gift given to us, don't waste it for something you didnt or did unintentionally.
<br />

<br />

<br />
For you guys wondering why he has 1 post only, it's because he posted and when the thread was cancelled, his account lose the count of that post, returning to 0 again.
<br />
Or maybe the accout was cancelled (if so i really cant understand why).
<br />
It seemed really serious to me, I really cant understand why that post was cancelled.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Best of luck man, for you and your friend.

			I wouldn't read too much into what this kid is saying. He probably got banned for being a moron, as morons often do here at Psipog, and now he's going to try and lay a guilt trip on whoever reads his post.  If he were actually looking for some help, he'd be a bit more informative about his dilemma.  So, in conclusion, locked.
