By James A. Conrad
<br />

<br />
In September of 2001, just seven days before 9/11, I issued a &quot;telekinesis breakthrough&quot; news release that swept around the world and caused a lot of confusion. You see, for while I claimed a scientific breakthrough, I decided to keep the exact details of the breakthrough a secret. Here now is that secret. I am releasing it simultaneously to the public and scientific community for replication testing and as the foundation for future research by others.
<br />

<br />
Conrad's Human Telekinesis Equation aka Conrad Telekinesis Formula:
<br />
TK = CFe + VC + ZPE - SD - E+
<br />

<br />
Wherein:
<br />

<br />
TK is Telekinesis. The ability to cause at a distance by cerebral-generated motive power the movement of matter or energy. &quot;Motive power&quot; refers to an emission or projection from the brain that acts upon or interacts with the atoms of a distant surface causing an effect of repulsion or attraction.
<br />

<br />
CFe is Cerebro Iron. Sufficient circulating iron in the brain and stored iron in the skull's bone marrow. The role of iron is essential, but further research into other factors is needed, as iron may possibly only work in conjunction with, and possibly only in genetically predisposed individuals who have, unusual magnetite deposits in the brain or in the ethmoid bone between the eyes, or perhaps a one-in-a-million chance formation of blood vessels and nerve cells in just the right place in the brain, in which an environment exists for an enhanced capacity to generate extra energy involving the presence of circulating or stored iron.
<br />

<br />
VC is Visual Contact. The target must be visually sighted in sufficient lighting with open space along the pathway in front of it. In repeated experiments, I found that closing one's eyes or attempting telekinesis in a darkened room produced negative results. This could mean that the mind has to be consciously aware of a target in terms of spatial three-dimensional reality and recognition, not through visualization by imagination, for the process of releasing telekinetic energy from the brain to occur.
<br />

<br />
ZPE is Zero Point Emotions. The mental trigger. No will power or imagination is involved, both of which consume brain energy. The usual response time for the emission of energy is between five to twenty seconds after achieving this state of mind. This is a learned process. Highly sensitive laboratory equipment can be used to detect very low-level telekinesis.
<br />

<br />
SD is No Sleep Deprivation, which inhibits mental functioning.
<br />

<br />
E+ is No excessive level of vitamin E in the body. Vitamin E systemically protects the body from excess iron and can make it difficult to absorb and raise iron levels. The body requires a certain amount of vitamin E naturally, so what is discussed here is an excess, such as acquired through the taking of supplements.
<br />

<br />
tell me what you think

			Interesting. They just described some of the brain's links to PSI, i think, maybe. However, they did not whatsoever explain the actual MECHANICS behind what actually makes the object move, just what happens to the brain as it is happening. Not much help. though i will start intaking iron to see what happens.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

unrelated edit:
<br />

<br />
What if the ability to do remote viewing, PK, and other high performance mental techniques could be induced with high-tech means? There is some evidence that there is a mental access window (MAW) when the predominat frequency of an individual's electroencephalogram (EEG) is 7.81 to 7.83 Hz. This is the same frequency range in which slight oscillations in the earth's magnetic field occur, known as &quot;Schumann Resonance&quot;. (Interestingly, this frequency also corresponds to REM sleep and hypnogognic imagery.) Houck first learned of the ideas from Dr. Bob Beck when he purchased a simple EEG biofeedback unit from Beck. The unit provides auditory feedback of brain activity to the user. Beck suggested that they make a recording of an input signal of exactly 7.81 Hz. Houck listened to the EEG unit attached to his head in one ear while simultaneously listening to the 7.81 Hz (using frequency modulation, the EEG signal is combined with a 2000 Hz tone so it can be heard) recording in the other ear. After a few minutes of relaxing, the two sounds became very similar, and then --- a full blown out-of-body experience. Of the 45 people who have tried this equipment, approximately one-half have reported either a full blown or partial out-of-body experience. This experience led to evaluating the frequency spectrum of people's EEGs, and has resulted in some correlations with the type of individual. For example, psychics and geniuses have strong components of their EEG frequency in the MAW, even in their awake state.

			That equation explains the setting and requirements for PK to occur. If we're to believe that equation is correct, and PK is caused by iron deposits in our body, that is. 
<br />

<br />
I'd like to have the physics of PK explained first. Like, what are the characteristics of Psi, and an actual equation of the motion. 
<br />

<br />
Pretty interesting stuff, thanks for posting. =)

			Seen it (the equation), i say its trash. Thats no freaking equation guys. Look at it, its a piece of crap thrown by a flying monkey! Its telling you to deprive yourself of a very important vitamin and eat paperclips! (&lt;--- = over-exaggeration). Also, people can move psi-wheels without visual contact. That guy is some faker. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Pepsiboy, that sounds very interesting, and do you have any idea where we could listen to the 7.81 Hz frequency? Like a website? or any programs on the computer that can perhaps generate the correct frequency, etc.
<br />
Sounds very interesting. Define &quot;genius&quot; though. I'm familiar with the word, just its very subjective.

			Well fellow psions, looks like it's time to chug some bolts.
<br />

<br />
Well, this theory can be easily checked. Just eat tons of strawberries, let the iron set for a day and try PK. See (and record) if you are any better at PK then usual. The just try to consume as much of vitamin E as possible and try PK again.
<br />

<br />
But yeah, the article is a bit inconclusive, it doesn't describe the mechanics or what ACTUALLY moves the object. What is our brain generating or doing to make stuff move?
<br />

<br />
Those questions are still unanswered, but it's nice to know what my PK ability depends on. Nuts, bolts and strawberries.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

That frequency is to low to be heard by a human ear. You need special equipment for that.[/quote]

Crap! ive been piketing against strawberries with my parents for like... 3 years now? havent touched one. Now i gotta give that up and still just say &quot;taste buds change&quot;  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> they really arent that bad, i kinda like em, just too much trouble. no more, ill try some.

			i just simply copied and pasted this information from one of the websites given in other threads.

<br />
they say the frequency is the range of the gravitational vibration.. and the fact that our mind can replicate and produce such frequencies is to some use of what ACTUALLY does something. 
<br />

as for the people asking what EXACTLY is happening in our head/mind/etc.. is that your nerveous system is transffering some sort of &quot;tune&quot;

So it's saying the iron has to work with the right genetic traits...

			It's BS.  He's using math that is stupidly and needlessly complicated (the derivative of an integral from x to a constant is simply the function to be integrated with x=x), and he doesnt at all describe how he intends to express things like visual contact numerically.
<br />

<br />
What the hell is that long equation involving unsimplified, first-year calculus anyways?  Is he saying that TK is dependent on only ONE variable, x?  Because that alone made me look more closely only to find it's all a huge, steaming pile of BS.
