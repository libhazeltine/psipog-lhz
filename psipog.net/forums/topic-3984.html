			For some unknown reason, im becoming very skeptical of this Pk stuff, even though ive been doing it myself, im kinda like half skeptic, half believer now. But theres so many people that raise valid points about how Pk cannot exist, and not many that raise valid points about it existing, ive noticed on the Kieth Mayes Tk forum that he raises valid points (yes he does insult a lot aswell, which isnt very helpful, i know), but ive noticed that most Pker's arent really coming up with 'solidly' valid points, i do still believe in Pk, but i was thinking a minute ago, couldnt it just be our subconcious playing tricks, like hallucinations, even if its caught on video, couldnt it be like hysteria, like a mass hallucination. I still have 'faith' (i hate to use that word) in Tk, but there are some good points posed by the Skeptics.

			It would have to affect all of the senses too. If you feel something, move it and feel where it used to be, you won't feel it. Even try making the object you are moving affect other objects, like pushing them as it goes along. That can be pretty convincing if you think it's hallucinations.

			I am a half beliver, what i mean is i don't completely belive, i think some of it is just sad, like someone said controlling the weather like what the hell man, but i belive in ki healing (or reiki) i belive in aura and i think i belive in ki balls or as u lot call it psi balls (same thing). although i think u have to feel a ki ball not really sure how imagining it helps.

			? The concepts overlap, but it seems like the aplication tends to differ. From what I hear people say ki is green and is stronger. When making a psi ball occasionally when I have a really good day and when it's strong I can see a green outline. I find energy is all the same, but it can move in different amounts and frequencys.

			Putting in my 2 cents, in this book of magick it talks about magicians altering reality and the future and changing event's, for example, casting a &quot;spell&quot; to make someone who is annoying lose their voice and actually having it happen, well someone could say &quot;It's a coincidence!&quot; then the book states that &quot;I'm sure a magician would be content to be able to create coincidents at will&quot;, I know people here disdain magick but I used it for the quote. I like that statement, and it makes sense to me <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> .

			I see your point, but alot of my experiances when messing with psi didn't do what I was thinking at all. Alot of them were explained by sombody somewhere else who points to other people having similar successes. One of my favorite moments which solidified my beleif in psiballs was when I attempted to use psi to help me see dreams. Instead of going into my head it built up and made my face sweat the exact opposite of what I was thinking.

			PSI stuff will never be proven wrong. but then no one will prove that i don't have an invisible martian sitting beside me right now either.
<br />

<br />
I'm not saying that PSI is real or not, I'm just saying that such things can only be proven, you cant disprove something that doesn't exist (if psi didn't exist you wouldn't be able to disprove it)
<br />

<br />

<br />
So in conclusion the world will never be able to point anyone towards the conclusive answer to the big question of whether its real or not, its a choice you have to make on your own, even if PSI doesn't exist, at least you will have learned to have controlled hallucinations  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />
