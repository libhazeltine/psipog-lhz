			On a stormy night, would it be possible to call lightning to a specific location? I don't plan on practising it, i'm just curious after reading up on Peebrain's experience with lightning.

			i think it probably would be possible..i dont know anyone that could do it, but it is..why wouldnt it be? using PK you could make the cloud go to there..

			Definitely. If you can make a cloud, you can make it rain. If you can make it rain, you can make lightning. But you should be able to do those things first, and that is a secret that is not widely known.

			Well, if people can do electrokinesis, why not use it go guide a lightning down there? Lightnings are just the cloud discharging the excess energy to balance the difference with the ground, it always takes the easy way. So if you could make that easy way, it will follow it. Maybe the easiest would be trying to raise part of the energy on the ground, it will work if doesn't have anything much higher close (including you), the higher you raise, the higher the chance.

			Yup, and if you got nervous and suddenly felt a nice big surge of energy and well then maybe the lightening would strike you!  That could be the reason people get struck in the first place, excess energy... then again what do I know about this... <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			Well if you created everything from scratch it would take a lot of energy, especially when you start giving the cloud a massage in order to generate a charge.
<br />

<br />
I think the best way to go would be to project a large amount of energy,   during a storm, towards your target, maybe even program it to especially attract the lightning.  This should work ala Peebrain's article on shielding, <a href="art-fire-and-ice.html8" target="_blank" class="postlink">art-fire-and-ice.html8</a>, where he used a diffuse shield to make sure the lightning didn't hit him.

			Create lightning? No. Anyone who's opened a physics book (or even seen &quot;Back to the Future&quot;) knows that lightning has a huge amount of energy. I'd put creating lightning up there with &quot;true invisibility,&quot; &quot;psi swords,&quot; and &quot;materialization.&quot; I know some of you want to show off what a 1337 s0rc3r3r you are by mimicking &quot;Call Lightning,&quot; but it's not going to happen. Maybe some day down the road, someone will invent some device that exponentially increases psionic abilities in humans, but for now, give it up and stick with rolling that pencil (as you can actually get somewhere with that).
<br />

<br />
Targeting lightning? Possibly. If you knew lightning was going to strike, you could use psychokinesis to move electrons to or from different objects/places, and cause them to group up in different areas, creating different charges, which would cause the lightning to strike differently. Keep in mind that you would need to know when/if lightning is going to strike, as it would be improbable to the extreme to create it psionically, and you would need to know approximately where it was going to hit (after all, lightning isn't going to jump halfway across the U.S. because it can't find a nearby spot to strike). Also, an acceptable level of knowledge on how exactly lightning works would be incredibly useful. Reading Peebrain's shielding article, I would say although creating lightning is in the area of fluffbunnies, causing the lightning to strike differently is completely possible. It would just depend on the psion's skill level.

			Here's an important clue to manifesting lots of physical phenomena.
<br />

<br />
Physical Reality and your Imagination (dot) (dot) (dot) have no (dot) (dot) (dot) &quot;direct link&quot;. Therefore it is unnecessary to perform psychokinesis (dot) (dot) (dot) scientifically. It is unnecessary to say or think when calling lightning that you will call down a million electrons and direct their movement at a super speed etc. etc. Or say for &quot;Invisibility&quot; that you will bend light around you and continue to imagine that actually light particles are going around you. This will complicate and inhibit your ability to perform your powers or whatever. It will also cause doubt which also inhibits your ability while performing. So it is best to keep your methods simple. Do you really think that reality cares whether you moves the electrons one by one or in a stream? If you think so then there infinite details of physics to go through and infinite worries to take care of.
<br />

<br />
Mystics in ancient times did not have knowledge of particle physics or of the nature of lightning or gravity or the laws of energy etc. Yet they still were able to call lightning and wind, roam about unseen, levitate etc. Therefore it is not necessary to imagine excessively. Just let your subconscious handle it, with its massive stores of sensory information and its accumulation over time it will understand what to do far more then you can consciously grasp.

			No, mystics did not call down lightning. Nobody has ever called down lightning without use of technology. How many animes and comic books do you have to read until you start believeing this stuff?

			I've made a huge lightning bolt and really loud thunder appear in a rain storm. I'll never forget that night. I was practicing Tk; and I got pissed the psi wheel wouldn't move and I strained and concentrated my hardest and in like 2 seconds the loudest thunder of the night and the brightest lightning of the night occured. It scared me so I went to bed. But I dont know about calling lightning...
