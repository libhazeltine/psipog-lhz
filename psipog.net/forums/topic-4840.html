			I aasked this question a long time ago. I am 12 years old and I still dont know about telling my parents about psi. I have spun the psi wheel a couple of times. And after a weeks worth of practice I sorta brought the subject up. I asked my dad, &quot;Do you think people could move objects with there mind&quot; ( I didnt go into much detail, and he said &quot;No, Newtons laws state that it isnt true, and it is just un realistic...&quot;
<br />

<br />
So do you think I should tell my parents. Or Shouldnt I? Take my poll too and answer the question in a comment and explain. Because I really sensed some anger in his emotions when he responded, (dont ask). Also how do you think he will react to it if I show him it after I get more expierenced?
<br />

<br />
Thanks
<br />

<br />
Jacob

			you can tell him you have been reading into it
<br />
it implies that you havent tried, but are interested, then gauge his response
<br />

<br />
good luck, i told my father about it, and he told me it was possible
<br />
i got lucky =D

			I can't tell you whether or not you should.
<br />

<br />
It's a matter of trust you have with your parents and how they are and how they respect you. It's only up to you.
<br />
 
<br />
I never told my parents because it's non of their buisness.

			I told my parents of my interest.
<br />

<br />
Of course, I've got one of those cool families that are not only tight-knit, but...
<br />

<br />
My father has a history of mild precog. (Mom says he foresaw an out-of-control truck coming and got out of the way just in time to not get hit.)
<br />

<br />
My Grandmother on my father's side was great with Telepathic suggestion, I've heard that she could influence other drivers for my grandfather's sake.
<br />

<br />
So my family does not deny psychic ability. In fact, my parents buy me books on psychic ability.
<br />

<br />
So yeah, I told my parents and they're fine with it. But again, that falls under the whole trust thing. I trust them to respect my beliefs, they trust me not to kill myself doing stupid stuff, we're all good.
<br />

<br />
So basically, telling your parents is up to you, and itdepends on your relationship first. But it might be good to start hypothetically.

			well, I guess I am lucky because both my parents (especially my mom) have really open minds.  My mom told me that she really believes in PK so I have told her and my dad about me practicing but since I am  not good enough yet, I have not actually shown my parents any  thing yet.

			I've personally told my parents about it and I'm 13, the only thing I was worried about is them thinking I was in a cult or I was  a devil worshiper or something, but when I told them they really didn't seem to care, but I think they just didn't beleive me.  I don't care if they beleive me or not though because in my eyes I know it's real, so don't be bummed if they don't beleive you man.  Hope it helps.
