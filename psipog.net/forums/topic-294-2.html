			I havent told them anything, and i had been prcticing psionics for 6 months. My mother is very catholic and i think it will take her alot of time to accept all of this stuff, but my father wont really care about it. So, i think i will wait more time, and then i will tell them.
<br />
My other problem is that i have 4 brothers and i don?t really want them to look at me like im crazy  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			When I was younger I had pretty good pre-cog and empathic skills.  Not knowing any better I thought that everyone had the same skills, but quickly learned otherwise after talking to my family about it.  Thy said I was just imagining things, and such.
<br />
I tried to prove it to them by telling them things that were going 2 happen, but they always said it was coincidence.  Eventually I stopped believing in my skills.
<br />

<br />
Now that I have ?rediscovered? psi, I don?t think I will be telling my parents about it.  If I am ever able to create any solid proof of psi, I may consider telling them.  But I doubt it.

			Before I told my mother about my belief and practice with psionics I used biblical texts and common sense logic to hint at psionics being a real and good thing with my mom. After having her read the Rowan series from Anne McCaffrey I told her my interest in the abilities and the fact that I was one. She didn't freak out and to my relief she accepted it and now we both practice and tell each other of our progress.
<br />

<br />
As for my father I used biblical texts again to prove precognition and then stemmed off to other abilities. He accepted those abilities and the fact that they can be used for good. I told him that I was a psychic but I know he didn't quite understand what I was saying. I think he was a bit in denial though he was given evidence and sound logic it was hard for him to accept it for his child just in case it was &quot;of the devil&quot;. However I think he does believe I'm precognitive as the bible would put it-a prophet or seer. If he can accept me for that it's enough.

I might tell them if I start geisting objects off tables into walls, but that hasn't happen yet.

			I wrote a short story about how my parents found out in a different forum.  Here is the story.  It is kinda long but bear with me:
<br />

<br />
Ok, this was a couple months ago. I was on psipog reading a new article about OBE's by peebs. Anyway, I got off my computer and I take out my pinwheel to practice some tk warmups. So i am moving it pretty easily. Just as the fan stops moving on my computer (it is a laptop and a loud fan. It also takes a long time to shut down), my mom comes in. I am surprised so i do that twitch thing when you are surprised and my mom said &quot;what are you doing?&quot; Of course I answer, &quot;nothing!&quot;. While putting away my pinwheel (making it look like it was homework) she asks &quot;what were you doing on the computer?&quot; (i have gotten caught multiple times playing games on the internet so now she expects it) I answer again, &quot;nothing&quot;. She makes me turn it on (because she couldn't find the power button...) and in a desperite attempt to hide my secret (practicing psionics) I say that I was sorry and I tell her what I was doing (not really though). Since I have been caught playing GAMES, i took her to miniclip and showed her what I wanted her to believe i was doing. I knew I was going to be in trouble anyway (and I was smart enough to erase history) so I didn't try to fight it. Then, she said &quot;I am going to go get your father&quot; (he is good at computers and can do pretty much anything). She comes back with my dad and he sits at my computer and goes into TEMPORARY INTERNET FILES!!!!!! I am sitting on my bed thinking &quot;oh shit (pardon my language). Since the folder for temp. internet files only hold pictures and sound clips, he sees the Psipog.net banner. He asks me what this is and I say it is a game (while sweating hugely!). And of course, HE GOES TO IT! He sees it and reads a couple things. Then he goes to the articles and sees telepathy, telekinesis, and many other things. He did not say anything (which normally means he is extremely mad) and he shut down my computer and goes into his room. His door slams..... I hear talking and yelling. My parents come out and come into my room and tell me to go to bed. my mom yanked the computer (remember it is a laptop that is plugged it) off of my desk. Which breaks the plug and stomps down the stairs. My dad said in a fierce voice &quot;You are not going to school tomorrow.&quot; I am thinking &quot;wow, they must be really upset to take me out of school!&quot; I am so afraid to talk that I am just sitting there nodding. So i go to sleep.
<br />

<br />
The next day, I wake up at like 8:30 (school starts at 8:00). I wake up by my mom screaming at me to get up and my dad flipping the mattress on me. I get up and get dressed and they take me in a car. Guess where they took me....the church. I got there and my minister (Kieth) was waiting for us and he took me into a room where it was just him and me. He asked me if i was trying to get the power of the devil and i am still shaking my head (cant talk). He asked me if I could do it and I (being stupid and wanted to stand up for something) said yes. He sat back and walked out of the room. Then, after a few minutes, all 3 of them (Kieth, and parents) came into the room. They got me back into the car and drove off. My mom made a phone call to a psychiatrist. So we go there and I tell her the same things plus a little more. She explains to me that it is impossible and a couple other things. she leaves the room about 1 and a half hours after i entered and comes back later. I go home and my parents are talking about this piece of paper that my dad is holding. I try to see it but he is waving it around and everything. I ask if I can see it and this is mainly what I saw (there was other stuff but this is the jist of it:
<br />

<br />
Christopher Clark King
<br />
Mentally Harmed
<br />

<br />
That is the story of me and my psychiatrist. I hope you enjoyed it. There were more details but I am about out of time to write this and I think it is long enough so comment about that crappy day.

			Wow! I read the whole thing.
<br />

<br />
My whole family (including myself) are all christians, but i hoenstly don't think that &quot;psionics&quot; have to alter my spiritual beliefs at all. I have refrianed from telling them though, i can imagin something just like what happened to you, happening to me. I don't go into all that &quot;hoo-doo and witchcraft&quot; stuff, but  in my opinion psionics is more like a languagem kinda like learning latin or something really hard lol. 
<br />

<br />
lol and guess who got me into all this psi stuff, my Dad!!!
<br />
He didn't mean too, he just showed me this article in a magazine about this person claming to bend silerware using his mind, he thought it was all a hoax but I used faithfull ol' google and thats how i got on this road lol.

Technically, if you're a Christian (I am!), you can't really doubt psionics, without doubting God. Remember the phrase &quot;With God all things are possible.&quot; Next time your parents try to pull the whole &quot;power of the devil&quot; card, tell them that.
<br />
&lt;/religiousness&gt;
<br />

<br />
Also, you could have a lot of fun with a psychiatrist. Ask them about their mother, or try to psychoanalyze them and explain their behavior to them.
<br />

<br />
My parents don't know, and I have no intention of letting them know. Mainly because of the 'uncool' factor. We were watching something on TV, and someone on the show we were watching said something about &quot;transmitting a healing energy,&quot; and my mom started talking about auras and stuff like that. I almost wanted to throw up. However, if they did find out, they would probably be accepting. My dad's point of view on things is usually &quot;If it's not illegal, unnecissarily mean, or harmful, then it's okay.&quot;

A fe of My friends know, We're all wierd but all belive in psi and stuff like that and all have experienced it.

Wow...Just, wow. Are you serious?
<br />

<br />
Anyways. I haven't told my parents. I plan on getting my telekenesis working very well and then spring it on them with an unexpected demonstration (ie - randomly start spinning a fork or something during dinner). It will be funny to see their reactions.
<br />

<br />
They aren't very religious and I don't think they'll call a psychiatrist. My bet is that they'll encourage me. Well, hopefully.

Good point, if they ever find out i'll definatly have to pull that one, i'd better go find it in the bible so I can give them the exact location. Might look better to them if it appears i put some wholesome thought into it before jumping crazily in. (which is what i usually do  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> )

			I started on and off about a year and a half ago. I stopped for awhile but i'm trying to get back into it. I haven't told my parents or the rest of my family yet that i'm psionic but i probobly will when I can produce solid evidence. My moms a doctor and she scoffs at &quot;chi&quot; and &quot;meridians&quot; etc... So that kinda turns me off the idea of telling her. But my dad is a practicioner of Internal martial arts so he might not think its so rediculous. Plus I kinda enjoy nobody knowing. Its my lil secret <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

That is a great idea!!!!  I will try that next time my parent think I am crazy.  The good part that comes out of that story is now I am &quot;Mentally Harmed&quot; so I get extra time on the SAT's and ACT's!
