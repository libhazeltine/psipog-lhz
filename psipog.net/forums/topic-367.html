			Martial Arts, in general, are much more than sports- really, only Judo, TaeKwonDo, Kumite Martial Arts(they were designed as sports to my understanding), and SanShou are 'sports'. The rest are ways of life- much deeper than most athletes to their respective sports- for those who study them; far from the sport arts mentioned above. 
<br />

<br />
My question is: Do you agree with me that martial arts are more than mere sports? Why or why not?

Taekwon Do is a full on sport. Our club emphisized training for tournaments and stuff like that. Jiu Jitsu was more of an art and really wasn't a sport at all. It was both self defense (more so than TKD) and a philosophy on life.

TKD is no use in real life... I've seen the results of that match-up, but every now and then there is a decent dojang for it, so, it's mostly sport-oriented, with little emphasis on actual self defense.
<br />

<br />
JuJUtsu was designed as a defensive art, so it'll definately be more effective in real life... but BJJ(Brazillian Jujutsu) is by far the most effective groundfighting style. Muy(Muay) Thai is considered the most effective standup style, though I disagree for personal reasons.

			Martial arts are not just &quot;sports&quot;; Where as yes, they do have some sports activity like olympic games. But there is far more to learning a martial art than just &quot;self-defense&quot;. Theoretically, it is very impractical to learn a martial art. In urban societies, if you are looking for a fight, odds are that the person most likely to just want to pick a fight is armed with some type of weapon.

I'm not saying the self-defense aspect of martial arts does not exist; Because it does, and can be very useful. You don't learn a martial art just to be able to fight, unless you are ignorant to the path of personal development and master.

			Most Martial Arts are much more than Sports. 
<br />

<br />
I've studied Karate and Jyu Jitsu for a long time and I have found them to be almost ways of life. Infact the proper name for Karate is 'Karate-do', which means Path/Way of the empty hand, implying more than just self-defense/sport. Some of the more traditional martial arts like Aikido can also be very spiritual.
<br />

<br />
Sure, some Martial Arts are sport-orientated but to think they all were would surely be naive.

Exactly... which is why some martial arts schools now are teaching to cope with modern knives, and how to best your odds of surviving a gun- they are adapting, as everything else is. I agree, though, weapons today are different, and that requires adaptations to the martial arts, which are beggining.
<br />

<br />
_Exception_: Aikido isn't exactly 'traditional' in the traditional sense... Daito-Ryu Aikijujutsu is, which is the main base for Aikido. I have begun Aikido recently, so I decided to learn a bit about Morihei Ueshiba and the origins of Aikido <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
It's nice to see people here who actually know something about the martial arts; those who voted no have yet to explain themselves.

Well I guess it varies from Dojo to Dojo, however in my limited experiences with it it was quite traditional. We had to always use formal Japanese and the importance of 'Ki' was heavily stressed etc. 
<br />

<br />
We also had to bow to a picture of Ueshiba at the start and end of each session (I don't know if this is normal but it struck me and somewhat strange, I had never done so in any other Martial Art) - Some schools have even been said to be 'cult like' in their respect to Ueshiba.

By traditional I mean it's not as offense-oriented as most styles... and the respect for Ueshiba can be cult-like in some places, and I know why- he was rumored to be able to dodge bullets(Though this is not something I take to highly to- I think he was a VERY lucky man).

			Having studied traditional shotokan karate and kick boxing i have to say it really varies from dojo to dojo and teacher to teacher. Some will learn for sport. Others will learn to be more focused with there body and raise there awareness. In general i beleive the idea behind oriental traditional martial arts and the balance of ones body is what makes that kind of martial art special. Just as the greeks said, healthy body, healthy mind.

			I'm agree with you, some of them are more than sports.
<br />
An example is Kung Fu, they teach you how to use chi, and they also teach you how to gather chi between your hands (thats what we call psiballs) and how to manipulate it. Also they use chi to punch harder.
<br />
i had also heard that the master that teach kung fu in my city knows how to move things with his mind (telekinesis).
