			Up until today I had been working on the Psi Wheel for a week now, and was having moderate sucess (frequent wiggling and an occasional turn or two in the clockwise direction). While I did believe it was my own doing, like many beginners (I'm assuming) I was not entirely certain, having no definitive proof that gusts of wind were not the cause of the wheel's sudden spurts of motion. And then it hit me! When practicing with a psi wheel, one will be working in one of two possible environments; either a setting that is completely airtight or one that allows for the leakage of occasional air currents. Because the former is difficult to create, let alone varify, I decided to work from the other extreme, creating an environment in which I knew that a gust of wind was responsible for the wheel's turning. Using a low powered fan about seven feet away, I created a steady stream of air directed at the psi wheel, causing it to spin counterclockwise at a moderate pace. Rather than attept to get the psi wheel to spin as most do, I decided to oppose it's motion, willing it to spin in a direction opposite to that which it was currently spinning (clockwise). While I had no sucess at first, I eventually managed to slow it signifiganly several times, and even briefly get it to a near stop once or twice. 
<br />

<br />
So there you have it. While I imagine most will stick to the traditional spinning of the psi wheel, I encourage all beginners to try this new (as far as I know) method. In addition to providing a somewhat more stable environment, I feel that it my also help concentrate one's focus (only a theory), providing a constant, opposing force that must be overcome. 
<br />
I'll be sure to inform y'all If I make any progress or alterations to the method.
<br />

<br />
For now, feel free to comment, critique or <span style="font-style: italic">Flame</span> as you see fit.

Cheers, Redrod

			I think that sounds like a great idea.  There are not many things that could mess with that test.  Sounds good and I want to try it out now.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			thats a great idea
<br />
when I spin my psi wheel, i always try to start spinning it fairly fast then reverse the direction quickly, but this seems like it will be much more challenging...i'm gunna give it a try right now <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			YES! I had much more success with this method! Thanks for the idea!! I think this method works a lot better because the Psiwheel keeps speeding up and slowing down, when it was slowing down, I was thinking &quot;I'm doing it! I'm making it slow down!&quot; and then it stopped and went the other way.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
