			I had this cool Idea Ok combat is a no no at pog but sometimes it does happen and everyone says sheild or learn to sheild now I know for a fact I had trouble sheilding when I first started and when I did do it they were vary week So what if we make a group of people who are good at sheilding and Then when some one says im being attacked or something combat related this group could sheild the person as to help them and set an example that if something like this happens theres no need to use offensive techs.Is this makeing sense?Well its just an Idea so add your comments or nag at it as you please.

			Why?  What is in it for the shielders?  what is the point of it?  The person is not getting attacked.  And if they are, they pissed someone off so they deserve it.

My advice is don't rely on psi too much because as you probably already found out you need A LOT of practice to do something that would even remotely be visible in the physical point of view. Instead, if you want to master self-defense go find a martial arts club, it's much more reliable than this theory of yours. And will do you more good in long term speaknig.

peace ?

			I know you have good intentions, but this idea is very bad.
<br />

<br />
Nine times out of ten, a newbie will come along and feel the slightest prick on the back of his neck, and announce to the world that he's being psychically attacked and needs immediate assistance.  Nine tenths of the remaining one tenth actually have a real attack... but the attacker has no clue what they're doing, and isn't accomplishing anything other than making the target paranoid.  So 1% of the people who claim to need help actually might need help.  In those cases - that person probably did something to piss off the attacker.  I'm not saying they deserve being attacked, but chances are neither person is &quot;innocent&quot;.

			Stuff like this also comes from shows like DBZ. And other shows with people and super powers that supposivly somehow link to psi, psiballs, constructs, stuff like that. So to some people, the thought of psi immeadiatly brings up &quot;Oooh, I can make balls of fire in my hands from energy! Bwuaaha.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I wish people would just realize psi is a friendly thing. ;P
