			last time after i barely woke up, (still laying on my bed)i tried using PK to move my t.v.'s antenna, i was able to make the antenna shake a bit after like 20 minutes, but then when i got up from bed and tried to walk forward i felt as if i couldn't control my legs anymore (and yes, i almost fell), i think that it had something to do with me concentrating for so long. I was wondering if someone here could tell me if thats normal or why did it happen

			Weird, I've never heard of that. I've heard of sleep paralysis, but you said you woke. Maybe concentrating like that isn't a good idea if you just barely woke up. Who knows, maybe doing that could cause/trigger temporary paralysis. I don't have a Ph.D in human physiology, let alone know how human psycology can affect the body, so I'm just making guesses here.

			I remember that I could move my legs before concentrating because after I woke up I turned the other way where I was facing my t.v.

			I don't think it's psionics related. It could just be a leg thing. I get it sometimes. And I've never heard of anyone tieing it into psionics before.

 Try and do the exact same thing another day, and experiment. Not really important, but see what happens. I have had that leg feeling and it just collapses underneath you. I suppose it depends on your energy reserves and how much your body has circulated around. You might not have given your body enough time to wake itself up and get it's limbs in gear. Did you stretch? Might have been that you didn't stretch and muscles were feeling a little too loose. It's like lifting weights that are too heavy for you to your legs. The same thing happens; you drop the weight.

			Yeah, I think thats probably what happened because it was right after I woke up. I tied it to it because when I was stumbling, I felt as if my brain was shutting down, everything turned dark really fast, I tought that I was going to pass out, but I didn't. It was like if I was watching someone else fall, it was a pretty weird feeling.

You were defintely blacking out. That's a certainty. Good that you managed not to. I blacked out a couple weeks ago in my business studies lesson. It felt EXACTLY like what you described. Like a dream and that it didn't matter, it wasn't you....sort of feeling. Apparentely I hit my head, but didn't feel a thing.

			I think you're right, thanks for the help. Another thing, I haven't been able to make the psi wheel do a whole turn, I can make it move with almost no effort, but everytime I move the psi wheel, it only moves back and forth.
