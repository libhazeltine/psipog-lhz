daniel: it seems to me that you didnt really care for the spiral sweep suggestion. personally, i'm not either for nor against chakras (i havent gathered a definitive opinion on the subject), but when i used the spiral sweep to just help me relax, it worked. i didnt take much of that other information into consideration (honestly, i dont even think i was paying attention to what she was saying when she was explaining the different chakras, i just sat there in blank meditation). 
<br />
if anything, i use that meditation now to help with manipulating psi.

i understand the mod's job is to keep this community running smoothly. i think the back and fourth bickering can get a little annoying though. i understand where both of you are coming from. i just want this to smooth over so we can get back to the topic  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

   I suggest you find a teacher. How old are you? If you can't then we can look together and find you something. What exactly are you looking for anyway?
<br />

<br />
   Anyway, sorry about derailing the topic. I'll respond to his crap/whatever else at the end of these posts.

   Aren't you new to psionics? Psionics isn't meditation or anything, but I assume you don't know much about topics like this. Maybe you do. Do you?
<br />

<br />
   I don't believe in chakras myself. Meditation helps me do psionics easier. So does hitting a punching bag or doing some puzzles though.
<br />

<br />
   Yeah, but not much else was going on. Think of it as a crappy bump.

			well no i'm not new to psionics. i'm 18. i've been trying to meditate for about a year. i've been working on it every now and then. i'm kinda lazy with it though. i'm not consistent, but i can meditate for about 10 - 30 mins.
<br />

<br />
well what i'm looking for are just tapes or any kind of audio that leads in meditation. i notice i meditate much better under guided meditation.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Help you in what way though? Give you commands like &quot;Relax, relax. Now imagine...&quot;? Or just some relaxing music in a certain pattern? Give us more information please.
<br />

<br />
   Those Buddhist monk guys have some pretty good stuff. There are a number of decent trance music stations online too.

			Lollers Daniel. You are a real jackass. I know alot of people like you. If you can't do or have what the other person has, you say shit to them. Admit it, you have no psionic abilities, and because of that you take your anger out on everyone else. If you keep this up, everyone might just find another forum or even start one of theirs. I wonder how you got admin. I wonder what the other Mod's have to say about this.

At first, I was going to say, &quot;That's a little harsh...&quot; Then I read the topic, and you're right. Psipog is closing down anyways, so it does not matter. I do not understand his dislike for Martial Artist. He has posted many informative posts that have helped many with various topics, and he certainly knows a shitload on Meditation and the like.
<br />

<br />
DanielH - Many of your posts simply attacked his beliefs, and were just completely unnecessary. So, you don't believe in what MA says. If you do not like him, then why respond to him? I usually avoid people I do not like. If you don't like someone, there is no reason in the world to talk to them. Also, it is extremely childish to call someone a 'stupid idiot' by using PMs. It's extremely childish to do it at all, actually, PMs or not. I thought you were intelligent, most of your posts point to this, but after reading this thread, hell no. You're the stupid one. Grow up. Do you get paid for your 'job' as mod? Then why does it matter so much, especially with the forums closing down soon?
<br />

<br />
You think anything spiritual is mumbo-jumbo, it seems, but this is the way that Peebrain is going, with the new site and all, and you're taking out your anger for Peebrain doing that on Martial Artist. He's entitled to his opinion, just as you and I are. There is no difference. Just because you have a blatant dislike for him, you single him out, just because his beliefs and experiences are different than yours.
<br />

<br />

<br />
This is no longer directed at DanielH, but anyone who practices psionics, especially energy manipulation, and is skeptical of chakras. The people who seem to not believe in chakras seem to be the ones who were skeptical of all this 'psionic' talk when they were first exposted to it. 
<br />

<br />
They learned to accept psionics, but then that is all they think is there, in dealing with psychic energies. How can one not believe in chakras, when they use them everyday for things like energy manipulation? Your chakras are just the energy centres that create the energy known as psi. Training the chakras allows you to create more of this energy. Chakra meditation is very much essential if you wish to go further in psionics. Chakra meditation simply develops your energy centres, allowing them to create more psi, and to let this unique energy flow better through your body.
<br />

<br />
I believed that psionics were real, as it seems absurd for such wide-spread ideas to have no validity whatsoever. The same can be said for chakras. The idea of chakras is apparent in every single culture in the world. Doesn't that say something? Do a search on chakras, or simply on nerve bundles. You will get a large amount of good information.
<br />

<br />
Those who blind themselves by science simply limit their development. Science is meant to be an aid. Not a law. Old theories are thrown out every day, as they are replaced with new ones. Psionics used to be considered witchcraft. Now it is in the field of paranormal phenomenon.
<br />

<br />
The only thing I am saying is, when I focus on chakras, it increases my psi generation abilities. At each supposed chakra point, there is a bundle of nerves, called ganglions, as well as major endocrine glands.
<br />

<br />
I do not care if others do not believe in chakras, but it may be percieved that I am 'imposing' my opinions as fact. I know they are my opinions. Just making this clear to avoid any confusion, which these forums seem to be massively infused with.
<br />

<br />
This ended up quite long.... heh.
<br />

<br />
That meditative sound file was quite relaxing, and will help to further my meditation.
