			17 (18 soon) and started around Decemeber, stopped for a while, and started again when the forums went up.
<br />

<br />
edit: Also, why did you decide to do it?
<br />

<br />
I was introduced to the whole concept through a link from a forum I go to which linked to another forum which linked to here. I try to keep an open mind about things like this and at first I was pretty skeptical and thought maybe these people had too much free time (I'm sure some of you do, though). It was interesting so I decided to read further into it. After reading about it it didn't seem as far fetched as before and I decided to try it.
<br />

<br />
Right now I'm making small amounts of progress and, as if I'm right, can pool a bit of psi into my hands. I'm still having trouble shaping it though.

			I'm 17.. and I've been doing it for just 2 months. I was lying in bed thinking with my hands kind of cupped and my fingers separated (just a random hand habit I picked up from a friend from her 'thinking mood') and I could feel something between my hands. I played with it for awhile, tested it out. Not having any idea what was happening.. it was exciting. I googled a lot and asked around to find out what I was doing, and now I know and here I am..

			Hey, I'm going to be 17 this Feb 1'st and I've been practicing for about three years now. I've been empathetic all my life but I thought it was the norm for everybody (btw I didn't have many friends in my early years XP). Once I met more people and realized they couldn't do it, I started to to research it online. It was in a completely un-empathy-related instance that I found Psipog. I was actually inquiring to someone about their knowledge in the field of Pyrokinesis and got directed here. Oh, speaking of which, whats everyone's take on that? Anyone experienced in that field?

Ive been into the paranormal and the link since I was inredibly young. It started out for the most part when I was 12 and could sense people behind me which I found weird at the time. I then went for 4 years without an internet connection or explanation for what was happening. I then got the connection back and delved into what we all know and love.
