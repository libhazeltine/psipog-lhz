			I would have to agree with Nick. The physical has very little to do with your succes in tk. In fact the physical does not decide at all wether you are good at tk or not. You do that, right? The outside physical world does only decide your ability in tk, if you believe <span style="font-weight: bold">in your mind</span>, that the physical does decide your ability in tk. So then again, it would be in the mind, even though you think it is the physical. That is because you <span style="font-style: italic">think</span> in your <span style="font-style: italic">mind</span> about the physical. Does that make sense? <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I know it starts to sound a little clich?, but it is indeed your mind that blocks you to do certain things. Or it can allow you to do a little, but actually the mind is not the thing I would like to explore, I would rather like to make the mind function as a tool rather than and obstacle, in my progress to the understanding of a deeper reality. Since the mind will always limit you. So I am taming it, to become a tool that helps me rather than blocks me. When you trancend the mind with your consciousness, tk will be alot easier. 
<br />

<br />
People often answer the question what is telekinesis? with: moving stuff with your mind. But actually it is not the mind that is moving the object, it is your consciousness. You mind is rather like a gate. On one side of the gate, you have the world of matter and physics etc. On the other site of the gate, is the non-materialistic world. That is where the potential of your consciousness lies. The amount of potential you have to use your abilties, depend on how much your gate(mind) is opened. The more this gate is opened, the more light of the potential of your consciousness can shine through this gate. If it is very closed, then you will live like most of society is living: like a helpless victim of the physical world. If it is completely open, you are free. With all the benefits that come with it.
<br />

<br />
So that is why alot of people say: <span style="font-weight: bold">be open-minded.</span> It is actually ment quite literally. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

so what you are saying is that, if one is obease with lack of oxygen going to your brain from all the fat, you can still do PK better then a healthy person? especially if one has a stroke causing brain damage.
<br />

<br />
seems like physical fitness has a part of it, plus those who aren't lazy usually progress faster.

			Yes that's exactly what I am saying. First off all, The subtle energies used in order to move something, don't have anything to do with fat. I know a view fat people (very fat) who are into tk, and they are actually quite talented it seems. So really the physical fat, does not make tk much more difficult. Only if that is a belief in your mind.
<br />

<br />
And second, you say those who aren't lazy, usually progress fatoo. But would you agree that laziness has everything to do with your mind and mindstate? When it comes to the physical part, then perhaps most fat people are more lazy, but that doesn't mean that they have to be lazy on a mental level.
