			In my mind, the only reason it would hurt is if you have a lack of concentration.  Think about it, you're moving your hand through the gaps between the atoms of whatever your phasing through.  If you don't focus it probably will hurt.  I've been trying it for a couple of days and all I've got so far is the objects go kind of soft.

			I think phasing is a very interesting subject and I would definitely like to help you look into it. In fact, I think I phased accidentally at school today. I had a wrapper from a muesli bar or something, and I threw it into the bin. It went right through the bin and came out the other side. Luckily, the only two people who saw me were my friends, and both knew about psionics. They were watching me strangely going &quot;what the hell did you just do?&quot; I told them I had accidentally phased, so I introduced them to phasing and that's that.

			LEEMCGAVINJOEY i've read in a couple places you sayin you've accidentally phased through your bed, floor then living room ceiling at night....not that im saying your lying but im a little skeptical. 1st off how do you know your phasing if your asleep?? How do you know your not just sleep walking....2nd after getting through your floor/living room ceiling, your couch would have to be directly under you to land on it...and even if it was wouldn't the impact of falling from the ceiling onto your back or whatever wake you up????...and 3rd if you phased that far in your sleep what kept you from phasing even farther through your living room couch/floor??...i'm just saying are sure you're not just sleep walking to the couch at night??????????

I'll do some attempts today and report if I get anything.

			I don't see why everyone thinks it is so dangerous and why some people here believe it can kill you if you put your chest through something or whatever. Where is there proof that what they say will happen, will happen?

			That's why we must study it further.  So far the only person I've ever heard of doing it with credibility is Rainsong.  That's who said it hurt, but she came upon it accidentally so it's not certain that it does infact hurt all the time.  We can't just take the testimony of one person as absolute truth.  The only way to really understand this ability is through trial and quite possibly error.  As most of you can tell googling 'phasing' won't bring up anything relevant.  We are pioneers marking the way for future generations here, so let's do it right.  Sorry for being all talkative, but I'm bored.  As for updates, I can feel my sheilds dissapating when I try to Phase.  Now all I have to figure out is the actual going through the object part, hopefully visualazation will help me here.

Yes. I saw it go in, go through the black plastic, and then I heard it hit the ground.

			Hi, all.  I rarely read the threads in this category, and came upon this thread when looking for something else.  Seeing as I seem to have been misquoted once or twice, I figured that I might as well comment.
<br />

<br />
My chest has been phased through objects, more than once, and I am still alive.  It was decidely unpleasant, but not fatal.
<br />

<br />
It has been suggested, in this thread and previously, that it only hurt because I am unskilled in phasing.  This is entirely possible.  I am unskilled in phasing, and make no claim to the contrary.  Other people have said that it doesn't hurt when they do it.  Truthfully, it didn't _always_ hurt when I have done it, on a small scale, such as a hand going through the counter-top...just most of the time.  And the large-scale stuff hurt a lot.
<br />

<br />
If I were going to make a practical study of phasing, I'd start with inanimate objects.  There's probably less risk that way.  
<br />

<br />
Bear in mind that psionic phasing is, by definition, psychokinetic.  Therefore, it will probably affect your blood chemistry.  I'd advise that you keep a snack and something to drink handy, while you are conducting your experiments.  And don't drive or operate heavy machinery immediately afterwards, for those of you old enough to drive.
<br />

<br />
I look forward to reading about your progress.

			I know I am new (first post in fact) But I have been gorging myself on all of these articles and various threads, and found them quite interesting.  
<br />

<br />
Even though I am still working on my first (maybe more, not sure) psiball, I would love to try to work a bit with phasing and join you guys in your study.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
