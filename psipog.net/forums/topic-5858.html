			I look around and didn't find anything about OBE while already in a dream being asleep. Personaly I havent tried OBE yet still on the basics, I'm a natureal lurid dreamer but I wasnt adware of this dream. Already your most likely having either angry thoughts at me for being stupid or not reseaching or mixing things up. But I had this dream which I felt what I believe was the beginning of a OBE experience............feel free correct me if I'm wrong for posting this here or for something else.
<br />

<br />
In this dream I was on top of a desert hill, no plant life or anything around me. I wasnt fully adware I was dreaming and the thoughts keep ringing to myself &quot;I'm OBEing&quot; which part of me knew it wasnt. I look behind me what seemed like a difficult path to crawl up from. But what was behind me was lines of people cloths where my path was. This I don't strange it was happen next. I looked up at the moon and repeatly told myself I was OBE which of cource the other part told me I wasnt. But when I stop telling myself that...was a little odd. It felt like I was two different bodies in the exact same place. One in the dream and the second laying down...but it...shakeing...badly..I felt some pain. I couldnt see this body but I could feel it like when useing psi. I look up at the moon and imagine myself there. Then before I knew it the moon was getting closer and I knew I was shooting for the moon. I felt my second skin shake more and more closer I get to the moon. But as soon as it start it ended. I couldnt stand the pain and I saw the moon fly away from me while I fall back to earth.
<br />

<br />
I woke up in the middle of the earth with my head aching in pain. I felt my body shakeing still. I never bother doing OBE yet but I knew what part of my subcounoise wanted to do while being asleep...I was tired and weak. I force myself back to sleep where I had a nightmare.

			You can initiate an OBE from the dream stage, yes. It's actually a somewhat commom method for lucid dreamers to obtain an OBE.
