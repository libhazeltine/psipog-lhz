			Hey is it ok to start with telepathy. Becuase I posted a thread a few weeks ago about me and my brother being connected. 
<br />

<br />
Now my little brother is 9 and he thinks I am crazy to believe in this.
<br />

<br />
But I think its neat, anyway, Last night I read an article on telepathy, and it say like imagine the image of the person you wanna contact and &quot;scream&quot; in your mind. Like you would to get there attention. 
<br />

<br />
And So I did that and i did the guess the fruit game. (or wat eva) and he guessed what fruit i was thinking of. 
<br />

<br />
So anyway my question is that do you think that starting with telepathy would be a good thing for me, seeing as me and my brother are kind of connected or should I start with Psiballs.
<br />

<br />
Thank you abuch
<br />

PS thanks for being so tolerant of all my questions, it must be hard dealing with a 13 year old.

			Sure, psiballs are a good place to start if you want to work with manipulation(ex. PK) but, in my eyes, they aren't needed if you're starting in telepathy. I need to get working on telepathy too.

Yeah lol. Most people are cowards ANYWAY so don't expect miracles. But if it's bothering you you obviously care  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
And sure. Start with whatever you want. It's just traditonal I suppose to do the basic energy manipulation first and then &quot;move on&quot;, but if it works with what you're doing atm it's not like it really matters.

			So starting with telepathy would be nice i ALWAYS thought that you had to start with psi-balls (for some dumb reason).

What would you guys consider the most basic telepathic skill to start on?

There's no standard order, because they're all different skills... I like to think of them as the psi equivalent of exercising different muscles. You can do a bunch of push-ups, pull-ups, curls, etc., and you will be able to lift heavy objects but won't run any faster, etc.
<br />

<br />
I reccomend you start with the basic exercise for whatever you're interested in.
<br />

<br />
Meditation, trance, and other mental exercises are useful for everything, and are pretty much the only things I'd reccomend for everyone practicing anything psionic.
