			Oh god, you obivously don't have clue of what you are saying mewhywhy, don't you? We use our brains to the full extent, we just don't use all of it at the same time. You would just pass out from that much pressure.
<br />

<br />
Try composing music, running an obstacle track, solving math problems, translating japanese and programming a computer at the same time. That way you would be using about 10-15% of your brain at the same time. Ofcourse, that would be impossible, you could maybe do 2 tasks at the same time since humans don't support Hyper Threading. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

1. Use english grammar. ((theo's edit: its vocab, not grammer))
<br />
2. 'Ki Flame' is a pile of bollocks, the person who made that website is full of bollocks, i find it funny when hes doing a 'Ki Flame', hes got his shirt off and is standing infront of a window, its simply the light bouncing off of his skin, it wouldnt work if he put his shirt on, or wasnt standing infront of a window or a light source, for thos of you that have no idea what im talking about......<a href="http://kiyamadera.tripod.com/id9.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://kiyamadera.tripod.com/id9.html</a>, this site makes me laugh so much, as hes not doing anything paranormal at all, and uses phrases from DBZ.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Read <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html106" target="_blank" class="postlink">this</a>.
<br />

<br />
Psipet is just a nickname, it's like calling your vaccuum cleaner Mike. A psipet is just a regular construct which is given some specific programming for it to act like it had a concsious mind. Well, there is a chance that you can create a psipet that can actually think for himself, but that would require some extensive programming.
<br />

<br />
I've heard of one technique, where you clone your subconscious to your pet, but it could get a little hard keeping the thing under control after that.
<br />

<br />
About the learning thing, i've made a construct myself which listened to other people and tried to learn, after 2-3 days I called her back from town and she besically told me to f*ck off and flew away.

			Hooray! Since you've apparently been the first person to actually visually prove a paranormal phenomenon, keep working on it. I'm sure the James Randi million dollar challenge (http://www.randi.org/research/index.html) will be thrilled. I mean, obviously, if you have actual physical proof, surely it'll actually work with other people watching. Right?......... Right?

			wow! That website given did look funny but advanced people in this said they have done these techniques, why do you think they are all around the internet anyways? You think there are like 50 people in a gang spamming google with fake ki techniques... doubt it. 
<br />

<br />
And the thing about light reflecting off the shirt made no sense to me. So you are saying eveyone who has &quot;flared&quot; a psi ball didn't know that it was the reflection of there shirt? And why are you here if you dont believe in this leave.
