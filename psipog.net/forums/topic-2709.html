			I have been able to telepathically communicate for some time but never able to use it at will, but now I can and it has become a little much. Let me explain, I have to cap my thoughts when im near someone, and I am about to say somthing and somone else near me beats me to it. (if you know what I meen) But I can most of the times willingly use it.
<br />

<br />
A while back (one year) I found a book about ghosts or somthing, I looked the stuff up on-line. I had found a couple of sites and reaserched it for about 3 weeks, I was really into the whole ghost stuff when I found this site. which introduced me to other paranormal anomalies. 
<br />

<br />
So I decided to try it out it gave me a good feeling for a while, telekinesis I could do like 2 inches away from the wheel thing, telepathy I couldent do at ALL, all the other stuff i could NOT do. anyways I lost my faith. Thats as soon as i started noticing my telepathic abilitys.
<br />

<br />
My question is how can I learn how to controle my &quot;abilities&quot;, and can you tell me somthing that will bring back my faith because I just got dsl and was watching movies from psipog.com and I am willing to give it another chance. P.S. sorry for any spelling or gramatical errors. Oh yeah and sorry for any dumbness I was in a hurry while writing this. Oh yeah and please give me feed back.    -Aims_ <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			How to hone your telepathic skills?
<br />

<br />
Practice <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. Practice projecting thoughts, and perhaps &quot;shielding&quot; to stop uninentional thoughts from being broadcast. I try and hold practice Tues, Thurs, and Saturday, If anyone shows up, which it doesn't seem they want to , you can practice there.

			Nah, two weeks isn't a long time to wait for practice <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
In that two weeks you can get some good &quot;prep&quot; work done. Or, you can e-mail me telling me how much you would like to show up to practice, and I can provide you with some &quot;hints&quot; about what to do until you can join the chat *cough*.

			Your ego should be made to &quot;deflate&quot; or become &quot;set aside&quot; while practicing telepathy/empathy etc. You look at the world with wonderment and awe and see yourself as one tiny being among many equally tiny beings.
<br />

<br />
At least, that's what i do... and it works for me.
