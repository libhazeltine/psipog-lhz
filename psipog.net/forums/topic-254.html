			I have been an avid reader of information on extrasensory perception since i was 12 years old.  At first it started out as an easy phase to switch from the superhero cartoons and dragonball z action type stuff but over time and after reading several books ive had a lot of personal experience where i see that i have talent i just dont know how or why i use it.  for instance when i play cards i can often predict what will be the flop (texas hold em) or ill guess my hand before i get it or ill visualize getting a flush, full house, or 3 of a kind and itll simply occur.  another example is taht when im walking ive seen quite frequently that streetlamps simply turn off or on depending on their previous position.  i also meditate occasionally using the monroe institute stuff ive downloaded off the web and i go into my space and i see flashes of light with pictures and people, and places in them that ive never seen before.  im extremely intuitive and find myself &quot;guessing&quot; information about where im going, or what surprises there will be heading my way.  the one thing im curious is how do i harness all of my abilities together?  is the answer meditation?  is the whole star wars force thing real ?  i was never a big star wars guy but i always felt amazingly empowered whenever i saw one of those flix even if it was only once.
<br />
is teleportation possible beyond the obe world?
<br />
are we all simply beings of light who can change the illusions around us
<br />
like the illustrious sai baba can?
<br />
how does one go from simple hobby to lifestyle.
<br />
i know things will come in time but if yoga and meditation can speed up our karmic conditions are there any techniques to speed up our extrasensory abilities especially where im extremely confident i have latent talent just waiting to explode out??
<br />
Sorry for writing so much, ive just had these questions forever and never really had any answers.
<br />
I appreciate whoever responds.  thank you.

Depending on which &quot;Sai Baba&quot; you are talking about... although the most recent one was proven to be a fake.  If you search in google for &quot;Sai Baba&quot;, you can find videos of him that clearly show how he is faking.
<br />

<br />
...Actually, I just tried to access the videos, and they aren't online anymore.  I think I have them on my harddrive somewhere... performing search...

			Alrighty then, as a huge Star Wars nerd let me clear up some information thought about the whose thing of the &quot;jedi&quot;, &quot;force&quot;, and &quot;sith&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Ok first of all the Jedi themselves were based off of many things that were cultural beleifs and things now dubbed into psionics today. the word &quot;Sith&quot; itself actually means revenge in the witch terms, that is an example of outside refrence.
<br />

<br />
The force itself was a mesh of many different things, and is a fantasy name for it. Chi was thrown in on the ability to strike others with an invisible force. Sensing emotion and people was based off of telepathy and empathy. Manipulation or &quot;throwing/pulling&quot; of items in the movies was based off of Telekinesis. Seeing future events or sensing incoming danger thats precognition. An echo in the force can be compared to todays field of Chaos Theory Math. Jedi mind tricks and other things are telepathic abilities and what not.
<br />

<br />
The Force was a mesh of ideas tossed together with abilities of &quot;Psionics&quot; thrown into it. It is just a fantasy idea with the simularities, its easy how someone could see that &quot;OMG! Psionics is the FORCE!!&quot; but the force is psionics, psionics is not the force. What your doing is retrocomparing the two backwards and looking at the simularities the wrong way, the force concept was peiced together by psionics, what your doing is reversing the flow of it and calling it truth, just switch the board around thats how things happened.
<br />

<br />
Now then, if you wish to call Psionics and Psi &quot;force powers&quot; and the &quot;force&quot; well then if thats your cup of tea then by all means. But understand that Psionics does not bind the galaxy together, there is no dark and light side of psionics, and in truth there is no dark or light side of the force abilities, it is how the user wields the force that shapes it's definition, and that goes for psionics, the psionic powers are not good or bad by itself, they are just powers, it is how we the people use them that would make them anything else.
<br />

<br />
All in all just remember, the force is a fantasy based from Psionics, not psionics being a fantasy based from the force.

I think you basically sum it all up with the force was inspired by psionics, not vice versa. It's like the say does life imitate art or does art imitate life? Or something like that....

			Y'all hit the nail on the head. Comparing the force and psi is kinda like compairing the lightsabers to scientific lasers. The force is based on many different ideas, as stated earlier, and psi was prolly one of them.

			i think they relate to force as we relate to energy if you ever watched an anime called naruto they call the energy chakra,simply when you apply telekinisis on an object your are indeed applying a certain type of &quot;force&quot; but this force its refered to the energy they control

to my knowledge chakra is an indian word used for aura or a spiritual part of the body that cleanses the body of impurities but i could be wrong since i am basing it all on what ive picked up from southpark and fake spiritual healers that take your money and pretend to help o_O
<br />

<br />
and if you REALLY think about it untill it hurts then one could stretch it so far to say that psionics does bind the world together seeing as everything exists out of molecules and my beliefs (not fact) is that psi is something that exists in every molecule and therefore makes it influencable to psi 'weilders&quot; as i would say in this particular instance but hey once again i could be wrong this is just a theory and not a very good one at that ;P
