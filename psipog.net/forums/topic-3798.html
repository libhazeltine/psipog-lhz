			Lately my pinwheel will only spin one way, ive checked its balance and thats fine, it will spin anticlockwise very very easily, but when i try to make it turn clockwise, it moves very slowly and sluggish, any ideas?

			This happens to me all the time. Is counter clockwise the direction you spin it most of the time? Because your sub-c might have just gotten used to moving it in that direction. My advice would just be to keep trying to turn it clockwise until you can get it to move as good as it does going counter clockwise. The solution to 90% of problems like this is practice.

			Mine almost exclusively spins anti-clockwise, but sometimes I can get some sort of control over it and get it to change directions. Doesn't seem to last too long though... almost as if i'm trying to oppose it's nautral desire to go in a set direction.

dude, i'm laughing a lot with that
<br />

<br />
my wheel too, likes to go just anti clockwise. and sometimes it is going a way, then i try to make it go another way, and it kinda stumbles, stop, and go to the other side, or at least &quot;tries&quot; to do that. like, moving anti cw (clockwise) then it stops, go a lill back, go forth, go more back, sometimes it starts really going clockwise, or sometimes keep on going anti cw.
<br />

<br />
i wonder if it is just air currents....
<br />

<br />
3 days ago, i started with psiwheel now &quot;for real&quot;. i have been researching about psionics for some months, i don't remember now how much time, but at least for 7 months i think... and never had the nerve to stay there praticing, was bored, and stuff.
<br />
now this day i went praticing (all excited, don't ask me why, maybe it was cause i was having the feeling i was being able to convince myself that i was able to do it) and my wheel at some poitn started following my finger. i thought: WTF??????? then i saw that a lill &quot;piece&quot; of cotton was hooked on my finger, and it was moving the wheel  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />
then i took it off, and tried moving. and it did move! and actually followed my movments. i thought it couldn't be any air current, cause it would be SO MUCH coincidence. it was perfectly following me. i even showed my sister!
<br />
then i started to think: could this be static?????? on my hands, on the wheel... i washed hands, put all things on ground, and it was still moving. dad saw it and said it was static.
<br />

<br />
then after some time i wasnt able to do it, it was turning more and more difficult to do. it didnt spin so easy and so fast.
<br />

<br />
could someone tell me, you think i was out of energy, or could it be static???? i have been doing for this 3 days, and it moves, but not always.
<br />
could be air currents? 
<br />
thanks a lot (lol i made a tread in a  tread, but anyway)

			It was not static.  Not a lack of energy.  What it was was beginners luck.  it happens to a lot of people.  You can move it great at the beginning, but after your first bout of practice, you have to work as hard as most other people.  But dont worry, practice and ye shall move it.

yeah??? really? lol, begginers luck is really awsome since i've stayed a LONG time without doing any pratice (pratice i mean 30 minutes non stop), just thinking about it almost whole day, and trying fast, like: ill move that fork, or something, get me?
<br />
wew, no static then, now i'm happy.
<br />
i made some visualizations about mental barrier and conection between conscious and sub. conscious mind, and i think it really helped me. tell me if you are interested and i may share with you dudes what i did ^^
