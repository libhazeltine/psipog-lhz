			Bending reality and/or the laws of physics.  Einstein said &quot;Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.&quot; 
<br />
I know this isn't to be taken literaly but if you have to ask yourself why does gravity exist or why does (insert) exist?  We really don't know, but could you change reality, in a small area, like around an object?  Doing so would take an incredible amount of energy but could it be done?  
<br />

<br />
&quot;As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.&quot;
<br />
Another einstein quote.  Is it possible, I didn't ask if it was probable, to change reality?  Or the laws of physics?  Please don't flame.

			Not only is it possible, in my opinion, to distort reality, but it wouldn't take unbelievable quanta of energy either. Energy is not necessary to change perception; perception is based purely upon thought, and action which requires no physical energy to take place (again, in my opinion). It takes only realization of the bendable nature of the world around us to do such things. Think about it, we do it all the time -the succesful ones of us that is- with PK or RVing or telepathy, but the only reason we break the laws of physics is because they exist; otherwise, any unexplainable action performed by a conscious being is simply natural.
<br />

<br />
   For example, in my chemistry class I sit next to one of the two main doors to the classroom, the one people tend to use more often. Both doors are wooden, with large windows in the center, and they stay locked from the outside all day long. For the longest time, I had to get the door when people were late or coming back from an errand. So one day, after having to get out of my seat to open the door for a few people I really dislike, I just decided to open it without touching it. I was totally confident, and when a friend of mine arrived shaking the door handle, I just made a gentle wave at the thing from a few feet away and it popped open. He wasn't touching the door when I did this. Now, if this happened all the time, the laws of physics would explain it very well and locks that wouldn't open would be wierd. You see, it all revolves around the way a person percieves the world.
<br />

<br />
   I have actually had many other weird experiences like that one, some apports, some fire drills, and of course large PK events but in all of them I was just just very confident and gentle about it, and I succeeded and didn't think much about it. To someone else, that's altering the laws of physics; to me, that's life.

It is my belief that we create &quot;reality&quot; ourselves. And that separation is in fact an illusion (as pointed out in several psipog articles), that is in our heads.

In order to change reality, all you have to do is change yourself.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			i don't know if sky covered this, but search the string theory.  this doesn't regard to psionics, but it does have to do with your question...if sky already mentioned this, then disregard what i said.
<br />

<br />
i would go into more about string theory, but i only know the very basics.
