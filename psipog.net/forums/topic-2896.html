I moved it few times without cup, but I'm not 100% sure that that was I, so next time I will cover it just to make sure <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			Well im going to answere my own.  I say without the cup because even if the wind blows it you could beleve(sp?) that you did it giving you a boost in your enthusiasm.  Also with out a cup should be easier to see so you can have better concentration insted of trying to see through a smuge or scratch.

I totally agree with that. Seeing it move when you are trying to move it boosts your belief in it and help you do it. Sometimes, I even blow on mine on purpose because it helps me think I moved it. I also I tell myself that I did it and then it helps me move it afterwards. Afterwards I can move it perfectly. Dellusion can be good. 
<br />
So I would say without the cup, although with cup can often help you become better at it in a shorter time; if you can move it with a cup, then you can move it really well without one.

			i didn't vote because the answer i believe isn't a choice.  i think that both are equally &quot;good&quot; and important.  i think that you need to practice without the cover so that when you finally do practice with the cover, it will be easier.  and even though you can't be 100% sure it was pk without the cover, it still gives you the boost of confidence to keep practicing and getting results.
<br />

<br />
without the cover is equally important.  without the cover, although it isn't 100% positive (maybe about 95%), there is still a <span style="font-weight: bold">very</span> good chance it was pk.  this of course will give you a greater boost of confidence to move onto to sliding/rolling and other &quot;pk projects.&quot;  it is also more impressive, even to skeptics  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
all in all i think they are equal; you need the egg to make the chicken, but you need the chicken to hatch/lay the egg...catch my drift?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

			if you can, do it with a cup because that helps eliminate any thought you have of having a barrior between you and the wheel.  Also, you can kinda prove it to yourself

			Hmmm, this one is tough.
<br />

<br />
Obviously having a cup over it eliminates other factors such as wind and if you suceed in this way there's virtually no way your brian can't accept it as being real. HOWEVER, the mental barriers built up over years of experience make this a very difficult place for beginners to start. Just believing that you can move the wheel without using you physical body is a big enough step.
<br />

<br />
I think based on that, my answer would be 'both'. I can't move the wheel under glass yet, though lately I've been so drained I haven't moved the wheel much at all - but it is something I intend to practice at some point. I am putting a higher priority on moving larger objects however - I feel that's a more important step than simply moving a wheel under glass.

			it's better with a cup, but with someone just starting no cup.  Covered is a big mental block that takes a while to get over usually.  I still need to over come this.
