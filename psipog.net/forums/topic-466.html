			I was just browsing psipog.net when i spotted this: <a href="http://www.robertpeterson.org/chap10.html" target="_blank">http://www.robertpeterson.org/chap10.html</a> ./////You know how we only use 5% of our brain now right? Well what if when we practice psionics, we are really &quot;exercising&quot; our subconscious. And when you exercise you become better. eg. Running a mile a day: You're legs get stronger and you can run faster and longer. So if we exercise our subconscious, maybe we will start using more of our brain power? <img src="images/smiles/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" border="0" /> Don't ban me if this upsets you... but the big bang theory was proven wrong over 200 years ago. Which leads me into the topic: Did Adam and Eve use 100% of their brain? Read the site posted above. Is this &quot;inner voice&quot; a gift from God? As proof that we are his children, or is it Himself? I dont know who here has been baptised before, but when i was baptised my inner voice started up without notice. As if i had connected to God at a greater level and he was guiding me. But humanity itself has been so stupid these last 1000years that we have lost our greatness, knowledge and brainpower. But through psionics we once again become attatched to our true purpose and &quot;exercise&quot; our brain to be more active. Think about it, if we only use 5% of our brainpower... we would be able to do twice as much with 10%, and twice as much as that with 20% (which is 4x what we can do now)imagine 100%.... In the bible it says that in heaven God has so much planned for us that we cant even imagine it. (What does yellow smell like?) New colours? 100% of our brain? maybe with psionics we could reach a small portion of that promise..... ==psi==..... Any feedback is respected. <img src="images/smiles/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" border="0" />

Really? When I got baptised, I had a euphoric feeling literally all day, and nothing else. Then, a couple days later, I started having huge internal debates on what I'd like to do in any given situation (I'm 100% sure I wasn't debating with my subconscious).

			when i got baptised it felt like i always knew what top do, sometimes i would think things like: dont walk there, and do this instead, etc. all i'm saying is everything got clearer after baptsimal. and do we use 100% of our brain, i want to know you're opinion. Sorry if i wasnt clearer from the start

			nothing special, something I did before I knew anything about religion, I just isolated myself and thought about everything, then religion clouded my head which made me weak mentaly, so I say baptism has nothing to do with it or religion for that matter.
<br />

<br />
I don't know about the 100% brain stuff, I really don't think we use all of it no matter how we meditate or do psi, I think we use a little bit more but not an full amount maybe like .5 or 1 percent, but I don't really know about the brain a whole lot...
<br />

<br />

<br />
BTW how is this an suggestion?

			Saying that we use 5% of our brain is a misconception. Imo, it should be, we use all of our brain, but some use some areas more, others don't.

			The &quot;You use ___ % ONLY&quot; is utter crap. You use ALL of your brain, but each portion does a specific job.
<br />

<br />
If you were to use 100% of your brain at one time, you would have a major gand maul seizure, and it would probably kill you, or render you comatos. If your brain has too much going on, it just shuts down.

			Who is to say that if the big bang theory was supposedly proven incorrect that a religious story is correct? It may be something we don't know about yet. Also, I believe psipog has a rather strict no religion policy.

Psipog Chat Rules:
<br />
Do not talk about things considered &quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;religious&quot; without permission from a moderator. Religion exists to answer one or both of the questions: What happens when we die? and How were we created? If you say something that implies an answer to either of those questions, then you are talking about religion. (For example, &quot;I visited my dead grandmother on the astral plane last night&quot; would imply that there is life after death, and would fall under religion!)</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Some people seem to be forgetting that Christianity is a religion too And that the theory that Adam and eve were created by &quot;God&quot; is also religious. Just because Christianity/Catholicism is the most followed religion doesn't make it okay to talk about on a non-religious site. 
<br />

(Sorry about the rant. It has been annoying me for a while and i just had to get it off my shoulders so to speak.)

			alright, like i said: =DEEP THOUGHT=, and =DON'T BAN ME IF THIS UPSETS YOU=. i had to get it out. and for sure we use 100% of our brain, its just that our brains aren't acting on their full potential. so our brains are only putting out 5% of its potential. at least thats what i've heard from school. sorry bout the religion part if it really ticked u off that much. but i figure that if u get pissed off by religion then something has corrupted your mind to hate religion for a purpose. be at peace and be open-minded.[/code]

			Many apologies for what I am about to say, for I am probably one of those people that you seem to have a grudge against.
<br />

<br />
Many of us here are religious, and to say that that has nothing to do with psionics on an emotional level would be flat-out lying.  However, this forum is supposed to operate on an itleectual level, not emotional.  Talk of religion here IS banned, and you have done it more than once now.
<br />

<br />
As far as the &quot;we are not acheiving our full potential because we are not using all of out brains&quot;.  That is a myth, do some research.  We are only using 5-15% of our brains at any given time, we do not use 100% of our processing capability all day long (such an exercise would be chemically exhausting to our system).  Stony, another moderator here posted as to this myth, but it appears that you have not read that post.
<br />

<br />
As far as &quot;the big bang theory is wrong, and was proven wrong 200 years ago&quot;, I would, at the very least, like to see some evidence as to how you arrived at this conclusion and at this &quot;date&quot; (in quotes because it is non-specific).  Also, I would like to see this argument made without religious backing.  At the very least, I would like to see a reference to any reliable data you can present.
<br />

<br />
Until this is proven, all posts in this topic of your will be deleted.  If I find you breaking the rules further, further action can be taken.
<br />

<br />
To everyone else, you may continue to have this debate, but please have it on intellectual grounds, as opposed to emotional, and avoid references to religion if at all possible.

			Please read the articles that you reference to, the one that states that there are &quot;problems&quot; with the big bag theory, does not oppose the big bang.  Indeed, the author supports the big bang, but uses the concept of relativity to claim that based on the gravity of the situation (lots of metter near the &quot;center&quot; of the universe), time would have passed more slowly, and that the &quot;heavens and the earth&quot; could have been created within a &quot;day&quot; because of how much slower apparent time would have passed.
