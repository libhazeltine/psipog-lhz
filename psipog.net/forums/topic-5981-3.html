This is true, but even with the egg layers, it is the female that lays the eggs, which is the point I was trying to get across <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Tankdown, I believe we all start off as female (if my memory serves me) in the fetus stage, then because of certain horomones, and the amount, males change to males.  Is the 'E' chemical you are thinking of Estrogen?  The female horomone?  Also, women feel more emotions because of an enlarged corpus callosum, which is the membrane that connects the two hemispheres.  This makes the 'signals' transfer sides, which is why many women entwine emotions into their logic, reasoning, and thinking.  Men have a smaller corpus callosum, so we are more focused on either thinking or emotions.
<br />

<br />
SFG:  Yeah, women can stare in our eyes while looking at our crotches...We can too, just not as good...I actually did an experiment with my girlfriend where we would look each other in the eyes, and hold up fingers by our crotches...She got the number of fingers right much more times than I did.  But, if I told her to look onto a map for a single city, I would probably find it faster than her, or if I told her to find a certain point on an object due to male's &quot;tunnel vision.&quot;

THAT'S IT! I am going to the hospital and getting a vagina. I am going to give birth to a 15 lb baby and rub it in your face!! 
<br />
OR
<br />
Get me that damn artichoke and I am totally pissing it out! 
<br />

<br />
Do you have any idea how big the whole in our penis' is compared to a vagina?! 
<br />

<br />
My biology teacher said that having one of those &quot;stones&quot; in your urinary tract is equivalent to having birth. So men can go through the same amount of pain. 
<br />

<br />
Once again, pain means nothing it is only an illusion. You got nothing on me with your &quot;Oh, I go through more pain than you.&quot; 
<br />
I'm fat, I go through more pain than you!

			somefatguy, please don't go all crypic with 'pain is only an allusion'. There's a reason for pain- it's that your brain is sending you signals that whatever you're doing is not good for it. Historically women have died in massive numbers during childbirth. Hmm...let's see...nope, can't find any instances of people dying from kidney stones! 
<br />
The average diameter of a woman's vagina is less than one inch. In childbirth, it usually expands to a diameter of more than four inches. The urethra of a man's penis is about 6mm long- by the way, the same size of a woman's urethra, and we can get kidney stones just as easily as men, and for the most part, I've never heard of a woman comparing a kidney stone with the pain of labor- and a kidney stone is usually around 12 mm in diameter. This is double the size of the urethra, while the expansion in terms of labor is 4 times the usual size of the vagina- and stretches more when the baby is being pushed through. Just thinking about having a baby seriously makes my vagina hurt. It's a form of pain men can't even remotely comprehend.
<br />

<br />
Oh, and by the way, I'm a redhead too, so I win double on the pain threshold thing <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Okay, I don't care anymore, what you think is what you think, it does not affect me. It doesn't even matter...
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Ehh, maybe not. I am still thinking about it. 
<br />
Sawerhickory: I would like to know your source about the sizes of the vagina and penis. And, kidney stones vary, they are not always 12mm! 
<br />
And actually, your measurements are wrong. You only gave the length of a male's urethra and not the diameter while you gave the diameter of the kidney stone, which does not make sense. 
<br />
And, I have 3 people say that a kidney stone for a male is at least near the pain of childbirth. 
<br />
AND: If I want to be cyrptic with pain being an illusion, I will.  
<br />
Oh, and a woman's vagina also varies in size. The more you use it the more it stretches out. For instance, if a woman has had 2 babies already then another wouldn't hurt as much because her vagina has stretched out a bit more. 
<br />
AND: This thread is titled: &quot;Why do female humans live longer than male humans?&quot; Not: Why do women feel more pain than men? Or Why are women better than men? 
<br />

<br />
Are you kidding me? You of all people had to result to such a thing as this so and so is better than that so and so. I don't care if it is true or not you are talking in the wrong thread! 
<br />

<br />
AND: What the hell does pain have to do with anything? Where did that come into play? Pssh, I certainly don't know. 
<br />
If a moderator were to even bother to look at this thread, I do ask if you can lock it. 
<br />

<br />
AND Sawerhickory: You have been on this forum for a long time and I barely even see you post and now you find some place to boast about how women are so amazing. Why don't you go to some forum about vagina's devouring the world.  
<br />

<br />
You had to be sexsist didn't you? &quot;Oh, I am not sexsist!&quot; Yes, yes you are.
<br />

<br />
Yes, I went a little overboard. I am sorry, but hey, I feel much better.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

I know what you are trying to say, but '<span style="font-weight: bold">Allusion</span>' is different from '<span style="font-weight: bold">Illusion</span>', and the distinction is important.
<br />

<br />
'<span style="font-weight: bold">Illusion</span>' is fooling the senses into thinking something is real when it is not.  '<span style="font-weight: bold">Allusion</span>', on the other hand, means &quot;covert, passing, or indirect reference (<span style="font-style: italic">to</span>).&quot;  (<span style="font-style: italic">Concise Oxford Dictionary,</span> 1976).

			Sorry, we're not equal.  Maybe in some grand scheme we can think that our skills and pitfalls all balance out into some zero-sum comparison between the sexes, but we are most certainly different in individual abilities.  There are reasons for this, of course.  I know if I say the &quot;E&quot; word it'll throw everyone's panties in a bunch.
<br />

<br />
I think it's important to remember that differences in gender, whether as general as pain tolerance thresholds or as specific as elbow joint configurations, are without any underlying moral considerations.  We aren't different because it's right or wrong; we are different because it has kept us alive for so many generations.
<br />

<br />
There are so many gender stereotypes, and the problem is, a good portion of them are true.  Feminists have characterized stereotypical male behavior as morally reprehensible; nevermind the fact that the human male is still driven by thousands of years of evolution that's pushing him to procreate as much as possible by impregnating as many women as possible.  Cock-swinging, testosterone-filled men who claim women are too clingy haven't quite understood the idea that women are driven to find stable, resource providing males who won't run out on them.
<br />

<br />
We are different.  Deal with it.  And start providing some documentation for your claims.

Well I going to say right now I don't know anything about it and heard from this guy I tend used to play rps on warcraft with. As I agure with him as I said before he simply explain to me that we start off in balance in between shortly after birth. Also that I said before I heard about people switching sexes, but I didnt tell you the ages, sometimes earily as 1 years old----all the way till your 8 years old, or so I heard. No it wasnt the chemical Estrongen, it was a male horomone I know for sure But it was only one of the chemicals in the syrum. If I had warcraft again maybe I can seach this guy down to ask him again but I just havent had the time or the money.
<br />

<br />
Part of me wants to say sorry for getting a little unset eariler (If you didnt then it donest matter  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> ). But I'm not  regreting it because its only human. I agree with Roy on the difference thing. I could go on with it but it would be offense and pointless for this bored.
<br />

<br />
As a joke I like to say the following remark.
<br />

<br />
If a big enough kidney stone kills the (little man) then the man is already dead inside..........
<br />

<br />
 <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> never heard of it happing just wanted to say that. I feel like I start all this mess for some odd reason.........well not exatly odd.
<br />

<br />
Naturely I think the female is better just because the &quot;male&quot; is exspendable. I think I should bring up animal planet for no good reason again. I heard of a rat that does nothing but go around perganting female mice for a whole 48 hours untill dieing from dehydration.

I just began reseaching the brain and emotions right now so I'm not really familer of the basics of how it works. But I do remember reading about the amybala and hippocampus that exist within the limibic lob. I heard that the amybala and the Hippocampus exist between the two hemispherse with teh Hippocampus (if memory serves) exist on the left side (or was it right?) and the amybala exist on the other that both strongly control instantious human reactions of emotions (amybala) and the storeage of emotions (hippocampus). 
<br />

<br />
Even though one exist on one side or the other, one of them (amybala) has more power. Which tells me that our brain may not be balance on either side as we may think. I did say something eariler that I am not sorry for is that &quot;size donset matter&quot;. Where does the corpus callosum exist exactly?

Maybe in some grand scheme we can think that our skills and pitfalls all balance out into some zero-sum comparison between the sexes, but we are most certainly different in individual abilities.  There are reasons for this, of course.  I know if I say the &quot;E&quot; word it'll throw everyone's panties in a bunch.

<br />
I think it's important to remember that differences in gender, whether as general as pain tolerance thresholds or as specific as elbow joint configurations, are without any underlying moral considerations.  We aren't different because it's right or wrong; we are different because it has kept us alive for so many generations.
<br />

<br />
There are so many gender stereotypes, and the problem is, a good portion of them are true.  Feminists have characterized stereotypical male behavior as morally reprehensible; nevermind the fact that the human male is still driven by thousands of years of evolution that's pushing him to procreate as much as possible by impregnating as many women as possible.  Cock-swinging, testosterone-filled men who claim women are too clingy haven't quite understood the idea that women are driven to find stable, resource providing males who won't run out on them.

			Women started living longer as soon as they got more balanced diets (they used to have much lower life expectancies, not surprisingly).  Female bodies had to be able to endure more to at least give birth to living children, even if the mothers died.  Once European women in particular were eating beans and other high protein, high calorie foods (which required an agricultural revolution to cultivate in significant numbers), they were able to maintain their bodies properly.  So for millions of years, the predecessors of women in the 1100s in Europe were forced to deal with the limited resources they had and they grew to have higher constitutions so the species would live on.  But that's only part of the story as to why the average lifespan for women is longer than that of men.
<br />

<br />
Boys are also much weaker for the first few years of their lives than girls.  They always have and always will be unless natural selection results in some sort of change.  There will always be sickness, accidents, etc. that a weaker male child will be less likely to survive than a girl.  Once the boy actually passes the age of 1 or 2, his life expectancy goes up significantly, even in the first world nowadays.  This is of course not expressed by statistics that just average out the lifespans of populations but there you go.

Ah man, beaten again, I was going to truce with a PM. But yes, truce.

And yes Lightbringer, I have heard that boys are weaker than girls in the first stages of their life but then pick up speed and overcome at least some of the girls past advantages.

From a man I haven't talked to in many years, and I probably never will talk to him ever again.... *voice trails off in sadness, somefatguy looks at his life and wonders...should he speak to that man again?*

I'm guessing that amybala=amygdala lol.  Yeah, if my memory serves me, that's semi correct.  I don't know if the amygdala has more &quot;power&quot; than the hippocampus, or the hypothalumus/thalumus.  But, the corpus callosum (which is where the nerves from the body cross over into the oppostie hemisphere of the brain from the side of the body they are located) is the &quot;bridge&quot; in the brain.  Therefore, if it is enlarged, then more neurons, and more impulses can be sent through it, which would contribute to the fact that women feel more emotion.  Since emotion is felt in (i think) the right hemisphere, that means with an enlarged CC, more &quot;emotion&quot; inpulses are sent from the right hemisphere to the left (which is where logic is located, i think...if not, just twist this whole statement around), which results in more emotion used in logic...that was my reasoning.

If the &quot;male&quot; is expensible, and therefore not needed, how are humans going to reproduce and survive?  I doubt we are going to be asexual anytime soon, or even learn how to do that, so I strongly disagree with that post.  The human race isn't going to survive with only one sex, so both are essential, and in a sense, equal.  Through evolution, males have &quot;survived&quot; and have helped the animal kingdom survive by going around and impregnating females.  This passes on offspring, which continues that species, and prevents their extinction.  This has been learned through evolution, and is the reason why the males of all species are &quot;horn dogs;&quot; it is our primary tactic to ensure our species continuation.  If we didn't do this, our species wouldn't live on.
<br />

<br />
I agree with what Roy said, how each sex has attributes which <span style="font-style: italic">naturally</span>* are better than the other sex.  Like how males naturally produce more testosterone, which is related to more muscle growth, and why males generally are stronger than women (lifting objects, pushing/pulling, physical strength.)  Now, that's not to say that there aren't women out there who are stronger than most men, but <span style="font-style: italic">naturally</span> men are stronger.  And how women naturally produce more estrogen, which is related to nurturing, and why women are more caring, compassionate, and generally have a higher natural empathy towards others.  Now, that's not to say that there aren't men out there who are more compassionate than most women, but <span style="font-style: italic">naturally</span> women are much more compassionate.  But, if there wasn't both sexes, we wouldn't be able to give offspring, and continue on for generations...unless we somehow became able to reproduce with primates, but that's doubtful.
<br />

<br />
This thread has gone <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">very</span></span> off topic, and like someone said earlier, is turning into a battle of the sexes...I think that this topic has served it's purpose, and in my opinion, should be locked before there is a more hostile battle of the sexes, that may result in personal attacks, and offenses.
<br />

<br />
*By naturally, I mean without lifting weights, &quot;protein shakes&quot;, or other strength enhancers.  And with the estrogen matter, men's testosterone has been proven to decrease during prolonged contact, or proximity of infants.  This makes them more compassionate and empathetic, and also decreases the chances of them having an affair.  This isn't natural, and even when women aren't around infants, they generally are more compassionate and empathetic than men.
