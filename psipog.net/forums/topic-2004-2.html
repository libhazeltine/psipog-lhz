			Hmm, indeed, I think we should have a panel of judges. But, what qualifies someone to be a judge?! I think we should work out the details in a running list on this Post before we have a contest!

			Must have made at least one video? Why? That means only people who are capable of making videos will judge, and there's a lot of space between them. They would probably have to rate their own videos.
<br />
Yes, they should be odd numbered... OR, one can be the &quot;boss&quot; judge who gets to choose in the case of a tie.

Individual judgement works best. You decide who gets to be a judge. No need to choose the judges in a democratic manner.

			Sorry for the double post here but i just sprung an idea and it deserves a separate post:
<br />

<br />
How about we have 3 judges and people enter their videos every week.  once a week.  We will have a topic in Psychokinesis for posting their videos and judges will keep their votes to themselves.  The judges will then pm one another and tell eachother who they thought won.  Then we will have another stickied topic in psychokinesis (and locked so only mods can post in it) where we will post the winners.  At the end of every month, there will be 4 winners.  We then have a super competition where we vote on 1 of those 4.  That one gets his/her name in the topic that is stickied and locked in big colorful letters.
<br />

<br />
So......what do you think?

			I don't know about having four sub-contests. Why don't we start out small first? I do not want people to be in a &quot;rush&quot; when they are making these videos, I want a &quot;wammy&quot;. Something creative, thoughtful, and most of all &quot;awesome&quot;! And to be perfectly honest, I don't want to spend that much time a week discussing the movies/watching them. I'm usually super busy, and it's almost all the time now, (That's why all most posts range from 11 PM-3 am) hehe.
<br />

<br />
About who gets to be a judge... I think the people who put the most input to this thread deserve a place in it. So, I'll put those who are working with this idea into the most consideration. I also think it would be a good idea to find someone who knows a little about Photoshop/movie editing to spot any likely fakes, our number one enemy.

			I could do that, i do a lot of web design, color correction or just plain paintings with photoshop and i've done my fair share of movie editing.
<br />

<br />
I also got about 4-5 hours of spare time in my schedule. So, do i qualify?

			I think the video that wins should be posted up on the front page of psipog and then get in the media section, you know. Theres only been a few vdeos added in the past months to years and I would love to see more go in, this would be a great way to do so.

			Another month passed, and I haven't seen any evidence of a contest.
<br />

<br />
Wouldn't it be easier if everyone submitted their videos, then at the end of every month judges pick the best few and post links on the main site (in an article?) or on a sticky thread.  Means much less work for the judges, and much simpler.
<br />

<br />
Are there enough experienced psions to make &quot;creative&quot; vids?
