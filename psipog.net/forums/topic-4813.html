			Thats the only way I can describe it. OBE.  At first I delved into my &quot;psi experience&quot; with a psi wheel, and am still pretty horrible at that kind of stuff, but tonight, minutes ago, I attempted OBE.
<br />

<br />
Using this article - <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html153" target="_blank">art-outline-to-shielding.html153</a>
<br />

<br />
Wow, amazing, and weird, are the only words I can describe it with...and I didn't even acomplish OBE, I was close though...I know that for sure.
<br />

<br />
I followed the instructions pretty much, just layed down on my bed, flat, with my head barely propped up by a pillow.  Got relaxed, untensed all of my musles, and just laid there.  
<br />

<br />
I had my tv on, with my ATHF dvds playing (yes I know this sort of stuff isn't suggested, but noise I'm used to helps me concentrate and meditate.)  And soon I wasn't sesning anything but prickles, warm sensations, etc, and a few things that seemed to be mustle spasms.  At this point I think thats just my body being fully relaxed.
<br />

<br />
After about 15-25 minutes of feeling those things, my right arm felt as if something were being slid over it, kind of like some cloth being pulled down over it, and then my whole body started to feel the same thing. 
<br />

<br />
After that, sure enough, the see-saw thing (or at least I think thats what it was) started to play out.  It felt like waves going across my body, gently, yet firm at the same time.  I just laid there and accepted all of it, trying not to let my mind wander to much at all.  The seesaw sensation kept up, and suddenly, I don't know what it was, I think it was my mouth drying out, I lost my concentration...and that was it.  I knew I had failed partialy, and I finally moved my entire body.
<br />

<br />
As the article descirbes, my entire body felt extremely fatigued, and still does as I type, but that feeling is also going away.
<br />

<br />
My thought process was also entirely effed up durring the entire thing...when my mind reached it's climax, all I was seeing in my head were weird shapes, seeing my body expand, and become tiny, and microscopic, it was extremely weird...and that was all I could think of or see, was my body shifting size, I also felt this as I lay there, felt as if my entire body was shrinking, and enlarging.  (What is this called/mean?) 
<br />

<br />
It was indeed an awesome experience, and I intend to do it again when I'm actually planning on sleeping (Its summer, so that won't be untill 5 frigin am lol) 
<br />

<br />
I suggest the article <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html153" target="_blank">art-outline-to-shielding.html153</a> to anyone who wants to try this, it did help quite a bit, and I know if I didn't read it, when I started to experience the seesaw and other thing I would have immediatly been freaked the hell out and awoke from the trance like state.
<br />

<br />
So, I hope I can actually leave my body later on, I plan on it being pretty damn cool ^_^

			You dont fall asleep, you enter an altered state of consciousness. Relax, stay focussed, have an OBE. Remember, mind awake, body asleep.

			Heh...that does help quite a bit, makes sense as well.

How do I know when it is actually happening?  The farthest I get is the &quot;seesaw&quot; thing--and thats after I imagine seeing my entire body lying down...then everything pretty much repeats.

			The 'seesaw' is more commonly known as 'vibrations'. Once you reach these vibrations, just go with them, until you feel that you are ready to leave your body. Then, just leave, once you are out, you can become fully conscious, like in normal everyday life. There are various ways in leaving your body, you can; Sit Up, Roll Out, Levitate out of your body, and any others you can think of. You will know when youre having an OBE, as it is so obvious.

			Yes, if you stay focussed you can go absolutely anywhere. Some people go to outer space, some people teleport to their favourite holiday destination.
<br />
Also, one of the really cool things about OBE's, you can become anything you want, you could become Superman, Spiderman, or the Hulk. You could turn into a monster with purple feathers, green fangs, and fly through peoples windows.
<br />
Ive even heard of some people having an OBE, and having a complete conversation with other people's subconscious.
<br />
So, in other words, you can do anything, go anywhere, be anyone.
<br />
OBEing is all its cracked up to be.

			Thats amazing, just curious, how far have you gotten?  And what do you mean by focus?  I would think that once your in that form you wouldn't need much focus other than just being there...so people can't see you, but you can see them?

			Attempt no 3. failed...but I'm progressing now I think...the vibrations are coming more and more often....I just can't seem to leave my body after I visualize myself...I even try to just visualize me sitting up, but w/o using my physical body...somethings working though, thats for sure. 
<br />
Weirdes thing for me is that I stop breathing (consiously) that is, I don't even notice my breathing anymore, don't even know if I am.
<br />
I wish this would work :/

			I have had 4 OBE's in the past month and a half. You cannot force OBE's to happen, otherwise they wont. If the vibrations come on more readily, and more often, then youre getting there. This is what practice is for.
<br />
Just keep trying and you will do it.
<br />
Now about the focus, when having an OBE, i find that if my mind wonders too much, im instantly back in my body. Also if i think, 'Holy Crap, im having an OBE', this instantly brings me back to my body.

			i just did my first attempt last night following the same guide. it was soooo weird, like, it felt as if my left arm could either be at my side, or inside of the couch (yes, i slept on the couch =/), or anywhere actually. and a weird kind of warm and buzzing feeling/sound came over my body and colors kept flooding into my head, after awhile i realized that i let my mind wander, and i *think* i was kinda close, but then i realized i was wondering and instantly was set back about 10 minutes.. that happened like twice then i ended up just falling asleep
<br />

<br />
but hey, it was cool! i'm gunna try again tonight. (were those typical pre-OBE feelings? just curious to how close i *actually* got <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />)
