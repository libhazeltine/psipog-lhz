			I need some explanation here please.  I tried to move my psi-wheel for about two months, with about 1 millimeter of success, (literally)...  I got sick of it, i meditated, concentrated, even tried communicating with my subconcious for help.  even when i tried moving it with the heat from my hands, (cheating for some self confidence), i couldnt do it!!!   so i gave up for a month... -_-   now im back with some interesting news; i can move a quarts stone on a string with almost NO concentration!  i made sure it wasnt the heat from my hands because i ran them in freezing water for a minute.  The amazing thing is that i can do it over and over again, from about 1/2 to 5 inches away!  
<br />

<br />
Please give me some reasons for why i can move quarts, and not paper.
<br />
P.S. I have tried SO hard not to use the word &quot;geokinesis.&quot;  please dont close my thread for using that word in reference...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I dont see what the problem is, in my personal opinion, the less on the wheel, the better, if yo ucan move stone on a string, well then why would you want to go back and move the psiwheel, i found that the psiwheel just makes it harder to move onto bigger things, or rolling and sliding, since you have to roll/slide and not spin.

			no, my point is that i can move different TYPES of things, not different sizes, <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  and i AM happy i can move it.   my idea is that some people may be able to move some kinds of things with telekinesis better than others, like water, minerals, metal, etc...  ive heard of some people that can create light with psionics, but not physical objects.  this is because the process of moving something phisical, and light, is very different.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  manipulating light requires the stretching and transformation of photons... some peoples' minds may be more developed to handle THIS task easier than the task of moving something else...  i hope you are getting the idea of this, but its still just my theory, so feel free to prove me wrong.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Well maybe some people do have 'gifts' for moving different kinds of things, maybe it was just the wind on your quartz pendulum, but its all Telekinesis anyway, i can see what youre trying to say, but practice will make it easier to move all sorts of different things.

			One thing I read was that quartz crystal and Amethyst are &quot;psychic stones&quot;. Maybe your mind was more in tune with the crystal whickh made it easier to move. I have read cases of people being able to move crystals and vanish or teleport parts of them.I dont know. experiment with it........ <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
