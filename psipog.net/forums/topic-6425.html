			My Theory (which I haven't really experimented with much, but yeah...)
<br />

<br />
Kay...we all know how everything is made of atoms?
<br />
Well yeah. So, I imagine everything around me (including me) as little itty bitty atoms, except for my brain. 
<br />

<br />
Now, I imagine my nerves. Then, I &quot;extend&quot; an image of my nerves into the surface, and then into the psi wheel. Then, I simply move it. 
<br />

<br />
Would this work? Try it a bit.

However it's an improbable science theory. Also, wouldn't the idea of everything is made of energy cross your mind more? Regardless, only matter is made of atoms, not energy. Energy is made of particles or photons.

It's not classified as an atom until it has all three types of particals in one cluster, in which, it becomes a element which is matter.
<br />

<br />
Psi is, so far, not matter or an element. It's energy. Regardless, I never said it was a bad technique, I just said &quot;If it helps you do psionics, why not?&quot; while stating how it's an improbable explaination.

When I first joined the threads were about debatable topics, controversial issues and interesting facts. Now it just seems like people are clawing for any reason to make a post. (My fault?? hmmm) Anyways, this one is so dumb.

&quot;I was running around and closed my eyes and visualized running into a tree, and in 2 seconds, IT HAPPENED!!! I now know I can predict the future so anyone who wants me to, just let me know. I can only help one at a time..&quot;

First joined, as in the whole 5 months ago?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
And neveza, I was talking about subatomic particles on the deeper scale. Yes I know an atom requires protons, neutrons and electrons for it to be an element, but that's not what I meant. Looking back on my post I realise it sounded like I was accussing you a bit when I actually was agreeing with you lol.
<br />

<br />
This is what I mean: it's common knowledge matter and energy are interchangable.  You said it's more likely psi/energy is made up of particles of atoms as opposed to the atoms themselves. In that case, one could conclude energy is the basic substance (the smallest particle - a quark?) and matter is the more complex arrangement of it.  THAT would be an interesting investigation...
<br />

<br />
Hmmm should I study physics or biology or chemistry? Yeah I know it's completely irrevelant but I have to send away my CAO forms in 3 or so months so it's on my mind quite a bit. Hate physics in schoo, love chemistry and bioloy. Love physics outside of school. Then there's the workplace. Hmmm.

Running into a tree helps?
<br />
I'll try that when my Listen-To-A-Jackass-Ometer is on, kay?

I posted this to a)Share findings and b) help others. And...I do believe I was on Pog longer than you...
