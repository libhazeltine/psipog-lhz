			I am trying to have an OBE using what I learned from Bob Peterson and the guide at Psipog.
<br />

<br />
So last night was attempt #5 or 6. (I've practiced more, but several months ago and recently started practicing again) I got to the point where most (all but a part of my neck) was completely numb. I got my neck numb, and then several moments later the 'numbness' turned into kind of a 'shield'. It felt like a huge body shaped handcuff was being wrapped around my whole body and tightened a bunch of times. I felt extreme pressure from nearly every direction.
<br />

<br />
Here's the confusing part - the 'racing' of the heart. After the 'caking/shielding' happened, my heart began to beat at an obviously abnormal rate. My heart would beat at the intensity as if I were doing a lot of stressful cardiac exercise. This isn't normal when I am just laying in my bed! I thought that might be a hazard to my health, possibly dangerous, but I kept going anyways. The heart beat was giving off little vibrations in my 'core' while it was going. Are these the vibrations discussed in how-to-OBE articles? I noticed the heart beat slowed down when I cleared my mind, but I can literally only hold it for a fraction of a second.
<br />

<br />
Are these normal effects of an OBE? Am I close to having one at all? Any advice?
<br />

<br />
I gave up after I tried to move and it was just my physical body moving. The total time I practiced was 36 minutes. Also, after I got up, my whole body felt kind of...'light', like 'flaky' and shaking. Normal? Dangerous?

			None taken.

I'm not overweight or anything. I have no physical condition that would give me high heart beats. My blood pressures normal, I don't have heart disease running in the family. I'm about 5'8'' and 140 lbs, I have some muscle, I try to work out alot and eat healthy. There's nothing really there that would cause that kind of random heart racing.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			If you?d consider an answer from a non-OBE?er, I?m pretty sure this is about excitement or anxiety. I?ve been at this point almost regulary at night and I know my body responds directly to what I have in mind, especially if it?s -about- my body. When I feel it fall asleep and lose control over it, it gets excited just as I do.

			i've heard about heart rates before. it doesn't seem to me that it is a negative side effect of obe attempting due to physical condition. when  one's obeing, one's sort of playing around w/ fire in the sense that you're going into territory you're not really sure of (experience wise) and people have different reactions. this may have come from fear or joy as felt in that instant and i dont see why it wouldn't be overwhelming?
<br />

<br />
when you pracatice obeing you're entering uncharted territory in your mind and well guess what your circulatory system just happens to be what keeps the brain operating. why wouldn't other functions be in some way effected by it?

			It got to a point I've never had it before and I thought it might be dangerous. I guess when I get used to the experience it will settle down a bit.

Thanks for the help guys. =]
