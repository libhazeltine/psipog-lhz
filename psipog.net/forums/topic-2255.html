			Everything is possible, You create your own reality.
<br />
Your brain, mind creates your body and sense, What is on the inside of you can be considered real, the outside is what the inside makes and vice versa. Your mind can create thoughts by your choice, you are real, your mind can create delusions, hallucinations by your choice. With your eyes look into your mind, delusions and hallucinations are not real until your prove it or want it. Hallucinations and delusions can become reality by your choice as it is simply put.
<br />

<br />
 Example- you hallucinate a ball in your hand with no shadow, put the shadow in and it works. Everyone creates delusions, when you change perception on reality, when your change a thought and just about every moment your heart beats. This is not a theory this is a true fact. Think about it, you can make it work now you just have to make the answers and solutions, it is not easy in the begining and it is difficult near the end. Quit looking for answers on the internet or the books its all right inside of you, if you just a take step of what I typed.
<br />
This isnt the only truth but it may be the closest it will ever get, think hard.

			sorry for the confusion, but are you trying to disprove psionics saying it's all an illusion?  or are you telling us we need to stop finding all the answers on the internet and making it easier on oursevles, and we need to find out the answers on our own; not only about psionics but about the world, what's around us, and ourselves? <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

sorry again, just a bit tired...either way, i think this is a well written article, which ever way you see it.

True, you are entitled to your own views regarding Psi, but I'm still holding fast to the idea that Psi is more than an illusion. But then again, if everyone sees the same hallucination, what's to say it's not real?

Ok, well we must be making hallucations and all be very good at telepathy too because we're forcing hallucations on others to see exactly what we're seeing. Also delusions, what of remote viewing, telepathy, empathy? How are those delusions? What are we doing deluting the memories and forcing a large hallucation over the person to &quot;see what we're seeing&quot; as that area we're looking at forever, well not to mention that but for everyone. Then be it this is all a delusion and hallucations we're forcing on eachother it all leaves one fact, that telepathy would be the &quot;almighty power&quot; of psionics, since for any of your theories to be 'true' telepathy would have to be there.
<br />

<br />
The world can't be answer with a few words which can never be proved, nor will anyone believe you on pure words alone, that I must reitterated, can never be proven. You've been making a lot of posts with many loopholes, but one constant is that your stating things that can't be proven then saying &quot;its truth don't question it&quot;, how do you know it is truth? How did you stumble upon it? Was it just a thought that came to you? The fact of the matter is, alright Psiballs and Psychokinesis those are the only fields that could apply to this, the rest cant be delusions unless the entire world is diluting the entire worlds mind with new and new perceptions of things that all of a suddent become true and be it this were true the fabric of reality would pretty much rip apart from to much overlay and change, ware, tear, and rip.
<br />

<br />
The simple fact here is this can be truth for you, but I can bet a dime it wont be for others, it has loopholes, it can't be proven, and its source is more then questionable. Besides if you read up on string theory and other things it has some interesting facts that can make Psi exist logically and therefore closer to the real truth, not an enlightenment fringe which relies on loopholes and indecisive and unprovable words.

			Loop holes are made so you can fill them in, What we know as reality Has to be false because what is true is what it came from, Think of it this way,
<br />
Zero point energy is raw energy, it is the existance that exists beyond the atomic level, now Life exists to take, exploit zero point energy and create this so called reality threw our minds and out our senses or threw our eyes and out our mind. Now to exploit that even further, we have imagination to influence our brain and recreate reality, yes now this leeves lots of flaws and loop holes but i have worked them out and so can you. What about other people, those are different physics. 
<br />
I really dont care if anyone is this far but i do like to tell people that this could very well be what it is, as close and as far. 
<br />
When you move a psi wheel is that real or is it your imagination and your imagination infecting other people, It is not hard to create delusions or hallucinations, just keep your eyes still, relax and look into your mind, then maybe make it better give it a sound or maybe even a feeling or anything that you decide. Find the glitches they are everywhere.

			hehe heres the big question that no one can prove...if all of this stuff is a hallucination/imagination created by thoughts, then what are thoughts made of? Saying that they just are creates the real, which in turn, makes the hallucination/illusions a factor resulting of real, therefore making them part of the real. That makes them unable to be not real. I hope all of you guys understood that.

That answers everything me and guessing a few others need to know. Look, the world isnt that easy to come with a theory that cant be proven either way then all of a sudden its truth, then when the numerous and large flaws pop out to say &quot;Umm, you figure it out, make it real&quot; basically your trying to force your theory onto us and saying &quot;fix it for yourself!&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Alrighty, i've read up on Zero Point energy and how it is the lowest form of energy in quantum mechanics, show the acclaimed article that states what your stating, because if that too was speculation then this is a spiral to nothing. The simple fact here is your trying to explain a complex universe with over simplified rules, which isnt going to work, its like throwing a cat into a bathtub, it will just anger the cat. Also fine for psychokinesis and psiballs this still applies, but you've failed to explain my points on remote viewing, telepathy, empathy, all those non corporeal ones, or are those &quot;flaws and loop holes but i have worked them out and so can you&quot;. In meaning that you have no answer for them or didn't care to think those through, for if you did what would be the reason for not just sharing them?
<br />

<br />
The universe isnt going to be explained from a simple fringe on 'profound' theories of deception and illusion, your trying to answer &quot;How the universe works&quot;, &quot;What reality truely is&quot;, &quot;How we fit into it&quot; and things related to that, sad fact is those are some things the human race many never know, reality being one of them.
<br />

<br />
Besides, one big flaw in your theory anyways, if reality is altered for each and everyone of us and it is by our imagination then that would mean I see millions of different things then everyones else and dare I say live in a completely different world, but at the same time everyone can see everything I do? Hrmm 2+2 doesnt = 22 and thats whats being said here, in a sense.

			Though it was well written and is interesting, it should be in the skeptics forum.  It has nothing spefic relating to PK.  It involes basically all of psionics.  If this could be moved that would be great.

			Telepathic powers is just hearing sounds and allitle of influence in it.
<br />
yeah i guess i am to lazy to post all i know so i fail. well maybe the world will be smart enough to find out all you have to do is think. No one understands quantum physics perfectly but i do, that makes me want to tell people, but all i have to say is think that you can think like a god.
<br />
but they push themselfs to say i cant there this and there that on my choice. Its sad but on my side its is nothing i win and if i had the power to do anything i would destroy the world just so i could make it again, is that what allways happens a god arrises and changes the world so that he can truely have a happy life or just a real game.  We are in the prehistoric time of supernatural human abilitys, change this or its will change itself.
<br />
Everything can be explained with two words opposite-equal or your
<br />
choice.  Times are changing Aliens exist and so does super technology
<br />
the goverment has just announced this but they have not ennounced how strong our mind is. It is. Well its ok no one is going to protect anymore.

			Wow... This is getting a bit to easy, I do so like challanges when debating to.
<br />

<br />
&quot;No one understands quantum physics perfectly but i do that makes me want to tell people&quot;, basically saying &quot;All the acclaimed scientists in the world are wrong, they wasted their lifes because I am the only one who knows this. Also you all have to listen to me on this because I do&quot;. So to that I have to say, where is you PhD, where is your nobel prize, where are the books you must have written for the scientific community, your name that all the scientists must praise since you &quot;Know all of quantum physics&quot;. Well where is that stuff, because I would love to see it.
<br />

<br />
Next bit of order is, &quot;Telepathic powers is just hearing sounds and allitle of influence in it.&quot;. Umm I do beg to different, telepathic powers is that of reading the thoughts and stored information in the human brain, you don't hear much of anything, to my knowledge, I dont read some guys surface thoughts and hear in the real as if im hearing someone else his thoughts, no I get it in the form of a mental message.
<br />

<br />
&quot;i would destroy the world just so i could make it again, is that what allways happens a god arrises and changes the world so that he can truely have a happy life or just a real game&quot;. Well for one the talk of gods should not be said on these forums, even in this meaning since you are saying we are gods and gods arise which is religious since it foils or contradicts other religions. Further more, if you could you would, but the simple fact is you cant and it seems that with all the talk of hallucations and disillusions your the only one who is.
<br />

<br />
Also may I ask where the official proclomation of Aliens and their technoligy and proof that our governments have told us and shown us? Also we all know of &quot;super weapons&quot;, by definition an ICBM is a superweapon, hell a lot of todays missiles are for they do have the power to destroy the world and its people, maybe not with initial blast but nuclear fallout. Also the government has released information on Project: Stargate, its project during the cold war that developed remote viewing, so your announcement of &quot;having told us how powerful the human mind is&quot; is well flawed as well. 
<br />

<br />
In short, maybe you should apply your title to your own meanings. &quot;Read up&quot; on true factual information, instead of fringed speculation and &quot;Grow up&quot; from these arrogent thoughts that your always right and everyone else is wrong only because your posing it.

			this entire arguement seems to be a &quot;i think therefor i am&quot; kind of thing.
<br />
though to be honest one of the feeling i got from the way the posts were written ((see &quot;No one understands quantum physics perfectly but i do, that makes me want to tell people, but all i have to say is think that you can think like a god. &quot;)) make me think that avius was saying all this as a joke...
<br />

<br />
if he/she isnt though all i have to say is as far as i myself am concerned. These are just.....how should i say this....out there?

honestly they seem to me like avius read a few science fiction books, took  the ideas, and tried to explain the world with em &gt;&gt;;
