Quite possibly my PsiPet could of not got his programming correct and is still sucking energy from all things it can, constructs, psi residue....people. So that may be it, though i'm trying to remember if I made it before or after my slump, probably after.

Well demoralization is starting to sink it, for it seems almost like my abilities of Psychokinesis have been sucked from me. For the longest while I had a down time on my psychokinetic abilities, not being able to hone them as I once had. Now I cant even seem to move the psiwheel with ease.
<br />

<br />
I had chalked it up to being in a slump and then a session of depression just dragging out the slump but its been far to long. I also tried chalking it up to 'locking' my mind on a psiwheel but even my normal psiwheel is seeing a diminish when I try to use my abilities, let alone my spare changable tops.
<br />

<br />
Though I have noticed time and time again my abilities work in odd ways, at some points in time my skill in some fields will just drop suddenly, then some time after the initial drop I start to get subconsious, or unintentional, spurts of another ability of psionics. Though usually once the spurt is done things will level out to normal, odd no? Anyways the spurt of my little precognative &quot;episode&quot; is done, also the few little &quot;almost OBE&quot; happenings as well, but my abilities in psychokinesis and clairvoyance still remain diminished... This worries me since its heavily diminished.
<br />

<br />
I've tried practicing and keeping at it but not much help is happening there. Also I have not diminished my belief of Psionics, given the control I had over the psiwheel, I do try to tell myself &quot;No no, see this is easy to do, come on you can do it!&quot; and simular things, but it seems to be of no accord. Does anyone else have the same kind of issue or can anyone lend me some advice or what not? I wish to get back to where I was, but it seems even my innate ability to comb over my mind and solve internal issues isnt helping much, so I turn now to experience, if infact others do cope with the same perdiciment i'm in and have been in.

			Ok, here is my theory on this subject: If you're depressed, your sub-c is depressed. It develops negativity, sadness, anxiety, and all the other bi-products of depression. If your sub-c has been putting up with this for an extended period of time, it may stop caring. Even when your conscious mind is back in full health, you may still need to &quot;coax&quot; your sub-c back to health. Complimenting it, giving it mental hugs, feeding it happy feelings whenever you can, and in general being life affirming would probably help. Also, depression can lead to states of &quot;not caring&quot; (hardly a complicated term <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />) and maybe it doesn't see why it should do PK. Perhaps, looking at your memories, it associates PK with times before you were depressed, which brings back thoe memories of depression, and thus treats PK as a hostile notion. You could try explaining to your sub-c that this isn't the case, and that PK would make you happy, more confident. Even in the smallest success situations, try being very affirming, giving out compliments like its 1999 <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
 Oh, and if I sound crazy now, just wait <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> However, I do believe that your sub-c is damaged and/or affected by all states of emotion, be they negative or positive. Perhaps it just needs a confidence boosting, and a little confirmation that the unenjoyable state of depression is behind you now. And also, congratulations on joining us in the happy crew again. This is my take on your post... so excuse me for talking rubbish <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
