			i was sitting at home working on my science project , and my minf=d wandered off. I was looking at one of my Tech Ed projects. I started to remember everything i did to make it. i remember clear coating the thing, and i started to smell the clear coat (which smells quiet good). has this happened to anyone else?
<br />

<br />
by the way i was far enough away from it to not have just smelled the project, and it doesnt even smell like that anymore.

			This is simply mental association.  You said yourself that your mind went through all the processes you had taken to make this project.  If at some point in making it you had noticed the clear coat thing had a nice scent, then your brain would remember it and the next time you thought of the clear coat, hey presto!  Back would come the smell.  Nothing paranormal in that, I'm afraid.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Ok Connmann1015 the correct term for what you are having is called Euphoric Recall.. It is where your mind/body remembers something from the past that you liked doing, or that you did alot and you just smell whatever it was out of no where.
<br />

<br />
I use to smoke weed heavily for 5 years straight--every single day 24/7.  After going through In patient treament for Drug issues.. I learned about Euphoric Recall.
<br />

<br />
Even til this day (I havent smoke weed or did drugs in over a year now) I will still smell the odor of Weed for a few seconds, even when no weed is around.

			Thanks for explaining that to me. I thought it might have nothing to do with psionics, but I wasn't sure.
