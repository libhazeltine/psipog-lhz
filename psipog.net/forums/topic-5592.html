			about a year ago, I lost a gold ring given to me by my mother.  It was her wedding band, about a half inch wide, size 6 i think, with circles intertwined throughout the band.  Last I saw, it was in my jeep.

			At first, I didnt think the grates were big enough for the ring to fall through.  I checked, and they are...

			I spent all morning taking off the vent cover, using a mirror, and trying to see if the ring was in there at all, i didnt see it.  I also took off the cover to the console, to see if it had fallen through the slot for the emerg. brake.  no go there either...

anyone else have an idea for me to look into??

			Sorry, I've had mixed emotions recently and it seems to be interferring with my ability to remote view. And due to this, I've also been unable to control residual images from previous RV's I've done in the past.

			i actually tried to view it myself, and i had seen it on a necklace, being worn by someone.  I couldnt see who it was, and all I could notice was a long neck and short blond hair in a bob cut.  I think someone has it who is young, maybe a child who is in her early teens, and the ring is too big for her fingers.  That may explain the brush or comb (the necklace being set beside the comb).  Could also be a doll, or gingerbread men on a wallpaper or border.  I just cant locate WHERE this person is, or any significant details about the person.
