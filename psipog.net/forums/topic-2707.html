			Okay. the big part two of this large topic...
<br />

<br />
and the subject of this topic is....
<br />

<br />
COLOR AND EMOTIONS!!!
<br />

<br />

<br />
because psi is rather personal, (you create it, and play with it so of course it's personal) i thought of what would make it easier to manipulate it.
<br />

<br />
my theory is that if we make our psi as personal as possible, we would have an easier and easier time manipulating it.
<br />

<br />
so, here it is. 
<br />

<br />
starting off with... colour!
<br />

<br />
instead of having your psi a colour that represents what it is you are attempting to do, (for the sake of examples, let's use a psiball full of fire.) instead of the psiball as a red colour to represent the fire, personalize it and have the ball fill with your favorite colour. when you create a shield, have it your favorite colour. etc, etc, so on and so forth.
<br />

<br />
this experiment was successful in my terms. i like purple. so, i create purple fire. purple shields, and just for the fun of it, purple emotions. (empathy. little success with the last one, but my empathy is growing.)
<br />

<br />
next, with your favorite colour in hand, (literally if you want it,) choose an element or energy form that best represents your colour. note, that this is purely a guideline theory. because it is just that, a theory, you can assign any form to your colour that you desire. although for the newbies, this may be helpful.
<br />

<br />
fire: yellow to dark purple (at least what i've tried to be effective)
<br />

<br />
ice/water: light blue to dark blue
<br />

<br />
Electric: any colour you can think of. 
<br />

<br />
Naturistic energy (life energy. you know what i mean if you can feel plants.) dak yellow to dark green.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
now, the final chapter to the colour.
<br />

<br />

<br />
DON'T GET ANGRY IF IT DOESN'T WORK!!!
<br />

<br />
it takes a lot of practice to become a confident psi user. if any of these work for you in reaching your goal, tell me! i'd be interested to know!
<br />

<br />
feel free to post your fav colour and-or shape. 
<br />

<br />
note- if this technique messes up your current routine, then disregard it. i wish to help not hinder.

			I'm not really sure if there will be alot of uniqueness when it comes to colors, but who knows. My favourite color is red, which might represent fire.. which for some reason it's the only element I can use easily. 
<br />
Red - fire
<br />
Blue- ice
<br />
Green - nature
<br />
yellow - electric
<br />
purple - soft
<br />
grey - solid
<br />
White - light
<br />
Black - pain

lol theyre like the generic symbols that are used these days.
<br />
including me, im sure others would use this. this does sound very interesting, but surely it would help to be realistic? not saying this isn't but say if i represented fire as green, i don't think it would benefit me, it would help if i visualized the actual colour of a fire.
<br />

<br />
i do like the theory here, but it seems that &quot;personalising&quot; with colour is slightly uneccasary.
<br />

<br />
i know i sound like a total piece of nob cheese, but im going to try this anyways.
<br />

<br />
its good to see that someone else is conducting their own research <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

sorry to sound like such a bastard &gt;_&lt;

			Oh it's ok, you actually have a point though. Want to create heat? light a fire up or google a fire video.. or something, feel a fire in every way possible to create fire yourself.  Same goes with alot of things, color can help just as much as feeling it. By color I can also mean describing the color, not just the color itself.
<br />
Reflecting fire as an emotion for example, it burns, violent, hot, wild, rage! get mad! -.- if I keep this up i'll set something on fire myself lol.  You know what I mean I hope.
