Wrong wrong wrong.... I have owned TWO xbox 360s already apollo. THEY SUCK. THEY ARE FUCKING HORRIBLE THINGS that should never, EVER, have been created.
<br />

<br />
They are defective, heavy, and consume MASSIVE amounts of power (horrible on your power bill). They will stop reading your games/dvds, or sometimes bypass thatdefect altogether and just melt the fucking things. Games also freeze. All this due to the hardware of the console, not the software of the game. 
<br />

<br />
Bottom line: Xbox 360 is a huge peice of shit and I recommend NOT buying it to anyone and everyone.
<br />

<br />
Edit: Ps3 will be awesome, but the will the price be right?
<br />

<br />
Wii will be the best of all three in my opinion, because of the new Smash Brothers game coming out for it. 
<br />

<br />
My friends and I are all HARDCORE Smash Brothers fanatics, and three of us (me included) are pretty sure we're among the best players of Smash Brothers Melee for the GC on the face of the planet. We sent #4 (fourth best of us) into a tournament once, and he came out 1st place... And every other group of smash bros players ever to face us walked home hanging their heads in shame... WE ARE THE BEST THERE IS MUAHAHAHA. lol.

THen you taped up the fan, bought a VERY defective one, or just suck at playing it.  The only thing i see wrong with the 360 is that the power converter thing (i think that is what it is) is literally the size of a brick.  Other than that, the weight is not very much (who cares anyway?!?!?), all the games i have played (which is most of them) have never frozen and have <span style="font-weight: bold">NEVER EVEN SLOWED DOWN</span>.  &quot; Ps3 will be awesome&quot;  Right......can you tell the freakin future?

Well, to be honest, you don't really need precognition skills to understand that the PS3 will be &quot;awesome.&quot; Has Sony ever let down it's customers with it's consoles? Not really, beside some things that are inevitable anyways (like the CD reader problem on PS2)
<br />

<br />
The PS3 will launch a lot of highly anticipated games: another Tekken, Final Fantasy, another Killzone, and Grand Turismo sequel.
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, The nintendo Wii happens to be the only console that seems to be getting original games. But even they keep latching onto the extremely overused Mario bros. and other famous characters.
<br />

<br />
As far as the Xbox360 is concerned, it's not exactly my weapon of choice. 
<br />
-It has constant freezes in the middle of games
<br />
-Even with bulk, it has a low tolerance to the elements (especially direct sunlight)
<br />
-It's main anticipated game will be Halo 3, and that's about it.
<br />
-It's not travel friendly
<br />
-I might as well buy a computer with more capabilities
<br />
-Graphics are limited to HD Tv's
<br />
-Graphics really arn't that revolutionary to the late Xbox games (IE-halo 2)
<br />

<br />
But, the xbox360 is fun. I'll give it that.
<br />

<br />
But, I just don't like the xbox franchise.
<br />

<br />
You don't really need to prove me wrong, I'm entitled to my opinion, and it's backed up with enough reasons on why I won't spend $300 bucks on a console that isn't as advanced as it's competetors

			Of course you are entitled to your own opinoin.  Just hear me out:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Has Sony ever let down it's customers with it's consoles?&quot;
<br />

<br />
You mean besides delaying the release date of the PS3....right?
<br />

<br />
&quot;-It has constant freezes in the middle of games&quot;
<br />

<br />
I want proof.  Take a video and upload it.  I want proof though (and you cannot have the xbox running for more than a day)
<br />

<br />
&quot;-Even with bulk, it has a low tolerance to the elements (especially direct sunlight)&quot;
<br />

<br />
Last to my knowledge, people dont play outside in the sun, rain, or snow etc...
<br />

<br />
&quot;It's main anticipated game will be Halo 3, and that's about it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Keyword: <span style="font-weight: bold">MAIN</span>.  People love Halo.  That is what makes it so popular!
<br />

<br />
&quot;-It's not travel friendly&quot;
<br />

<br />
If you travel with it, you are addicted and need rehab.
<br />

<br />
&quot;-I might as well buy a computer with more capabilities&quot;
<br />

<br />
For 3 times the price to get to the same capabilities (not to mention software), sure.  Go right ahead.
<br />

<br />
&quot;-Graphics are limited to HD Tv's&quot;
<br />

<br />
There are great graphics on HD and not bad graphics on regular (could be better on regular though.  I will give you that)
<br />

<br />
&quot;-Graphics really arn't that revolutionary to the late Xbox games (IE-halo 2)&quot;
<br />

<br />
Halo 2 was an XBox game.  Some of the games can be played off the 360 but that does not mean the graphics are different.  It just means that it is intercompatible.
<br />

<br />
&quot;why I won't spend $300 bucks on a console that isn't as advanced as it's competetors&quot;
<br />

<br />
Ok, buy a computer that is about $900+ dollars and will get outdated in a year.  Again, to my knowledge, the PS3 has not been released yet.  Nor has the Wii.  So that cannot be judged yet.
<br />

<br />
And finally:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Wanna know something scary about the 360? <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=xbox+360+cd+scratch&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" target="_blank">http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=xbox+360+cd+scratch&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=</a>
<br />
My little brother did this same thing.. wrecked perfect dark.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I looked that up and read this one sentence:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">A growing number of Xbox 360 customers are reporting having problems with their disc's getting scratched by the DVD drive when switching the unit's position from vertical to horizontal and vise versa.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
No shit.  I would have never guessed that if you keep tilting the Xbox <span style="font-weight: bold">while</span> it is playing, it would do something to it.  Uhh...Physics?  
<br />

<br />
That is why people should read the manuel!
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">#1 Remove discs before moving the console or tilting it between the horizontal and vertical positions.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
I wonder why they put manuels in the box that you purchase anyway.

My friends and I are all HARDCORE Smash Brothers fanatics, and three of us (me included) are pretty sure we're among the best players of Smash Brothers Melee for the GC on the face of the planet. We sent #4 (fourth best of us) into a tournament once, and he came out 1st place... And every other group of smash bros players ever to face us walked home hanging their heads in shame... WE ARE THE BEST THERE IS MUAHAHAHA. lol.

I and all those I know who own an Xbox 360 have yet to experience any troubles like those you've just mentioned.

			About the disk scratching thing... my Gamecube has actually, LITERALLY fell off my 4 foot desk and onto the floor while running and nothing happended. It was as smooth as if nothing had happened. But thats for the gc, I can't say anything about the wii and the ps3, but as for the xbox 360, One of my friends friend's 360 also went bust moments after he got it. Overheated and melted. And appolo, elements such as heat and coldness froma a room can affect it, not &quot;snow&quot; or &quot;rain&quot; because, as you said, no one would do that. Overall, the 360 has bad programmers.

			I did not even tilt the 360, and it scratched and ruined perfect dark. I bumped it with my hip (it was on the table at the time). I don't own a 360, it was my brothers.

			I want to tell you this story: On mythbusters, they did this thing where they drop a ps2, xbox, and gamecube off a 30 foot building. 
<br />

<br />
ps2:completely and utterly ruined.
<br />

<br />
xbox:broke in half and had buttons come off.
<br />

<br />
gamecube:hit ground, and lid popped open. They plugged in later and played video games on it to close the show.
<br />

<br />
Who do you think is dominant? (breaking wise)
