			In light of &quot;The other kind is fake comment&quot; Don't Psychoanalysts actively use hypnosis as a form of introspection? A way into the unconscious mind? Unless of course you were refferring to some other type of hypnosis.

Hypnotism truly does not 'work' on some people for a variety of reasons and beyond that, obsessive-compulsive disorder is something I think would be hard to change with hypnosis. The rituals become ingrained in you. I take it yif you try to stop, actively, you end up having panic attacks or such? This would probably lead to you, at least subconciously, resisting the hypnosis thinking you'll still respond badly without the rituals.

The biggest thing with real hypnosis being performed by one person on another is that you cannot be hypnotized if you don't want to be. Conciously and subconciously. (At least this is what I have heard from more than one psychology teacher as well as one or two TV documentaries.) This is probably why self-hypnosis usually works the best; you wouldn't be doing it to yourself if you didn't want to be hypnotised! In the case of one person performing it on another, it's basicaly a willing relaxation of the mind to let another person communicate with and give suggestions to your deeper concious or subconcious.
<br />

<br />
As for those vegas stage hypnotists... total bull.
<br />

BTW: This is all my oppinion and speculation; feel free to disagree or correct me.

			Actually, Aohd. It's not JUST little &quot;rituals&quot;. Also, if I see something, I sometimes have to do something with it. If I don't, it's like trying not to breath.

For example, I once saw a cooking pan and HAD to find out if it was hot, for no reason. So I put my hand on it.

			I've never been able to learn self hypnosis or others, but I think that you could have a suggestion to make your self good at &quot;psionics&quot; and such.

Instead of creating neural pathways that say you can do something, destroy neural pathways that say you can't.
