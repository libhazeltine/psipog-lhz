			Hey, I was just wondering if anyone thought that David Blaine might actually have some form of psi abilities.  I realize that it's highly unlikely seeing as how he's known as an illusionist, however, some of the things he does seem beyond what other illusionists do (like some of the street magic he does, which is amazing).  Well, I was just wondering about this.

In my opnion, I don't know, but I think he has something to do with mind over matter about him.

What? are you saying that any form of Illusionist loses their ability to do psi?
<br />

<br />
All we know some of his tricks has a bit of psi in it.
<br />

<br />
Most of his tricks are illusions, but there are somethings I don't really know.

			This topic comes up a lot.  Believe it or not, magicians do things that you can't figure out.  They DESIGN their tricks so you can't figure them out!  So don't use the fact that, &quot;Gee, I can't figure out this trick&quot; to mean &quot;it must be real!!!&quot;.
<br />

<br />
You are being fooled.  That is the POINT of magic.  To fool you.
<br />

<br />
Both David Blaine and Criss Angel are wonderful performers and entertainers.  They are magicians.  All of the tricks you see on TV actually do have an explaination that doesn't involve psionics.  Even though you can't figure out what that explaination is, doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.

			Yes, how did David Blaine bend those prison bars (not that I think he might have done it with psionics...).  Still though, David Blaine might be ripped, but there are probably stronger guys in that prison than him.  Not only that, but some of the people in that prison have been there for over 35 years and never saw the prison bars bend before...
