			Okay, In martial arts there is a lot of talk about &quot;Chi&quot; or the &quot;Universal Engery&quot; so could &quot;Chi&quot; and Psi be one and the same?
<br />

<br />
In martial arts they say the stomach is the &quot;Sea of Chi&quot; so they get their chi from the stomach.  
<br />

<br />
In psionics you get psi from a source.
<br />

<br />
If the two are the one and the same, Could that meen that we are the own source of psi?

interesting some people believe the solar plexus whichc is around the stomach holds alot of energitic value and such in chakra or psi and chi is more of a fluffy term than chi dont ask me probally DBZ's fault but im sure there related considering most matial arts comlement psionics

chi is just a word, in the scientific world the similar phenomenom was labeled &quot;psi&quot; the greek letter for the unknown.  Just study the two and decide for yourself.  I have determined that they are the same actual substance, but we psions look at it much differently in what it can do externally.  Usually the chinese &quot;chi&quot; is used to signify your internal energy flows along pathways (meridians) and there are many forms of medicine designed to correct blockages in your energy flow (accupuncture most notably).

When people say they get energy from their stomach it is mostly a visualization, with the stomach being the center of you that is where most people feel feelings and therefore it seems natural.  It doesn't really mean that they get all their energy from a single organ.
<br />

<br />
Also to note, most people do use energy from their own bodies to create constructs and the such, this energy comes into your body in the form of food, and is depleted in many various processes throughout your body (psionics being only one of the many numerous).
<br />

<br />
Your post was a bit hard to follow, but that is what I thought of when I read it.  Mostly the &quot;chi&quot; vs &quot;psi&quot; argument boils down to the method in which each group uses the &quot;energy.&quot;  But the actual energy itself is very similar in the fact that they are both created from your body and used by conscious direction of your mind.

			I think they are just different names of the same substance. Just like water isn't &quot;water&quot; in every language, you can't expect psi to be called the same thing in every langauge. Since they sort of have the same properties, I just sort of put two and two together and figured that they were talking about the same thing. If you really want to know, I guess you could ask Martial Artist.

			it's are relativly that same, just a different method of use with different rules.  But your putting to much on what psionics is.  psionics and psions are a pretty loose bunch of people.  Not really following one creed.

			Well, I'm almost a black belt, and quite honestly, much of the power comes from your solar plexus (sp?). Chi energy comes from there, and is exerted in your ki-halp (yell). I think they are similar, but not linked. THere are many differences between Chi and Psi.

			to me their basically the same thing, chi is just more concentrated then regular psi, a weak chi ball is about 150 times stronger then a regular psi ball, maybe to put it into better perspective I take 3 seconds to make a chi ball and takes about 30 mins of full focus concentration on psi to make it the same strenght. Just my 2 cents on it.

			from what i have experienced, chi seems to be more physical. i mean i think they are on and the same, but my friend does aikido and taught me some stuff, which is hard to explain but it works.
<br />

<br />
imo, chi, psi etc, what bladeslinger said. but its the philosophy, chi has a major background in the eastern beleifs, and i think its that development that has made it more powerful. psi hasn't really been talked about and practiced through history, its only in the past century that its really hyped up.
<br />

<br />
meh, my opinion.
