Don't get your hopes up my friend. It looks like this is over (as SFG stated). I just wanted to get the truth out. Either he doesn't care anymore or he doesn't like being told that he's wrong (or maybe the most obvious possibility: that he doesn't have time <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />, therefore a response would take a long time and none of us would care anymore <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />).

But I do want to make a point:
<br />

<br />
There have been isolated children (those who have never recieved contact until resuced by authorities, or found in the wilderness, etc). One of them had learned no emotions, because emotions are something you learn from your parents while still a very infant child.

			Umm..an emotion is a physiological process.  You don't gain the ability to make new neurotransmitters relating to certain emotions only after those emotions are displayed to you.  Isn't it a bit more likely the kid was fighting for survival his whole life and was terribly jaded/had post-traumatic stress disorder?  Maybe he was lucky and simply had an inability to express/understand emotions (which happens if someone is born without a corprus callosum) which gave him a dispassionate nature ALLOWING him to survive on his own for so long.  I think you've gravely overstepped the boundaries of logical deduction with your conclusion mattz...

			&quot;With the world the way it is today, humankind's greatest flaw is its emotions.&quot;
<br />

<br />
you condemn one of the most powerful things in nature?! the arrogance!  
<br />

<br />
&quot;Emotions were useful when we were still cavemen. Now that we have achieved the technological level that we have, we no longer really need them.&quot;
<br />

<br />
absurd! emotions are and always have been one of our greatest aids in everything.
<br />

<br />
&quot;blahblah selfish bad thing yakyakyak&quot;
<br />

<br />
bullshit. if people weren't selfish no one would try to save themselves when they were in danger.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Humans have no choice in what they do as it's always motivated by unconscious reasons.&quot;
<br />

<br />
That's subconscious! unconscious means you're asleep. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;True Will unaffected by desire is called enlightenment.&quot;
<br />

<br />
existence unaffected by desire is called &quot;just sittin' round like a moron&quot;.
<br />

<br />
&quot;If ego is expressed and emotions are more tangled then no one is enlightened.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
if emotions are not expressed then people get brain cancer and other horrible things.
<br />

<br />
&quot;If a society exists then not all can be enlightened, if complex society exists then not all can be enlightened.&quot;
<br />

<br />
being &quot;enlightened&quot; is a hollow victory if you don't have emotions to enjoy it with.
<br />

<br />
&quot;No one is smarter then you, they just learn to think and read more.&quot;
<br />

<br />
what a beautiful, inspirational load of crap. it's nice to believe that if you just try to learn something you can, but it's not true, some people think faster than others, some are stronger, some are better at everything and some suck at everything, one can increase their abilities, sure, but even enormous amounts of practice can't defeat a natural talent.

Why are you bringing this up again?
<br />

<br />
I suggest you read my second post in this thread. You will make yourself look like an idiot if you don't, my OP has already been replied to several times with the exact same points. Did you even read the entire thread, or did you, in a fit of amazement and anger at my &quot;arrogance&quot;, skip over it <span style="font-style: italic">just to attack me</span>? This is the exact place that emotional control needs to be exercised, and you are clearly failing.
<br />

<br />
This is exactly the sort of thing that annoys me. A person will see something and immediately jump to conclusions without looking to see if their post is necessary, which I am certain yours is not.

didn't read the website, but our SAP class did a project on the child Genie
<br />

<br />
...wasn't raised from animals, she was left in a room for 10 years. neglected by her parents.
<br />
was still using a toilet-training thing
<br />
room had no windows/other ways of seeing the world
<br />
had never experienced emotion
<br />

<br />
--
<br />

<br />
well, in the end, she ended up learning fractured english, with no grammar whatsoever. she could do all the same things any other human could, with her hand-eye co-ordination and other parts of the brain that control movement

Beleive it or not that is a key element when it comes to being the pray or the pradator. Every second counts.
<br />

<br />
I know I said this a few times before. But in the brain, we are geneitic design to feel emotions before the neocortex can even react. The reason for this is that when something in the bushes makes a noise...that could be a tiger looking for food.
<br />

<br />
What I found to be amazing is that the amygdala is even able to highjack the rest of the brain incase of danger. Such as jumping in the air when you &quot;thought&quot; you heard your mother in laws voice..
<br />

<br />
However survival of the fittness is never truely kind...such as shooting your own child when you thought she was at her friends but infact was in the closest. While you instinitly thought it was a robber.
<br />

<br />
We feel before we can even think.

THAT is the root cause of most forms of violence. That is the point I'm trying to make and the point that many people seem to have overlooked in my posts.
