			This is my first Hypothesis on what could be the psionic realm, and perhaps other phemoneas in our physics world. To what I came to understand of psionics what I thought first was tachyon particles. But what I deviced to do was to take my old hypothesis of &quot;faster then light&quot; travel to see how it works with it. I fingure I might just have something good here. I first have to explain the basis of my &quot;faster&quot; of light travel.
<br />

<br />
First is first, techanigly its not really faster then light at all. I have came up to two different ideas to travel faster then light they may just be possible. However I already know of the flaws behind it, your welcome at any time to say them. To what I understand of Einsteins theories of general relativity when I was younger I saw something odd. The basis of things to go near light speed are often said in 3 simple formulas. Speical relativity is often simple in mathmanical form adcording to the rest of mathicans. Unlike Gerneral which is by far more complex.The 3 formulas tell us what happens where we speed up. Simply we gain mass, time moves slower. and we get smaller in size. But what I saw is that &quot;maybe there something more?&quot;
<br />

<br />
I think perhaps a foruth formula mite be needed. I believe maybe spacetime is effective even more from these 3 forumals. If space curves inward on mass, and we gain mass and get smaller as well as time. Would the road we take be smaller? This is something that strikes me. Now the 2nd thought of this faster then light travel mite be able to be found in a mass that amost travels near that speed. Comic rays, I saw travel near the speed of light, and due to there small size they don't really slow down. But here is something odd I found, a comic ray when it reach near light speed tends to give off a &quot;pion&quot; particle. a pion particle normaly quickly decays into other forms of particles such as a muon or a neutronio. Sometimes a pion decays into a electron! But get this, the type of pion that decays from a comic ray becomes two &quot;photons&quot;.
<br />

<br />
So it hits me, what if the brain itself is just projecting information from itself? It makes sense on some levels, comic rays move so fast they move through us and even the entire earth without us even knowing. I havent look up on the other particles that a pion decays into. But the electron and photon interest me so far.
<br />

<br />
I found that my faster then light theory mite subject a few things. It space is shorten due to speed itself, simpler to &quot;tachyon bubble&quot; you find off the warp drive system off startrek. A different warp drive mite be possible...but the fact that everything tends to break away from physics when you reach extreme condictions tells me that the pion mite be from a singulartiy flux from the fast speeds. I know that the universe is speeding up and I wonder if the mircowave background itself is a decaying pion state of fast moving matter from pion particles. I also know that during nuclear reactions the neutronio tends to move faster then light, or &quot;teleport&quot; somehow.
<br />

<br />
So this is my theory so far. How do you all think of it?

			I forgot to add some ideas about my comic rays being psinoic idea. Well first it sort of a mix...but thats not what I'm getting to. I know that comic rays are nothing but fast moving atoms, so if a atom can pass through something quickly it may or may not be able to absorb information and then tranfers that information when we get it. I think the human brain is just playing catch with other players in the world. I'm wondering about seeing into the future. I simply wonder that chemcials in the brain are able to travel faster then light and simply go back in time. But that is just a after idea.

			<img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> well of cource, but we got to have some thought as to how we can detect the flow of it. I just wanted to know how you thought about it (besides that)
