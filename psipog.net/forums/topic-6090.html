			I found out a couple of sensing techniques, two of them in one night.
<br />

<br />
1. Using the ground. We were playing a variation of 'tag' and I decided I'd try something new. I crouched on the ground and sensed, as apart of the ground, along the gound for any energies touching the ground. A fairly useful technique if someone is touching the ground. I haven't been able to do it long range, though, seeing as that was the first and only time I've done it.
<br />

<br />
2. A radar technique of sorts. What I did this time was I stood up and moved a bunch of energy into my hands. Then I extended my arms outwards and shot energy out, like a beam. Then I simply turned in a circle and when my energy was disrupted, I knew someone/thing was there. I dunno how, but I'm able to discern what's a person and what isn't.
<br />

<br />
3. I don't really know how to explain this one. There isn't anything I use but myself. I just close my eyes and focus on the surrounding area. I feel energy going down the back of my head, and that's when I pick up on people. I know it isn't very discriptive, but it works. One of my friends can do it so well that he can practically see, cause he can tell the shapes of objects and stuff. It's crazy.
<br />

<br />
But yeah, there you all go. So when you think someone is coming up behind you, or is around you and you can't see, just try and sense for it.

			cool.   I always use 3- just kinda pick up on their sig.   I can do it very accurately usually and I can also find objects with a kind of psychometry, I guess. it works like this.

			haha....i might try 3....

i've always been using auric vision to differentiate different ppl n locating them

			I've tried the  3rd one. It's very useful for identifing <span style="font-weight: bold">what</span> is there, but borderline useless for who.

I didn't interpret #3 as auric vision. I make a thin psi shield and I wait until something comes close enough to pierce it.
<br />

<br />
But auric vision is good. Its like fingerprinting for psions.

			for sensing, i use a similar technique to #3, but i use a variation of #2 for telepathic scanning if playing shapes and colors or something (not with hands)
<br />

<br />
#1 sounds interesting too. i usually just always feel the ground with my feet. they're already touching it, just try to notice the subtle vibrations
