<br />

<br />
On behalf of the PsiPog staff, I welcome you. I'm sure the majority of our members have heard of your infamous challenge towards the supernatural. There have been a fair amount of threads based on your challenge.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps you'll remember me, we've spoken before. As I've stated previously, I would be more than willing to participate in your challenge. If you've viewed the media section, you'll find some of my material using psychokinesis. I would be more than willing to participate in your challenge using psychokinesis as well as remote viewing. 
<br />

<br />
Although I would be more than willing to participate in your challenge based on testing psychokinesis, my main skill would be remote viewing. I am a professional technical remote viewer. I graduated from TRVU which is owned/operated by Psi Tech. I know you've heard of them. Which leads me to my next question, why didn't you take Psi Tech's challenge towards you? I've personally spoke with both Joni and Dane concerning your challenge and from what I've heard, it's not worth my time. 
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.psitech.net/news/tsl_090502.htm" target="_blank">http://www.psitech.net/news/tsl_090502.htm</a>
<br />

<br />
If you are indeed the real James Randi, I would like to hear from you. You can email me at <a href="#">JoeT@PsiPog.net</a>. If you're willing, I'd like to discuss what the testing will include and what I should expect. From there, I'll make the appropriate decision whether or not I'll participate.
<br />

<br />
I look forward to your resonse.

Might I inquire as to why my examination is not worth your time or $1,000,000.  You must charge a ton of money for that professional remote viewing buisness!

Randi - is there anyway you can prove that we are really talking to you?  For all we know, you are just a kid that is using Randi's picture to have some fun.

Does this mean that SheepKing is really the King of Sheep?  That peebrain has pee for a brain and that he looks like domo-kun?

Pardon the sarcasm but that is quite silly to put that forward as 'proof'.  I'm sure you'll agree?

You make the claim that you're James Randi, so I am demanding a little more proof than a picture.  This is called healthy skepticism.  In all likelyhood, you're just a prankster having a little bit of fun, stirring up some trouble on the forums.  Not a HUGE deal... although it does break our rules, and you shouldn't lie.
<br />

<br />
What is the real issue here?  You want to see how the community would react to an offer of $1,000,000?  As you can see, JoeT takes it pretty seriously, and I've talked to him in the past about how he's planned on taking the challenge.  I also took the challenge serious for a short amount of time - until I witnessed an amazing amount of fraud just from asking simple questions relating to the money.  You can read about my experience at the following article: <a href="../show.php@cmd=wp&amp;id=14.html" target="_blank">http://psipog.net/show.php?cmd=wp&amp;id=14</a>

			First of all, this topic is a waste of everyone's time and I suggest someone locks it.
<br />

<br />
Second, every three days someone re-invents this James Randi topic and it's always the same. I think one of the forum's rules ought to be &quot;no James Randi topics&quot; or something because this is starting to get annoying <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
And I would also participate in this thing for a million $, as would many people from around the globe if this was real (just read Sean's article, it convinced me). Psionic communities would be swimming in cash if any of these tests were real, so I frankly just don't believe in them. And who knows what would happen to you if you proved psionic abilities to scientific communities and started spreading the word, you would probably get &quot;accidently shot&quot; or something ... I'm sure top-secret working scientist know about all of this for quite some time, people behind it just don't want the entire world to know, so they're making them believe it's all just a ferrytale. Well guess what people once you see it you start to believe it. And once you believe it you reconsider your opinions about the world around you.
<br />

<br />
The funniest thing is that all this is actually pretty easy to do if you devote yourself to it a little, and it gets easier by every practice. In the end it is so easy already that you can convince every skeptic in a matter of seconds. And no-one even wants to try, they insist that it's just not real because they say so. Its funny how quickly opinions change when someone views the thing first hand <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.
