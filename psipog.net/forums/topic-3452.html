			What do you all suggest I should be able to do, psionically, to be able to make a decent construct? I've been looking around here for a while and I can make a good psi-ball, it's just I don't know if any constucts I've made have worked. I've only tried one, and if I discussed it, it would be considered combat, so we'll stay out of that. But how should I train myself to make a decent construct? Psi pets amaze and intrigue me to no end and I'd like to start on my way towards that.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for any tips.

			A good practice technique is simply working on being able to send it elsewhere programming it simple to begin with, if you've a pet there would be good feedback from that :O if not then could just practice catching birds on the fly or when their on the ground send the simple constructs to em. If depending on how you built and programmed, the birds might do strange things. I've been making tons of simple constructs sending em to either my cat or to the birds outside and I take note of what kind of reactions that they give. On a further note, in all my experiments I've stayed strictly away from any kind of harm/retaliation type constructs.

			If I was you I'd make a simple psiball, and program it to hold shape and stay around for a day.  Then check on it every few hours and see when it falls apart.  Once it falls apart at the prescribed time try moving that time back more and see how long you can get a construct to last.
<br />

<br />
After that I would start programming more advanced things for them to do in addition to holding shape and staying together for a while.  Try to stick with hold shape + time period and one other thing at that point...too much stuff gets kinda muddled up if you aren't experienced enough.
<br />

<br />
Thats my suggestions, basically it can be summed up as...practice.  Practice making a lot of constructs, and then practice sensing them or you can try programming them to resonate or &quot;buzz&quot;-like feeling when you touch them to know where they are and if they are active.

<br />

<br />
but as soon as i want to do things with it, or remove my hands it seem to dissapear.
<br />

<br />
also when i want to feel it, i can't
<br />

			Easy...read Gnome's sensitivity manual which pretty much can be sumed up as more practice = more sensitivity

You need to program your psiball (which we call a construct once you add more programming than just &quot;be a ball&quot;) to hold its shape for a certian duration.  This is also sometimes called &quot;shelling&quot; a construct.
