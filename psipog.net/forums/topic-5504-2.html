			yes apollo, I do want you to get the video, because I personally believe he is the real deal, if you've seen most of his stunts you'd believe it too, like think of it, how could the walking on water be faked? or the levitating from one builing to another, or walking down the side of a building above the streets where everyone can see... Some of the small tricks are just illusion, like the tricks that he shows how to do, those are small illusions to do at a party or something... Also as for David Blaine, he is definetly fake, or at least really really bad at what he does, and he focuses moreso on card tricks (last time I saw his show, haven't seen it in months upon months)

Now if he could seriously levetate across buildings, why fake it on that block?
<br />

<br />
Walking on water is easy.  He probably had a plastic board barely underneath the water surface.  People who are in his videos are all paid actors.

walking on water=strip of plexiglass just under the surface..it's strong enough....he's openly shared and admitted they're all tricks!!!..get that in your head...and blaine doesn't only deal with card tricks if you've actually watched his dvd and researched a little...it shows him doing all kinds of crazy stuff in african countries as well ( levitating a leaf just plucked from a tree, having water pour from his hand with nothing in it and no long sleeves, or how about pulling out that girls teeth in a casino then spitting them back in her mouth with dozens watching, also phasing his arm through the front store window of a watch shop with people right beside him...just to list a few)...you shouldn't talk about things you know nothing about

			well derrick that's why I added that little comment in brackets... You see the last time I saw his show well he only did card stuff...

<br />
And if you want me to name more criss angel tricks: the one where he walks through glass (people say hinges on the glass, look at the f-ing glass there are no invisible hinges, it would be very visible) The one where he makes the person levitate, the one where he pulls a girl in half and the legs stand up afterwards, all his disappearing and reappearing on top of buildings within seconds, the one where he jumps on a dirtbike and disappears in the air and ends up in the audience
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Also a piece of plexi glass that long would bend like no other, and would snap very quickly, plus people swim in front of him and underneath him

			Log2 if you seriously believe he PULLED A GIRL IN HALF....bottom line your a moron....P.S there have been many other magicians doing the same type of stuff...separating their own upper body from their legs and moving both around...taking their own heads off and holding them simply to connect them minutes later...the best court jesters used to do these types of things for kings and top notch royalty...bottom line log2=moron

			well I'm not saying the pull a girl in half thing is real or when he cuts himslef in half, because I happen to also know a lot about the human body, and, well everyone know the legs wouldn't be able to move without a brain <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />
Also I work with machines all the time, and I happen to know there is no such conveyor that would be able to do that, you would need a somewhat fishing line or acting wire to be able to near make it invisible, and seeing as how there were a lot of close ups and you didn't see any acting wire, or any shirt lifting slightly because of a hidden acting wire, that leaves my to a sort of fishing line... however you may say it could have been shark line, well take a look at how thick shark line is and you'll see it had to be thin to be invisible... But fishing line is meant to be pulled not bowed, it would break instantly
<br />

<br />
Also Derrick you cannot say I'm a moron, or else you're saying that a lot of people in the world are morons... Also if you call me a moron, that's just like calling a jewish person a moron when you're a christian, because they don't believe in the same thing as you

wait a second..... Do you know what fishing line is used for?  Fishing!  How do you think someone caughts a fish?  The fish pulls and it bends the rod which therefore &quot;bows&quot; the line.

Of all things you could have picked, that is the worst example.  This is why:
<br />

<br />
1) Criss Angel is and has admitted that he is an illusionist (religion has not)
<br />

<br />
2) You are bringing religion into a thread at psipog (and it is not allowed)
<br />

<br />
3) I have shown you a video of Criss Angel <span style="font-weight: bold">SHOWING</span> people how to do the stuff he does and you still believe he is keeping some type of secret.  If any religion left behind a video, there would be a lot less other religions.
