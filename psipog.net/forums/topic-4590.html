			I am putting this here because I guess it is a form of telepathy.
<br />
I was at a Target today and there was this baby crying and it was really annoying and giving me a headache.   So, I tried to send this psi energy at her saying &quot;shut up&quot;  after I did this the baby stoped crying and just sort of staired at me with this weird expresion like &quot;what was that??&quot;.

Anyone else ever tried this?

			Thats not exactly controlling other living things, but simply communicating through telepathy. In this case, you asked the baby to shut up and it obeyed because it somehow understood the message you sent it. (:

			It is impossible to control things completely.  All anyone can do is use suggestion to overpower the target's mind until they give in and obey you.  Good telepaths can do this without the subject noticing.

Telepathic Suggestion is a safe topic as long as you do not discuss hurting others.

The thread is called &quot;Controling other living things&quot;?
<br />
I'm not against it, but in other threads shit like that was a big nono.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, TPS can be quite cool if you do it right. Works best when you ask nicely in a &quot;firm&quot; message, Not into the whole commanding thing <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

			Okay I can speak for this one, I was talking on the phone with my girlfriend, she was tired and laying in bed. She said &quot;Im too lazy to get up, but im sooo hungry!&quot; I overtook her conscious mind i guess, as i was suddenly in her house, i walked her downstairs and made her eat a cookie. It was awesome. I think i more overshadowed her then TPS b/c I felt everything; and I mean everything. *awkward silence* <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> I havent done it since then because i havent really seen a reason to.

			I would say....that if you're developing TPS, do it on animals. I don't like doing it to humans. I think it's wrong...but thats a whole other issue. So I practice on animals.
