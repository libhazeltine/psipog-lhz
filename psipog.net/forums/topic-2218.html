			Well, this is quite cool, I was cooking in a sauce pan, stiring somthing, and my hand slid across about a quater of the suace pan, everything went slow mow.  My mind was going, &quot;holy shit i need to move my hand&quot; but my hand wasn't really responding and kept draggin acroos the pan until if finally came out.  I checked my hand, didn't look burnt, touched it, definetly did hurt.  It was wierd some how i touch a 100+ degree pan and didn't get burnt.  I touched it to make sure it was accually hot and...yeah definetly hot.  I just defied getting burnt!!!  I wouldn't sugest  trying to learn to do this cause you'll probalby burn yourself alot but it was probably the largest random psi evet i've ever had.  it was neatoooo!

			How fast was you hand on the pan?

You can run through a pile of hot coals if you keep a constant movement without Psychokinesis, although, I don't know if it would be considerable for a pan..

			I cant really tell cause as i said things kinda slowed down, but i definetly should have gotten burnt.  I tested it again after that and it was really hot, probably burn after less than a second of touching.

			Some kind of adaptive metobalism.. or something like that i donno. 
<br />
In a way that could explain some people sitting in ice for super long periods of time, they don't freeze to death, or even get hypothermia, or anything.

			I had this happen to me a LONG time ago, when I was about 5-6 years old.  I hadn't been into psi then.  A hot iron fell on my hand.  I remember it hurting a lot, but there was no burn.  I'm not trying to say that psi wasn't involved, just adding my $0.02.

			I got this out of the guinness world records.. it reminds me alot of this:
<br />
Full Body Ice Contact Endurance
<br />
The record for the longest time spent in direct, full-body contact with ice, is 1 hr 8 min and was achieved by Wim Hof (Netherlands) on the set of Guinness World Records: 50 Years, 50 Records (ITV, UK) at the London Television Studios, London, UK on September 11, 2004.
<br />
I believe he was using PK to influence his body *shifty glance*

			Even some good meditation could acheive that.  Which i guess would be PK.  Idk what caused this.  I guess my mind just reacted faster than my body.  Interesting...

Coal is unique in that sense that it wont burn your skin, but it shall heat it up emmensly. Though a pan, depending on the materials its made of or currently in it, should have left the area inflamed and red, if on for a longer period of time, then yes burnt, if it was a quick slide off and was inflamed and red i'd think it was normal, as for the slowing of perception, possibly just a result from the sudden adrenaline rush.

			That happened to me except the burn and hot part. I was playing baseball, and I jumped to catch the ball but I slipped so I was gonna fall down. As I was falling, it felt like the time slowed down. I was thinking at that moment that I was falling, and also like what the hell is going on? I also felt like kind of weak and little slow. That happens to me mostly when I fall down by accident.
