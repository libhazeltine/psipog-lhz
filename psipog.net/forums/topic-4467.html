Do you even realise how cliche this remark is!? <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

Now seriously, why do so many still think that performing psychic phenomena works as if you have a little bucket filled with depletable energy from which you draw energy while performing a skill...
<br />
Levitation would require some alteration of energy, rather then getting a really really big bucket of energy from which you draw energy. You see, everything <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> energy, so you can never run out of energy. Your microcosmic orbit(your personal energy) is directly connected with the macrocosmic orbit(universal energy). Therefore, you can, by altering your own energy (read: focusiing the mind through intention and attention) affect the macrocosmic energy in such a way that it's remarkable intelligence arranges aspects in time and space as to fullfill your intention. So you see you are not using your own little bucket of energy, you are just pushing the button on the machine which activates the endless macrocosmic energy. You are not drawing that energy from your body, you are just consciously giving commands to this universal intelligence which will perfectly assist you in fullfilling that intention. You do not have to drag your body from the ground with mental power. You just command the macrocosmic energies to do what you wish, and it will just happen. This goes for all these phenomena, you just have to know how to push the button instead of using only the energy of your own limited mind.

I believe levitation is possible, especcially while in meditation.

Now your explanation as to why I'm not too sure about since I'm not familiar what you are talking about. It does sound logical, but I don't want to jump on the band wagon too quickly.

btw....nice to know there are other martial artists on psipog.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

   You're an idiot. I really really wish you would leave forever. Have you ever wondered about why it's cliche? Maybe because it's the truth.
<br />

<br />
   You're doing a lot of talking, but you're not really posting any sources. I already warned you about this. I'll begin editing your articles to take out all the trash you don't back up if you don't start using sources soon.
<br />

<br />
   Are you talking about changing the universe? Why not change everything so that you're god? I mean, you CAN reprogram the world... can't you? Isn't that what you're saying? Correct me if I'm wrong.
<br />

<br />
   heh, I cannot believe that people think the universe has a consciousness.

My sources are too many scattered around in books, internet, scriptures, people in real-life, meditations, so I cannot post a source for everything I write, since everything I write has become a part of me and it comes from me as the source.
