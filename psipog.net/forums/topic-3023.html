Thought loudness is the same as what some people (me) call &quot;thinking loudly&quot;.  It is like broadcasting but involentaroly.  Have you ever accidentally picked up someone's thought during a conversation?  The person was &quot;thinking loudly&quot;.  To think loudly, feel like you are about to say something.  Like when you studder, you feel like you can say it but your tongue wont go where it needs to go.  You are thinking about how to pronounce the word and therefore, you are thinking loudly.

			no thats not wha it means when it refers to thought loudness apollo. it means to not  say anything in your mind. beacuse the higer the voice is in your moind the futher you are away from the aplpha state in brain wave terms. the quieter your thought or no thout loudness enables you to slow down your brain waves and reach the alpha stage witch is the bridge between uncousios and the subconious. the hern locations are in the sight spectrum theory. ive read both books if you have any futer uestions about uyta ask me. im not a master or anything its just that pepole on this site wont interpret the concpts as they are meant to be
