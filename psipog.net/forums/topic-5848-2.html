			Sorry for the misinterpretation. Psionics and Wicca I always find in the New Age section of bookstores whenever I look for some reading on either or. Also, I am not grouping them as similar but merely because they are the most popular I have heard of in discussions and would like to inform people about it if they have heard about it as well. I didn't mean any harm or disrepsect to anyone. My sources:

<br />
I used quotes from the top 2. I can post my speech outline in case it's necessary...I will anyways I guess: (Be gentle on critiquing <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />)
<br />

<br />
Specific Purpose: To inform others about the growing New Age minority
<br />

<br />
Introduction
<br />

<br />
I.	Open With Impact: If you could have any supernatural power, what would it be? If I could choose any, it would be the power to teleport. How great would that be?
<br />
A.	Although some phenomena are pretty far out there, there are some that is very real.
<br />
B.	Many people are born with certain powers or abilities without ever knowing it.
<br />
C.	Some people even join covens to develop their abilities or even reach a greater level of achievement.
<br />
II.	Focus on Thesis Statement: As of now, there is a growing minority within the world that focuses on the practice of the paranormal.
<br />
III.	Connect With the Audience: It would be wise to at least be informed of the capabilities the human body has so that you may one day take interest in these abilities.
<br />
IV.	Preview: Today, I’m going to tell you about the two main groups within the minority that practice paranormal abilities, why they do this, what may be there goals, and my own personal experiences.
<br />

<br />
Body
<br />

<br />
I.	Main Point: The first and very popular group is the Wiccans.
<br />
A.	Wicca, the religion Wiccans practice, is the modern term for witchcraft.
<br />
B.	The Celtic Connection says in an article, “Wicca is a belief system and way of life based upon the reconstruction of pre-Christian traditions”(The Celtic Connection, 1997) It is a pagan religion and was wiped out by the medieval church through rumors of satanic practices and relating the religion with the rumored “Satan Star” or pentagram.
<br />
C.	Wicca is also known as the study of white magick, spelled with a “k”. Wiccans vow to follow a set of rules, Wiccan Rede, to help human society not harm it. They cannot hurt themselves or anyone or anything.
<br />
D.	Some people become Wiccan to try something new or they are into the spells for their own specific reason.
<br />
E.	The Celtic Connection also says in the previous article, “Witchcraft in ancient history was known as &quot;The Craft of the Wise&quot; because most [Wiccans] were in tune with the forces of nature.”(The Celtic Connection, 1997) And I figure being in tune with nature and creating peace are the main goals of the basic Wiccan.
<br />

<br />
(Signpost: Now with some knowledge about modern witchcraft, let’s move on to a different type of practice.)
<br />
II.	Main Point: The second yet less known about group is the Psions.
<br />
A.	Psionics are the abilities hat Psions practice and Psi is the term used to describe the energy Psions use for Psi is the Greek symbol for the unknown.
<br />
B.	Psions are still working on understanding Psionics. The Parapsychological Practitioners Society states in an article, “…We need to break apart the energy. This is the challenge. This is one of the most important parts of understanding Psionics.” (Parapsychological Practitioners Society, 2004) Many Psions try to explain Psionics and how they work but have trouble explaining what Psi is and how Psi works.
<br />
C.	Many people basically practice Psionics due to fantasy. Others practice Psionics to try to further develop their ability to manipulate their own energy. Some practice Psionics to try to reach a higher state of mind, though Psionics is simply the gift that comes with that achievement.
<br />
D.	The main goal of many Psions is to learn more about Psi, how these things happen and are possible, and to develop their abilities further.
<br />

<br />
(Signpost: Now that I have told you about the two groups, let me tell you about my own personal experiences.)
<br />

<br />
III.	Main Point: My experiences with the paranormal range from the basic weird dreams to the creepy “wow that guy is crazy” events.
<br />
A.	I remember it still, very clearly, my first vision.
<br />
B.	Since then, I had an interest in the paranormal and one day searched for others.
<br />
C.	I practiced things like energy manipulation and telekinesis.
<br />
D.	I had achievements that made me proud.
<br />
E.	I am currently working towards Self-Realization.
<br />
F.	My creepiest event was a run-in with a Wiccan spirit.
<br />

<br />
(Signpost: Those are just some of the things that have happened to me during my spiritual changes.)
<br />

<br />
Conclusion
<br />

<br />
I.	Summarize: I’ve told you a lot about the two main groups of the new growing minority.
<br />
A.	There are the Wiccans which try to become in-tune with nature and fight the Satanic thoughts about them in a peaceful manner.
<br />
B.	There are the Psions who mainly try to further develop their abilities and learn about Psi.
<br />
C.	I’ve opened myself up to you and told you about the phenomena in my own life.
<br />
II.	Close With Impact: I know there are many of you who may think I’m just a psychotic who fantasizes too much.
<br />
A.	There is a growing minority out there and these abilities are real.
<br />
B.	Like an important Yogi once said, “We are Immortal.”
<br />
C.	We have the ability to do anything if we put our minds to it. Why not this?

			I would suggest that instead of saying THE two main groups, you say &quot;two significant groups&quot; or &quot;two groups that represent this new cultural movement&quot;, something along those lines. THE two main groups sounds a bit too concrete.

First of all, &quot;New Agers&quot; are more commonly associated with the spiritual side of psi/paranormal and the &quot;New Agers&quot; usually go into philosophy. What you have described in this speech are basically just the people involved in the paranormal. Also anybody who says wiccan is not psionics is wrong. Wiccan &quot;spells&quot; are basically psionic activities turned into a religion. I once heard a girl talking about scrying and I was like &quot;RV!&quot; Magick is just psi with a different more spiritually connected method. I don't know what you are doing with this speech because most people on here are already psions. You're preaching to the choir. 
<br />

<br />
Second of all, this New Age group has not suddenly come out. Wiccan has been around like forever and thus psi. Also the ancient chinese practiced a form of psi. This is not a fast growing group. This has always been a small minority of the human race and will probably always stay that way.

Very nice, I liked it.   It avoided the word &quot;New Age&quot;(very bad connotation there), and didn't say psi and wicca are the same.   Nice job!   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

I'd disagree there.   Yes, the end result may be the same(emphasis on may, I don't know a whole lot about Wicca), but the way you get there is very different.    To me, at least, that makes them different.   
<br />

<br />
Slaughtering everyone in the room to get some quiet is one way, but just leaving the room or telling everyone to shut up is another altogether.
