			No, I do not think that a construct helped you. First of all, I doubt that you have much experience or control over psi. Second, what exactly do you think the construct did? Balanced your legs in place and stomach?
<br />

<br />
   Regardless, it just sounds psychological. It seems as if though you just kept practicing and wanted to do it better which led to your well... doing them. Practice and motivation make perfect.

you dont really need to use psi to do a handstand.
<br />

<br />
To do a handstand correctly, first learn to carry your body weight on your arms. By putting your hands on the ground and kicking on leg straight up and having the other leg close to the ground, you learn to feel your body weight on your hands. 
<br />

<br />
Then, after you can do that pretty well, work on bringing up the leg that was close to the ground to where the leg that is going straight up is. When you feel your body comming down, bring one foot down close to your hands to stand back up.
<br />

<br />
Having straight legs and arms help a lot if you're just starting out. 
<br />

<br />
Also, to maintain balance, spread your fingers out, and try grabbing the floor with your hands. The 2nd row of joints on your fingers should be going up. This will help keep your body balanced.
<br />

<br />
When you feel like you're falling down backwards, you can tuck your head in, and roll on your back to prevent any horrible fallings.
<br />

<br />
I guess you can use psi to help hold it up longer, or basic visualization. For example, when i do it, I imagine my body as a pillar, or something like that. I try to use psi when i'm doing other skills though.

			Sounds like a placebo effect, but hey, if it helps you to do handstands, then more power to 'ya.
