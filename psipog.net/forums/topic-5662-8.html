			I would just like to ask that you guys be a little less harsh to GWN. He must of spent a hell of a lot of time typing all of those giant posts, and you just completely destroy him and all of his efforts. I know that opinions mean negative and positive but at least push him into the right direction if all you can give is negative remarks. 
<br />
It is best to give criticism in a calm and nicely mannered way. 
<br />
That is all I ask.

Sounds like he knows too much psi stuff to already know at the start. Shouldn't he learn these various traits along the way, during story progression?

			Well I think its wonderful for someone to dream and create, but a sad turth is that all creations are mock for what they are in this world. Being judged is after way of growing up, but not nearly as much as you judge others, its a two way street, but both ways can hit a brick wall.

I enjoy reading his posts (even if they are just a <span style="font-weight: bold">LITTLE</span> bit long  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> ) But there some things skills I can't help but wonder, I wont mentsion them now.

			I believe you guys misunderstood me. I am aware of the fact that he asked for opinions good and bad but when you give an opinion you should act in a kind manner. 
<br />
For example:
<br />
&quot;I dislike your manga, you have no plot.&quot; = Good criticism
<br />
&quot;You plot sucks shit, I am now going to throw up all over myself.&quot; = Bad criticism 
<br />

<br />

Thank you for the support Tankdown. I should respect their opinions it's just that they don't have to put it so curtly. As for the characters, I'd like to do that. I could even mention the relationships between the characters and how they change throughout the story. The only problem is that I need more time. I've got a research project due next week I think (don't know exact day) and I've been spending too much time on the forums making posts here. I think it would be best that I post info. about the characters after my report is due. Until then, if any of you would like to ask questions about the story in which I can answer with MUCH smaller posts <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> you are welcome to do so. One last thing, judging from some of the posts, there seems to be two types of people on this thread: the critics (Niushirra) who find every possible criticism and mock it unless it's completely original (and maybe screwed up like Evangelion) and then there's people like you, Tankdown, who point out my mistakes POLITELY and for the most part aren't too demanding about how original it looks. Frankly, I think it's hard to make something that original because so many ideas have been taken. I could try to change it but I'm going to need a lot of help. Feel free to ask questions.
<br />

<br />
P.S.  I apologize for the long posts Tankdown. I'm a detail freak. I can't help it and I get carried away (like in this post that was supposed to be 4 or 5 SHORT sentences long <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />).

			By the way, I edited the first post concerning critisizms, so that way anyone who wants to critisize me with such lack of manners can't say that I said he/she could. It was a foolish mistake for me to put it the way I did. If someone new to this thread comes in and decides to make a critisizm, my rule will be there in big bold and underlined words on the very first post as my alabi <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

That's right,  <span style="font-style: italic">all </span>the good ideas are not taken. I have A LOT of ideas that are completely original and I'm confident that if I could talk to the right people my ideas could turn out to be a book, movie, or manga  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> ....But that's always the problem isn't it. Needing to find the right people at the right time.
<br />

<br />
P.S My ideas are not only completely original but are also extremely captivating and complex...got an amazing idea for a plot...I've just been deciding if I should post it or not...I think I'll wait....Mabye start a new thread at a later time. Also Lawrence_of_Arabia is freakin' hilarious  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Stapler Man and TissueBox Boy are both telekinetik mutants from the planet Jargargarga IIV on the outskirts of the gamma quadrant. While in search of their neighbors Tyrannosaurus they come across an ancient twinkie able to unleash the power of a thousand suns. TissueBox Boy eats the twinkie and explodes thus hurtling Stapler Man through time and space to a distant world known as Protoearth where he meets 17 year old Lawrence_of_Arabia who has way too much time on his hands.

Sadly, yes. (LMAO!) He's a lot different in person though. When we talk in person we prefer to talk about spirituality and the meaning of life as opposed to exploding tissue boxes and talking dinosaurs. (Jameson and I are a lot funnier on the internet.)

I never thought of it that way. The only problem is that my manga would most likely turn out really wierd if I came up with something original like LOA's (Lawrence_of_Arabia) idea! On the other hand, his post about the evil sun and the opressed world gave me another idea for my manga. It caused me to think up an alternative world that Ushima would live in. Here are the different ways it could be done:
<br />

<br />
1. The world is controlled by a tyranical dictator who rules the world with an iron fist because of his amazing and powerful psionic abilities. He has a secret group of elite guards/minions who are also powerful but not nearly as powerful as he is. They mainly specialize in one ability but can do LITTLE bits of almost everything else. They carry out assassinations, espionage (eaves dropping on the common people/government officials (gov. officials have limited power but can be a slight threat to the dictator, yet they are needed to run the countries) to find traitors to the dictator) to keep the public under control. And below them are the standard police who, including the dictator and his guards, are the only ones allowed to wield guns. The police can use psi combat and if they become skilled enough and are considered worthy/loyal enough they get the chance to become an elite guard. Everyone else is allowed to have melee weapons for self-defense, because the cities are a dangerous place. Common people are allowed to use psionic abilities increase productivity and make their jobs easier. But it's against the law for them to do psi combat. And it is also illegal for them to be taught psi combat unless they are training to be police. Ushima's master was once a highly talented and powerful elite guard for the dictator who later retired because he was getting too old for his job.....at least that's what everyone thought <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />. He quit because he decided that he could use his special guard privileges to make a police training (with permission from the dictator of course) academy. But the police training academy is merely a front for his real plan. His real plan is to recruit brave, trust worthy, and hopeful students who could do undercover work and could therefore learn and use psi combat legally. They would get inside info. and would try their best to ascend in rank (the highest ranking officers get in contact with the elite guards for orders since the police never see the dictator in person). They would also try to sabotage the the dictator's political system dressed as-guess what?-NINJAS!! Ushima would, of course, be a promising and trustworthy student of the leader of the police academy. The master would choose his &quot;real students&quot; by evaluating their auras and listening to their thoughts. Every now and then he'd find a student who was obviously against the dictator and would recruit him and teach him secret and advanced psi combat techniques/tactics. Ushima would find trustworthy non-police friends while on/off duty via TP eavesdropping and aura evaluation after they did something that caught his attention (like performing an ability with immense skill, hinting that they may be powerful enough to use it for combat). His friends could become part of the police too. I'd better stop here <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
I have slightly different (I'd just type up the differences instead of the whole thing, lol) settings but I don't have much time. Tell me what you think. (but even I find it pretty cliched so I won't be surprised if I get disappoval)

			Here are some more ideas/add-ons:
<br />

<br />

<br />
2. similar setting, except the dictator would only control the city. But in secret from the rest of the world. He controls the people of his city with fear of mass murder. Once you decide to live in the city you can't leave <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />...unless you're a part of Ushima's possy <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. When Ushima leaves the city in secret he goes to other places where he learns other advanced abilities from other masters across the globe.
<br />

<br />
3. ADD-ON: there could be a psionic military for the city
<br />

<br />
4. ADD-ON: Ushima could fight in tournaments to move up in rank as a psionic police officer
<br />

<br />
That's all I've got for now. Tell me what idea or combinations of ideas you think is best.
