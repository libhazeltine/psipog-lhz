			After about 1 and a half days of practice at the psiwheel, I have finally moved it, and I am pretty certain it was me and not some draft or wind. The best bit of it all happened just minutes ago, when it followed my finger for about 2 seconds. It felt really cool. I might dedicate a bit more to pk now.
<br />

<br />
 Before the finger following, I also made it move several times today; in the morning twice, after I did some meditation (got up at half 6!),I think...yes, the day before that, and just before the finger following. I have noticed that whenever I do it, my mind is sort of not really thinking of anything, just asking it to move and then it happened. When I try to visualize it moving or force it, it doesn't move. So forcing clearly doesn't work well. Anyways, just wanted to share. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			id say work with that some more, then try to 'ask it' and then expect it to happen. Get into that mind state and do the above.

			Congrats. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things, now. Many people get 'stuck' on the psi-wheel, rather than experiement. 
<br />

<br />
Aim to improve but also for a better understanding of how it works for you. With that, it should be easier to get better.
<br />

<br />
Good luck.

			Oh yeah! Double whammy! I just did it again, but this time it was for about 4 seconds, twice! I used a method on another site I found where you shout at in your mind and tell it that you can move it, and then I just shouted &quot;go&quot; in my head and it started spinning. Then, I turned to look at the door and was feeling pretty pleased with myself,when I turned my head to look at the wheel again,  it started turning for about 4 seconds again, then it stopped, and i made it go the other way!

			Ok, now this is just insanely cool. Sorry bout all the posts about this but I now have loads of control over it. Iv'e progressed a lot in the last half an hour. I can now just look at it and it turns, at a decent pace. The only problem is that I can't seem to make my mind up about where it spins. It keeps spinning left and then stops and then right, so on so on. It's actually incredibly hilarious to watch. It's like the wheel is getting confused.And I have also managed to do it without my hands more now. lol, I have off minutes.

			Yey. Thnx guys. I think I might actually have an off day today. I have moved it a couple times but only after a minute to two or starring. I'm gonna meditate on the wheel and become one with it, and gather energy into my third eye. Hopefully it should last the whole day like yesterday. 
<br />

<br />
I aslo told one of my friends on msn last night. phew, he thinks it's cool and wants to talk about it on mon so we can learn together. I'm glad I told him, instead of someone really skeptical who is more likely to spit it back at me!
