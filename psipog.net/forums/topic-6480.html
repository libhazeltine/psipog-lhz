			before i start would anyone like to point out anywhere in the science of the human body that the actual phenomenon of psionics could occour? no? okay then.
<br />

<br />
firstly psionics is just a short name for what is actually going on, its more of a nickname. but what psionics really is, is a deeper, more implemented ability, that my best guess at this time would be to revolved around the external manipulation of energy around the body.
<br />

<br />
Ever felt eyes piercing into the back of your neck? well, if you have, no that is not any kind of psionics. its your body feeling the changes of air pressure between you and the other person. how is this pressure created? well, its simply the lack of what i would like to call &quot;the pressure of light&quot;. because everything is made up of atoms and all that, light is a form of visible heat. when this light reaches the other persons eyes, they enter the eyes through to the brain through the pupils. and the pupils are actually a filter for light which lets us enhance our vision. if any of this light is reflected, they return outwards through the pupils towards the person. because this light has been filtered we feel a strange change in air pressure around the area in which they are looking. thus you can &quot;feel&quot; if a person is looking at you. of course these changes are minute and requires a bit of concentration which can usually come in silence or quiet places.
<br />

<br />
how does this have anything to do with psionics? well, psionics is basically the same thing. manipulation of air pressure around the body.
<br />
how does this happen? well with the current facts of the human body, it is powered by a form of electricity.. in other words, energy. how does this react with the outside world? we have our brain send a message to an un-coordinated area, which is infact outside of our body. when the energy reaches as far as it can go, it is released from the body therefore creating a new form of light moving through the air. and because light is heat, and pressure, we can use the pressure part to manipulate physical object. how? by creating a strong enough force to achieve our goal.
<br />

<br />
You might be saying: yes, this accomplishes pushing. what about pulling? Well thats answered quite the same, because light is a form of pressure, it can be used to evacuate an area in the air, therefore creating a vaccuum, or if you want, a gravitational force. how? by creating darkness (opposite to light), which is negative air pressure, and negative heat.
<br />
why else is it cold at night -- because there is no light. darkness = lack of light. we are creating a lack of light.
<br />
this force would take more energy to create.
<br />

<br />
Fire? An abundance of heat that is genetically combined with the body's energy (electricity)
<br />
By genetically i do not mean putting them together, i mean combining their chemical properties, which creates plasma. and plasma is fire.
<br />

<br />
What about solid objects such as constructs? well, we set our brains into a motion cycle, which continually creates this &quot;solid&quot; object by sending energy/pressure to it.
<br />

<br />
this is why it is easier to create heat over cold.
<br />

<br />
What about using an external force for power (sun,moon ect?) simply a motive to create that kind of energy, using your default chakras. 
<br />

<br />
Anything i have not explained in this topic?

Yes. You forgot to mention an experiment you devised to prove/disprove your theories, which is what will make your idea a scientific theory.

so im just basically asking for: is psionics a direct thing that was specifically designed in the body?

			To be perfectly truthful, science hasn't the slightest idea of where to start in Psi research. Some people have come out with ideas that fit with current physics (*raises hand*), but none of these have been tested yet, and those that have have only been tested in very limited ways.
<br />

<br />
So really, at this point, it's anyone's guess.

			I think they will never progress unless they work on the hypothesis of the conscience being independent of the body. I think the multiverse related theories might provide some light into that. After that they can work on what the not-physical aspect of us work and there they might find some answers. At least on how interaction occurs, not where everything really starts. This might look a bit too &quot;spiritual&quot;, but you can't simple try to understand psi and forget all that some people know throw spiritual beings, being that medium ship, OBE's or whatever. But that only points to the right direction, to scientific answers they need to go from ground up, so be it.

			You didn't explain telepathy, empathy, OBEs, healing, biokinesis, or complex construct making. Sounds like your theory is just a convoluted hypothesis about psychokinesis. You've done no experiments to prove this at all, your information is completely wrong, and the theory is to convoluted even if it was right. Light is not a form of visible heat and does not cause differences in pressure. When someone sees something they don't &quot;take-up&quot; a large amount of photons. Light is basically just velocity without an object. Photons are very very weak and cannot move things. Furthermore the body's heat is not the same light you described before and cannot push things. Furthermore , you used the term genetics incorrectly. Furthermore, the electricity in the body is a lot more complicated and much more weak then your outlet. It deals with changes in the membrane of neurons caused by ionic neurotransmitters.

Well said. Even via the laws of physics (Compton's proof of the mass <span style="font-style: italic">equivalent</span> of light, conservation of energy), it can still be said that light doesn't always deliver heat.
<br />

<br />
And, even <span style="font-weight: bold">IF</span> PK was caused by manipulation of air pressure, it would still be PK as is currently accepted. It would just be manipulation of the air around the object, rather than the object itself. 
<br />

<br />
If my current collection of hypotheses come up negative, I'll test this one.

.....the human brain would be one. The process of human cells able to repair its own DNA is a another (expect when several things break all at once causeing canser <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> ). How the human heart starts at birth is a phenomenon. Of cource there are theoires behind all of these none of them really hit them directly.....just like psionics.

So you ask a question that no one can answer so you can criticize back?

Minor nitpick: the human heart actually starts BEFORE birth, at around 21 days past conception.
