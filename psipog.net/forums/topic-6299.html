			I joined up on the forums a few months ago, and I never really got active.  I enjoy lurking though.
<br />

<br />
I was wondering if anyone would be willing to scan me?

			Okay, I sense that your name is Jason, but I was probably influenced by your username. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

You have blue eyes, light hair but not blond, more like light brownish. I didn't know what else to scan for, maybe you should be specific.

			You have sideburns, the place you live in has lots of wood and stone and your room is pretty small compared to the rest.

			-You are asleep or in a sleep-like state as of the moment of this posting. I sense calm, and that you are not dreaming at the present moment.
<br />

<br />
-You are not shielded, at least not in a way that my scan would detect.
<br />

<br />
-You do, however, have some sort of internal block. You are (subconsciously) repressing some memory or feeling. Because of the block, whatever you are repressing is not bothering you at the present moment. Whatever you are repressing has significant emotional impact on you.
<br />

<br />
-Nothing much else going on. I'm guessing that you have just gone to sleep because it seems your subconscious is cataloging and reviewing the past day. I got some random images; the clearest one was of a computer screen with a forum index sort of page on it (not PsiPog); something with a dark box (perhaps you received a box in the mail today?); and something else very indistinct that I have quite frankly forgotten by now.
<br />

<br />
As a previous poster said, it would be useful if you had given more instructions on what you wanted us to do.
