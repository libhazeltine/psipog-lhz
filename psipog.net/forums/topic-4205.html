			Your body thinks it's, let's say, standing up. When all of a sudden you can feel your physical body, your mind freaks out and jolts you. It's perfectly normal, and compare it to, let's say Vertigo.

			I think I agree with Redifin. Your body thinks it's standing up. When this happens to me I'm usaually walking and I'll like step off a curb or miss a step or something then when I try to catch myself in my dream my body will wake up trying to do the same.

			I get those, usually while I'm in the middle of hypnogognic imagry. I react to it, and since I'm not in sleep paralysis yet, so does my body. Might not be what is happening to you, but it is the closest thing I've experienced to that. Besides simple muscle spasms of course.

			Yeah it happens to me all the time. I have a dream and then I trip and then I just kick or something and wake up. I'm like &quot;AH&quot; *kick*, I'm worried if I kick something. Hey has anybody had a dream where you act out what you dream. I once had a dream where I was pointing at my mom and saying &quot;no don't do that&quot; and then I woke up in bed with my arm pointing in the air and my head turning in that direction and then my arm fell. My arm almost fell on my brother but I moved it away in time.

			Actually that acting out thing is not supposed to be physically possible during a dream since your motor neurons are shut off. During a dream your muscle tone is supposed to be relaxed. You CANNOT act out a dream. Otherwise everybody would be running around during the night. That is an accepted rule however I have had the strange experience of it happening and I'm asking if anybody else has.

You aren't conscious when sleepwalking however. I used to sleepwalk a lot, and I never remembered any of it. This is something else, I think.

It does happen to me too. The odd thing is that I wouldn't have started dreaming yet. I would be very relaxed and just lying there thinking of something or the other and I suddenly feel like I missed a step or something and I rise my leg. Then I dont remeber what caused me to do it, since I wasn't thinking about walking at all. Or maybe I forgot that I was thinking about walking...

			For me I'll be falling off a cliff and right before I hit the bottom...WHAM! I jolt awake. It has something to do with the animal part of the brain. I think it's when it's been holding a simple emotion like fear or something else in all day and once your human part of the brain is asleep and the consicous passes down to the instinctive animal part (which is before deep sleep). That's why it usually happens right after or during you loose consiousness (I cant spell that word). That's is mostly accurate of what my dad said (He studies the brain and stuff).

			I get those while like walking in a dream, or if someone throws something at me, I'll try to catch it and wake up from the movement. Other times, I feel like my bed is tilting up and I'm falling toward my feet so I kick to stay on the bed. It's really wild, once you think about it.

OH, and on the note of sleep walking, my friend would like sleep run into things. Scare the crap out of people in the house.
