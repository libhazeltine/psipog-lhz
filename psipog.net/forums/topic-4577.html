			I have always been a bit of a skepic, and though I have tried my hand at psy a few times, I have never had much success. Or so I thought. The other day, I found a journal from LONG ago when I was attempting lucid dreaming. I was in elementry school at the time, and played that oh-so-evil game known as neopets (it had JUST came out) The dream of interest, well recorded on a page within he book, detailed a neopet that was not within the game. Now, no need to worry, I lost interest in neopets quickly, as did friends, but upon seeing a neopets trading cards ad in my local music/novelty show I saw the same bunny like thing! I checked the journal as soon as I got home, sure enough, The description fit, and I had a name written &quot;cybunny&quot; a quick check at neopets... yeah, it exists! under the same name! 
<br />

<br />
I have experienced deja vu (Pardon my lack of accents) of similarly mundane events such as videogames, class lectures and conversations before, but I assumed it was a memory-illusion as is the scientific consencus to my knowledge. I was most suprised to find a record from my childhood that is trying to show me I am wrong!
<br />

<br />
So, am I an idiot? Missing something? and most importantly to me, is there a way to learn and develope these abilities further? I haven't seen any articles on it. This is really weird for me, since I have never believed in precog. (that explains why I would write so much about a dream on NEOPETS... now my E-manhood has been reduced to -1)
