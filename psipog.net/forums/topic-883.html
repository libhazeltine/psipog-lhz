			Ok, look at all your thoughts from a distance, imagine all of them being swooped backwards off the edge of an infinitive cliff. Now look forward into an endless void and focus on that. It always works for me.

			Whenever i practice PK i listen to trance music (whenever i can, if im at school i cant) Perhaps just listening to music will help. Also, an added bunus, trance music helps put you in a trance state. I get mine at di.fm (yes that is &quot;di.fm&quot;, all you need is there) Have fun with your practice.

			I think that music has great effects on psi.  I'm a music major, and I've noticed that when (in classical music mostly) there is a tension build,  the body and psi will kind of tense up with it.  When the music resolves, so does the tension in your body and psi.  This leaves you feeling at peace and reall, really relaxed.  If you'd like to give it a try...get your hands on Chaccon by Holst. This peice of music has the longest tension build ever written.  It was the first peice that 'moved' me in that powerfull way.   
<br />

<br />
Oh and you have to give yourself up to the music. Don't fight what your mind, body and psi might want to do.  It works for me and hopefully you can use it to help you.

			i also have that problem. usually because im listening to my iTunes when i do TK. if its a track that i like, i seem to focus more on the music, if its something i dont, i usually focus more on the psi-wheel. 
<br />

<br />
heres an easy method to clear your mind.
<br />
lets say me for example, im can hear &quot;x-bass&quot; by &quot;IK&quot; in my head, and i love that tune, so i go and listen to it like twice, and then it goes out of myhead, whehey!

			Well, like mentioned if you can get ahold of some of some music, perferably wordless ones it helps tremendously, for me atleast. As of right now im in a very rusted state with my psionic abilities given it's been about almost 2 months of no practice what-so-ever. Without music I could still spin the PsiWheel, but it was slow and weak, no full revolutions, and my &quot;follow the finger&quot; excercize gave results yes, but slower then normal.
<br />

<br />
So right now I play the ,<span style="text-decoration: underline">Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back</span> complete orchastra and clear my mind, I have generally no problems at all to just empty my mind of thoughts and then im getting results as I did back in my normal practice routines, if not faster response.
<br />

<br />
Music itself can help you clear your mind for if you just listen to it then your focusing on it and not so much thinking. If worst to worst meditations does wonders to help, though I never really did that, others say it helps. I suppose my innate ability to easily blank my mind comes from a long line of practicing drawing. I tend to draw with minimal thought, just the picture in my mind and working to get it on page.

			Hello...
<br />
I'm new to the forums and I'd like to introduce myself...
<br />
To the point, I've found it fairly helpful to use music.  Though I've not had much success with psychokinesis, I've found that it's far easier to accomplish my goals with a strongly stimulating tool such as music.  Wordless music works well for me, as does music of opera-type or in a foreign language that I don't know.  I've also found bands in which the vocalist or vocalists are death growlers to be great... an example of these that I really enjoy is Destr?yer 666.  On top of having thick Australian accents, they're mostly instrumental and their only vocals are growling.  Many of their recorded tracks are live, which makes the singing even more difficult to understand (which is nice if your concentration tends to wander and you end up focusing on the lyrics of songs).  You could also check out Lacuna Coil; one of their vocalists is a woman with an amazing voice and the other is  a fairly talented (as talented as they'll get) death growler...  I reccommend both bands, as I've used them to get into an altered state of consciousness while meditating.  Techno remixes of Rob Zombie songs work great for me as well, as they're fairly poetic and the lyrics don't make direct sense (take a gander at the lyrics of Dragula; listen to the techno remix of it), plus they sound freakin' cool <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.  Six Day War - DJ Shadow is one of my favorite singles...  If I'm in my computer chair listening to music while meditating, I prefer to use Windows Media Player and use the visual 'scope', under the 'bars and waves' section.  In full screen with full screen controls off it's extremely relaxing to let my eyes lose focus, watching the jagged yellow line flex to the music.
<br />

<br />
There's also a link to a track somewhere on the psychokinesis forum that's great to meditate to while simultaneously listening to music...
