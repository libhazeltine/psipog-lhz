Alright, I'm unlikely to respond to any more of your posts because it's not going to be constructive and will just end up with getting a topic locked. Just a thought though, I'd work on your grammer if you want to sound knowledgeable even if you're trying to be obscure.

			he talks like a philosofist, i do understand but i need to reread is posts more then twice,yet some of them i find hard to understand
<br />

<br />
anyways back on topic:in cases of &quot;most intelligent&quot;animals we have dogs, different spiecis of primates,dolphins they are among teh smartest animals but,im sure there's more cats are generally quite inteligent
<br />

<br />
iguanas too,mine learned how to open the terrarium just by seeing me do it,i belive its true they learn things better through body language then words or explenations
<br />

<br />
i used to have a dog and a cat, my dog learned how to open doors because he saw my cat doin it and my present dog cant open doors very well,she undertands the meaning of pointing...when i show her my empty hands,she understand tehyr empty and starts searching for whatever i hid from her

			The way I see it, if you're smart, type smart if you want. an_St may be smart for all we know, but he's not got the grammar skills to type in that way.
<br />

<br />
Tailor your speech patterns to your own linguistic skill and preference. More importantly, linguistic skill.

I've pulled out 2 references from a quick internet search. I picked on birds as a topic since a lot of people tend to believe the &quot;bird brain&quot; stereotype. Not all animals are &quot;stupid&quot; even when trying to use human type intelligence as a reference:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s487635.htm" target="_blank">http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s487635.htm</a>
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic"> &quot;Twenty five years of research has shown that grey parrots have the cognitative intelligence equal to a 6.5 year old child and communication skills equal to a 2+ year old child </span>
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~asifg/braindiversity/Emery%20-%20Cognitive%20Ornithology.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.princeton.edu/~asifg/braindiversity/Emery%20-%20Cognitive%20Ornithology.pdf</a>
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">...corvids and parrots, which have forebrains relatively the same size as apes, live in complex social groups and have a long developmental period before becoming independent, have demonstrated ape-like
<br />
intelligence.....&quot;
<br />
&quot;This is discussed with respects torecent investigations of two supposedly unique aspects of human cognition; episodic memory and theory of mind. In reviewing the evidence for avian intelligence, corvids and parrots appear to be cognitively superior to other birds and in many cases even apes. This suggests that complex cognition has evolved in species with very different brains through a process of convergent evolution rather than shared ancestry...&quot;</span>

			wow thats amazing...i wonder if the dromeaosaurids or velociraptors were that inteligent since they're also birds,there have been so many stuff about the raptor intelligence and what they were capable of. Jurassic park played alot with they'r inteligence making them talk with each other,setting traps,being so organised,'SMILING'like the raptor did in the first jurassic park...and problem solving inteligence
<br />

i wonder if they were actually that intelligent after all

			Im not much of a freudian but &quot;Some&quot; of what he says may well be right.
<br />

<br />
In basic terms ( for those who dont know) our sub-concious (Or Unconcious) consists of 3 parts. ( Bare in mind this is simplified a fair bit )
<br />

<br />
The Id
<br />
The Ego
<br />
The Super Ego
<br />

<br />
The Id is the most basic area, I want this, I need that and it has to be now! (Animals certainly have this too) (sometimes called the 'Child' part of sub concious)
<br />

<br />
The Ego is a more rational part, it works with the Id and the Super Ego in order to please the Id whilst keeping long term consequence in mind. ( The 'Adult' part of the sub concious)
<br />

<br />
The Super Ego is a largley Moral part. (it has 2 subsystems but they arent really relevant to the point) The super-ego always wants to perfect, even if its impossible to do so.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The point here is, assuming Freud is correct, animals may well have an Id, A pack of wolves, for example, will not steal food from each other. The Id would not care about breaking the pack but the Super-Ego most certainly would. The Id and Super-Ego cannot exist without the ego to balance them out.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, perhaps a little far-fetched but, if true, then animals would almost certainly be able exhibit telepathic behaviour to some degree.
<br />

<br />
Just a theory based on a theory anyway. (hides from potential flaming)

			Taking a slower approach this time I feel what Valentine said about an Id and super ego unable to exist apart from the ego not accurate. Correct me if I?m wrong but that?s enlightenment. 
<br />
Anyways rolling with the idea that animals have an Id would it be safe to assume telepathic suggestions work on non-humans?

			i think it would work.
<br />
i dontb know i dont trust the concept that only humans have inteligent
<br />

<br />
how come dinosaurs survived for miillions of years without technoligy and such and we humans to live a mere 100.000 years need all this stuff
<br />

<br />
anyways,animals might have ID, i few days i  went to a place where they kept horses and they had a horse tide to a holder, and i felt like the horse was mad because he was stuck, he tryed to realease himslef but he couldnt, so i was probebly mad at his keeper for tiding him into teh wall 
<br />

<br />
yesterday i was retourning home i saw a bunch of birds on the ground chirping at each other i could feel they were arguing for some reason 
<br />

<br />
perhaps animals too have a consciousness,rationality and inteligent but its sort of &quot;design&quot; for they'r needs we werent the first animals on earth to that learend how to construct, how to choose concepts, and  use tools
<br />

<br />
ants builded theyr own hives even before humans beggin to walk straight.
<br />

<br />
birds learned how to use tools teh same way primates use them now-a-days

Anyways your string of sentences reminds me of an idea from The Seat of the Soul (a good read) about non-humans having one consciousness. To add sense to that I mean that specific animals all share one.  i.e. all dogs share the single dog consciousness.  Not saying its true though...any thoughts?
