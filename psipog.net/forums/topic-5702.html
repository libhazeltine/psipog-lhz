			Hello everyone, 
<br />

<br />
I've started practicing PK for about 2 months. Initially, micro-PK and I'm reasonably good at doing the roulette wheel (making about 100$ a day) and influencing die rolls (for my RPG sessions).
<br />

<br />
I've also recently started practicing the psi-wheel with some minor results.
<br />

<br />
But this has made me thinking. This stuff is great but none of it is really useful beyond the point of proving the reality of Psionics to people. I was thinking there must be a way to make this *really* useful for humanity. I've been reading books and articles on the Internet and many say that you can basically manifest anything you like and that the power of the mind is unlimited.
<br />

<br />
So I was thinking. What if we used our powers of PK and manifestation to stop or prevent the wars (e.g. the Iraq war) going on today? We could do this by simply jamming the guns and turning the bombs into duds. If a lot of people did this, I think this could actually have an effect and we could save a lot of lives.
<br />

<br />
Would anybody be interested in joining me with this?

			Not likly. Most people can't even slide objects around much less disarm bombs and jam guns with Pk. It's silly. Plus, War is good. removes the weak. Removes the non-needed population. We over crowd the world.

Anywho I dont think anyone is that good at it to disarm a bomb. Maybe 30 years and the future a few might be able to do some major major pk. But I doubt that anyone can do it now

			haha I definetly agree with monkey that no, wars are not good..I don't see how it gets rid of the weak in any way (that was a senseless statement) and do you realize how much pressure and force is involved in shooting a gun. No matter how good we get in psionics I doubt anyone would ever be able to jam/stop a bullet (unless your name is Neo lol)...If you were truley a master of psionics it would probably be easier to let bullets phase right through you  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ...but i guess that wouldn't stop a war lol...same goes for bombs..You would have to understand how they work in order to disarm them..not just think &quot;this ones gonna be a dud lol&quot;.....At least I would assume so...Lastly the sheer mass of bombs and guns would make it impossible.

Please try to use proper spelling and grammar in your posts.  Taking away free thought will not stop wars.  In fact, I think that would only add detriment to the situation.  The inability to change viewpoints, to resist the urge to see something how another person sees it, would undermine any and all peace efforts.
<br />

<br />
Motivations for peace originate in the hearts and minds of the pepole, which should then be perceived by the government and it's lawmakers.  The military is simply a tool of the government to enforce an international agenda or protect itself from a malevolent, outside force.
<br />

<br />
If you want to stop war, sway personal opinion.  Vote for more agreeable politicians.  PK and telepathy are unnecessary, inefficient, and ludicrous methods to employ if you have this goal in mind.

War is a neccesity, even if by some miracle someone magically &quot;jammed guns&quot; and &quot;made bombs into duds&quot; there would be adaptation.

I have to disagree.  You say that war is a necessity.  Ask what war is, and you'll find that at it's base level war is the violent enactment of a disagreement on a large scale.  Therefore, war is only the manifestation of a conflict.  There are other ways to hold and settle conflicts then to kill each other.  If you think this is an impossibility, then I guess you don't put much stock in humanity.
<br />

<br />
Sure, war helps the economy and I guess it has a small effect on over-population, but again, those are two goals that can be achieved by other means.
<br />

<br />
I'm not a hippy, but even I can see that conflicts can be solved through non-violent means, however unpopular that seems to be nowadays.  To say that we are victims of our own psychological tendencies as developed over time (aggressive and warlike behaviors) is tantamount to omitting the fact that as sentient beings we have the potential to overcome them.

Because some of us hold ideals very dear to our hearts and will work for them no matter what the perceived or actual odds are.  If you give up just because something seems hopeless, then you're just a meat sack.
<br />

<br />
When it comes to your future, my future, and the future of the generations that will come after us, I think that a possible utopia is a good goal to work toward even if it's unattainable.  You want to be unstoppable at pk or another psionic ability?  Many people say that's impossible.  Does that mean you quit practicing?  I don't think so.
<br />

<br />
Strap on your testicles.  Show you give a damn when it comes to humanity.

			war is just an aggressive way of negotiating with another.. and if war is not good how come people keep doing it in the 1st place? as they say there are other ways of solving a certain difference of opinion or whatever disagreement has come upon their shallow minds... 
<br />

<br />
oh, and for me, war is just the manifestation of human's inner desire to kill and destroy.. or maybe they just want to prove who's tougher..
