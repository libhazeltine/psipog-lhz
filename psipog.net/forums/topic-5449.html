			helloForum,
<br />

<br />
I am new to the forum but I already feel comfortable after reading the introductory tutorials, I really liked the author's writing style that was really relaxed and down to earth!
<br />

<br />
I am 38 years old and now  is my time to develop.
<br />
When I was a teenager I became aware that I was different.  I cannot explain why here but Icontinued to explore my gifts without a teacher.
<br />
Although I started with a Ouija board it became clear that this was not the most effective way of learning.  I began to experiment by joining spiritual churches, I tried healing for a short time and I also tried meditation within a private coached environment which brought lots of success.
<br />
Unfortunately at this time I joined the military and I had to break off the meditation with the private group.  I was saddened, but I knew that there would be a time for me.
<br />
The timespan from leaving the private group to now is about 10 years, in this  timespan I became ill (depression) which I have now overcome.
<br />
In recent times I have had close contact with the Reiki master, but all contact is not yet strong enough so that she can teach me.
<br />
Therefore I decided to research myself on how I could best develop what gifts I have.  The main problem is where does one start first, I have decided that the best method is to continue meditating.
<br />
While I was ill it became apparent that I had the ability to sink deeply into the meditation in a relatively short time. (Therapie)
<br />
Now that I have introduced myself I hope that somebody will be able to pick up on where I should be going!
<br />

<br />
I just hope that I have landed in the right place.
<br />

<br />
with Best regards Smee

			Hi Folks..
<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply
<br />

<br />
My teachers from the private meditation group said to me when I was 23 that I would be able to get back into development when the time is right...
<br />

<br />

<br />
Waited <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />  Waited <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> Waited <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />  Waited, and now I know that I have gathered enough Life experience to carry on Lerning.. and the longing to lern is there..
<br />

<br />

<br />
I think its great that we have a lot of young members (I do not know how many)  <img src="images/smiles/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" border="0" />  But I think when helping people with skills and knowledge, It is sometimes better when someone is a little bit older.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I hope that I find my feet here...
<br />

<br />

			Sorry, I don't believe in fate.
<br />

<br />
I don't like to think that my path is predetermined, that whatever I do means absolutely nothing because I'll end up say...dead, working in a dead-end job or a millionaire, with no input from this. ~Points at my brain~
<br />

<br />
I don't like the idea that I have no control over my life. That some big bastard in the sky with a huge beard is influencing my every action, gently nudging me all the way to the coffin.
<br />

<br />
I don't have a destiny. I decide my own future.
<br />

<br />
Besides, we should avoid anything remotely religious. 
<br />

<br />
You don't want your first thread locked by one of the moderators now, do you?
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I hope you learn much from your experience here. Have fun.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			The great thing about democracy is that we can choose and discuss what we think..
<br />

<br />
I feel really sorry for the communist countries like China who have their opinions and information supressed and manipulated.
<br />

<br />
The only thing you can be sure about is that you was concieved and born and that your body will give up functioning, at a point in time.
<br />

<br />
When this happens ???  Does the big man decide or is it just a coincidence???
<br />
Who knows 4 sure I don`t.
<br />

<br />
Destiny.. It would be nice to manipulate destiny to help others.. e.g. the poor.. if I could win the lottery.. but that would be open to abuse wouldent it??
<br />

<br />
I believe that everyboda has a guardian. The guardian is there when one wants to listen..
<br />

<br />
I just listened to mine and he said that you were a good joker because my post was too interesting to be locked..
<br />

<br />
Have fun
