			I can clearly see your skepticism, but there isnt a need for it. You must understand, much of my immeadiate friends and family do these things (Psychokinesis in general). Wouldn't it be possible that since I enter they're mind frequently enough, see theyre thoughts, memories that I could sub-consciously be taught these abilities even I swear I'm learning too fast, therefore my subconsciousness plays around and tries the new &quot;toys&quot; out it found out about somewhere. The reason I tell you all the things that I can do is not for attention, In each thing Ive said its related to a question I have asked about it previously.

			Alright Chiro, you seem like a really cool guy and I can honestly say I believe you.
<br />

<br />
I've got a cool idea though.  Grab an Ipod or CD player and start listening to it.  Try making the Ipod or CD player disapear.  That would be awesome if you could get the Ipod and head phones to disapear but still hear the music.  You could listen to it in classes and stuff  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

I'm not skeptic about you. I was in a hurry in the last post I did and forgot to type that I really do believe you, it's a feeling I have. But the way you wrote it can give skeptic ideas in some minds.

hmm, interesting question. &quot;I think&quot; no, because what does being around different people have to do with your pk abilities? But maybe I can be wrong.

Dude, that would be damn wicked! Try that!!!
<br />
But I have question, are you sure you are teleporting the object and not just making it invisible? And what category would this be in? PK, TP, bla bla bla....

			Alright, I guess maybe I also took that a little too hard as well, its cool now but yeah.. I have a theroy, when teleporting an object maybe it becomes one with your Psi, therefore it moves the same way as a Psi ball would only its of simpler consturction, An Idea to try you guys is imaging the object surrounded by your psi, then mutualy bonding with it, then move it the same way you would a psi ball. Again just a theroy so dont shoot me over it if its false.. I posted this because I think thats how I do it.
<br />
Now.. if anyone had a clue as to why I cant control my TK.. because I seriously am clueless, but in case you've forgotten When I try TK I vanish the object (teleport) but it does budge occasionally so..... I'm confuzzled quite the bit. XD
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Thanks JoeD12, for taking my word on this. Also yes that'd be VERY awsome should I be able to hide my Mini-Disc player, but I listen to it anyway XD Headphones in the ear head to the desk, hood over my head I have to ask this though? Can anyone else see emotions from text in Auric form?

			Somethin else that I need to say is that I can barley do the basics, Telepathy Telekinesis and Psi manipulation are very hard for me, you guys seem to be able to pull these of at a moments notice. I started at the dubbed &quot;advanced&quot; portion of the chain and have to work my way down, which is still just as hard as climbing up
