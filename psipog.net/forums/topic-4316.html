			I came up with an idea, dont flame me if it sounds dumb, but what if u could make a construct that creates little people, castles, buildings, and program the people to be like normal people, except small in size. You would eventually create a town, or a city and they can worship u and stuff, that would be pretty cool wouldn't it? But i am not sure if it'll work..lol

			MaxuS has a point. It would take immence amounts of energy and time to create all that, it's far easier to make a pet to let you know when you are dreaming to get instant lucidity.

			Not such a bad idea. Actually, something that sounds interesting/fun to do.

All though I don't know what REAL purpose it would serve, it would be an interesting test of programing and minute detail creation in your Psi skills.

IT's good to have fun.

			that is if someone is able to flare a hologram like image of a mini-life-size-proportional-human-like-being. I find this far fetched and its best to use your immagination or buy SIMS

not everything has to be very serious and have a point... you can do something for absolutly no reason

Great quote, all be it a wrong one.

You can create a psi-simulation without having to create Artificial Intelligence in the said constructs. And all you need is a visualization to create the necessary shapes.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, what's the point in doing something if you can't take a long time?

			Why not create a Psi factory, in which you program the shape of the little people, and it will draw energy from the earth, shaping it to the people, and you could also program default functions to them, that will have each and evry one of them. I thought of this idea to, but programing movement ad interraction would be far more complicated. I thought of a space battle, fighters flying arround and shouting the enemy, etc.

But wouldnt lucid dreaming be easier anyway?

Because then you can see, feel and maybe even smell the said constructs.

			I think it's a cool idea. I have also thought of it before but I agree, it would take a long time to complete. However, the reward of it would be really great. I would love to see that I have made a small city with people and possible flying spaceship battles. It would give me a good sense of achievement.

I do admit that it would be really really cool to be God of a little city or something, but i still stick with my earlier argument.

			Lucid dreaming wouldn't be so good, becouse in some point you control the action of battles for example, nothing is left for chances, and to remain in lucidity for a long time, with all of the exitament of battles, adrenaln in your veins would be cuite hard. Sorry for the grammar, I am hurrying to create my fleet of destroiers.

			Ahem.

<br />
In a lucid dream, I: Ran on a minefield, sneaked up on guards and strangled them, fought against 3 samurais with a crappy walmart katana, got shot 4 times, killed a person and watched him suffer on the end of my sword until he took his final breath and finally commited suicide.
<br />

<br />
Then i decided to wake up because I ran out of ideas.
<br />

<br />
Now don't you dare come talk to me about adrenaline sonny.
