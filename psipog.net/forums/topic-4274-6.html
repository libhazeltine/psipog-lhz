			well, you can wish that somebody would wishfor everyone would stop corrupting wishes. But it would be utterly pointless, because that wish would be corrupted, and you would end up only encouraging it. Sucks for you.

You slack off during the summer and manage to pull off a 100% on your final only because you slept with your physics teacher. because your the only person who ever has gotten 100% on that test your transfered to a incredibly hard collage and end up being the single most hated person there.

			wish granted, but you forgot to put up an invisible psycho field.  you mack on one of these normal looking girls, and the next thing you know you have been castrated, your dog is now pink, your car has been turned into a make-up vanity, all of your clothes have been burned, as well as your money, your family has been killed, all of your (girl) friends and previous booty calls have been viciously murdered (psycho girl is very jealous), you have a leash fused into your spinal cord, your new name is &quot;hubby&quot;, you are chained to a giant pink heart bed full of stuffed animals and &quot;i love you&quot; notes, you can't go to work or anywhere on account that both of your knees have been broken, your t.v. has been painted over with black paint (so you can't watch the girls on t.v.), you are fed food through an IV (psycho girl doesn't want you to lift a muscle, she wants to pamper you), you have a shock collar and any time you say something psycho girl doesn't like, you get 1,000 volts of electricity coursing through your body.  now don't you wish you would have accepted the fat chicks???  (or at least made an invisible psycho field???)

You lead a very happy life with Victoria, but always wondering what her secret was.<span style="font-style: italic"> 'Is she gay?' </span> you would often wonder, but turn down the thought. One day over dinner  you ask her 'What's your secret?'. She tells you 'After dinner honey.'
