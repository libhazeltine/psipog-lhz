When I even mention the word psi my mom looks at me like I've just summoned the devil, and my dad laughs briefly and keeps watching tv <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

Oh well I guess I'll be moving out in about 2 years or so, so... who cares?

the disadvantage of the internet: you can't tell anyones tone of voice.... either way ill stop this as it is irrelevant.
<br />

<br />
i think if you were to tell your parents, break it to them slowly... i.e
<br />
&quot;do you beleive in psychics&quot;
<br />
kinda like baby talk, if yes then proceed, if no then i wuldnt bother to be honest.
<br />

hopefully your parents will support you <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Im never tellin my parents until i can show or prove something. But then again i try to look at this psionic stuff from a whole perspective and yes i can see it as being one of those &quot;phases&quot; like i used to be into lucid dreaming and yes i think i had 1 or 2 lucid dreams but then i kinda stopped doin it. I would only have lucid dreams when i listened to this mp3 called Hemi Sync. But whatever.....I wonder myself if i will still be into this stuff a month from now or it wil be just another phase that ive gone through lol. Ive tried to make a psi ball, but all i see is thin air, yeah i know to see it u gotta flare it, but i dont even feel it there (between my hands). It could be real cauz so many people claim they know how to do this stuff and there are tons of these internet communities, but it could be fake, because the instructions are so very simple concentrating on a point focussing energy into a ball, im sure that if it was that easy then everyone would be doing it and there would be more proof. Lol srry for my ramblings.

			Hmmm, somewhere between 2 and 3.  When I first got interested, I tried telepathy with my best friend - it didn't work.  I remember I was worried what my parents thought (I was 14 at the time) of me just having a book on it in the house.  But the fact that I was interested at all concerned my mum most and my brother to a lesser degree, as we are a Christian family.  I just remember dad trying to keep the peace; I have no idea what he thought.  At the moment I think the longer I can keep it away from my parents and brother the better, especially since I can't really do anything yet.  I appreciate their concern for me, and promise I won't do anything stupid, but if people aren't interested and only intend to be hostile towards me then I would prefer to be left alone.

			I don't really fall under any of the poll options... It's more like this.
<br />

<br />
My friend and I were veiwing a bunch of FAQs and articles. Then my mom came downstairs to use the computer. Then, my friend starts blabbling about telekinesis and telepathy and everything. I <span style="font-style: italic">was</span> planning on waiting for results to tell my parents, but my friend broke the news. My mom doesen't really beleive us. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
She'll forget it easily... Later on, when I got more results, I'll bring back the subject to her and prove to them that it is possible. I'll just mark the &quot;I'll tell them when I get results&quot; option.

			My grandmother is my guardian while i am at school. Being so, she feels she must be in every aspect of my life. I am Wiccan and she is against that. She says it is a cult of Devil Worshippers and that i should believe in God and The Holy Trinity,  And The Holy Spirit. I have tried to tell her the Wicca is a combination of her religion too but she would not hear it. Telekinesis is not a good thing to talk about with her, but , i did , and it was'nt( big suprise!!) Now, she thinks i am mental and that i need therapy, she is soooo unaccepting of my interest and beliefs. I feels as though she is constricting any progress with my PK or Wicaan studies. How can i help her understand more without freaking out and fighting with me for dominance in my life.
<br />

<br />
Also, i voted #2 on the poll, and yes she has had some bad experinces with demons and magic, etc... But i tried to tell her that PK is something that everyone can, some are just better than others, but everyone could do it.
<br />

<br />
Also, becuase of her faith and determination, not saying i want her to do it, but, she could be pretty good at Pk.....
