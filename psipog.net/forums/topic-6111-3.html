			Until he was mentioned in this thread, I was under the impression that Sai Baba was a fraud. I can't remember where I found that out, so I assumed that I was wrong, and gave Derrick the benefit of the doubt. 
<br />

<br />
As there's no conclusive proof other than a book (that could be EXTREMELY biased, or a publicity stunt), no attempts to explain his abilites, and he's pretty much enjoying being worshipped, I'll revert back to my initial conception of him, and say he's a fraud.
<br />

<br />
If he explains how he does this stuff, or gives conclusive evidence (other than a book) regarding his legitimacy, then I might consider taking a closer look at him again.

You guys are fuking losers. Who's spreading the greatness of anyone? A comment about materialization was made so I mentioned accounts about it. Just mentioning anything on this damn site gets everyone jumping down your throat for proof or evidence. Why can't someone just share some information. Matt and Nishurra go get lives and find somthing better to do with your time than chop up my comments you losers. I already stated I wasn't trying to or didn't want to prove anything to you. Believe whatever you want, I don't care, it's already proven there's no explanation about it so stop making stupid comments.
