			In order to use telepathy or empathy you have to create a link between yourself and the object correct? However, what if you first create the link between yourself and the physical object but then that the object gets up and walks away? Will the link still be there or will you have to create it again?

			Hello sasuya,
<br />

<br />
You do not need to create a link in order to successfully practice/attempt telepathy. Although having a link between you and your target might help, it is not required in some aspects when dealing with telepathy. To answer your second question, their really shouldn?t be a problem with your target walking away or moving away from you. Just remember to feed the connection with more energy to keep it up. Reading Annie's article might help as well.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

			Since you're obviously new to this, I suggest that you don't make links to people, since you probably won't be able to kill them off, and you'll be running around with loads of links to everybody, making your waking life pretty crappy. That of course, relies on your actualy being able to create a link.. So you probably don't need to worry about it yet.. Also, I see that you obviously didn't read any articles, because I don't think it says anywhere in them, that you have to make a link to practice telepathy. Or if you did, you have the retention of a slow autistic child. (Not good) My advice, read the articles, and practice.. Any questions you have should be answered on the articles, or if not, search around on the forums.. Don't take up space with a question when if you had just looked a bit, you would have found the answer...

			Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I should have read all of the articles and researched it more thoroughly. I read Gnome's Linking article and Peebrain's empathy article and both mentioned linking. In annie's article she uses a &quot;utility belt&quot; method. She says to aim at the target and fires the connection &quot;rope&quot;. Reading those articles I assumed that I needed a link... I guess I should have read the other posts too before I hastily sent out this one. Again, I apologize.

There's no need to be rude.  This is the second thread where I had to comment on you disrespecting others.  Sasyua's question was worded intelligently, and it was a legitimate question.  On top of that, other people quickly answered it in a helpful manor.  Now, I agree that redundant questions like &quot;how do I make a psi ball?&quot; should be looked at as annoying and stupid, but this one just came from someone looking for some extra clairification.
