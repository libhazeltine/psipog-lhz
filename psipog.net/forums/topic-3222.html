			With everything their should be balance. Often times the extreme of two points are not the answer and it is the combination of two ideas that bring about a synergetic solution. 
<br />

<br />
Let's look at what causes people to doubt these things. When we are children we believe everything and anything. But sooner or later we create constructs of reality. Outside of that reality is stuff of fairy tales such as psionics and magic long believed by you to be simply kid stuff. 
<br />

<br />
Thus because things such as this is outside our self-concept we refuse to believe them and are skeptic. This can help and this can hinder. Being a skeptic helps you from being cheated, but it can also limit your thoughts and potential. If all your life you've had sadness and are skeptical about happyness (for an extreme example that can be replaced other emotions. 
<br />

<br />
Thta is why the best stance towards thing should be 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Be open to anything, but questoin everything.</span>
<br />

<br />
That should be the doctrine of those in the self improvement circuit and those who criticize it.
<br />

<br />
For to often when one realizes these truths they start believing everything, and buying BS products. All though that technique or idea might exist, thta does not mean that theyu're document of it is valid. Being open to anything but questoining everything helps those who know it can be done from being cheated

What one defines as &quot;obvious&quot; is a subjective term. When analyzing geniuses researchers have found that that what they perceive as complex the genius perceive as only obvious. What is &quot;common sense&quot; differentiates from person to person. Their are some common ground do to societies morals that we adapt, and the normality of base intelligence that we all as humans possess for the most part their are some concepts that may seem extremely obvious to us, but not known, understood, or believed by others.
<br />

<br />
That is why even to use the general point seems all but obvious to us it extremely important that we spread these and make such things general knowledge to others. Just like it is simply common sense to me to post something intelligent and thoughtful. To be curteus to others and respect their opinions and not to judge when posting on the forum. But to others it is not thus the big &quot;Be Intelligent&quot; one sees before posting. 
<br />

<br />
It is good that you see it as common sense neveza. Thus you should help in the spreading of these ideas so that it can become a common presupposition in which psipog.com is based. For all those who do know can do is spread it to those who do not know.

Yeah. I have all this stuff figured out, I ask somebody so they can figure it out and when they're like &quot;WTF?&quot; my only thought is &quot;but it's really simple...and obvious.&quot;

			I now crown JustOwnin a philosipher. Damn how do you spell that???

<br />
I do agree with what he says. And the posts he has put foward have been better than some people that have posted hundreds. 
<br />
It's a sad fact that most people don't realize what JustOwnin stated. In a way, it's both obvious and vague.

(edit) Avius was strange.... no offence to the guy.

			Once a great teacher of mine once said &quot;People never learn if someone is always there to tell them the answer&quot;, which is why I don't spread my &quot;commen-sense&quot; , I don't want to be their guardian nor be spammed by useless questions that should've been obvious on these articles on Psipog.
<br />

<br />
I want people to learn by them selves, not being hand feed every day like a mental retarded human.

If they can't remove this ignorance, then they don't deserve the previlage to know.

I don't really give a fuck. I don't mean just throw them in the wilderness without any type of knowledge and hope for the best.. A little knowledge is nice, but you shouldn't tell them every single fucking detail.
