			Thanks for the help! One problem though. I usually loose control when I am in the dream state. Sometimes I do catch myself falling asleep but when I do I snap back into conciousness but I have feeling and everything as if I just layed down. Any ways to elaborate and help?

			Try to focus on looking at your eyelids from inside. The first time I did motionless meditation, I actually started to get the vibes! I kept myself in, since I was just trying to friggin' meditate. it took about 40-45 mins of meditation until I felt the vibes. I've done alot of 3rd eye focusing in the past, and now that it's open, I've easily been able to do many things, like move the psi-wheel, Energy Manip., and now almost an OBE.
<br />

<br />
It felt like I had the spins, you know, when you're wasted? <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> Don't worry, I was sober, so I knew It was OBE vibes. They're ridiculously apparent. Say to yourself in your mind that you <span style="font-weight: bold">will</span> have an OBE a couple of times. I did, even though I didn't want to have an OBE at the moment, and I got the vibes.
<br />

<br />
Heh.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, yeah, stay 100% motionless, and at the beginning, use the progressive relaxation method, and say outload, starting from your head to your feet or vice versa, &quot;goto sleep feet/head whatever&quot; Let that echo in your mind. I heard that someone on these forums or in an article for OBE's I think. Hope this helps.

			I dreamt of having an obe some 2 months ago. Its like my subc. was demonstrating the whole procedure from exit, journey, entry part, everything. This is probably the best guide anybody can have because its so real. At the time dreaming i thought i was actually OBE-ing, until i came back to my body in the dream and then wake up. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> So as seen the pover of ones (my) subc. and dreams i would strongly advise enybody who can get lucid or even partly lucid to try and engage an obe in the dreams. Beside having a great 1st person documentary about obe, you might even engage in a real obe. 
<br />

<br />
Though in real life im still having problems with not letting vibrations develop.. they come but i always &quot;chase&quot; them away by concentrating on them.. So &quot;passive&quot; is the key.

			Yes.... now that I am actually pursuing an OBE, I tend to focus on the goal a little too much. You have to be an observer to everything that happens. I felt the beginning to some small vibes last night, but I think I chased them away.
<br />

<br />
My mind was a little too active I think too. I guess I should just try to motionless meditate again to do it. That seems like the best bet. Yeah, you have to just be an observer to what is happening to you, or say bye bye vibes!
<br />

<br />
If you're scared about leaving your body, or the thought of it, that may hinder you as well. I've just come to terms with this, and will continue to make progress now... It's only a matter of time. I think I'll probably have one in the next couple of weeks.
<br />

<br />
Meditative binaural beats have helped me quiet my mind quite a bit, and lower my brainwave frequency to that receptive state for OBE's. Binaural beat generator: <a href="http://www.bwgen.com" target="_blank">www.bwgen.com</a>

			Lately I have been having dreams of doing everything I want to do that has to do with psi. But I can't do most of the stuff in reality <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />

But it's still fun <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
