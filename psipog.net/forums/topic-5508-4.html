			So Peebrain if you make a new site that has to do with OBE's and spirituality, are you going to tell everyone what its called before you shut psipog down? because i would like to join there since the subject is a large part of my life, and im very interested in OBE's.

Perhaps in some sense, but I've learned very unique lessons from PsiPog.  Over the next couple days I will be putting PsiPog behind me (emotionally), and I will be ready to focus on my new direction.  Please do not think that I will simply be create yet &quot;another&quot; New Age site.

			i dont know what to say, so ill just say what im feeling right now. i dont think anybody realises how big of a influence psipog has had and i believe that even archived it will still keep influencing people who seek information on psionics. i dont know why but psipog stood out from all the other sites, maybe it was all the time that was spent coding and making it look profesionall waiting for proof to come (i read the blog), but it wasnt just wasting time, it made a big difference even if only it was noticed on a subconcious level. i still dont know why it stood out but it also had something to do the letter to parents, altough i havent i showed it to them i felt like you understood the position most begining psions are in and how confusing it feels. what im trying to say is i felt a conection to psipog, it was something i could trust, like it wasnt just another website made by a kid trying to feel big. i dont understand exactly what you mean by mechanical world, but i only read that 5 minutes ago and im going to let it sink in the read it again. as much as i want psi pog to live on, transfering it to somebody else will change it to something else, so we have to let it die and move on. the only proof i needed was to read the articles and (in the begining) everything would happen naturaly, this has never happend anywhere else. not that i am in the position to ask for anything but i think it would be good if you still kept a log of your experiments and maybe release them on website you deem worthy. as i mentioned in the beggining, nobody here can comprehend how much psipog has influenced, i hope this isnt the end but rather a new beggining.

			This is definately I didn't see coming. Psipog closing. Wow. However, I think peebrains decision to step up and set the bar for higher levels of psionic training is probably going to be a positive experience for most of the online communities. He has been, after all, a very inspirational and influential psion. Still, I've gotten used to psipog over the last four years I've been lurking around. Its going to be weird not having it around as a community.

			ive just rememberd something (getting over the initial shock) my horoscope today said that a new phase in my life is begining, i should start to wrap up the old so i can have a fresh start. there are lots of things in my life that have loose ends in need of wraping, but you cant help but wonder if it also reffers to psipog

			well, peebrain, i respect your judgements and things that you want to do with your site.  Unfortunately, since i am not focused on dreams and spirituality, you will rarely see me again.  I will primarily be based at <a href="http://www.psilinks.co.nr" target="_blank" class="postlink">Psi-Links</a>.  Maybe UPC and PsiOnline too. I wish you luck and it was great to help you out on staff.  After 4 years of psionics, i have thought about quitting.  Your move makes me think even more about quitting.  I will have to think about this more in depth to myself.  I hope we all have the best of fun in the last few months of psipog.

			I have been a member of the forums for about eight months, and a member of Psipog for longer (I think). However, I must say that I find the new turn that Peebs is taking to be far more exciting and fascinating than anything I have found at Psipog.
<br />
Perhaps it is because I learned the basics I needed before I came, but I have always longed for a pool of more advanced information, while still fearing a lack of credibility. 
<br />
I have every intent to follow the surge to the new community, and I offer my skills at writing on any topic where articles are needed if that topic is something I have enough knowledge in.
<br />

<br />
Peebrain, I applaud you and your decisions. Even in such a difficult situation, where you have members trying to get you to change, you still manage to make what appears to be the best decision concerning those involved.
<br />
You have been a truly good leader for Psipog, and I can't imagine you being anything but a truly good leader in your new efforts.

			(PLEASE READ, I like my idea a lot, and maybe it can work.)
<br />
I'm sorry, I really wanted to read everyone's comments, but I ran out of time. If someone has already said what I am about to say, I'm sorry. I read your blog Peebrain...I am not exactly sure if my memory serves me well, but it sounds like you just want to make a new website focusing on OBE's and sprituality etc. But you made this website, you made the rules and those rules were no spirituality and religion. And you can change those rules. If you want to talk about different things and learn about different things, then add those things to the website you already have--Psipog. Why let something die when you are still going to stick with psychic related ideas? I don't know much about the internet, or about websites, but you must just be able to add your new ideas to the already exsisting Psipog. Don't get rid of Psipog...change Psipog. This is the first thing that came into my head when I read what you wrote. I love it here, this is the first place on the internet that I have ever been on where I can talk to people. I know almost everyone here. And I have changed, my beliefs are so different it amazes me. You can have your cake and eat it too...can't you?
