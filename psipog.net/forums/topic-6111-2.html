			Energy can be more of just Kentic energy, if all energy made heat, then gravity and space itself would give off heat. True nothing can reach absolut 0, but things like space are seperate from us, and they don't give off heat. But I guess you can use the mircowave background as some silly evidence to support space having heat...but that wouldnt make much sense.
<br />

<br />
Unless I'm missing something, not all energy gives off heat.

Not really. It states an <span style="font-style: italic">equivalence</span> between energy (E) and mass (m), in direct proportion to the square of the speed of light in a vacuum (c2).
<br />

<br />
&quot; The equation was first derived (in a slightly different formulation) in 1905 by Albert Einstein, in what are known as his <span style="font-weight: bold">Annus Mirabilis </span>(&quot;Wonderful Year&quot;) Papers. In these, he showed that a unified four-dimensional model of space and time (&quot;spacetime&quot;) could accurately describe observable phenomena in a way that was consistent with Galileo's Principle of Relativity, but also accounted for the constant speed of light. His <span style="font-weight: bold">special theory of relativity </span>ultimately showed that the traditional (Euclidean-Galilean) assumption of absolute time and distance was incorrect, and, as a consequence, <span style="font-weight: bold">that mass and energy are different only in form</span>. &quot;
<br />

<br />
That is how everything is energy.

			I was speaking mathematically, anal-man.
<br />

<br />
Mathematically, it means that mass times the speed of light squared equals energy.
<br />

<br />
Of course, when converting from one form to another, you have to factor in efficienty.  Like with burning wood. You still have most of the log left.

			Y'know, if someone somehow figured out how to convert raw Psi energy into matter, and turn matter cleanly and efficiently into Psi energy, we could develop a perfect means of production and waste disposal.

Imagine someone with electro-PK. They turn garbage and other waste into Psi, then pump that Psi into a grid system or capacitors as electricity. Might sound kinda fluffy, but it would be cool, no?

There have actually been recorded accounts of this. A man named Sathya Sai Baba, a sixty-four year old Indian holy man, is said to have these abilities, and many more. Supposedly he can materialize <span style="font-style: italic">specific</span> objects at request. He hands out costly rings, jewels and objects made of gold as gifts to the throngs who visit him daily and who venerate him as a saint. (The gold and everything else has proven to be 100% real. 22k the few times it was tested) He also materializes an endless supply of Indian delacacies and sweets, and out of his hands pours volumes of vibuti (sacred ash). These events have been witnessed by literally thousands of individuals including both scientists and magicians, and noone has ever detected <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> hint of trickery. One scientist has spent over 10 years researching him and wrote a book about him. (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Modern Miracles: An Investigative Report on Psychic Phenomena Associated with Sathya Sai Baba</span>) Some of the food he produces can sometimes be so sizzling hot people cannot even hold it yet. He can make syrup and oils pour from his hands and feet without any trace of the substance on his skin when he's done. Even make rare fruit (That cannot even be found in the part of india he lives) like rice with perfectly carved pics on them, and apples that when peeled, turn out to be an apple on one side, and another fruit on the other. Everytime he walks amoung the crowds that gather, he continually pours <span style="font-style: italic">huge</span> amounts of this sacred ash on outstretched hands, buckets, heads..everywhere. In one walk he produces enough to fill several drums and Dr. Karlis Osis (Director of research, American society for Psychical research), and psychologist Erlendur Haraldsson (University of iceland) saw the ash in the process of materializing. They said it 1st appeared under his palms(turned downward) in the form of granules, that crumbled into ash <span style="font-style: italic">when touched</span>.(Eliminates the possibility of sleight of hand) <span style="font-weight: bold">They say it's not the result of mass hypnosis because everything he does are open-air demonstrations that he freely allows to be [b]filmed</span> and everything shows up on tape. <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> [/b] The production of specific objects, the rarity of some of the objetcs, the hotness of the food, and the sheer volume of materializations seem to rule against deception as a possibility. Not only that, but he's been doing it for 50 years! Since he was 14, and noone has come forward with credible evidance he's faking his abilities. Untarnished reputation for 50 years is pretty good I'd say. It is said he also has the ability that shamans rarely share, to be in two places at once. It's said at the snap of a finger he could dissapear from right in front of your face, to hundreds of metres away in the blink of an eye. There have also been many other accounts of meetings with Hindu ascetics who could materialize similar objects.
<br />

<br />
Moral of the story, materialization may not be as hard as you think  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> . It's also just very cool info. Think I'll make a thread about it.

			I was looking for proof in a more underhanded way. I asked for methods, which I intended to try out ofr myself with an open mind. If they worked, then I'd know he was legit. If they didn't after repeated attemps, then I could comfortably dismiss him as being a VERY good illusionist.

Ofcourse you should be skeptical. I'd expect you to be. I didn't give you proof because I don't care to. I wasn't trying to prove anything to you, I was just telling you about somthing I found interesting. You would most likely find the most &quot;proof&quot; you need, in the book written about him.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

And to SGTPSION I doubt he tells about his methods because they're probably way over the average person's head. Due to his religious beliefs he most likely would not tell anyone either unless they're his disciple/apprentice, or somthing like that. Same kind of idea as being a shaman. Shamans only teach other shamans, who must be tested and initiated. He's not exactly going to sign up for psipog and write an article for everyone.
