			I'm not sure if many of you have heard of Goetia, or other magickal practices but its quite interesting. If you have ever heard of evocations and invocations then thats great. So for people who don't know, here it is:
<br />

<br />
In magick there is a certain practice called Goetia, which deals with the summoning of demons. The cache is, these are not full-blown, 8-foot tall, omfghlyfckingshit demons. You basically summon them and they do work for you and you form a relationship with them. They do things like pop uncounscious information into your head, you don't really see them when you summon them, you scry up random images while in a trance. So in short these things are not concrete, but they work and they get things done. So now everybody wonders what they are, some people say they are real, conscious entities. Others say they are constructs only from your own head. The last one is that they are massive constructs formed from several people believing in one entity. But believe me, a lot of people believe in just one demon. So I'm asking for your opinion on this Won't these constructs be so extremely powerful if so many people believe in this?  It's amazing the things they can get done, teach you liberal science, turn your personality into that of an smart ass, replay music from your head etc. So what do you think?

			Depends on what you believe in. But as I think to myself over this I feel that even if they believe in the demon, part of them would still be agasint it.
<br />

<br />
I guess it matters what kind of power you had. Size really donest matter after all.

			I'm sorry if I'm becoming a bit religious here, but if a lot of people believed in the devil, master of evil and all that, wouldn't he/she/it exist to cloud people's minds and stuff?

			If you believe demons are bad then they will appear all the more so to you. The point is since good and bad exist we constantly try to attain goodness but since its so perfect it hard to get and evilness seems to be lurking around every corner causing us to be paranoid thinking we'll be condemned to an eternity of torment at every little bad sin. If you try to summon a demon and it appears horrible its because of you, not the demon.

Yes, the devil seemed to be more prominent in 16 century times where the Church was very important and extremely real. That's why there were so many more cases of possession back then because the construct was so much more powerful, heaven and and hell were very real, so was the devil. Using the word &quot;devil&quot; was like a curse word, &quot;oh the devil lurks in those waters&quot;, &quot;speak of the devil&quot;, &quot;the devil is in here, in this room&quot; etc. Since the Church allowed itself to condemn so many things etc. God however never manifested himself as a construct, it seemed he was to abstract to have any characteristics or that you can't really say anything truly intelligible about him. He often seemed to contradict himself. Nowadays the devil is not so prominent because Christianity is viewed as being more metaphorical and not as real, the devil and god are becoming like mere symbols.

			If you talk about God and the Devil being real, that's religious talk, we don't talk about religion here, it often leads to trouble.
<br />

<br />
I was just talking about the possibility of a construct which was unintentionally made because people believed in it and feared it, so it could have actually existed.

			hello psiready i have heard of goetia and read the goetia and other such books and learned alot about demons and cm and i am a demonolator so i have learned alot about demons. from what i know demons are not evil they are neutral and had from what i know they were entities that help man and guided us when we ask for thier aid. i have heard that since the demons are nuetral they often take the form of what you expect so if you fear demons that summoning one would be a bad idea.
