			Most adults fear what they don't understand, i don't think any of us really know that much about psi, pk, etc... Sure we know how to control it but some things we still don't understand about it. I was wondering how many of you people are doing this behind your parents back. May sound wierd but i was just curious  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
~~Edit~~
<br />
btw if you where wondering why this is in the PSI balls forum, i picked it because it's technically the beginning. Its where all newbies would start out and that is who i'm basically directing this poll at.

			When I started 2 years ago, I made a psi ball in my first week and, after having those results, I considered telling my mom (since my dad wouldn't buy it). Since I had evidence to back it up I figured she would listen. She seemed like the type of person who would listen and everything so I said &quot;WTH&quot;. Yes...those exact words. I didn't answer the poll question because, when I told her, she thought I was weird and does not really believe in it. She hasn't made me stop but I can tell its because she wants me to have a reason to believe in something since I don't go to church (the rest of my family does). That in and of itself doesn't cause too much tension in my family but I can see her reasoning. Its a tad disheartening.

			I started when I was 15, and told my parents right away.  They thought I was stupid/crazy and going through a phase.  So I stayed quiet for about a year I think.  Then I had to ask for money to host PsiPog.net, so I told them again.  They gave me the money, but ultimately wern't supportive and suggested that I stop spending so much time on it.  Fast forward another two years and I'm a little more open about it.  I start predicting stuff and reading my dad's thoughts.  He gets freaked out, and then starts to accept it.
<br />

<br />
My mom never really thought it was something amazing, but she never really told me it was stupid.  She took the position of, &quot;if it makes you happy, go for it&quot;.  She was never really concerned with what I could DO... she seemed more interested in knowing what I cared about.  She liked hearing about the relationships I've had with people (I think).
<br />

<br />
My dad liked the cold hard evidence... which took a few years to provide, but ultimately was cool to finally have his acceptance.
<br />

<br />
I suggest that everyone tell their parents and get it out in the open.  I know that different people have different situations... but ultimately, if it's something that you really enjoy doing, and you can see yourself doing it for years (or you've been doing it for years already), then it's an important part of YOU.
<br />

<br />
I know some parents aren't supportive, and it does suck to have the people you love looking at you like you're an idiot (I know, I've been there).  Then you notice them look at each other, and you can tell they are having a conversation between themselves about how silly this &quot;phase&quot; is... yadda yadda yadda.  I know.  I've been there <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
Back to the point: if it's an important part of you, then give your parents the opportunity to share that with you.  If they decide not to share it with you, then that's their decision and you have no control over it.  But at least give them a chance - don't just assume they will shut you down.
<br />

<br />
End small rant. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

			Hehe i was actully brought into this by a friend, i at first was skeptic and he was hardcore, but soon he stopped beleiving and just got fed up. I continued to research and wont stop till i get the results i seek. Since im 20 i dont think there is any point in telling my mother, she lives 4000 miles away but i really wouldnt want to give her a reason to get back at me for all the times i laughed at her for beleiving in &quot;the eye&quot; and &quot;god&quot; and stuff like that.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> My girlfriend is kind of psychic herself (Natural). She has visions and OBE's but she doesnt want to get into TK/PK.

			Well, in the country I live, PSI is not well known....and actually, I can say, it has a bad fame. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />
Anyway, as for my parents, I dont plan to say anything to them as I cant provide any actual proof - as in the last two years, I've literally moved to Lucid Dreaming.

			lol bieng the creator of this poll i probably should tell you what i voted.
<br />
#4, yes thats right. My parents don't know yet (so shoot me:P)
<br />

<br />
I do plan to tell them once i get really good results but for the time bieng i think this is better left to myself, of course all this forum dodging does get anoying. My dad always checks my internet history so i have to go through and delete all my psi links out of it. Call me silly, call me whatever but i just don't have the guts to risk missing out on this great oppurtunity to learn.
