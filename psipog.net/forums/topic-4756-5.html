			Hmmm....this 'astral sex' doesn't sound like astral sex to me. If anything, it sounds like a form of telepathy; sending emtions and feelings to others and the orgasm is what results in them receiving the emotions and feelings. I've not 'had sex' like this, but I've sent hugs to people.

Well I'm not proud of it but what I said was true in some sense. Lieing is not part of my philophecy. I only expermented with these luid dreams when I was much younger with them damn homomones messing with my head. The first step of healing is admitting you had a problem.

			Um, hey I don't mean to put you off or anything here, but I think it would take quite a bit of stimulation for that to happen, and from that distance it seems even more unlikely. Also, I'm fairly sure astral sex refers to the unifying of two beings as one, out of their physical form, it's supposed to be a euphoria that physical sex can't hope to match. My opinion is she faked it, or that she felt what her mind wanted her to feel, but that's just what I think. If thats really how it went then more power to you.

I'm not embarassed (maybe a little) but the reason why I wanted to edit it out is because there are children about. So I wouldnt get in trouble if I traumitized any kids.

I'm a guy....I guess you have to be a guy to get it so its why it didnt work on freakinrican626 because I thought she was a he. Mainly because I thought she was a he because of the avatar. &quot;Now&quot; that is something I need to be embarrsed about. 
<br />

<br />
How I fix the darn thing is somethnig I am also not proud of. All I did was simply masterbate.....I don't like masterbation is not because of religionish ideals is most likely most of you are thinking. But instead most of it goes agasint my own philophecy. Not only that repeating the same darn thing (trying not to curse) is unbelieveably annoying to me. But its the only thing that stops me from taking advancage in my luid dreams that comes up with the problem. 
<br />

<br />
I don't know why but I can never get my self to think to my max in my dreams (well I did once but it was only once and it was my first luid dream 7 years ago..and only for a moment) but it tends to come natureal to me to do it.
<br />

<br />
Something that comes natureal to me in my dreams is teleportation which I'm proud of. Most of the times I'm not even adware I'm dreaming but still do it. Sucks that I can't get myself to do it in real life  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
