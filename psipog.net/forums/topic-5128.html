			I had a question to ask everyone, and I wasn't sure where to put it. So i placed it in the msot neutral place.
<br />

<br />
If someone were born into this world. But then instantly isolated and never taught anything. All they would have and know was themselves, but if they never learn a language. How would they construct thoughts in their heads? 
<br />

<br />
Would it be completely visual thoughts or would they create their own methods?
<br />

<br />
I was thinking of this in relation to telepathy and psychokinesis. If they were never given the moral and cognitive barriers that we have, could they use these without any formal tehing of them. Like if you met the speechless young man/woman, would they just use telepathy to communicate because of them not ever using language. Not sure if it makes 100% sense but its fun to think about.

			well, sometime in the beginning of time, no one spoke and yet we still evolved into who we are today.  Therefore they would have to be able to think.

			In the 60's the US did an experement on a baby monkey involving that.  He just didn't move, ever, unless he needed something, like milk.  And then they threw him in with a bunch of other monkeys his age.  When ever one got near him, he'd freak out and try to kill the thing.  So probably a person would be a gibbering mess and violent.

			What you are proposing is actually called &quot;The Forbidden Experiment.&quot; The closest we can do to get answers are study feral children - and it is a fascinating study, one which I am very interested in.

			Other related questions would be: Would someone born without a sense (sight, hearing) still be able to recieve telepathic impressions in that format? Would they still be able to get the message but just convert it into something they can understand or would it not be understood at all?

23% emotional (the way you say things)

70% body language

someone correct me if i'm wrong, but you get the jist of it.

I never use words when I think. They're too faulty.
