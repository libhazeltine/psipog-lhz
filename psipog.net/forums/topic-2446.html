			Salutations all, I was resting today on my bed earlier being still but overall not wanting to redo a psionic feat I tried earlier that gave some instant and bad feedback, i'll keep what I did to myself though.
<br />

<br />
Anyways during this session I got the odd sensations that are explained in the OBE manuals, a tingling body, feeling of being rocked, also hearing whispers, though oddly enough mine was music, given the night before I was listening to my music all day whilst working on some things at my desk. Most of that time I was just relaxing listening to the music since it sounded almost real and no it wasnt my computer for it was off.
<br />

<br />
Well after a while I felt the tingling sort of get denser, then my body rocked a bit more, then all of a sudden it kind of felt like I...well how to explain this, sort of like I did leave my body, I felt like I was much much lighter that I had a small push up and out of the bed area. I was intrigued, so I tried to move up, I felt myself moving up slight, but I couldnt turn to the left or right. After that I began to move down, I felt something odd, an odd sensation pass through my body then I saw whiteness above me, at that time I was guessing it was my bed, that I had went through it. At this point I was solid with the though of &quot;Oh my! An OBE!&quot;. Now the odd thing here was my vision wasnt how people explained, for the most part it was still dark like my eyes were closed, so I tried to open my eyes, well I did open them and right I tried to open them the sensation stopped and my eyes opened and I was looking up from my laying down position on my bed.
<br />

<br />
Now I'm no expert on OBE's so I don't know if this was or not, it had all the prior signs of it, but the one thing I found odd was I sort of knew I was out of body with the sensation I got, this contradicts the sayings of &quot;Its so lucid you wont be able to tell your out of body right off the bat&quot;.
<br />

<br />
What does everyone else think?

			Sounds like obe to me... whenever I try to obe, meditate, or practice any kind of psionics it feels like my minds doing a backflip or something, its hard to explain, but if I concentrate enough with my eyes closed, then it does that its wierd... ive never succeeded in obeing though, I want to so badly...
