another part of the book teaches you how to use this energy, basically, it's making your hand heavy....at least that's how it's explained in it.

Isn't the psyche related to psi? could be a result of psychokinesis.

   There are a million books, websites, stories, etc there go against that. That is not scientific proof. Here are two websites I got from Google. The first one I found and my favorite... Wikipedia. There are plenty of others. Google it.

			Note: the personal well of psi ever made a psi-ball without drawing from an outside source? well then your drawing from it; and for scienctific proof, like JKT said you can look up kirlian photography. I have also seen kirlian pictures of someone draining energy from someone. As for the martial arts that include those techiques, I havn't studied actual martial arts since I was like 10 so I all I know is various asian martial techiques, I could look in a few books I have and search online if you wish for more proof, though I believe it's possible to project your aura out without training in a specifc martial arts. As for hitting harder it's because you strike at their aura or perhaps &quot;soul&quot; might be a more conventional term for you, and it is possible to damage someones aura, and even scar it but I won't get too far into metaphysical theroies as they are hard to prove...

   I already responded to the picture thing. I don't believe in any of that crap... at all. Auras... souls... etc. I don't believe in any of that crap. At all.

<br />
   What do you mean actual martial arts? Aren't Asian martial arts actual martial arts? Do you mean you havn't done martial arts since you were about ten? Explain more please.
<br />

<br />
   Please do. I'd like to see what books and websites you're getting this information from. I don't really care too much about what you believe... I'd like to see a good source of information with this stuff.
<br />

<br />
   Striking at their auras? You mean not hitting them? I think a punch to the face would hurt more than a punch to the aura... you know. No contact versus actual contact. That's just me though.

			No you actually do hit them but you charge your aura to inflict harm when you hit them ever heard of a psiball used for combat? instead what they do is hit someone and charge their hand with damaging energy just like when someone makes a painful, harming, or slaying psiball same kind of energy just around your hand instead of in a ball you throw at someone. my next post shall include links and information about the martial arts that include that...

It helps because you can use your psi to SEE changes or fluxuations in things like the wind or your opponent's aura in situations where you pull a move that causes you to look upside down.
