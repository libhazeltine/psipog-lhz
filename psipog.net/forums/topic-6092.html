			Sorry if this is in the wrong place, move it how you sees it. But there isn't really a &quot;General psionics&quot; subforum o.0 I saw General Discussion was basically just anything so that was out <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Yeah, so yesterday or so we got handed PSAT booklets, and when I got home and read a section, the passages quoted were ... guess what?
<br />

<br />
About psi.
<br />
Also though, about parapsychology, or the study of psychological phenomena. The first passage was about psi, second was parapsychology (we were comparing them XD). 
<br />
So many students reading what I practice. And they are probably not even reading it, skimming it, or just not doing it at all. I just wonder what they all think of it, and if we ever read it out loud in class (and if I sucked less at telepathy) Maybe I'd scan some surface thoughts to see what they think of it. Haha. I'd bet I'd get a lot of &quot;What the hell?&quot;'s.
<br />

<br />
I could quote the entire thing, but I don't feel like it tonight, not up to the 100 lines easy of typing. I guess I'll do it tomorrow, <span style="font-style: italic">maybe</span> tonight. If I have time. Right now I have to do homework XD

			It may be, it's a two sided booklet, where you flip it upside-down and it's right side up for the other half. The part about psi is in the PSAT part, which I can't tell if it's nationwide, though the other half is &quot;National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test&quot;... keyword national <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> And It was &quot;<span style="font-weight: bold">co</span>sponsored by National Merit Scholarship Corporation&quot;
<br />

<br />
Plus, it was actually in the &quot;practice test&quot; inside the guide, which was a seperate pull out booklet that was in the center.

			Is it the actual test or just a pratice Booklet?
<br />

<br />
I have a practice boolet for it, nothing of psi, however, we do live in separate areas, state wise, so that might be it, but it's a universal thing, so I'd figure it'd be the same.
<br />

<br />
Nevermind! I found it on it.
<br />

<br />
Passage 2 of it sounded quite familier on a book I read. I wonder if it's the same author.

			Ahh yeah, practice booklet. So we must have the same practice booklet. I guess if anyone not getting PSATs wants me to type it off I can... but I'm not gonna do it if you guys have it right under your nose <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
