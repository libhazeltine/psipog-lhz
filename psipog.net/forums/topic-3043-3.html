Yes, that was me.  Although I believe you're remembering a post from Veritas because I have never mentioned teaching it to my ex here. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
And no, I haven't changed my mind.  I've limited myself to simply saying &quot;Teleportation is possible&quot;.  Nothing more because it's above the heads of the majority of people in the OEC and all that any description of the methods/philosophies behind the feat really gets me is ridicule.

To Apollo: You're request is as unachieveable as a skeptic asking a telepath to read the thoughts of everyone around them with perfect accuracy because they claim to be able to read others' thoughts.  You make the assumption that &quot;I can do this&quot; means &quot;I am an all-knowing master in this field and can perform this given action at any time&quot; and obviously that assumption is faulty.  So let me pose you a challenge in the same vain: if you can use TK, lift my house off of it's foundation.

You could teleport to a general area instead of a specific location.  You could be limited as to how far you could move.  You could have issues teleporting objects other than yourself, etc.  Anyone with decent mental capacity who put a half-assed effort into actually thinking before typing could come up with that.  Now you're obviously not stupid so you must simply be too lazy to actually think before typing.  So if you aren't even bothering to do the most basic mental work so that you are able to actually contribute something to the thread, why are you posting at all?

			BUt, once your able to teleport distance wouldn't be that big of an issue depending on the method you use.
<br />

<br />
I was thinking and there are really 2 basic methods. 
<br />
1) To take yourself apart peice by piece and assemble yourself at the specific location.
<br />

<br />
2) To force your material body onto the Astral Plane and reappearing back in the material plane. Like sewing yourself through. This method would take more practice, but once mastered then distance would never be an issue.
<br />

<br />
I know both of them sound outrageous but both are very possible.

			Both of them sound dangerous to me! How would you go about doing it to yourself though? I would be afraid to. Plus, if someone is like attacking you and you are under pressure, then you could screw yourself up. If it's anything like pk, then you won't be able to do it like &quot;that&quot; *clicks fingers*. It would take a lifetime. Spinning the psiwheel is like teleporting marbles, rolling a pencil is like teleporting a cat, and levitating a phone is like teleporting yourself. And I don't fancy getting stuck inbetween time and space. <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

			What's wrong with doing it just to see if it can be done. Look at TK. It would be easier to just flick the psiwheel with your finger than to stare at it inorder to turn it. You do it to feel the acomplishment that you moved something with your mind. The same applies. Wouldn't you have the greatest feeling after teleporting a marble 2 or 3 feet <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />. I think it would feel even more awsome than when I moved the psiwheel for the first time.

Sorry Apollo, but your arguement kinda fell apart there - you're saying that PK is possible because it's mental, but teleportation isn't possible because it's physical? How it PK not physical either? Rolling a pencil with PK is just as much a mental AND physical act as is teleportation - except in teleportation you're just moving youself.
