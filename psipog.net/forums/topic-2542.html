			Hi Everyone,
<br />

<br />
I've been practicing for 4 months about. And I've progressed to the stage where I can move the psi wheel, straws, toothpicks, and pen. But I have only been able to pull the object towards my hand or finger rather than be able to push the object like so many of you. All of the videos I've seen are of everyone being able to push the object. 
<br />

<br />
Just wondering if people here are able to do both pushing and pulling of objects or is it just one or the other that people can do? When objects are being pulled towards me its sort of like my hand is a strong magnet or im charged highly with static electricity and so where ever my hand is the objects move or spin towards it. I'd like to be able to do both pushing and pulling at will, but I haven't been successful at pushing any of the objects I practice with.
<br />

<br />
Any feedback?
<br />

<br />
Thanks
<br />
Jayden

			Hey Jayden, I just started and I can't push or pull, it's sort of in between. I don't push the psiwheel, or pull it, it does it randomly. I swear it has a mind of it's own! <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />
I wouldn't worry to be honest. It will come in time, and hey, youv'e gotten further than most people. Moving a pen is like lifting a car to me. <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

			well, sometimes the psiwheel moves randomly for me, but the &quot;push&quot; technique i use is this:  
<br />

<br />
when i attempt to perform psychokinesis, i usually project energy from my solar plexus. this is because from my own research and that of others, i found that pk is performed better when using the solar plexus nerve cluster. while doing this, i create the feeling that i am physically &quot;pushing&quot; the energy out--simmilar to the feeling you get when you exhale forcefully. i aim this &quot;energy-stream&quot; at the psiwheel, usually <span style="font-weight: bold">pushing</span>, or pulling a corner of the wheel. i usually don't visualize much, i just visualize the wheel moving while i am doing this.

I think the cause of the &quot;pulling&quot; is that you reference PK to a Magnet.
<br />
Magnets &quot;Attract stuff&quot; you might just have to switch the poles around.

i only move and spin the psi wheel but here is what i think:

<br />
i think that your all 4 months you used to parctice tk with pulling idea and pulling method so i think you need to practice on pushing .
<br />

psi_manipulator_3000, same here my tk do it like <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> not as i like, but sometimes it is polite and obey me <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.

			Yes i can pull objects. I use the push technique except reverse it. I feel the push on the back of my hand, that gives me the sensation of pulling.

			Hey, great stuff, I think you're right Gonzo, because I reference my hand to be like a strong magnet it makes the objects pull towards me. You guys have given me some great ideas for trying new techniques. Thanks for everyones input. I'll let you all know if any end up working for me.

			The inability to &quot;Pull&quot; or &quot;push&quot; when you can do one of either is really a psychological thing. It plays on how you experience Psychokinesis. For example, if you always push instead of &quot;pull&quot;, it technically will be easier for you to Push. And you may even think you can't pull at all. 
<br />

<br />
You need to come to a realization:
<br />
1) You can spin the wheel? If yes, go on!
<br />
2) Since you can affect an object, even if it's spinning, you should be able to push it.
<br />
3) Pull it too? Yeap.
<br />
4) Levitate it.
<br />

<br />
If you can do one, you CAN do all.

sure  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> .  the solar plexus is the area right underneath where your ribs seperate, around your diaphram.  if you start pushing around there with your finger, it's the spot that pushes the air out of your lungs. 
<br />

<br />
it is believed by many people that there is a &quot;nerve cluster&quot; there that you can project psi out of (much like your hands) and is more efficient with tk than your hands are (just a theory).  it's located where the solar plexus chakra is.  (that's why that chakra is known as the solar plexus chakra  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> )
<br />

<br />
note:  the solar plexus isn't a made up word, it is used pretty widely.
