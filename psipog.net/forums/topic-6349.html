			Uhh. I haven't tried this myself, since I just thought of this. Have you looked through the motionless meditation topic? I suggest you do, it's wonderful. Anyways, while you're meditating, you could focus on moving your energy in a constant circle throughout your body. I imagine that the more you do that the easier it'll become. I also think that if you can get to moving it fast you'll be able to create a shield or a psi-ball at a good speed.
<br />

<br />
How often do you meditate? I'd experiment with this myself, but I don't meditate on a regular schedule, mostly cause I forget.

			Need more clarification.
<br />

<br />
What are you trying to do with this energy? Are you trying to draw new energy into yourself? That's (relatively) easy and doesn't require meditation... I think all of the psiball articles start with telling you how to draw energy from a source.* Are you trying to do something with the energy already within yourself?
<br />

<br />
Basically, not enough information to give a relevant answer.
<br />

<br />
*I think the way that the articles tell you to draw energy varies from misguided to inefficient to downright wrong, but that's neither here nor there.

			i'm trying to pull more energy in and make the energy that is already in my body flow better and i could use this energy to certain points of my body, i need alot of energy and it has to flow better.

			If you would really like to know more about that and become good at it, I advise you to research Pranayama Yoga. the yoga of Breath and prana.
