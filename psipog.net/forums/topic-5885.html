			I just wanted to know if you guys could help me because I want to be able to fight like a Shaolin Master but the martial arts schools around here don't teach the mental focus. If you guys know how to train your mind like that or how to get to the point where your awareness is just so high that you almost become unstoppable, could you reply? I have done kung fu and know the technique but I just want to know more than technique.

			Well, if you want to gain focus and &quot;slow time,&quot;(speed up your perceptions).  Meditate, meditate often.  Do soft style martial arts such as Tia Chi or Aikido.  Though by your multitude of run on sentances seems like you are a sparkplug.  lol  So you might get bored easily, but just stick with it(also sticking with these kind of martial art will help you sparkplugy-ness, if you have sparkplugy-ness).
<br />

<br />
good luck

The key is to have noe fear whatsoever. You should have no fear for getting hit. Second thing is: No thoughts. There is a different between focussing, and thinking about something. The moment you start to think of something, you are no longer present there with your awareness. You should be fearless and thoughtless. Be fully focussed on every moment. Have no doubt nor hesitation. Feel your oponent without thinnking about him, so you will feel what his next step is going to be. This is all trained with meditation indeed.

Also, practice meditation, and qigong (chikung).

Holy crap that is deep. So you would have no emotions and no thoughts...you have to just go with the flow...isn't it almost like trancing and fighting at the same time? 
<br />
Can you do that MA?!

			I havent trained physical artial arts in a year or so, but thanks to my meditations and my fear-reduction and focus-increase, I am better at 'fighting' now than I was a year ago. So I would say fear and a scattered mind really disables your ability to have a higher awareness. You will see things coming far too late if you are thinking about fighting. If you, instead, justfight with pure conscious focus, but without thinking about it, you will know what is going tohappeneven before themove is made. That way sparring becomes a joyfull and focussed dance in which you are able to anticipate the next move before it arrives.

			So how do you think I would go about not fearing anything and clearing my mind? Would I just have to do the standard meditation (counting breaths, staring at a dot on the wall) or would I have to do some kind of extravagant type of exercise?

			If you want to have no fear, you should have a good reason not to have fear anymore. Mine is that I know, or I think to know, what life is about. I believe to know what my true nature is. Once you discover your true nature, fear will automatically dissolve gradually, because you realise there is no need to fear. There is no death. I am immortal. So why should I have fear? Once you begin to see through the illusions of transitoriness, you will be settled more and more in your own immortal consciousness and less dependent on the bodily consciousness alone. Then you will transcend fear. So no, fearlessness is not gained by staring at a dot I believe. Perhaps after 300 years of staring at it, I dont know.
<br />

<br />
So the best way to become fearless in life is not to put up a tough attitude that tries to fight the fear within. That is only a mask and it is not real fearlessness. Real fearlessness is gained after accepting the fear you have, realising from what missassumption and ignorance it comes from, and then transcending it by understanding the truth about yourself.

			sensory training. look for my article in the personal technis.
<br />

<br />
and, from one martial artist to another, trance-like states are really easy to come by. the slow-time effect is a after-product of it. just focus all your attention on your opponent, and it just might click.

			I practice Aikido as well. Although, you can't learn to 'fight like a shaolin master' from a forum... Take into consideration that all great martial arts masters had practiced for a very long time and dedicated their lives to their arts in order to get such results. 
<br />

<br />
You should reconsider your intentions if you want to fight like a shaolin master... Do you want it to impress others or to make others think higher of you? Maybe you want it so you can kick someone's a$$? Or is it self defence?
<br />

<br />
If it's any of those reasons, you'll probably never achieve that level. Because, as someone said, you cannot follow the path with one eye with the other eye fixed on the goal.
<br />

<br />
Slowing down time isn't possible in the matrix sense. From my experience, it's just a matter of perceiving that you have enough time to do a technique correctly, even though the attack might be very rapid. It comes with practice and concentration. Think of it this way: it takes you about 5 years to get a black belt in most martial arts. And it's only the beginning of your training.
