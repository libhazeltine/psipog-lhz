Wind currents are not going to push pens and pencils around unless you are blowing on them, which obviously I would know given a live demonstration.

&quot;Now...about your subconscience having to get used to it&quot;
<br />

I do not disbelieve or believe in TK or anything else. Very few people are apparently reading my posts. Meh, their loss. I have already explained my position on this numerous times. 
<br />

<br />
I grew up knowing that objects can move on their own without any apparent physical means moving them. There is nothing wrong with my mind or subconscious accepting these things. I am only skeptical that others can do what they claim, especially when they do something and claim it is actually TK or paranormal.

Maybe the pinwheel can be moved via air currents, but how exactly does that fit into the argument of &quot;OMG IF IT CAN MOVE BY AIR IT CANT MOVE BY PSI&quot; that you keep pulling out of your ass?

You say you've levitated stuff before (which is a pretty radical claim, based on the shit you just pulled off back there), why are you claiming that the pinwheel can't be moved by psi?

I am not PMS'ing over anything, YOU are the one all pissy and angry that they had all their crap arguments torn to pieces. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Maybe the pinwheel can be moved via air currents, but how exactly does that fit into the argument of &quot;OMG IF IT CAN MOVE BY AIR IT CANT MOVE BY PSI&quot; that you keep pulling out of your ass?&quot;
<br />

<br />
You are not moving it with psi. Get over your delusion. 
<br />

<br />
A pinwheel with sit there and spin with no effort from a person, just having their hands near, not near, breathing, anything will work and make it spin, apparently on it's own. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;You say you've levitated stuff before (which is a pretty radical claim, based on the shit you just pulled off back there), why are you claiming that the pinwheel can't be moved by psi?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Because it's air, or heat, or any number of factors. A pinwheel will move from nearly no influence at all. Get up and walk away from a pinwheel, and you will create circulating air currents that will make it spin and move. 
<br />

<br />
It is not a valid test for any sort of psionic powers, EVER. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Are you so paranoid that you think EVERY SINGLE PERSON that puts a psi video online is faking it?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Paranoid? WTF? What would I be paranoid of?
<br />

<br />
You are the one paranoid that all your little alleged psi videos simply don't cut the mustard and are merely magic tricks, not magick powers. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Are you that full of yourself?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Are you that stupid?
<br />

<br />
Yes, I am filled with myself; my organs, my fluids, the food I eat, the air I breathe. That is me, and I am it. I can only be filled with me, otherwise someone would be wearing a flesh coat made from my skin. 
<br />

<br />
Why are we the ones dismissing evidence? Your dismissing 
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">our</span> evidence. Your just not providing a rasional arguement for your beliefs. And fyi, barging into a forum, parading your beliefs about and expecting us to follow you like little sheep isn't a good idea and won't get you much respect and support. Also, when you say stuff like &quot;You can't do pk and you are not moving the psi wheel&quot;, you are meaning to say I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DO THIS&quot; yes?
<br />

<br />
Tip for the future: Don't call us &quot;kiddo's&quot; or &quot;kid&quot; or &quot;junior&quot; (sp?)
<br />
Give us the respect that we would like to give to you if you didn't keep shoving it back at us. We are people too and <span style="font-weight: bold">Humans</span> at the age of 15 are not stupid and gullable you stereotypical bastard. You obviouslt havn't had the courtesy to sensibly put forward your arguements without bringing verbal violence into this forum. I think this member deserves to be kicked for being an ass and not providing proper evidence, nor accepting any other evidence we choose to show him. What do you actually want?

			Please guys, don't reduce yourselves to this level. This is what the sceptics do on sceptic-dominated 'paranormal' - forums, like unexplained-mysteries.com.

<br />
Please don't lower yourselves down to their level. Does it matter to you what Kief thinks? No? You could never convince him using words anyways. If he doesn't want to understand your perfectly valid points and simple logic (and a little flame-bordering arguement), he won't. Simple as that. No one wants to see psipogbb.net follow unexplanied-mysteries.com down into the mud.

Others would claim they did the same to you.  Equalling to nothing  and pointless bickering.  Both sides need to relized that everyone has lost.  No one is going to win this agument.
