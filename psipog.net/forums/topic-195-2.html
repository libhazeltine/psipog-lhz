			Wow, that is pretty far out. I didn't plan on trying it out after gym since I was sore like you said all the rest of it. That sounds pretty intense, wonder if there are any masters left... <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> hmmmmm. That would be pretty cool being a human 'god'. But loosing my mind in the process, no thanks.

			Its not a matter of liking, but when a topic is raised it must be explained by those who know about it.It can be anything.
<br />

<br />
Infact on PPS society and a couple of other places i saw some mis statements about it, so probably thought it would be good to shed light.
<br />
anyways its better not to disucss such topics and I agree but for right reasons.

			there is a rediculous amout of misinformation on kundalini, thats why here especially when its off topic (being a religious practice primarily - the use and cultivation of which relating to enlightenment) do i want to see definitive statements about what kundalini is or isn't. if this topic was discussing how kundalini relates to psi or i don't know.   just the examples given here i don't feel really fall under the topic of kundalini other than to further spread misinformation.  i guess my frustration has to do with it being thrown around by the pop-yoga community at large.    i don't see many gods on earth walking around so i don't understand why so many poeple are trying to teach about it.

			There is indeed alot of misunderstanding around the phenomenon Kundalini. Or you could see it as a poly-interpretable subject. I'll give a little bit of information here, on what my studies, practices and experiences has taught me about kundalini.
<br />

<br />
As most of you already know, there are many forms of energy. We have heat, we have thoughts, we have matter, we have the four elements, we have chi, we have EM, you name it. Everything we see exists out of energy. Though we see all kinds of forms, on the most fundamental level of reality, all those forms exist out of one source. One kind of substance/energy, that has manifested itself into different forms. Or should I say, all forms remain that one substance, but we humans like to label the stuff we see. So in fact, there is only one, pure form of energy. (If you take an even deeper dive in reality, you will en dup in nothingness, but let's not make it too abstract for now)
<br />
This undivided, pure energy, lies latent in the base of your spine. We call it: Kundalini. Yes, the source of the universe(by many described as a snake), is taking a nap at the base of your spine  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />. 
<br />

<br />
This godlike energy, can be awakened through a variety of practices, but the essential part is that you have to become conscious enough, in order for it to awaken. Once awakened, it will rise up through your sushumna channel (your spine) all the way up to the top of your head (Crown Chakra). On its way, Kundalini will open, and purify all the seven chakras that are situated along the spine, giving you acces to all the secret knowledge and abilities about this life. A kundalini awakening is a very delicate process, and it is probably the most powerfull form of consciousness that you can acces. By awakening the undivided form of energy(pure consciousness), you will awaken your exceptional powers(in sanskrit: Siddhi's). 
<br />

<br />
A kundalini awakening is the re-union of your personal consciousness, with the universal/godlike consciousness(nothingness). Simply said, it is the proces of re-uniting with your source. Your ego will vanish, and you will be free from all fears and illusions. I don't want to make this sound any fluffier than it probably already sounds for most of you, but let me tell you that once your siddhi's are awakened, and you are free from your own illusions, you won't be bothering with the psi-wheel anymore =)
<br />

<br />
This is probably the highest form of spiritual enlightenment. 
<br />
If you are planning on practicing this process of awakening, you will need devotion, determination, care and patientce. The hardest part of all its aspects, is to let go of your sense of self. Or rather, your ego/personality.

			Umm...why is this technique which basically sounds like a DBZer's attempt at making a psi technique not being challenged more?  Kundalini has absolutely nothing to do with &quot;charging up your muscles&quot;.
<br />

<br />
The power of the Kundalini isn't due to it having more raw energy than something like psi, it's due to the fact that constant kundalini flow requires your body, mind and spirit (new age as that may sound) are in peak condition.  When you're entire body is working at 100% and is focused perfectly by the mind, the <span style="font-weight: bold">amount </span>of energy it can hangle becomes huge.  The kundalini energy is really just an indicator (in fact I have doubts whether it is in fact it's own type of energy or just a specific meridian chi flows through).  If your body is capable of letting energy through your main chakras in copious amounts, then your body is working optimally.
<br />

<br />
Now I don't know about being &quot;God-like&quot;, but the benefits are certainly clearcut and dramatic.  Your awareness psionically goes through the roof, as well as your ability to manipulate things psionically.  You do gain speed, strength, balance and wisdom due to a kundalinic awakening but it's usually temporary since people tend to awaken it due to odd body positions (like Yoga) or just luck.
<br />

<br />
To address some of the bad crap that can happen to you due to kundalinic awakenings, these come about when you are not fit to work at 100% mentally or physically.  You might go mad because all the physical things are happening to you but you are simply overwhelmed.  You might burn out nerves if you're mentally ready but physically lacking.  Any combination of those 2 shortcomings basically cause all the symptoms of an improper kundalinic awakening.
<br />

<br />
Basically, take care of yourself, learn and grow and you'll be set on the path of kundalinic awakening.  Trying to force your body into letting a zillion joules of energy flow around your spine in a double helix to do some parlor tricks is not going to get you anywhere except in a wheelchair with some weird nerve disorder, an asylum or a grave.
<br />

<br />
But of course, there is one up side to having so much power contained within us: it's a bugger to awaken.  Real awakenings are far more dramatic than just &quot;feeling like your head is going to explode&quot;.  A real improper awakening tends to involve convulsions (a proper awakening even has some muscle spasms until the body gets totally used to the energy flow) and psionic burnout to a degree you'll never get spinning a psi wheel for too long.  Most people just want to say they've had an awakening when they've just had a dribble of extra energy flow through their main meridian.
<br />

<br />
I think that's about all I've got to say for now...*pats self down* Yup, I don't have any more lectures left.  I'm all out.

			Lol. I love all the criticism. Just to refresh your memories, this is a forum to learn things. If you don't like what someone teaches, leave. But don't bitch at them, no one wants to hear you bitch or hear you sound like you know more than the person writing it. If you are going to tell me off, the least you can do is try it and see if it works. Damn Hypocrites.

			I don't mean to be hostile, it only seems that way because I feel it's my duty to inform people of the truth.  Should what you claim not be true for whatever reason, I think it's best if SOMEONE lets you know rather than having you and all who accept what you say living in ignorance.  That someone just happens to be me since no one else seems to be pointing out your error (perhaps due to lack of knowledge on the subject which makes it that more important that I dispell the idea that you can &quot;charge up&quot; on kundalini energy).  Kundalini yoga is an ancient practice, there's tons of information written about it that's easily accessible and your technique is counter to all that information.  So, this isn't meant as an attack on you, but just an informing of the total incorrectness of what you're claiming when compared to thousands of years of gathered knowledge.
<br />

<br />
Whether you made up the technique, found it or heard about it, it doesn't matter, but don't present something so authoritatively when you obviously lack knowledge on the subject.  Basically, I'd rather you didn't teach people radki techniques cloaked by the guise of using Kundalini energy.

Tell me, what gives you authority in such fields as Kundalini. Really, you've given me nothing more than what I could read off of some dumbasses site or some text book. You don't know what I'm talking about.. so as politely as I can put it. Helpful criticism no trolling.

			I talked to Tenkei for a long time in the chat about this thread.  If I understood him correctly, one of the problems in this thread is that he is trying to redefine the word &quot;kundalini&quot;.
<br />

<br />
For communication to work, I believe it's important to keep consistent definitions.  We all need to be &quot;on the same page&quot;.  I try to enforce that at PsiPog by not allowing people to re-define words, or invent new words.  I'm not perfect - in fact, in the past PsiPog has invented new words, or re-defined old words as well.  But looking back, I think it's a mistake.
<br />

<br />
The major problem with this thread is that Tenkei is redefining kundalini to mean something else, and the skeptics in this thread are arguing that what he's talking about isn't kundalini.  What he's talking about ISN'T kundalini - BY DEFINITION.  I know that Tenkei has good intentions, but I think he is too relaxed when it comes to the english language.
<br />

<br />
I encourage people to share techniques, and try new things with an open mind.  But at the same time, we can't just pick keywords in the english language that are &quot;sort of&quot; what we're talking about, and use them for a new purpose.  This causes confusion and arguing (this thread is evidence).  To avoid this, I am closing this thread until Tenkei clairifies his position, or uses different terms.
<br />

<br />
Again, for the most credible and effective communication, we should avoid:
<br />
1. Re-defining terms
<br />
2. Creating new terms
<br />

			hmm, i remember last summer, i was taking down the cieling of the school, since i work a the school part time, and decided to have fun seeing how many of those wierd tile things  i could break with a single punch.(you know, the ones you throw your pencil at to see if it'll stick)
<br />

<br />
i energised my hand as though i were making a psi ball, but kept it in my hand, and punched and it SEEMED(i might have just punched harder cause i thought i would, never know.) to work better. i got 7 of those things in one hit a couple of times.
<br />

<br />

<br />
afterwards, i noticed that i had repeatedly jammed my thumb doing it without even realizing it. XD 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
btw, how long exactly does it take your body to make more 'life' psi anyway? or is it a simple supply that goes away forever after using it?
