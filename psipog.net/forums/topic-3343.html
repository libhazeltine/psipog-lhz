			Well in my other topic I didn't get anything. But is this normal...
<br />

<br />
1.) I can move anything pretty much.
<br />
2.) If it's heavier than 13 pounds I have lots of trouble
<br />
3.) I feel so flushed out and exausted after pursuing a long
<br />
connection with an object.
<br />
4.) My eye color is changing rapidly.. yellow gold brown right now..
<br />

<br />
I am quite frightened by the idea. It can come to be useful.
<br />
But is it safe? Wiill anything happen to me&gt;
<br />
Thanks

			you can move anything less then 13 pounds? thats awesome. i dont think anything bad will happen to you if you keep doing telekinesis. but if you start to feel exhausted and getting a headache when doing it you should take a pause for a while until you feel all better.

you actually believe me? I am so glad. Can you do it? Move things

			It's kind of stressful. I really can't believe other people can move stuff.
<br />
What's a psi wheel btw?
<br />
The only thing I have difficulties with is moving water.
<br />
I feel like somethings coming from my wrists to my hands. Like
<br />
a liquid rushing through your skin and escaping to the object.
<br />
I never used my hands or any other body part before. Just my mind.
<br />
It's a lot easier with my hands though. It kind of stabalises it.
<br />
Can you move anything else?

			a psi wheel is a piece of paper folded into a four-cornered star shape balanced on a pin and you try to spin it with your mind. its all i can do right now because ive only started 4 days ago. how would you describe the feelings in your hands and mind when moving objects? and do you have any extra advice?

			It's kind of hard to explain but here it goes..
<br />
It's like when I want to move something I don't really have 
<br />
to focus much. Like having it in my thoughts and thinking 
<br />
about what I want to do with it will be its guidance. So if i wanted
<br />
to move my computer mouse, lift it and place it down on the other table
<br />
I just have to think about it happening. Or if I conecentrate on it I can
<br />
sometimes press the buttons in without thinking about it. Probably the
<br />
pressure on it. I still have lots to do. But from some of the most
<br />
recent and strangest is probably lifting the 14' tv. It kind of went up
<br />
then I start conectrating and you know that sound when hard plastic
<br />
gets pushed in and makes that sorta cracking noise.. well thats what it does.
<br />
I don't know but whenever I focus and think on it, it starts to put
<br />
pressure on it. But other than that that's all i can do. I tried lifting
<br />
a table weighing a  lot more than 10-13 pounds and that resulted in it sputtering up and falling back down giving me a headache.
<br />
Whenever I get headaches, things around me move and tremble.
<br />
Don't kno but I get kinda scared that I might do somethin bad.
<br />

<br />
The feeling in my hands is like something rushing out the end of my hand.
<br />
If It's something simple like flipping a switch it feels like a little tingle.
<br />

<br />
What do you feel?

			you shouldnt stop doing what youre doing. being able to move things that heavy get me so jealous. when i try do it after a while my palms of my hands get really warm and fingertips start to tingle. and then my third eye feels tension on it but if i go for too long, like today where ive been practicing non stop, then i get a real headache and just cant continue.

			But before I leave I will explain myself...
<br />

<br />
When you said &quot;Can't believe other people can move stuff? Did you think you were... not human or something? lol.&quot;
<br />
Honestly how common is this? It's a site regarding it, doesn't mean it's full of people.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
When you said
<br />
#1 and #2 are a slight contradiction...
<br />

<br />
I mean't i can move anything like a pencil or paperclip or
<br />
plastic or a remote. And by saying 13 pounds it's just an estimate. I
<br />
dont go weighing things. And by saying 13 pounds i am saying that's what the limits to all those things I can move..so explained. doesnt contridict.
<br />

<br />

<br />
When you said &quot;What happened to objects over 13 pounds?&quot;
<br />

<br />
okay I have difficulties with water. It's hard to get a grasp on it cause 
<br />
of course it can be split into a million different sections.
<br />

<br />
When you quoted &quot;</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">I never used my hands</span> or any other body part before.

<br />
okay I was giving my statement. Of what i think about what it feels to me.
<br />

<br />

<br />
when you said &quot;Not that I completely don't trust you, but I'm a bit skeptical from the way you present yourself.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I don't care how I present myself. I wanted to get information from
<br />
someone else who experiances the same thing. And what you're doin 
<br />
is killin my hope. So just don't.

Yes, it does get kind of warm. It usually happens when I concentrate mor
<br />

<br />
Have you tried using anything else. Maybe a peice of string or a bottle cap.
<br />

anything about what's going on...
