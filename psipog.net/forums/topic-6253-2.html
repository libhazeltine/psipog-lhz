			I used to be a mega Dragon Ball Z fan up until my cable got cut so I mised out on the cell saga. That kind of saved me from becoming an Otaku. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  But I would have never dressed up as a character. Yes...they would need therapy....very much. I watched it awhile ago for a bit trying to catch up but didn't even bother with the Bu saga or whatever he's called because it's rubbish from what I've seen. And GT I didn't even think of watching for some reason. 
<br />
btw, if you want to see lots of dragon ball z or any other animes or even practically (and I mean almost) every show on tv, then go here: <a href="http://www.allfg.org" target="_blank" class="postlink">www.allfg.org</a>. That site is like my savior now. Screw youtube...unless you're just looking for some funny random shit.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

Because usually they're too busy illegally downloading anime off P2P programs and watching it during every second of free time they have to notice that it's a derogatory term. I knew some people like that in high school. They could fill up entire hard drives with just anime. I mean, come on, I like cartoons and TV too, hell, I even made a small UT2004 mod based off the cartoon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Phantom" target="_blank" class="postlink">Danny Phantom</a>, but there's no need to worship a cartoon.

			Twas indeed. 
<br />

<br />
Although the fighting with each bad guy became predictable: Arrive, Talk, Shoot, Dust Clouds, Get Beaten, Then Have An Amazing Comeback.
<br />

<br />
I'll also agree with the person who started this topic; there was a major change in the quality of animation after that episode.
<br />

<br />
I never watched DragonBall GT, couldn't be bothered watcging more of the same old thing.
<br />

<br />
P.S. This forum really isn't what it used to be. I remember in the old days on the old forum; a topic such as this would have been deleted immediately after it had been first posted.

			The quality went down after the Cell Games because AT wanted to end it there... actually, I think he wanted to end it after Frieza, but fans wanted more... and I guess after Cell he tried to make it bad so he wouldn't have to do it anymore.
<br />

<br />
GT wasn't even made nor endorsed by AT(the DB/DBZ creator), which is why GT was just... bad. The ShadowDragon series was the only semi-decent one in GT, and even that was iffy.
<br />

<br />
But anyway, DBZ was pretty good up untill the end of Cell... then it really did get repetetive(then again... what show doesn't after that long?)

			I used to like it...... I watched it through to the end, and I still think it's better than people give it credit for(though Rorouni Kenshin, and Inuyasha are a HELL of a lot better).   But yeah, after the cell saga it just kinda got repetitive/lame.
<br />

<br />
Cell was so obviously supposed to be the &quot;final bad guy.  period.&quot;, that buu was just kinda a repackaged cell.   It should have ended at Cell, imo.
<br />

<br />
And we won't speak of GT.   That was just....weird.

			Yeah, Cell was designed that way. It took basically a whole season on two fights(Goku and Gohan) to finally kill him off. Buu was a bung of seemingly random, little fights. Though when Vegete blew himself up, I thought it was pretty cool. But that's about it.
<br />

<br />
Gohan becomes completely lame after Cell. He's about half as strong during the time after Cell as he was on Namek, unless he goes SSJ- and even then, his power is lame for the Z world at that point.
<br />

<br />
Having Goten and Trunks both be able to go SSJ? just sorta annoyed me. Maybe if they were a few years older and had gone through some serious battles... I honestly think AT was trying to make the fans STOP wanting DBZ shows
