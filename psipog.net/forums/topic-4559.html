			I read in several places that it's suggested that you make your own energy instead of drawing from others.  Why?  I'm just beginning this, and I get a stronger Psi Ball (or at least stronger BioFeedback) when I draw from other sources.

			Well, first of all, is it the same energy? same source? we really don't know, it might all be a psychological thing. Personally, do whatever, as long it helps you make psiballs, as long it doesn't invade anybody's personal space.

			I've seen some benefits from it. It helped me be able to make psi-balls on a dime, and even lower my sleep needed, though that's not necissarily a good thing, unless you need to stay up for 24 hours or something...

<br />
I guess whatever works for you is best. Try everything.

ya good questions. i know i react like everyone else when i use my mind for too long; i get headaches and become tired. in order to get rid of that i take caffeine and/or sleep. 
<br />

<br />
i think doing whatever works for you is a good idea. i would say try certain things out and find out what works best. 
<br />

<br />
i would watch out though, if you decide to eat caffeine/sugar to give you a kick, watch your weight if you dont want to be obese.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			There really isn't an advantage in using your own energy when it comes to the creation of whatever you are trying to make.
<br />

<br />
Generating your own energy can get difficult, because your body isn't as abundant of a source as say, the earth.
<br />

<br />
But if you practice using your own energy, you'll become stronger. Making your own energy is like a muscle, the more you do it the stronger you become.
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure what being able to generate energy more does for you, but making yourself stronger sure seems cooler than just taking energy from the earth all the time.

Hmm, that's an interesting point. If you can't generate your own, then what's all this &quot;if you practice drawing it from your body, you get stronger&quot; stuff I've been hearing alot? Does it have any merit whatsoever?

			ya that's a good point am. i've used the same reasoning, so i don't really know where blade is coming from when he says you can't make your own energy. 
<br />

<br />
i really do personally think you can make your own energy, like what i said about those generators.

			It's really insignificant where you &quot;get&quot; your energy from... They all come from the same source, I think, no matter what you visualize.

When I was first beginning I would attempt to draw psi from various things, plants, water, fire... But it was all really ineffective and just for &quot;show&quot; and a &quot;Mystical&quot; feeling <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

I have had many more success' from using my body. And there really is no reason not to. It's close to your mind (I think <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />), and it's always around where ever you go.
