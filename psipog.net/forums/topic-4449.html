			I really don't believe you can see the exact future.
<br />

<br />
I've read plenty and thought about it, and it seems that it's only a calculated future. Not the exact. Our mind is quite the computer, but consciously, it's terrible, that is why I believe it's not the exact future, since we can easly change the probable chance.
<br />

<br />
now then, time to disagree or agree. Precognaters out there, please think about it, think of the precognition then think of what happend, is it exactly the same, every detail..every time?

We all know that Remote Viewing is possible, we all know that telepathy is possible, so maybe when we practice these things, our mind puts a picture of  a place and everything in it together, then 'sees' what will happen next.

			I agree with you, Neveza. I'm not sure it's possible to know the exact future, either.
<br />

<br />
Now, I'm not a Precogger, so I'm just using logic here.
<br />
At any rate, I figure that at most, precog shows the most likely future, or perhaps the future as it will happen if nothing is done about it. However, humans are blessed (or cursed, depending,) with free will, and once we know the &quot;future&quot; as it stands, we can decide what to do about it.
<br />

<br />
Then, the only problems come when the doubt hits of &quot;what if by trying to prevent it, I only cause it to happen?&quot; But even then, it would probably have changed, especially if it depends on the actions of multiple people.
<br />

<br />
So basically, I agree that it couldn't be possible to see the exact future.
<br />
After all, nothing that I can think of is good enough to predict the actions of everyone involved without doubt when free will and human spontanaiety and unpredictability are involved.

			Maybe it's like that whole quantum, physics thing... If you &quot;see&quot; it it's already changed. So, perhaps by seeing something, in an actual precognition, that's the only possibility that will happen? <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

<br />
This is what also, makes me think what I do, If it was acutally the exact future, I don't think it would be distorted. I personnally belive that our minds couldn't fit all the peices together so it becomes slightly distorted.

I think your subconscious mind takes these subtle little things and like you said uses every little detail from everywhere and peices it together.

Yes, when I precog it's always right, always perfect.  Sooo...you're wrong.  IMO time is simply less linear and one-dimensional than most believe, allowing for the passing of data from one time to another as well as alterations in how it flows (I've been experimenting with time dilation for the last few months with startling results).

Well, then, This doesn't show I'm wrong, maybe your mind can calculate better then some. You can't fully say is one wrong or right if you don't have any scientific facts. But I'm not saying I'm right, I'm just stating what I believe and hope for a decent argument.

			Well In my case, precog is mixed up with dreams, so when I see the dream coming true, it's just a piece of it which comes true (not all the dream), but it's EXACTLY as I saw that bit, so yes, it's exact, the images, the feelings and even thoughts (I dreamt that I thought while seeing... isn't that weird?).
<br />

<br />
Just one note out of personal experience. I don't know which dreams or part of them will come true until they do. Knowing that, most &quot;precognaters&quot; that I know of (mostly friends) agree that, if you see the future, it's because it will happen, otherwise it wouldn't be called: &quot;future&quot;.
<br />

<br />
As we do not live in a sci-fi movie, we cannot change future by actions or time traveling or whathever. Imagine what would happen if you corrected the future or past, then you wouldn't be in need of changing it, and you wouldn't have gone, then you wouldn't be there to change it and you would need changing it, so you'll have to go there &quot;ad infinitum&quot;. See? It's not so easy.
<br />

<br />
To those who believe in &quot;there's no destiny, it's all 'bout decisions&quot; as I do, you can confort yourself knowing &quot;precogers&quot; don't see destiny, but the result of an outcoming decision. Sort of micro-PK?
<br />

<br />
P.S.
<br />
If I could calculate like that, I wouldn't suck at math.
<br />
This may not be a &quot;decent&quot; argument, but my opinion was asked for, so I gave it.

<br />
It hurts me to read that; as I was attired to psionics not only by the scqepticism but by the fact there was something I couldn't explain. In fact I believed in psionics just because of precog. Before hitting psipog, I was in great danger of becoming a &quot;fluffy white light&quot; while searching for answers.
<br />

<br />
Well, it seems precog will never be in the same level as RV or micro-PK.

			Yes I agree nev. I too have also had minor differences between the experience of precognition and the actual occurance of said event.
<br />

<br />
However, I do believe that if one becomes good at precognition, then they can create that immediate future themselves, either to be exactly as they have seen it, or to change it accordingly.
