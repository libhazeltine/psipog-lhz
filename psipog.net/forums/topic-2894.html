			From reading your post, your problem seems to be your utter frustration and obsession from lack of results. Getting frustrated gets nothing accomplished and blocks you from success. Don't practice and expect results. Practice and let results come to you, don't command them to you.

			well, not being able to do PK for 3 years would frustrate the hell out of me!  I dont blame him.
<br />

<br />
I developed a way to get around short focus time because when i was little, i had a tumor in my short term memory lobe of my brain.  It effected my attention span and i still have an impared one now.  But hey, i get PK done very well!  (there you go.  A fact about me that no one here (except maybe a couple) knew.)

			Isn't there meant to be a connection between ADHD kids, and a natural instinct for psi? - their attention spans are shorter.
