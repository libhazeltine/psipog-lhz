			hey, i just thought perhaps a safety forum or section of psipog would be good.  although i've never had any long term negative effects i think i strain a little too much at telepathy and have gotten some unusual bad effects that other people would probably want to avoid.   i sent this to the newsletter once but here goes again.
<br />

<br />
1.  avoid linking with poeple that are likely to have mental illness or defintely have mental illness.
<br />

<br />
2. if you're trying to make bizzarre telepathic construct <span style="font-weight: bold">really make sure you have the basics mastered</span> first.  i once spent a free couple hours on a train ride attempting to make something (that in retrospect was a horrible idea in itself)  but anyways, the thing backfired in the sense that i used it on myself accidently and it worked,  triggering a panic attack which in turn triggered more panic attacks (i never had them before that, and i got rid of them within a couple months through self hypnosis <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />    )
<br />

<br />
3.  when you feel completely &quot;normal&quot; (no psionic activity) make sure to take note so that later if you need to turn a sense on or off you have a good frame of mind to refrence. 
<br />

<br />
4.  don't strain yourself.  the best effects seem to come fluidy and naturally. while trying really hard i've gotten wierd sensations of pops or clicks in my head usually followed by a period of uncomfortable unstable mental states.  i've always quit there but i can only imagine it gets more unstable.
<br />

<br />
5.  it took me a long while to learn this one but in retrospect it was pretty obvious and pretty important.  i used to practice alot just using anyone who was around because i would commute alot in a big city.  at first i didn't think anything about attempting to cause harmful effects in other poeple.  now adays i realised that if you're going to practice on other poeple, things will just go better for you and them if you practice sending positive things (plus attaching positive feelings or thoughts to commands seems to make telepathic suggestion stronger).
<br />

<br />
i was sure i had more.  the main one is be really careful who you link to.  i've gotten some crazy shit to happen by linking to the wrong poeple (crazy homeless poeple have really messed up minds).  (the most recent thing that happened is a developed a lazy eye because i was linking to someone with a lazy eye.  it lasted a couple months until they moved to a differnt state then my lazy eye went away also)
<br />

<br />
i'd be interested in whatever ancedotal dangers other poeple have run into?

			That is nice, but I would say it would have more success as an article than as a forum <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> . But the forum idea is also good <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />
Here is one: Do not over work yourself or stress yourself out.
