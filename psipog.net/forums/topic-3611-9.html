I'm husky just to let you know. Not quite as fat as my brother. I've got more muscle than he does because I usually work out. As for greatness, I AM GREAT! <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />  &quot;Believe it!&quot; <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> . My weight has no effect on that. I usually exercise. And when I do I put a lot of effort into it. When I go on the cycling (bicycle) machine I prefer to go on for an hour. I've tried diets and intense exercise in the past but they've never got me skinny. I'm on a very wierd diet right now (infact it doesn't even seem like much of a diet at all! XD). If it fails (which it probably will <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />), I will have to go on my own harsh diet that will be incredibly hard to endure. If that fails I doubt anything else (besides weight loss pills, etc.) will work. When I had to take People's P.E. (for disabled or injured people; I was put in there just because 1 of my back problems would have affected my back during high impact activities such as running) I worked harder than anyone in there (you probably assume it was due to their injuries, but they weren't that restricted by their injuries that much. The gym teacher himself nagged them all the time to get off their asses and do some work. He often commented on how hard I was working.) and I benefited greatly from it.  By the end of the year I could curl, leg press, and bench press about twice as much as I could in the beginning of the year. I got my body fat down to about 22.5% and I had gained about 10-15 lb's of muscle (that's not bad considering I was only doing 4 sets for each exercise and I only went to the weight room one or two days a week). I hope that puts things into perspective for you. I'm not a lazy fat dude who eats all the time. Even somefatguy is better than that. I don't do sumo and I don't even use a fighting style. I prefer the Bruce Lee philosophy (make up your own moves and do whatever it takes to win). I actually thought up that philosophy myself (somefatguy did too) and was interested when I heard Bruce Lee believed in the same thing. Well, that's enough of my life story. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />
TO JOSHY:  I hope you find me to be an exception for the fat-discrimination philosophy of yours like my brother. That is a cruel philosphy my friend. What is your reasoning?

I can't think of a good compliment for you, pepsiboy. All I can think of is this: pepsiboy is kind for coming on my thread. Sorry.

It actually wasn't my life story, it was just a part of my life. I was just using it to get the point across. If you read it you'd see that I didn't weightlift and diet for 17 years! By the way, did you mean to say you're running out of time? If the answer's no then who's chasing you out of town?! <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

baalzamon is creative for having a very unique username and a cool avatar. He's also nice for joining in on my thread, seeing as he is the newest one to post here. This thread seems to be falling behind. We must act now my deciples! Post like you're on crack! We can not let this thread die. We must try to beat the jail thread. They're slowing down so now is the time to strike! <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />
