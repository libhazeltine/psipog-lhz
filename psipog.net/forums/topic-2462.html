			Your looking for something that isn't normally there i.e. pressure, static, tinglyness, etc. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Also, your poll doesn't make much sense, as the question is not a yes or no answerable question. I say fix it.

			Agree on what? Most of it is questioning, or looks like it is leading up to a point to agree on or to disagree with.
<br />
In anycase,
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">How do i know if im really making a psi ball?</span>
<br />
You feel it, see it, or otherwise sense it.
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">i mean, when i try to make onw, i dont feel anything. is that normal</span>
<br />
Yes
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">do i have to imagine a certain shape?</span>
<br />
No. Imagine what you feel will help you shape the Psi that way. Its all about communicating with your subcouncious(sp). If it understands your trying to make a Psi-Ball when your imagining a duck then it is perfectly fine. Generally people think of an object they often see that looks, and feels about the same as what they are trying to make. Trying to 'feel' it with your hands, or imagining what it feels like is also helpfull along with trying to smell it. Anything to add to the realism.
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">what am i doing wrong?</span>
<br />
What are you doing? I don't know what your doing, but generally you will get it if you keep at it. Just because it does not work does not meen you did anything long.
<br />
At Thermopally the Spartans along with many other city states stood ageinst an army of 2million people marching under the Persian banner. They lost the ground, and all died. They did nothing wrong, and infact won in numbers. They could have done some things better, however. If they did not die, they would have held there ground doing what they did.
<br />
Bad medaphor, but my mind is out of it. What I meen is don't give up, and you'll get it. Even if your not doing it perfectly, as long as you believe you will do it, you will.
