I'm pretty sure your shield crosses the line, because it attacks back.

			well in a sense, it could just be a drastic measure of self-defence.  If a psion is attacking you, and won't stop harassing you, why not make a &quot;super mirror shield&quot;.

			If you really feel that threatened, embed your mirror shield with the powerful suggestion that you are not to be attacked.

I'm not the most talented RVer, but I have had some significant luck with a few around here... (if anyone remembers practicing with me, I'd be happy for the reminder!) creating a camera-style construct that could gather all kinds of information and broadcast it back to me.
<br />

Keeps ya' safe from people abusing the link from the construct to lash out at you.

I've done something similar(ish) to this, my computer was running all stuttery like, so I made a large motherboard shaped chunk of psi that gathered energy from the PSU that tried to push the electricity around faster and also tried to stop any problems developing (my PC has a long history of annoying errors) though it hasn't completely stopped it, its been significantly faster since I 'installed' it. But my computer doesn't really need more cooling, got a case fan which keeps it down enough <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

hmmmm... I thought it would have screwed up your comp, what with all the electrical and magnetic current and that. I half expected it to be melted. There was actually a question somewhere on one of the seminars I read that went something like this:&quot;Can you use psi balls to charge a phone?&quot; Perhaps it is possible to effect electronical devices without screwing up micro chips etc. I would be too afriad to try that on my comp since i love it so much and I have loads of importna t stuff on which I couldn't risk losing. 
<br />
Try it on other appliances and see what happens.

			Well, most of my constructs seem to have an unconscious fail-safe built into them. Call it luck. Plus my computer is an old chunk of scrap metal anyway, only things worth saving on it are my documents. And psionics can definately affect electronics, I read somewhere (can't remember where exactly) that this girl's dad bought a huge wide-screen TV and it blew up when she was pissed off from a period. Though I shall have to try mucking up my toaster in the morning <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> (if I have enough energy at that point) And the thing about chargin a phone was funny, Peebs (I think) had no idea what he was on about, psychometry indeed!

			Quantum entangled energy well:

<br />
Place container of oil, herbs, etc somewhere with a high or useful energy level/content,
<br />

<br />
Put a bit of your hair, fingernail or blood into the container [glass bottle is ususally best]
<br />

<br />
There, now you can &quot;metaphsyically&quot; access the forcecode of that relic.
<br />

<br />
Where to set such a think up?
<br />

<br />
Try building a monolith or something, heheh.
<br />
Quartz cristles and tree stumps in the forest.
<br />
There is too big a list of natural energies to number.
<br />

Warning, even your handwriting can be used for distance effects.

Witches could cast a spell on someone at range just by having an object that the person used, wore, etc. Photographs and hair work best.

Sending energy and programming into a tachyon crystil is probably the most powerful psion construct I can imagine at this moment.
<br />

<br />
Online you can search for tachyon energy info.
<br />

Be careful! I've just spoke of something more powerful then many realize.
