			Yea, I know exactly what you mean.  I met a girl a year ago in a keyboarding class and KNEW I was going to be good friends with her.  I forgot about her completely for about a yearand was surprised to see that she was in the same lunch hour as me <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.  I was looking for someone new to hang out with at lunch.  Turns out she didn't remember me at all last year <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />, but we are becoming pretty good friends now.  Nothing unusual really, just something that kind of relates when you said that about your girlfriend.  Truthfully, I thought that too a year ago that she might end up being my girlfriends, on my side at least it seems that it is going that way, but I really don't want it to be like that because I have almost lost some very good friends that way.
<br />

<br />
About the clicking in and out of consciousness thing, a big YES <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.  I have learned to control it a lot too.  Sometimes it just happens, but for the most part I have played around enough to manipulate the feeling, which is how I got myself walking without any input.
<br />

<br />
About your thoughts, I have thought that too, nothing ruling out the possibility at all, well in my opinion.  Hell, the Matrix series was made for a reason <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.  That has boosted the thought process of it.  I sometimes. wonder would would happen if I all of a sudden I just &quot;woke up&quot; like you said.
<br />

<br />
I don't mean I KNOW how someone is, I just get an idea, I remember someone posted about being able to tell if someone is corrupted or not, but not if they acted on it, I don't remember who said that, but thats pretty much how I feel.
