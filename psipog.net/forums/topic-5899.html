And why would the bells go off?

			Well to purposely do it, I'd suggest some kind of DMILS. Maybe just move a lot of energy to your ears with the intent to help your hearing or magnify sound waves. You could probably screw something up badly like that though, so maybe you could do Remote Viewing only for sounds? When I did the listening to the piano thing, I just focused on the sound of it as I walked away and I could hear it a lot better than usual when I got far away.

			You're probably just so used to hearing the school bell, that you are hearing it even when you shouldn't be able to?
<br />
Possble to hear that far? It depends on how loud the sound is. Maybe the bell was loud enough, or, in my opinion, it is more likely you were just hearing things... and by that I mean hearing things that aren't actually there.

i get something like this sometimes. i'll be doing something random when a scent will suddenly materialise. a kind of sweet, musky scent. i have no idea what it is. i think i may have mild Synesthesia. (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaesthesia" target="_blank" class="postlink">Here</a>) but if that's the case for me. then i've yet to find the trigger for such a smell.

			At work it sometimes hard to hear the music because the machine I work at is so freaking noisy. Also they point the mircophone away from my seaction......don't know why. All I do is focus on it and I can hear the words. Just today the radio was switching from a talk show to music every few seconds (I'm still wondering why someone would do this for a whole hour straight, I have my doubts that its just the radio.) But when I focurs on the words enough I'm able to hear the words in my head when the music fades out. Sometimes I hear words I didnt even know to the song.

I have experienced something just like this. And I think you have the right technique as well. Well, one day I went into my brother's room and he was listening to music on his earphones and I talked to him. Then I was done talking so he put his music back on and I walked away concentrating on the song, because I like it. But then as I got farther away, I noticed that I could still hear it! And by that time I was all the way into my room...and he closes his door. It is very amazing and I think there is something to it.

			yeah i think thats it. your subconcious knew the bell rang and you inner clockwork knew the time so it just reminded you for some reason? I can see advanced hearing working too though. If you try and focus your energy on your ears like someones post said but then also focus on barrowing the energy from your other sences?

lol i have a story! its kinda similar
<br />

<br />
so sometimes i get so bored when im like sitting at the theater waiting for the movie to start or i'm sitting in the car on a long drive or whatever i start to think of a song i like and i kind of play it in my head. Even though its not perfect it pretty cool cuz i seem to only listen to the best parts and i skim over the other parts. I never do it on purpose though its just something i catch myself doing alot.

			Getting back to smells-
<br />

<br />
My uncle (who now has been diagnosed with cancer for the second time, very sad) smells a watermellon-flavored jolly rancher. You know what I'm talking about? Well, we figured out what it's linked to about the fifth time (we've counted 41 or so in total). PREGNANCY. Someone either in the family or close to it gets pregnant. He's smelled it for my mom, my aunts, my cousins, you name it.
