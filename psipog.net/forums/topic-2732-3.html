hey, you want me to scan an image of my drivers license for you? you want to act like you know everything, and yet you are apparntly quite blatantly incorrect. you cannot verify my experience to be unreal any more than you can verify my age. i was in the middle of working on proving my story, and i'm ready to show proof that i am the age i clame to be.
<br />

<br />
i do NOT like being called a liar. i do NOT lie other than maybe a couple small insignificant ones in every day life that everybody does. but i do not even do those little ones as often as most people either.
<br />

<br />

<br />
anyways, i believe lucid dreaming means a dream that you are awake in right? if it is then yah, there shouldnt be any reason you shouldnt be able to have one about games/tv shows. i normally dont realize i'm dreaming, i'm an overly cautious person, and my dreams are rather close to real life, so even if i am consious during the dream i never do anything to break the flow out of fear i might be awake.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I was referring to pretty much everyone in the thread, besides myself and Daniel.
<br />

<br />
I don't particularly care what your actual age is. It's the age you act that matters. This goes for everyone. The whole &quot;zomg I lucid dreamed into a video game&quot; thing is really f*cking lame. Sure, maybe an ordinary dream that you have no control over might be in a game. That's cool; lord knows I've had some really strange dreams; last week I had a dream, and when I woke up the only thing I remembered of it was a map of the ethnic groups of Chad (I checked later, it was partially correct). But a lucid dream? Find something better to do than live out your favorite cartoon. Or, if you want to live out your favorite cartoon, for goodness' sakes, don't tell anyone.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

So then what you're saying is you and Daniel are the only stuck up assholes with no imagination left to have fun with an ability that is, as I see it, used solely for the purpose of relaxation

			I had one last night in a diff world infact, it was like our world, but yet so diff, the sky was orange, i think it might have been a domesticated mars, in the dream a rocket peice fell down and it had a nuke on it, made a huge explosion, i luckily was far away enough from it not to get mutinized or killed or whatever, kool thing was i got to meet people in the dream  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> it was ultra realistic, as in i saw everything with my eyes. everything was shaded, it was 1st person and it wasnt like a cartoon or a 3d modeled animation, everything looked real

Now why the hell do we need to be preteen to play video games!!?? <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />  I've never heard of any age restrictions on video games before now. The ESRB video game ratings, &quot;Teen&quot; &quot;Mature&quot; and &quot;Adult Only&quot; somehow don't make any sense to me now that I've figured out that only 11 and 12 year olds can play video games  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> . So don't be a dumbass and tell us what to do in our own dreams, which are places to have fun and mess around.

			Hi,
<br />
  I also don't get the logic behind this 'stop playing video games' and 'stop watching cartoons' thing because it just doesn't make sense. I am 17 and I still LOVE Pokemon Anime and games. Pikaaachuuuu!!!
<br />

<br />
  Anyway, I used to have LDs since I was 8, I just didn't realize that that was what they were called and also didn't know to induce them. 
<br />

<br />
  One time, I was spiderman. I would try to make the web and it would be sort of too thin. So I was prone to falling down <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .
<br />
  Then I have been in Harry Potter world. I wasn't Harry, but I had a wand and all. The odd thing was that it took place at my school  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />   <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />  . In this one, the spells didn't seem to work very well. I shouted the spells till my throat was dry(at least it felt that way). And they worked only occasionally <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
  Another time I was with Pikachu <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> . Cool huh? . And once I dreamt that I had a beyblade ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyblade" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyblade</a> <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ) that I could control with my mind <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> . But most of these (except the Spiderman one) took place in places I have been to and not in fictional places. Cant think of any others now..
