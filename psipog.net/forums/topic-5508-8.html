I'm surprised nobody pointed this out yet.  Or, maybe someone has.  
<br />

<br />
I'm not going to give a huge speech about why I think PsiPog should stay open.  Why?  Because it won't matter.  Sean's made up his mind about this, and nothing anyone says can change that, no matter how much you wish you could.
<br />

<br />
I wish PsiPog would stay open, but it won't.
<br />

<br />
I wish Sean would hand it off to someone else, but he won't.
<br />

<br />
There are things in life that you just can't have.  Having PsiPog stay open is one of them.  
<br />

<br />
I respect Sean's decision to close the site, but I don't support it.
<br />

<br />
Best wishes with your new site, Peebrain.

Thanks.  I've already started meditation with a goal to OBE from it.  I hadn't considered hypnosis, but maybe I would have in the future.  My eventual goal is to OBE from a waking state.

It is, but Kobok isn't the only one.  The sharks smell blood in the water.  But really, it's not that bad because a lot of people who go to Psipog already visit several different psionics-based websites.

			Eh, I was wondering whether to follow, or to go to other communities..
<br />
I've reviewed a few communities by myself...but none have what psipog has had for me. This is why I'm following. Also, I'm not too shocked by seeing PsiPog leave, although it has served many goods, I always felt it was a bit too basic.

 Those expectations are unreasonable.  You act like it's easy for me to continue to maintain PsiPog.  Or that it's easy for me to pass it along to someone else.  You don't understand the things I do every day to maintain and make everything a smooth ride for everyone else.  You've just been enjoying the ride, oblivious to how much work I put in every day. </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Not all of us <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  I came here through Pavlina, a few months ago, and registered in the forums only recently (only when I thought it was worthy: when one of the exercises seemed to produce a physical effect). 
<br />

<br />
I am trying to host my own website, and if only in economical matters, I realize that Psipog has been an enormous effort for you. Which I thank you for. I also thank you for the internet abilities you had to use to keep it up, since I myself lack them. I also thank you for the time invested. I suppose you also got something in return from the visitors, but any way you look at it, YOU did the most of the work, and everyone else benefited.  That, most of us acknowledge, even the newbies who have problems feeling the &quot;tingling&quot; <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

If you're arguing about the forums, realize this: the forums have only been up since January of 2006!  The majority of PsiPog's time online has been WITHOUT forums!</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />
Certainly. I discovered the site months ago, but only registered months later, after having tried the Beginner's Handbook and a good part of the articles. I would NOT miss the forums, but the articles. Not for me, mind you, I can copy them. For whoever who could not be able to see the articles after me. But if no one pays your domain or bandwith costs, why should you keep them up? If you don't, it's your choice. If you do, it's a good thing.
<br />

<br />
People, don't be selfish. Don't take for granted that Sean should keep and maintain and cover the costs for the website, and failing to do so is wrong. He has NO duty towards anyone to keep the website, and doing so is RIGHT. Psipog was a present. If it comes, great, but no one has the obligation to give you presents. They are not forced to.
<br />
 
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Peebrain wrote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody"> When I was new to psionics - PsiPog wasn't around!  Imagine that!  I spent days tracking down to find one person who &quot;might&quot; have had an OBE.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />
Stupid me, and I only thought about the maintenance costs, in money and time. If it wasn't because you had done the investigation, I'd still be thinking that you had to be &quot;special&quot; to use psi. That you had to be &quot;born&quot; with it. Stupid me, I believe that art and dancing can be learned without &quot;having&quot; it inside, but I always believed that, to have psi powers, you had to be born with them. Without your Beginner's Handbook and Articles, I wouldn't have even considered the possibility of being able to use psi. I would have remained like a person with a blindfold who thinks that only &quot;gifted&quot; people can see. That I couldn't ever do so. 
<br />

<br />
I read some hints in the B's Handbook, but now I see how hard the investigation process must have been. I only know three people who have had psi experiences. One, an OBE. Only one, what could I learn from it? Was it even real? Wasn't it a bad dream? Two, telekinesis, one in a daring ouija session, one in a place where many murders had been commited. I thought there was something... But without Sean, I would never have believed that I could do the same things that Nina Kulagina. I, who believed &quot;practice is everything&quot;, wouldn't have dared to believe I was &quot;special&quot; enough for this.
<br />

<br />
So, I just came to the forums three days ago and they are closing. Pity for the techniques shown in the forums, but it's not the end of the world. I got the most important stuff: real info on HOW TO... From someone who looks logical, commonsensical, not biased towards any organized religion and who explains things in a way that you can believe them. The down-to-earth style of the Beginner's Handbook is what got me. I couldn't believe that a person was talking about psi without sounding like a whacko. I don't know how many wackhos or weird people or schizophrenical people or just deluded people Sean had to talk to to even remotely begin to realize how psi works. But I bet it was a lot and you could write a book with those experiences. So you should be thanking, and just asking the million dollar question:
<br />

<br />
-Are you going to keep the articles and Handbooks up?
<br />
-If not, will you tell us with time so we can make copies?
<br />
-Without altering the copies, do you mind if we share them?
<br />

<br />
The rest will take care of itself.
<br />

<br />
Good Luck with your next travel <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Peebs, I think its important to follow what you believe. I'm very glad you have decided to archive. Losing 80+ articles would be a shame. I will check out your new website, and see what the new you has to say.  Maybe I will find our spiritual ideas are similar, and maybe I wont, but I do wish you the best of luck in your journey. I know you'd say the same to me.
<br />

<br />
I'm not really that affraid of losing my friends in this community. If I need to talk to peebs, I know where I can find him. I&quot;m sure mannen and roy and such wont be that hard to spot either.  
<br />

<br />
I agree with Sean's statement about being too attached to a website.  I've been too concerned with just hanging out and psipog and getting &quot;points&quot; with people. So much so, that my own site has been neglected.  I think this has been a wonderful reality check for me.
<br />

<br />
Nobody has &quot;lost&quot; the community. They're just splitting up. If you're that concerned, get their AIM/Skype/New Website, and you can keep in touch. I know that's what I will be doing.
<br />

<br />
Peebs: I still hope you'll drop around PsiOnline every now and again. Its always nice to see you around.
<br />

Yes, the articles and handbooks will continue to stay online.  I wrote about this on the latest news entry, located here: <a href="home.php" target="_blank">http://psipog.net/home.php</a>
<br />

<br />
Each author maintains their own copyright.  I only have the authority to tell you what you can do with articles written by me.  You can read my requirements here:
<br />

<br />
<a href="../qna.html" target="_blank">qna.html?view=1&amp;viewid=1782</a>
<br />

<br />
The handbooks have different requirements, which are outlined on the first few pages of it, under the &quot;Document Information&quot; section.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your positive words, Natsufan.  It means a lot to see someone who hasn't become attatched to all of this.

			&quot;whats the meaning of moving a paper on a pin? whats the meaning of 
<br />
making energy balls?&quot;
<br />
nice questions.
<br />
i know a guy who once asked me why did i think about pk. what was it's 
<br />
real use.
<br />
i can't tell. we don't actually (at least most of us) NEED to grab something that is far away, like a glass, or turn the lights off without getting out of bed. we can just go and do it by physical means.
<br />
then he got all excited again and thanked me.
<br />

<br />
we don't need to read others minds, neither ping them. just give a call 
<br />

<br />
to their cell numbers.
<br />
what's the point of all of it, you ask.
<br />

<br />
you tell me.
<br />
tell me what's the point of getting up at fucking 6 in the morning, 
<br />

<br />
eating something and then spend your WHOLE day away from your family and the people you like to be in front of a desk screwing little things togheter? then you go back to your house, sleep until six and do it all over again. tell me what is the big deal.
<br />

<br />
yeah, you don't need to do pk, nor tp. nor rv. obe either.you won't die if you don't do it.
<br />

<br />
everybody can live their whole lives without moving a single paper with 
<br />
their minds. it's too much easier to move it with your hand. you don't need skill, neither working for it. just use your cold mechanical means, and eveybody is happy.
<br />

<br />
about closing psipog: i was shocked too when i read that. and i read sean's posts.
<br />

<br />
i got what you mean dude. it's just empty for you now, all this psipog 
<br />
stuff. for YOU, it has done it's job. now you know what you want (and i 
<br />
think it's VERY good, since most of us, humanity, don't know what we 
<br />
really seek), go on, and get it!
<br />

<br />
i kind of understand what you feel. in our lives, we need goals. it's like a game. if you finished it, it isn't interesting anymore. you got all you could think of. tp, obe, pk and so on. now you want something more. and it's ok for you do want it. but there is a problem, and you should take this into account: when you made this site, you made it for yourself alone, didn't you? it's ok. 
<br />

<br />
but more people started to join it, and we all in this site have kind 
<br />
of supported you and helped you in your goal of getting proof of psi.
<br />
this site isn't only yours anymore. it's ours too. we've joined it. 
<br />

<br />
we've made friends here. we've found a place where everybody respects each other and helps each other. we've became a big family, who live in the same land. imagine it like a castle. people moves in, and everybody lives togheter, works togheter, have fun togheter. 
<br />

<br />
you can't just walk into the main hall one day and say: you all ought to leave in the next six months. ill just blow this place up, as im not having fun here anymore, and will move to south.
<br />

<br />
we will all be homeless!
<br />

<br />
i respect what you think, all your ideas and everything else. in the 
<br />
begining, you could say this place was all yours; but from the moment 
<br />
you all of us involved, it's very selfish of you to close this place just because you want to.
<br />

<br />
as other members already said, i think passing the control of this site 
<br />
to a member would be the most reasonable measure to take.
<br />

<br />
you say psipog has alredy done it's job for you, and you are already finished with it, but it haven't fulfilled it's purpose for all of us yet. and for the people who will come. you can now pass it to somebody and forget about it, it's not your responsability anymore. you are finished with it, aren't you?
<br />

<br />
thanks for reading, and really, think about it.
