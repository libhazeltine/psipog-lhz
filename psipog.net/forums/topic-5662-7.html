No can do. Right now the edit feature isn't showing. Also, it would take away too much of my limited free time and I'd have to redo it in a unified form.

Those who did would probably read it while eating popcorn <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

P.S. I'm rather surprised you keep posting here. You almost seem to want to help me make it into a decent manga. If you thought it was so bad why didn't you just stop posting instead of giving me tips interlaced with critisizms? There must be some reason behind your actions.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">Although I'm very nasty to the people here, I do want to help make the community's ideas better.

You're right Tankdown. He's honest (and nasty <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />). I myself am honest, but I only say honest and potentially hurtful things when people ask for them directly. Niushirra is just the unrestrained honest type like my mom's fiance <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. He wouldn't even wait for you to ask him if he thinks you're this or that, he'd probably just blurt it out in a conversation. He mostly does this to somefatguy though <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />.

To me, you sound like you're still angry from that topic in skeptics you created a long time ago that was brutally shot down.
<br />
The one about us psions coming out to the world and exposing ourselves?

<br />
Well, whatever. I take my previous post back.

So, GWN, how is the story progressing? I'd like to hear more information before the forums get shut down.

Well, all I could discuss now is what abilities some of the characters would have and some of the major things that may happen. There isn't much to discuss now. If you want you can just ask me a specific question about it and I'll answer it. As for finishing it before the forums go down, it would take a while to get everything discussed with all the school work I've got on my plate *cough &quot;especially the research paper&quot;*. If the forums are almost closed and I'm not finished discussing this stuff I can simply exchange e-mail addresses with everyone who wants to hear more or we could just discuss it on peebrain's new website <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. (I prefer e-mail though)

			Everyone, I've just been informed of something very unfortunate. It turns out there is a manga that seems noticibly similar in story line and genre (by genre I mean involving psionic abilities, sorry for the wrong word choice). I'll go into more depth when I've got time. The similar manga is called X Hunter X. Any info./suggestions would be appreciated.

Um. I just got new info. about it. Nothing to worry about too much <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. Forget what I said. Also, I realize that this thread is probably going to die quite soon (no responses in days <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />) and I realize it is pointless for me to bother keeping it up. The last thing I have to say is this:

			Never mind, I've got at least this to post because I got carried away PMing it to someone and figured I may as well post it here; all the abilities and their uses I can think of for the story so far.

Well, you get the idea Yamamaya <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. I've probably got even more uses for TK, but I don't have that kind of time.
