I get this feeling in my hands to! I've been trying to move a pencil by using a method similar to chakra's before he posted it. I get a tingly feeling and some spasm. Does anyone know if this is a good thingy?

			Gloaming, that is natural and good/bad. All it means is that you haven't put full consciousness into the object. You're still remaining too much in your own physical awareness. Once you keep enough awareness in the object, it will be the object that has these spasms.

Take care,

			I always get a tingling/ magnetic feeling when doing TK.
<br />
I think its the energy, and I also think that means you are connected with the object.

			Yeah, its kind of a pulling feeling for me. Like my psi is being stretched around and out of my hands. The way i move things with it is i try to pool the energy in and around the object, and then manipulate the energy, not the onject. It takes some time, but it generally works.

			I feel that too. When i try to move a pecil and put my hand close to it, i feel a magnetic pushing. Like the energie is pushing between my hands and the pencil. A bit like when you try to hold 2 magnets with the wrong side together, they push eachother away. I also have that feeling when making a psiball. I think it's the energie.

			like you I also felt that feeling in my hands, I notice it takes place when I spin or altleast try to spin the psi wheel, my guess is it's psi-energy traveling through your hands and fingers.

So perhaps you are right <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
