			well really.  If you think about it, if someone really wants to psychically attack someone, they could.  It isnt that hard to think of ways to use telepathy or tk or something to hurt someone.  By hiding techniques that can be made up within a few seconds, it is just pointless.  Also, if someone wanted to find something about combat, there are a few sites that are JUST about combat.  I dont think it would hurt or help.

Peebs has absolute control over everything that goes on on this site but that doesnt mean we cant see eachother's views about it.  Just because we all know it wont happen doesnt mean that we should all believe that way and drop it.  We just want to see eachother's views.

			You are correct in that you can discuss it but there is no logical end to the dicussion. All your points where already covered and shot down by Peebs when we had this same conversation in chat. Since there are other sites that are less strict just go there and cease trying to bring it up here as it has no point.

No, it's not pointless.

If we did post combat techniques, then it would ATTRACT visitors who want to use combat.  Right now, those visitors are NOT attracted to psipog because of the policy.  Therefore, from your perspective of the community, everyone seems nice and you think it wouldn't be a problem.  However, if we started posting combat information, it would attract a different crowd of people to psipog.
<br />

<br />
I do not want to attract those people.

Those other sites dont attract creepy people.  UPC and psionic dojo post combat articles and they dont attract bad people.  I think that psipog should have the same as psionline, the combat prevention section but it, again, has to be heavily moderated.  I dunno.

			Yeah, Peebrain I <span style="font-style: italic">definately</span> respect your reasoning, plus you might get caught up in some legal thing about alleged psionic attacks via your site.

Excuse me for offending anyone, Innerfire, but Apollo's right - people should be able to state their opinion even if it is &quot;pointless.&quot; Analyzing things is what drives progress, and no one is forcing you to input anything, so you shouldn't have to deign to posting here if you feel it's truly meaningless, and let the &quot;fools&quot; babble mindlessly.

I am sorry but he is not, Peebs has laid down his judgement in this post and made it obvious that he is not going to change his mind. Also what you guys don't know is I have heard that there are a lot of backstory events behind this decision, between those two points there is an extremely minute chance that Peebs would ever change his mind. Why bother dicussing an issue when the decision has already been made? If you want something like this on another site bring the topic up there.

IF we taught combat, people would get attacked.  This included people that particular psions don't like.  This includes people that make others angry on the chat/forums.  Psionics is dangerous enough without giving people weapons.

AGAIN, we are stating our opinions.  Do you see us trying to make Peebs start it?  no.  Just because people tell us something is never going to happen, doesnt mean that we cant talk about our opinions.

That is similar to what i said earlier ^^.  I do agree with that.
