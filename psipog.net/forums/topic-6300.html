That's the whole reason why I like them, they are very skeptical so if you just go around believing that this and that is a ghost people might not like it. 
<br />
The reason they head out is to actually disprove there being ghosts in a certain location. But they have found enough evidence to make me believe in ghosts or whatever you want to call them.

Indeed, it is the &quot;TAPS&quot; one. I believe that their way of investigating the paranormal is one of the best ways. But I think they should get some more cameras.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

What the fuck are you talking about? The British guy always gets possessed, fuck, half of the shit that happens on the show is repetitive. You can probably make a drinking game out of it.
<br />

<br />
Jinx, they don't judge things by personal experience, plus, some events you've said, they've judged to be haunted. Don't over exaggerate the facts.

well i think the british guy is full of crap cuz when the blonde chick asks him questions that he should know (the possesor) he never answers. he just growles or something
<br />

<br />
the specific episode i'm thinking of is one i saw a long time ago when they went into a prison/jail/whatever and the warden had possesed this guy and when the blonde girl asked him to speak in latin or something the guy just growled and when he asked were he had stashed the bodies or something he just churned his head.
<br />

<br />
what i'm saying is that as much as you wanna believe creepy noise's and movements just dont convince anyone. yeah i think thats the point of the show, to try and convince people of this stuff (and to make cash) its not like they're doing it for laughs. i do think he's a very good medium though. as far as acuracy with his visions and stuff. he just tried adding spiritual rent-a-body to his resume and its not going to well

I've been watching them since Episode Uno, and I still think some of their best evidence that made it to TV was from season one- Frank in the Armory and the Eastern State Penitentary videos.

If you want to check them out, go to:
<br />

<br />

<br />
The have all sorts of cool stuff there, and I'm a long-time member of their forums. The vids I mentioned and more are available for download, as I'm sure some of the stuff tonight is- ALL FOR FREE. 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, TAPS investigating Leap Castle lacked a certain feel because Steve wasn't there- he has a HUGE fear of flying and heights. He got on the plane, but when the doors started to close... he freaked out and had to get off. He tried, but couldn't do it.

it's not so amazing when you have a similar fear of that power.
<br />

<br />
My fear is a bit different than his, but mine is just as powerful. 
<br />

<br />
I absolutely... POSITIVELY... can't ride a schoolbus. Plain and simple, I can't. I used to, then in 3rd grade there was a bad, bad accident. Rolled bus, some bad injuries... couple of deaths.
<br />

<br />
So the only way I got to and from school from then on was my mom. Fortunately, my mom works at school so it didn't cause a problem.
<br />

<br />
Once you get a fear like that, then you'll understand.

Anyway, TAPS investigating Leap Castle lacked a certain feel because Steve wasn't there- he has a HUGE fear of flying and heights. He got on the plane, but when the doors started to close... he freaked out and had to get off. He tried, but couldn't do it.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Oh, thank you for providing that link. 
<br />
And yes, it would of been better if Steve was there. It's amazing that his fear was so powerful.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

it's not so amazing when you have a similar fear of that power.
<br />

<br />
My fear is a bit different than his, but mine is just as powerful.

I absolutely... POSITIVELY... can't ride a schoolbus. Plain and simple, I can't. I used to, then in 3rd grade there was a bad, bad accident. Rolled bus, some bad injuries... couple of deaths.
<br />

<br />
So the only way I got to and from school from then on was my mom. Fortunately, my mom works at school so it didn't cause a problem.

Once you get a fear like that, then you'll understand.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Fear is only an illusion my friend.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

If it wasn't, then how do so many overcome their fears?
