			Since the recent arguements in other parts of the forum, I am creating this topic for the exclusive use of deciding wether PK is real or fake.  Notice it is in the skepticism forum.  Mainly, argue here instead of in the psychokinesis forum.
<br />

<br />
I, myself, know it is real but you all know that.
<br />

<br />
This is a follow-up topic for those who were argueing in the following topics:

That is my main arguement.  That, and how can i move things as big as i can right now?  Heat?  Think im fake?  go to my blog and look at the articles <span style="font-weight: bold">I</span> have written.  Read the comments.  Here are a few examples:

This article helps me a lot.Great job.

Wow! What an excellent article! I am new at tk, and have been trying to find a technique that would work for me, and I think I found it! Thanks so much, and congrats on the site!
<br />

<br />

<br />
Anonymous said...
<br />
woo! i can spin it faster...
<br />

<br />

<br />
Now, if i was fake, could i write an article that <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">helps</span></span> others?  If i was fake, why would i waste my time writting articles, writting posts (here and in other forums), and taking my time responding to an average of 300 emails a day?  THAT is my arguement as far as i am not fake.
<br />

<br />
As for is PK real?  Read everyone elses posts.  I am to tired to type them out.

Yeah that is what solidified my beliefs in TK, despite the fact that i can move things.  And i never understood the argument about how just because I happen to be 16 in a month, that it  makes me delusional and stupid??  I'm an A student in ALL honors, GPA is 3.56,going to taking college courses (even though i'm goingot be a junior) in psychology at and &quot;accredited&quot; college.  But the fact that i make pens wiggle, bam i'm stupid have no credibility and possibly crazy because i'm obviously seeing things that aren't real!!!

bull shit!!

			*claps hands* Well said Rahmid. Well said. Couldn't have put it better myself.
<br />
P.S. Sorry bout putting the topic in the wrong bit! I didn't see the other one and didn't really know how big and expanded the tpic would get. lol.
<br />
And also, Apollo I think has probably one of the strongets arguements so far. Why on earth would we sit here making articles and websites. There literally thousands of sites on psi and the like, why would they <span style="font-weight: bold">ALL</span> be fake??? Surely there's not that many people in a single group determaned to play the biggest prank ever on the net. How sad would you have to be...

			guys look, everyones truth is different. its ALL a matter pof perspective anyway. is it real? what do you feel? what do you feel when you do tk, or when someone who doesn't yet move an object attempt it. it's indescribable. we are tapping into this amazing force. your own personal experience will tell you so. kief, don't believe it, be so skeptical you shit green, but give it an honest try for a week, it will change you, i promise.

			Ok, fine I'll continue my 'discussion' (although it was more of an argument) here.
<br />

<br />
PK is like history class. If you have no idea what you're teaching, nobody's going to learn. And yet people learn.
<br />

<br />
And they spread it on.
<br />

<br />
I have yet to see Kief make the video he so threateningly dared to make. Bet ya he's not going to do it.

Who's the highly intelligent man who gave you that idea <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />? Although I used history class in a more detailed example, it gets the point across.
<br />

<br />
If anyone would like to debate PK, I will be more than happy to participate. I understand that Kief has quite an open opinion on this matter. I'm sure others do as well. If you would like to debate this matter, then please state your point of view and I'll respond.

Take care.
