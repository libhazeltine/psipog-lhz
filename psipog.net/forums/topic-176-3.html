Personally, i wouldn't trust a russian even if he/she pays me. And yes, it may be kinda mean, but if you're forced to see about 4000-5000 russians every day, most of them commiting crimes, you kinda lose trust. And don't come talking to me about not everyone being bad, they all have the same manner of thinking and they are all criminals in my eyes.

Back to the topic at hand: Eyeless sight is kinda cool, i've walked around outside with my eyes closed and i could see most obstacles in my way. Ofcourse, i could sense some too, but that is another subject.

			I don't really care that they charge an absurdly high rate or that people don't seem to trust Russians; I can do this, and it can be learned. There's no reason to doubt that these people can see without their eyes, at least to some extent. High rates are charged for many things that invlove great benefit, like school, for example. It's not like you need to go there anyway.

			Hey Sky, I've taken a look around, and I haven't been able to find the link you speak of. Think you could post it here, just to make it easier on unobservant people like me?
