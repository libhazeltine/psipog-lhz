			i dont know how that happen and still hard for me to believe and i know alot of you will not believe it .
<br />

<br />
i was in wc and i made the pick up oil fan work for no bad smell <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> then i look at stick and i tryed to move it with tk , i concentrate on it alot and make tension to my mind and i tryed to blurred my vision to move that stick but instead the carpet under my legs moved i saw the far end of the carpet fly and i look under my legs not fly because my legs were on it then i moved my legs away from it then it all fly for 1 second and when i saw it i said omg wtf!!!( &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; with arabic <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />) then it go down on the floor .
<br />

<br />
yea i know that the fan was pick up the air and the door was closed so the air from down of the door was coming in in strong because of the fan but that strong air cant make the carpet fly and that did not happened before too, and i go out from wc and see if anyone open doors or windows so strong wind come in so it helpped that carpet fly but i go out and nothing were opened and asked my mother did you open the door outside or window she told me no. 
<br />

<br />
any questions you want to ask me i will answer it and by the way it fly about 10 cm or something like that .
<br />

<br />
i know it is hard to believe . weeeeeeeee i cant believe that <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .

			You made a rug levitate about 4 inches above the ground with you standing on it?  What did the rug surface feel like?
<br />

<br />
I must say it was a bit hard to puzzle through that post, but I'm pretty sure you rushed to the computer to type it out when you were excited.  Right?

			yea i was exicted and bad english too <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> . but when it fly i was not standing on it while it fly , i mean i was stand on end of its ends so the far end of me fly so i look under my legs and find that i stand on it the other end so i moved my legs away from it and whole the carpet fly for 1 second.
<br />

<br />
the surface of the carpet was rough.
<br />

<br />
other way i can say by it : if we say the carpet have 2 ends ,  end called end 1 and end called end 2 .   so i stand on end 2 and i saw end 1 fly so i moved my legs away from end 2 and from the carpet itself to make all the carpet fly . <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			thats pretty wierd but cool at trhe same time.  You must be pretty good if you can levetate a carpet w/out wanting to.  see if it works again if you purposly want the carpet to levetate.  what were you thinking about when you concentrated on the pencil moving?

			I think I see what you are saying.  You were standing on one side of the rug, and the other side lifted around 4 inches.  I thought you were saying that the entire rug lifted up with you standing on it, which is why I was asking how the surface felt (like was is squishy, or was it rock solid like it felt like the floor was under it)
<br />

<br />
Anyway have fun with that and stuff.

			i want to tell earnest about that but he banned me <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> because every time i try to post my questions it reach to him with more then its half removed so i think he though that im spamming his forum or something. that is my thought . 
<br />

<br />
other thought i think he want to banned me so when my post go to him he remove some of my questions to be like piece of shit then post it in the forum . 
<br />

<br />
but i read something that i dont remember , he said you copy past your questions but i dont remamber what he said but that is true i copy my questions that i wrote in my text then i past it in the post.
<br />

<br />
if he know what i done he will go mad <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> because he told me to dont use negative energy and stop tension that i use <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> . because as he said using negative energy lead to death and postive energy lead to the way of life .
<br />

<br />
anyway soon i will change my ip <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> and go in the furom or my brother will come tomorrow and show me that programme that make fack ip <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />. but truly i did not mean to spam his furom , something wrong there .
<br />

<br />

<br />
i tryed to lavetate it again but i could not , maybe i need to try again and watch myself carefully to know how it happen . all i got from watching myself was the tension that i created in my mind and blurring my vision and concentrated much but that was on the stick not on the carpet lol .
