Well well well, isn't this the pot calling the kettle black!  If Psipog was closing down because of its users, you'd be the first one to inspire Psipog's demise, Theorist.  You have an almost zero knowledge base of anything psionic, you constantly compare psionics to the animes you watch, you give horrible advice that is unfounded and doesn't have a shred of credible evidence to justify giving it, and your spelling and grammar is absolutely horrible.  I pity the community that you decide to latch onto and suck the life out of after Psipog is gone, but alas, I have no control over that.
<br />

<br />
If Psipog were to close down because of the lack of intelligence of some of its users, then it would have done so a long time ago.

			Funny thing is, Theorist, you <span style="font-weight: bold">still</span> have yet to present any credible evidence. All you've done is call me a retard. Scientists, or at least the more intelligent and mature ones, don't do that. And they normally use proper grammar and punctuation. Maybe you should consider doing that, it goes a long way in making you look more intelligent, and it has the added advantage of allowing people to better understand your sentences...
<br />

<br />
Funny how that works, eh? Maybe the stuff you learn in school is meant to be remembered and used in the real world...

I agree with you, an unprogrammed psi ball, in theory, shouldn't hurt someone. However, there's still a lot we don't know about psionics and the brain, so it's wise to use caution anyway.
<br />
Additionally, there's the fact that a lot of people feel psi in different ways... Some feel it as heat energy, others feel it as electricity. Maybe this is just how their nerves interpret it, or maybe they inadvertently (or intentionally) programmed them to generate heat or release electricity. In this case, such a psi ball shoved into the head would indeed have adverse effects, as outlined in one of my longer posts on this thread.
<br />

<br />
I agree that there's less danger posed by an unprogrammed psi ball... But there's no way to say for sure that there is no danger posed at all; it's not a formal science yet, and it's kind of hard to observe with the instruments we have right now. One thing's for sure, though: Any electrical change in the brain could be disastrous, and we know that some psi balls do in fact generate electricity, or at least generate the feeling of electricity. Electricity disrupts brain waves, no matter where it came from, and if an electric psi ball were shoved into a brain, it'd be pretty bad.
<br />

<br />
So thanks for the post, Nightshade. I found it quite polite, gramatically correct, and overall logically sound. Good job <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  Fight the powers of stupidity with me!</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Thank you.  I was trying to imply that different people feel energy differently than others, maybe I didn't impose it enough  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  
<br />

<br />
My main argument against the &quot;harms&quot; of psiballs being pushed in your face, is that the psi energy is already flowing throughout (sp) and around your entire body-including your face...If this energy did carry a painful tone at all, we should already feel it.  But, like both of you said, we still don't know everything about psionics yet, so it isn't safe to be completely one-sided with any aspect of psionics, in my opinion.  I guess some research would be handy, and when I get some time (maybe tommorow night), I might conduct it.  If either of you are doing research, which I believe you said you were, I would appreciate any findings to be posted.  I think this whole thing, as well as psionics all together, is very interesting, and I would like to keep posted.  Thanks  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
