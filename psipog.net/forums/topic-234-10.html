Make you own little construct creatures! For example, I've made a little monkey thing that sort of dangles on my shoulder and bites me, then I got Vladimir to scan it. It was fun, and we were thinking about making more creatures that are more advanced, but it was a fun and cool idea, and lets you be really creative. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> You could make creatures that look like whatever you want, and that do whatever you want. I eventually killed mine because it was hurting my neck lol.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

			Batworz: It's not difficult to make a construct that bites you. Making it sentient would be the difficult/impossible part. Wouldn't bother really.
<br />

<br />
Of course it wouldn't be physically biting you, telepathically suggesting that you feel biting is more likely, or simply having it bite through you to create a tingling sensation. having said that, if you were good at PK you could probably have it physically bite you.

			1.how bout a shield that becomes more dense and stronger when applied with force or something harmful from an attacker... and of course only you can dissipate it.. 
<br />
2. a construct that can be used to preserve energy so when there's a black out only your room, house, or wherever will have lights.. already tried this and it works..
<br />
3.a construct that can convert hot air inside your room into cold.. or cold to hot..
<br />
4.construct that can kill flies?? a safe pest killer..

			Hi,
<br />
  I have found a good way to make constructs and easy too. You see, I have satellite TV (the one with a 60cm dish,works on KU band <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ) at home. The signal gets disrupted when there is rain. What I do is make a construct with a connection to the earth, with a sort of a diode attached to it <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> so that energy flows only from earth to construct and not the other way <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> . So this construct will make a clear path for the signal till above the clouds. I have tried it many times and it worked. 
<br />

<br />
  I found that it needs some motivation. If I am not very interested in watching the programme currently running, it may not work. But if the loss of signal was during a programme I really LOVE , I go mad...really...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> and I think the emotion makes it more powerful. I usually get good response in some 20 seconds. 
<br />

<br />
  Cool huh? I also make a 'thinking cap' -style construct. Basically it covers the entire head other than face. This one also features a 'wire' to the earth with a 'diode' in it to get energy when needed.
<br />

<br />
  I used it before my recent exams. Basically I program it to get the questions for the exam in the next day  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> and make the answers for them fixed very clearly in my memory. I do study of course... .I am waiting for the results now... Will see... But the exams were relatively more easy than usual... dunno if it was due to 'thinking cap' . One thing the cap really helped with is waking up. I am a late riser (need 10-12 hours sleep <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ). Last day, I programmed it to make me wake up at 6 AM and I woke up, fully refreshed, at the exact time!! 
<br />

<br />
  I am thinking of improving this 'cap' further as it is very helpful.
<br />

<br />
Thomas

			One time, when I had just been practicing psionics for like 2 weeks, I was hitting tennis balls into my garage door and when I hit them wrong, they'd fly onto the roof and roll into the gutter. Well of course, I got fairly frustrated, so I made a construct to keep them out of the gutter. It was like this little round shield over the gutter. It worked great, but I felt kind of drained every time a tennis ball bounced into the gutter and my construct repelled it. And that was the most useful construct I've ever made.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  Although I still haven't tried to make one to tell me I'm dreaming, that would be the best.

			I'm not sure if it would work, but how about a construct that constantly scans you all night, receives your dreams, and stores them, so that when you wake up, you can review what you dreamed at will?

That's quite a good idea. I should try that.

These little annoying ones would be so cool to use in school. I have a few people that I would attach these to.
