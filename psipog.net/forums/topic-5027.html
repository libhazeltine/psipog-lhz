			Alrighty, hello! This is my first post, and I'm VERY new to all this telepathy stuff, and I must admit I'm a bit skeptical about the whole thing! (Sorry <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />) I have thought of a clever little way for y'all to maybe demonstrate some of your &quot;powers&quot; (is that what its called??) for me. If I get enough positive feedback, maybe I'll continue on with this!
<br />

<br />
The Challenge!
<br />
- Locate the general whereabouts of the TV in my room (ex. high on a shelf, next to a dresser, etc. stuff like that)
<br />
OR
<br />
- Describe the TV in my a room a little bit to me (size, type, etc.)
<br />

<br />
Now, if someone were able to accurately do one of those (or possibly both!) I'd be really convinced about this stuff. If you are anxious about the possiblity of you being wrong, I definitely wouldn't mind if you just PMed me instead of posting here. Thanks!! I hope to learn more and better understand this stuff!

			An old TV, the kind with the antennas. Your TV is an a cabinet or a shelf or something, though I see it more likely being a cabinet. Your dresser is possibly to the left of your TV and you have a mirror over your dresser. Do you have a fan hanging over your bed as well? And what color is your room painted, is it like a light blue? I'm getting mixed with your name but it's either a D like Darren or Derek, A like Alex or Adrian, and this one is pretty random but John.
<br />

<br />
I'm new to this, let me know if I'm right. Whitesnake is right though, this forum is for people who need help finding things and such, not simple minded proof.

   Stop trolling or you'll face consequences. This is not unreasonable. Do NOT post messages like this anymore. Understood?
<br />

<br />
   What someone does with their own free time is up to them. Some RVers might like this and do it for fun. Maybe as a challenge, warm up, or PRACTICE.
<br />

<br />
   Believing something without proof is stupid. That's the kind of blind faith that starts wars and gets people killed. If you believe in this stuff without proof you're just being stupid. And you're wrong about skeptics. Enough proof is enough to change most people.
<br />

<br />
   All but one of the trash messages were deleted. Carry on.
