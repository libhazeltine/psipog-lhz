If you want to make sure you made a psiball, ask someone to put their hand between yours. And if they can feel the same presure, warmth or electricity etc. as you, you made a psiball. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I've been able to make them pretty easily for a while now (under a minute) and i find it easier to start by placing your hands about an inch apart  and moving them as if you're rolling up a chunk of silly putty in your hands. Just visualize rolling up some psi, then when you can feel it (the pressure, magnetic feel, heat, any of them) then you can stop rolling up the psi and just keep adding energy to your ball  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Well stumbling upon this site late at night has been a true eye-opener for me. In an early age (10-14), I have had what I thought to be simple nightmares, or vivid dreams. 
<br />

<br />
One of my early experiences was as this: I woke up at around 5am. The sun was rising so I could see most of my surroundings in the dim light. I went to the bathroom where I.. peed.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Once I was done I held my arms out straight in front of me.  I felt as if I was holding a ball which I would describe as beeing basketball-sized. I didn't see it but in my half-asleep mind, it was light grey and had millions of small particles appearing and dissapearing. As I opened the door (holding the 'ball' in one hand while doing so), I felt as if it was bigger. My mind wasn't able to comprehend this, and I was slightly overwhelmed by this feeling, and my tiredness.
<br />

<br />
I carried the now bigger ball roughly about the size of a tire, but shaped as a sphere, through the living room. I started going up the stairs that lead to the second floor, where my bedroom is situated, and the ball got bigger again.
<br />
The ball was now the size of those big rubber balls that gymnasts and others use for training.
<br />
Now remember, I was only a kid at this time, and the world of psionics was unknown to me.
<br />
The ball seemed to have become heavier in accordance with its size, and my arms started hurting, as I slowly walked up the stairs.
<br />

<br />
At this point I started crying.
<br />

<br />
Once the tears rolled down my chin, my mind sort of 'woke up' from the state I had been in, and I let go of the 'ball' which dissapeared as quickly as it had appeared in the bathroom.
<br />
I dismissed the strange occurence and thought of it as a very vivid dream, untill this night, when I found this site.
<br />
I am almost positive that this was a real psi-ball.
<br />

<br />
What do the more experienced psionic-users think?
<br />

I don't know much about this yet, but looking at earlier posts, it seems you need to shell the construct first. Add a layer to the outside of your cube and harden it untill you are able to feel it.

Make sure you're really feeling a tingle. Often it can be confused with the warmth of your body radiating from your hands. Remember that a lot of blood vessels gather at your hands and make them warmer than your arm. Keep trying. The most important thing to remember, is visualizing it in your mind and believing it to be there, because with will and determination comes great results.

			Hi i'm new to all this stuff. Yesterday i read a lot about psi balls and their creation. I decided trying to create one. I relaxed and tried to feel psi in my ab's. I could'nt feel it but i tried to imagine it moving up to my chest and from there to my hands and out of them. I did this a few times and then, when i tried to put my hands closer there was like some magnetism which pushed my hands so it didnt let them go closer too easy. I'm not sure if this was just my mind playing tricks on me(i hope not  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ) or if i created a psiball. In any case it wasn't visible.
<br />
Do you think i created one?
<br />
Thank you
<br />

<br />
Ps: Sorry for my english i'm from spain^^
<br />
Bye

			I've been trying with psi balls for a while now... At first all I could do was generate a little bit of heat between my hands, nothing special there seeing how my hands generate heat anyway. I then tried some more visualiztions and other techniques, and now I am getting a fairly good tingling on the surface of both my palms (even when I'm only making it with one hand, sometimes), kind of like when your leg falls asleep but not quite painful.
<br />

<br />
I can't ever feel the magnetic part of it, and for some reason my left hand seems to be a whole lot more sensitive than my right to any feelings related to psi. When I try to put it elsewhere, I can't say that I feel it at all.
<br />

<br />
So... did I make one? If so, what do I need to work on?

			I read the Psion's Handbook, as gratefully provided to us by Peebrain, and I used the method of harnessing energy by visualizing the blue ball of energy in my abs, and it worked better than my other tries.
<br />

<br />
#1. When I visualized the ball, my abs started going totally ape-shit. Flexing, then relaxing. The book says that examples of what happened was warmth, coldness, pressure, tingly feelings. Would you consider my uncontrollable flexing a sign of success?
<br />

<br />
#2. After i &quot;pooled the psi&quot;, I visualized it travelling through my stomach, into my hands, and through I felt no pull or push, I didn feel warmth, but that might have been because my hands were palm facing palm, producing heat.
<br />

<br />
What do you think?

			Last night when i was trying to make a psiball, (still practicing) i finally got the first part to work! (gathering psi in abs) so i tried to make it, one step after another.
<br />

<br />
1. Felling the moon shine down psi on my abs.
<br />

<br />
2. make the psi move around in my abdomen.
<br />

<br />
3.Move it up to the chest.
<br />

<br />
Then when i finally sucseeded to &quot;feel&quot; the psi going out to my arms, my arms suddenly feels like they have fallen asleep. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  
<br />
I could still feel things with my arms but they still felt like they was asleep!
<br />

<br />
So i wonder.... was it psi? Or what was it something els?
