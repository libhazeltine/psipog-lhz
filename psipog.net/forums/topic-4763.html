<br />
Tekken is the rightful owner of this photo.
<br />
There is an extremely long story behind this photo, here is the short version, during a TP practice, we, Tekken, PazarX, Vedran, and myself decided to all make a psi ball together, the first one we made was succesful, and HOT!, well we decided to try again with the joy of our initial success, the second one we made we decided to make cold, I was the last to receive the second psiball and I was also able to see it, unfourtunately I did not have a camera handy, so I sent the psiball to Tekken, only one in our group with a camera, he took the picture and yada yada, and here is the picture.

			Johnny, I thought that when you edited the images it left a &quot;finger print&quot; where you could check the image details and see what kind of layers or whatever where applied to it? Not sure, that's what I thought was up <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />...
<br />

If not, they should <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.

			Hmm, Paint Shop Pro (photoshop alternative) says it hasn't been modified.

Checked the coding, too, but I don't think JPEG's leave fingerprints that way anyway.

			IF you look hard enough you can see two dots.
<br />

<br />
One of them is located 3-4 inches above the top right portion of the line.
<br />

<br />
The second dot which is blue and somewhat harder to see is located 4-5 inces to the left of the end of the line and down. Still though, these things are always hard to &quot;Tell&quot;.

			Ok. Since there does seem to be a debate on the validity of this picture. I'll tell you guys the long version of the story. 
<br />

<br />
Ok. Our group, Age, PazarX, Vedran, and myself were in #projection, we were just messing around, trying a game that PazarX wanted to try that none of us had done before. The game was pretty cool, it worked for all of us, our first ball that we sent to each other was hot, like hot enough you didn't want to hold it on yourself. This was all cool, but no offense to Vedran, he's a sensitive as a rock, so we decided we should try and get him to be more sensitive so we were throwing things at him, stuff like that. After a while I said that on AIM one of my friends should be getting on soon [he never did, lol], and that we should send a really cold ball to him and I would try and get his reaction, so we made the ball and passed it around. It finally got to Age. He had thrown something at my face earlier, so I was slightly annoyed with him, so I threw the psiball has hard as I could, I told him this before I did so. He put up a shield for himself. Anyways, I chuck this ball that is very cold directly at Age's face. It hits his shield and somehow becomes visable. We aren't really paying attention to it at this time. We thought it was some fluke with the shield or something, but after it was still visible for about 10 minutes, we figured we had something. I had the only camera in the group so as I got my room to complete darkness, or near enough not to see my hands infront of me. I snapped a picture. I really didn't have enough time to edit it, one I didn't have an editor at that time, I do now to so I could see if it was fake AFTER I sent it to peebs. Two the time between my taking of picture and posting the picture on the internet was very fast, too quickly to have even opened and uploaded a picture on my computer. Approx. 1 minute 45 seconds. I have a horrible computer <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Also, now that I have an editor, I'll try and recreate this hair theory you guys seem to be using.

			Ok. I've tried to just take a picture of a single hair, in good resolution, like in the photo. Yeah. With my camera, I can't do that. 6.1 megapixels aren't enough to see a single human hair very clearly like it is shown up there. 
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c80/monkers7/Hairedit.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"> Here </a> is my BEST picture of a hair. It's the small small brown blur on the white part. Now trying to find a single brown human hair in complete darkness and then edit it to a greenish yellow. I would be very very impressed if someone could do that.

Just because you cant reproduce the effect, doesnt mean its not a hair.
