			I managed to get very relaxed, mostly in the legs, and was just kind of lying there waiting for any sensations.
<br />

<br />
I think I may have dozed off, and I had a dream in which everything in my room was exaggerated (television was much bigger, also lower than normal) and felt like someone was by my bed and pulling at me. I tried to get a look at whatever was by my bed, and it was a real struggle to keep my eyes open and push the blanket out of the way so I can get a clear view, to find nothing.
<br />

<br />
At that point, I began rolling over, but couldn't go over the edge or roll back onto bed. I figure this was just in the dream. Then, the dream and atmosphere of fear were over and I'm not sure what happens between this and the next part.
<br />

<br />
My legs began to twitch very rapidly, and lifting themselves in the air. It felt very real and I sincerely believed that I was standing on my head near the end. Then, I woke up and I was unsure if that really happened or not.
<br />

<br />
Edit:
<br />
The leg twitches were kind of like climbing along a wall while lying down, but the wall curved above at the perfect distance from me so that they could just continue running along it. Very odd.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Do you think this might have been an almost successful OBE or just a weird dream?

You pushed the blanket while your was in your dream/obe? (I dont think you can move objects)
<br />

<br />
And I think from what I read your legs twiching by be from being tense?

Heh, I've have my experiences with sleep paralysis. Wasn't very twitchy.
<br />

<br />
As for the possession, though it didn't feel like I was in control of the leg movements, I'm not religious and it's not really my nature to take such a simple answer.
<br />

<br />
I'm going to dismiss this as a crazy dream, since I didn't get my usual signs such as vibrations and images of lightning striking.

			No you see, you've experienced SP what? once or twice? They're many kinds of SP, and that sounds like SP. I've twitched in my SP, I've moved around in my SP.
