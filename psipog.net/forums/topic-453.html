			There?s an interesting topic in the psi ball section titled ?do your parents know?? in which many people have posted there parents reaction after they found out they practiced psionics.  Any way, this got me thinking about what I would do in regards to my children (hopefully they wont exist for quite a few years yet) and psionics.  I think that I would teach them what I knew about psionics as early as possible and let them make up their own minds about it.
<br />

<br />
What do you think you will do in regards to your future children and psionics and why?  Or if you already have children, what have you already done in regards to your children and psionics?

			I'd teach it to them while they're still young because it seems that small children learn things faster and are more open to them than teenagers. And when they're teenagers they might think you're just becoming crazy(or them) because their friends would probably say that it's all fake.

Younger children are also less suceptible to other people infulencing their thoughts, but they are more responsive to their parents.
<br />
If I ever have children, I'll try to teach then as soon as they can understand.

Now, to combat the problem of attention span...haha...

			I personally (if i have ever have those annoying brats people call children) would teach them after they can controll there emotions. after all, would not want them to try and send a &quot;focebubble spike&quot; though everyone they dont like(i would brobobly still have to figure out some way to keep track of thire psi use at school or wherever) but, thats my plan.

			If I have kids, I'd let them know at an early stage. When you're younger, it's so much easier to pick up these skills, and you'll be more open to it... not to mention... things like these at this age in life seem incredibly more awesome.

			The most important thing you'd have to teach your kids though, is never to use it against another person unless they really (really really really, XD) mean to hurt you - or else the kid would start doing bad things with it...and attacking people for not getting their way, etc.
<br />

<br />
But instilling children with a sense of morality and ethics is kinda what you gotta do to a child anyway <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> You just gotta reinforce the fact of not hurting others with psi. (unless they mean to kill you, etc)

			If you did teach you kids psi, would you tell them to hide it from ?normal? people?  I mean can you imagine going to pick your child up from play group to find that the teachers been traumatised coz your kids been using PK to make toys fly around the room, or something along those lines.

force it upon them? how is that forceing?  unless you beat them with sticks untill they learn, it's more of introducing them to it, if they don't like then they don't need to learn.

<br />
but... you need, as a parent, a balance...
<br />
there are a lot of things that, when you are teached, you discard as &quot;useless&quot;, like maths or maybe literature, but that's why there are teachers and parents in this world, they are people that have been through a lot of things before us, and have their experience to know when a skill or knowledge will be usefull for you, in your life...
<br />
how can a 10 years old boy distinguish between usefull and useless knowledge? i repeat: that's why parents exist!

			If you think it's forcing then I'm sure you will never send them to a school will you? I learn stuff in school too which doesn't interest me... I think that some things are useless... But I have to learn these things because it's the law  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />   I don't really think it's forcing... Are you forcing a child when you teach them to ride a bicycle or to speak? Not really so I don't think it's forcing when you learn them about PK and such, but you shouldn't force them to practise it...
