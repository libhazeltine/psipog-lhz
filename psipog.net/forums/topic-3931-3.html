I like watching him, good entertainment, but not the real thing in my opinion. You want to really levitate? Work your ass off in psionics or be trained in hypnosis. You want to look like you levitate? Go to wikipedia or that magic site one of the people have and learn king's rising(that's my favorite levillusion*), that's pretty good, or try Aliun, but that'll cost ya about $1500.

Notice when he cut himself in half they didn't show his cross sections of his lower and upper halves...

Too many of these threads...also if you can't spell his name right please don't bother making threads about him <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> .

			I can't 100% prove this argument one way or another, so since there is a chance that he is a psion (even if it is a small percentage), I'm going to keep that in mind and just flow with it.
<br />

<br />
I understand that you all respond with your opinoins in good faith (and I understand that the trend here is to believe that he is JUST an illusionist and magician), but because of what I do and what a lot of you do I feel like we are being somewhat hypocritical. 
<br />

<br />
My zoo professor was talking about this in class. He said that science can never 100% absolutely possitively prove theories. I understand that we believe that when you drop a ball it will fall down to the ground, but he still says that no one will ever be able to prove this 100%. Here's the catch, since he can't prove it 100% sure, then the percentage must be around 99.999999%. So what happened to the 0.000000001%? = Psionics. It's what we do. We change the quantum mechanical equation to where that 0.000000001% happens. 
<br />

<br />
I know this isn't a very good argument for my point, but through personal experience and development, I have learned that one should just stay open-minded even if actual proof is given, because in the end it can't be proven 100%.

			wait, so every billionth time a ball is dropped, it will hover?  I disagree.  I think you either mis-understood your professor or he mis-spoke.  I garrentee to you that gravity works 100% of the time.

I think a lot of people have a misconception of what the scientific theory is.  It's not about proving theories, it's about <span style="font-style: italic">disproving</span> theories.  A good scientist will construct a hypothesis surrounding an experiment and then will test that theory until it is disproven (or fails to be).  If at any moment that hypothetical ball did hover upon being dropped, then the theory of gravity would have to be scrapped and a new one would take its place until that is disproven.  Ergo, there is always the possibility that one day gravity may very well fail us as we know it.  
<br />

<br />
People don't like not having absolutes to go by so it's easy to think of science as the only way to knowledge.  But on the contrary - it's much better off at pointing out what we <span style="font-style: italic">don't</span> know.

			since im a dye hard fan of charmed i was on a forum for it and someone mensioned how some of the powers they used are real. (thats one of the reasons why i love it so much even though they exagerate it emensly) i said blah blah psionics blah blah and then someone else said something about psionic and refered to criss angel. I looked him up and saw him levitating on a couple pictures. to be honest i lost interest after seeing it because it seemed kinda cheesy. his sir emoness went around showing off this so called amazing gift and said he was using psionics. if this is the way psionics is going to be reveiled to the world then i wouldnt be a proud practicioner as i am now  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

I don't know, if I could make a fortune doing psionics I might just go for it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

About Criss himself, well, it seems too good to be real.  The only thing that keeps me on the fence is that I find it hard to believe that they have found so many extras to act surprised every time he does an act.  But perhaps they have.

			Chriss Angel is a magician, he has already said he was a magician, he has already shown how many of his tricks are done, there is nothing supernatural about it, to think the man has special abilities after he has already shown the entire world that he doesn't is just stupid. He's a good magician and thats all, it's just that simple.
