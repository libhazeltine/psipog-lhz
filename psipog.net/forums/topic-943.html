			Many people seem to think they are being attacked by a psion or some spirit. If you think you are being harmed/harassed/attacked, first ask your self this:
<br />

<br />
For a psion:
<br />
<ul>
<br />
-Who could you have ticked off? Do you even know any psions?
<br />
-Do you even know anyone who would be strong enough to hurt you or even make you feel uncomfortable (especially if you have a shield)?
<br />
-Why would they be trying to harm you? 
<br />
-Ever consider that they may have better things to do other than sitting there trying to harm you? 
<br />
-If you were them (the person you think is attacking you), would you attack you? Wouldn't you think it would be a waste of time to try to hurt someone who you don't even know and have no way of telling if you succeded?
<br />
</ul>
<br />

<br />
For a spirit:
<br />
<ul>
<br />
-Have you previously even believed in spirits/enitys/ghosts/(insert name here)?
<br />
-Could it hurt you?
<br />
-Why would it want to harm you?
<br />
 </ul>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: normal">Finally, could it be a physical ailment or just your imagination?</span> Unless someone said they were going to attack you, just go see a doctor/psychologist. If the &quot;attacks&quot; persist then post on the forums. I might be able to belive you if you had a unique circumstance or could tell who it was that was attacking them but most people say they can't think of anyone they might have ticked off and they describe thier symptons as a headache or stomachache.
<br />

<br />
P.S. I didn't know where to post this so i put it here.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: I edited this post to clear up some confusions about its topic. The point of this post was to say that I am skeptical that someone would try to hurt another person for no reason (although there are a few exceptions) and that, most of the time what someone precieves as an &quot;attack&quot; (notice the quotations) is a psychological or physical ailment. I am sorry if anyone precieved this post in the wrong way, and thanks to SheepKing and all the other mods for unlocking this.

I do know someone who was attacked by spirits... he and his freind were at a party or something and they were the only psions and they could sense the spirits... they found out it was some sort of spirit hotspot and well... lets just say it wasnt good, the spirits werent that nice...

Originally I had locked this thread but now I think it's more or less OK, as it forces you to consider the following question:

&quot;Am I just paranoid?&quot;

Please take into consideration what has been stated in the first post.

			Well, his second statement was an &quot;EDIT&quot; statement so at that point in time he decided to change his mind to unlock it if he locked it in the first place and if unlocking it is possible. But you get my point. (and yes he didn't right EDIT which is why you didn't know) And if you did know then I am sorry and please don't insult me by saying &quot;Duh!&quot; Because it would hurt my fat feelings and fat people feel more than skinny people.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />

			Well personaly many people have &quot;Attempted&quot; to attack me using &quot;Psionics&quot; as well as &quot;Hack me&quot; using the &quot;Internet&quot;. No psion or hacker has ever had any effect on me or my computer, it gets boring after a while.

			This proves my point. Unless there are a lot of crazy psions with lots of time to do pointless things(which there aren't), there is a very low chance you are, have been or will be harassed. Therefore it is probably either nothing or it is some psychological problem.
