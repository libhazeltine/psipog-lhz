In What the Bleep do we Know, in the part with the basketball course, the kid throws the basketball, the lady says &quot;that hurt&quot;, and the kid says &quot;it never touched you.&quot; It goes on to explain that two objects never touch each other, and that they repel like magnets, always leaving atleast an atom-wide space between them.

Anyway, What the Bleep do we Know isn't a good source for &quot;accurate&quot; material, that is why I said my information is not infallible.

			I took Rainsongs advice for stupid people. If you wish to phase, just repeat vivid visualisations of yourself phasing while in a trance, it took me a couple of goes, but once you've got a feel for it, then your set to go.

			Despite Raingsong's warning, i'm still going to try this as well. But first, i think im going to attempt it in a lucid dream. See how it SHOULD go, so if i mess up somehow, it wont end up painful. It might help my expectations of pain too, hopefully.

			I don't think A Lucid Dream might help seeing as how anything can happen. Let's say you start thinking about 'you can actually go through walls and stuff'. You're really gonna go through it.
<br />

<br />
What I'm saying is, in a Lucid Dream, what you want to happen, will happen, whether you're new to it or not. If I wanted to go through walls and decided to lucid dream about it, then I WILL go through the wall because I WANT to, while in real life, I have a chance of NOT going through the wall.

			That may be true, but in my lucid dream, since i wont be able to feel it, and i wont <span style="font-style: italic">want</span> to feel it, it wont hurt, right?
<br />

<br />
Well, thats exactly what I'm going for. Hopefully, it wont hurt when, or if i phase, because i dont want it, or expect it to hurt.

			I think its because the general theory right now is you use PK to effect your molecules so that they can pass through other matter. The whole quantum mechanics thing where if you crash a car against a wall for an infinite period of time, eventually it will go through.

			I once had a dream of phasing- but that was a long time ago.

Could it be possible to intertwine your molecules to create something such as the metal guy from X-Men (can't think of his name). It cannot be a simple replacement, otherwise you wouldn't be able to breathe. It would, in theory, make your skin tougher and maybe even impenatrable.

			I'm aware of the probability, I'm just saying that was the best theory I'd seen, and the reason for it going under PK. I still don't know how phasing works, and somehow I doubt that theory is correct. Has anybody heard of anything more likely?

			I've phased a few times and they hurt me badly (not the phasing though  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ) Just the landing, I normally phase in my sleep... I have fell through my bed and the floor a couple of times and it only hurts when you land on the floor in the room underneath <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> . My worst fear is falling through the floor... forever and getting stuck  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />  I've got stuck in the wall before but it didn't hurt, my initial subconscious reaction was probably for all my atoms to push the other atoms aside... and I got back out <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  (I think) But it does'nt hurt. It just takes some visualising!

			I've never been stuck while phasing, something just stops me from getting stuck. Like if i lose my concentration, while half way through a piece of wood,  my hand just shoots out the other side, remember...2 Objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time.
