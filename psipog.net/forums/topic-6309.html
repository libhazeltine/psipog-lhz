			Not to sound mean or anything, but Criss Angel doesn't actually do anything psionic. He's a stage magician. Some of the other members could probably point you to a site that explains how he does what he does.
<br />

<br />
However, this does not by any means prove that psionics is fake. Just because you can use a parlor trick to do something doesn't mean that's the only way it can be done.

			I find this ironic. Most of the psionics folks find him fake. I don't think this would convince skepticals if it can't even convince folks that practice psionics.

There's this thing called using actual sentences, and capitalizing the first word of each one.  If you really want someone to take you seriously, have some self respect and take some time to type.

I'm not going to say that what he does is real or not but i will say that he is one of my hero's. seeing him do the things he does is amazing, and the things he has says are very inspiring to me.  such as, &quot;nothing is impossibles&quot; &quot;world of illusion&quot;.  I now believe that anything is possible, and that this life is not really life at all. life starts when we die.  He was my gateway into knowing my true self/potential.  even if what he does is a hoax does not make a difference to me because he made me realize that nothing is really as it appears.  Theses are just my personal believes.

He admits, on his website, that he is a magician. He admits that none of what he does is real.
