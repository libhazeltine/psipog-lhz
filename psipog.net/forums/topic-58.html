			I can't make psiballs or anything, half the time i can't even pool any psi in my abs. I've asked around and it's been suggested to me that i should try working on my concentration, so, does anyone have any ideas that i can try to work on that? maybe there's some technique you can share that you use?

			Here's a litte technique which seems to work for me.
<br />

<br />
Concentrate only on your breathing. Hear it. This helps build focus which can then be directed to whatever you want, in this case making a Psi Ball.

			Y'know, I read once that the human attention span is about 3-4 seconds. That means that you cannot concentrate more than five seconds on making a psiball without something stupid popping up if you are the average human.
<br />

<br />
Ever ask yourself, &quot;Why the hell is meditation so boring?&quot;
<br />
The entire point to meditation is to manifest willpower, to expand your attention span, so that you have a stronger intent when you try things. I read that if you get 1 thought to last for 28 seconds, non interruptions, then you break a mental barrier, and from a a buddhists point of view (I think) reach a stage of enlightenment. And if you get a 68 second thought, anything is possible.
<br />
(Y'know, I've always wondered what enlightenment was, and thought that maybe the buddhists that do put themselves through that mental torture and reach enlightenment simply contrast their humble lifestyle with their painful meditation so much that it is blissful to live without such intense concentration... But that's just me, don't go ruining your dreams because of what I just said.)

			Ha ha... The second I tried to get past 4 seconds, random images kept popping up because I tried to get past 4 seconds. If you don't think about thinking for past 4 seconds while thinking about it, that stuff wont happen, but that's the hardest thing ever.

			hi friends,
<br />

<br />
     the key here is not doing but undoing, not removing the thoughts but to let them go away..
<br />

<br />
     in addition to the above mentioned breathing exercise, just follow this -
<br />

<br />
1 just breath normally and relax.
<br />
2 just act like you are watching a movie, and watch your own thoughts..
<br />
3 slowly close your eyes and &quot;SEE&quot; how you breath.. . by &quot;SEE&quot; i mean just observe the inhale and exhale motion... you will see it will tend to slow down and balance a bit.. and you will see your mind reducing the number of thoughts .. and eventually calm...
<br />

<br />
thaz all you have to do to ... .<img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  if still you dont get it .. read peebrains guide for beginners.... that will surley help.. you all on the psipog.net
<br />

<br />
regards

			Well I be giving my standard psiball speech.
<br />

<br />
A) The best way to improve your concentration is to continue practicing, even  if aren't succesful initially you're building on stuff, even something as sparse as a once a week practice should eventually crack it.
<br />
B) Don't consider energy to be a problem, in this case even someone with below average energy generation can successfully do this technique.
<br />
C) Read up on tactile visualization on Psipog, sometimes it works better for people to use that, or sometimes it works better to use a combination of both
<br />
D) Since you're having trouble always try to practice under &quot;optimal conditions&quot;, good sleep, not depressed, not starving.
<br />
E) Don't sweat it, you'll get it eventually if you keep trying. It doesn't even mean you're a bad psion, it took me a while because I had some wierd issues and energy manipulation isn't my main strength.

			a technique I use if I can't concentrate long enough is, rather than thinking of some random thing subconciously, I force myself to visualize the act a different way. I.E. I start to make a Psiball, I imagine a red ball (trying to make a hot one), when I feel my concentration slip I would switch to an orange ball, then a ball made of fire, etc etc....I don't know, it works for me  :3

			So you basically get a bunch of visualizations for your goal, and you switch when you have trouble concentrating?
