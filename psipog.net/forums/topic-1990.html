			hiya. Here's my situation: At random times during the day, I will get this odd feeling in my stomach and it feels I stop breathing regularly (whitch is only partially true, not completly) and I have to execute deep sighs to breath. The reason I put this topic in techniques is because maybe someone can give me a &quot;technique&quot; to prevent this. I have also recently gone to my doctor, and he says im healthy and it is probably stress-related. Only problem with that is that this thing will happen during times I am not stressed at all, like during vacation, or something. Not to say it doesnt happen in school...
<br />

<br />
Anyone who can maybe give me some advice on what I should do would be greatly appriciated. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			well i dont know if my example will help you much.
<br />
In meditations sometimes where at the last stage i must lie down and close my eyes i feel so good, so relaxed and so many different feelings comes to me that i dont breathe long time...
<br />
Or if someone is keeping his hands on me where i want to keep em ( sometimes on stomach, on heart center.... ) i dont breathe so long.. it was said by the person who was giving his hands on me that i didnt breather longer than 1min and sometimes much more.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> i think im on nice stage of relax...

			Hello superninja,

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody"> 2.

I think it's best that you tell your guardian about your situation. I'm sure your guardian will make the appropriate decision based on the your symptoms. I'll have to lock this thread due to the nature of the question. It would be smart to ask a doctor what he or she thinks rather than people that do not have the necessary knowledge to give that sort of advice (Including myself). 
<br />

<br />
Take care.
