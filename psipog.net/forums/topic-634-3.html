i am saying, that if you want to say something is impossible, give a reason. it is poor ediquit to just say 'you cant do it because you cant' a solid reason is needed to back anything up.

i'm not taking a side because i dont know everything on the topic, but i do know that solid reasons are necissary to make a point and not shouting.

			correct,it doesnt mean you cant do it you may be able too, but not now perhaps in future generations you'll be able too or somebody will find a method to do it...i dont mind practicing as long as i had a single idea of how to practice...i

 feel its what happens with most people, you think its just jump and voila, your floating there must be a rational way to induce it , i will reasearch on it and practice with some methods i might come up with, meanwhile i think there is no point on makinga  thread like this because no one has ever been succeseful with it its just a point of &quot;is it possible?&quot;
<br />

<br />
as a final note: make some methods, practice them if your succeseful congratulations.

no, but then again saying 'it has never been done' is quite a better way to make an argument than 'it will never be done' 
<br />

<br />
^_^; they made that mistake with reaching the moon, and the incandessant light bulb, and look what happened.
<br />

<br />
at any rate, your point gets putt across better when you make the correct arguments. closeminded arguments just start aggression and stubornity, which isnt neccisary when talking about experiments.

i'll keep practicing cause i belive there is a way to do it...space godzilla is HUGE and he can float *here i am basing myself on tv stuff* but so you wont say that i watch to much TV after all is a monster not a human...back on topic keep practicing &quot;let go&quot; of the ground completly ignore it see this gravity was discovered when some guy droped an apple, well make the shield do the opposite with your body</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Nope, two things:
<br />

<br />
1) Shields/Constructs cannot do what you yourself cannot, so you would still have to be a master in tk to pull this off
<br />
2) Learn how energy consumption fits into things, really, shields and constructs would be actually a very bad way to do this because you'd drain out all the energy in the shield before you got close to levitation.
<br />

<br />
I've said it before and I shall say it again
<br />

<br />
Is levitation *theoretically* possible? Yes
<br />
Unfortunetly, the amount of skill and energy makes it so insanely difficult that it is currently out of most of our reach to do it.
<br />
I did a little physics math with it in another thread, you know how moving a pencil is considered advanced?
<br />
It takes around 1500 times the force of that just to lift a person, then you have to maintain that force for as long as you want to stay airborne.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

This is the THIRD time I've had to quote this since people don't feel like reading, if you're asking for reasons frigging read the first two pages of the post.

			Since it seems people on this thread are just running around in circles, I think I should throw my hat into the ring and offer a new way of thinking. InnerFire wrote that it takes 1500 times the force to lift a human than it does to lift a pencil,  meaning if you go from lifting a pencil to trying to lift a person or yourself, you're likely to have a blood vessel pop. I sort of think of pk as a muscle (theoretically, not physically). You have to start small and work your way up. I'm pretty sure people like Rainsong and NI didn't start moving trashcans and canoes their first day of pk training. 
<br />

<br />
If you start with pencils, then go to something a little heavier, and then a little heavier after that until you can lift a considerable weight, why shouldn't you eventually be able to lift a person?

			It is unsure, as it is proven there is a certain point where humans cannot sustain a certain muscle mass (it was brought up in a talk with experts as to wether someone could ever attain the physique of the hulk), in keeping with your analogy. 1500x is a lot to cover, and that is for around a 150-160 llb human,  for us more built males it would take more. I'm not one to give up but you have to respect a glaringly large number like that.

			Okay, good point. Give me a valid argument for something like this, and it's no problem. I just hate it when people say there's no way it could happen and just sit there criticising everyone else for believing it. I believe that people have to keep an open mind when dealing with psi, because a) we're dealing with a (partially) unknown substance b) just because it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it won't happen in the future, and finally c) if someone really believes that ithey can't do something with psi, then it will never work for them.

			If people have gone from moving psi-wheels to canoes, trashcans and even couches, I don't see why it would be impossible to learn to levitate yourself. I understand that, if it is possible, it would be extremely difficult to learn... but remember, most people would probably say the same thing about PK in general.

			ok im gonna post another idea of mine, ok i think you can nullify the weight of the object like suppose you have a pensil, it has its normal weight but when you hold it and move it around the weight doesnt matter any longer because this weigt is nullified as you hold it, not because you have enough strenght to hold it but simply because the weight is nullified
<br />

<br />
i'll give you another exemple when your in the water you usally are able to float if you swim because you become nearly weithless, the whales are gigantic but they move so well in the water, its because no matter how big you are the weight is always nullified,
<br />

<br />
instead of trying to figure out how much energy you need in order to move a pensil try to figure out how much energy you need to nullify its weight so you can move it easyer,the same applyes to us, intead of focusing energy to go with our weight or our size you simply use this energy to nullify all of this weight size everything
<br />

<br />
feel free to flame me or to correct anything that might be wrong

			oh man, let's do a FBD!  (Free body diagram, of forces acting on a body)
<br />

<br />
Pencil:
<br />
.  ^
<br />
.  |    Normal force, reaction force produced by your hand on the pencil
<br />
. |=|
<br />
.   |    Weight force pulling the pencil down (gravity*mass)
<br />
.  ^
<br />

<br />

<br />
Fish:
<br />
.   ^
<br />
.   |    Bouancy force produced by sacks containing oxygen within the fish
<br />
. |=|
<br />
.   |    Weight force pulling the fish down (gravity*mass)
<br />
.   ^
<br />

<br />
both of these objects are in &quot;static equilibrium&quot; (they are not moving, or are moving at constant velocity).  The &quot;weight&quot; (m*g, remember?) is being &quot;nuetralized&quot; by another force.  In order to levitate an object, you MUST produce continuous force AT LEAST equal to the object's weight.
<br />

<br />
taking the pencil example, it IS your strength that sustains it (otherwise we could hold a car in the same method).  taking the whale example, it works on the same principle as the fish.  When you are in the water, you must &quot;tread water&quot; or apply bouancy principles to stay elevated, or you WILL sink.  You are not weightless, there is merely a natural bouancy tendecy of water that is producing an upward force on you.
<br />

<br />
This is basic physics.
