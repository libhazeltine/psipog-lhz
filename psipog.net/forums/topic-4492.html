			Hi guys,
<br />
today I was searching the Internet and suddenly I found a PDF file on this website with a basic introduction to Psi etc. Because I like stuff like this, I started to read and of course tried the first part. And I really felt a warm feeling above my bellybutton - even after only a few minutes of training.
<br />

<br />
Happy about my new experiences I searched this site and found the following picture: <a href="media/ni-telekinesis-000.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink">Click here</a>
<br />

<br />
For a newbie like me, it seems to be impossible to do things like that. And I actually thought that this isn't possible anyway.
<br />

<br />
So, my question is: Is the above picture a fake or is that really possible? I mean has anybody of you ever tried this and can say that it is possible?
<br />

<br />
Thanks in advance,
<br />

<br />
Sebastian.
<br />

<br />
PS: I will of course practise Psi, because it's fun to me and I believe in it.

This picture has been the centre of lots of attention, 'is it fake, or is it real' has to be the most common one. The answer is, if you believe that people can do these things, especially if you can yourself, then you would probably believe that it is real, if youre totally against anything like this existing, then you'll think its probably fake, you have to make up your own mind. It doesnt matter if the picture is real or fake, what matters is that if people see this photo, they instantly think, 'omfg, im totally gonna learn psionics so i can do that in the future', if you believe it is fake, you are by all means entitled to your opinion, i personally think that the picture is genuine, if you would like to see some video footage of real feats of Telekinesis, then go to <a href="http://www.psipog.net" target="_blank" class="postlink">www.psipog.net</a>, click on the media section, and view some videos, or troll around the forums, there are so many videos of Pk and Tk on here its hard to imagine why anyone would make up Tk, and why so many people would believe in it.

			Looks fake to me. The hand position is kind've typical when you want to add drama. I've levitated cards before (as in magic, not real), if you have the right angle then you can fool anybody, I put a toothpick under the card to hold it up and know one knew how it was done. The image was too convincing for them. So if NI knows about this &quot;so convincing&quot; factor then he could probably do it. But NI just doesn't seem the person to do that.

It is hard, isn't it? I mean, how can one move objects with the mind, and so little that is known about it? I think the saying &quot;seeing is believing&quot; holds some truth here. I didn't truly believe until I actually had experiences that I could not deem coincidence or air currents or heat and such. You just have to try and see for yourself.

Ah I see my error.  The link is in the Telepathy and Empathy forum, but the topic is here in the Psychokinesis forum.  I got to it via the link, which is why I got confused.  Back on topic, I have a question on this: if that is a true picture of NI levitating a penknife, why does everybody on this forum say levitation is impossible? <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Anyways, levitation is possible. Those who say it's not are just further away from doing it. I think they mean personal levitation anyway which would take quite a lot of energy but with enough practice and enough will force and belief I don't see why it's impossible.
