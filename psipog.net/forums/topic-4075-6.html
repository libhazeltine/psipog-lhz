<br />
Your sub-c, i believe, controls the amount of melanin depending upon what you want your eyes to change to, so you dont have to know the amount of melanin you need, just what you want your eyes changed to.

I know my eye colors change a lot of their own, from amber to green and one time, to yellow. Yellow is weird. o_O

			i did this on accedent, i really wanted to dye my hair darker, but my parants wouldnt let me, but i guess i kinda did that but not relly thinking about it (i know it sounds weird but i cant describe it) but my hair thats growing in is really dark, like i have light-brown hair with relly dark roots its kinda odd, id assume that since hair isnt alive when its grown out only alive at the roots that youll have to let new hair grown in to change that color

			He did say it would take about a month. I, for one, have only been at it for about four nights. Although I am noticing, the outer rim of my iris tends to get really dark after I practice, and it's a pretty defined line. Sign? I have no clue. But I take it as encouragement, since the longer and better I focus, the darker and wider the band is. I'm makin' progress!

			yeah guys it takes quite a while. at least it did for me. but jsut remmember even if you don't see the color tell yourself you see it. and it'll happen faster. it's like that one TK trick i learned. when your stuck and can't seem to get it to move just tell your subconcious &quot;ohh did you see that, i saw that little twitch, i told you we could do it&quot; and things like that. it takes a lot of belif and then it'll come <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			ok, I do not mean to come off rude so dont take it as an attack or anything.
<br />

<br />
1. I am a strong believer that DMILS (or &quot;Biokinesis&quot;) is fluff/fake due to the known fact that our eye color is in our genes.  To change that, it would take a long time altering our genes and then, good luck with that.
<br />

<br />
2. A lot of peoples' eye colors change with different lighting, different environment, and (of course) alergies.
<br />

<br />
3.  In the pictures that you took, the reflection changed in your eye (symbolizes that environment/lighting changed), your irises got smaller (hence different lighting), and nothing else changed.  As peebrain said in <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?p=42073#42073" target="_blank" class="postlink">THIS POST</a>, his eyes change color naturally.  I think that is all that is going on here.
<br />

<br />
Again, i am a firm believer that DMILS is fake

You're aware that the term was coined in a research laboratory to define a phenomenon they had observed?
<br />

<br />
DMILS itself is not &quot;fake.&quot; This is not DMILS, and this is most certainly some kind of fluff. DMILS involves techniques like healing, cellular level changes, and occasionally genetic level changes (in the form of healing cancers, for example, where it is a sudden mutation that is causing the disease).
