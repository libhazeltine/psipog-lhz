			There seems to be a little secret war going on here between skeptics and anti-skeptics. It's not big enough to cause a problem but it's there. I just have to say what I think on the whole issue. I think both groups are insanely stupid or don't know what they're talking about. First of all the only way to prove this to yourself is to use another person. Sorry but feeling your psiballs is no proof at all. You need to show off come TK or practice some TP. Anyways, on to the point. The anti-skeptics: your arguement is totally blown up. Nothing is more probable then something amazing and the norm is more probable then a change. If you don't give us proof and try to give us a reason why then you, first, sound like you can't do it; and secondly sound like you don't actually care at all and just want to fight. If you say you can do these abilities you better back it up if someone demands proof. Now, the skeptics, you guys are less worse then the anti-skeptics but seriously, just go out and try it yourself if you don't believe it. Stop saying it dosen't exist and demand proof, go prove it. Now if you tried and it didn't work and you want help or proof. You should get some help or proof. Anyways, on to the real point. I wanna make a third group of people. I wanna get people who can actually do these things and want to get out of there lonely little house and show some people. You think you're like doing something special sitting alone like lifting shoes or telepathically communicating; well, you're not. If you don't spread the word you're just an oasis of good stuff. It's like this, if an animal gets a new adaption that is amazing and then it gets hit by a car it can never reproduce and thus the adaptation dosen't matter. To stop this from happening I wanna get some people who say they wanna be revealers and actually show the world. I would be one to but I cannot find a good telepathy partner and that is the skill I would like to perfect.

			I can't speak for everyone, but I think the popular stance among psions here is &quot;I don't really care if you believe me or not.&quot;

So long as we keep to ourselves, skeptics have no right to barge in here and demand proof. We don't go around to skeptic sites claiming psi is real, so why should they come here claiming it isn't?

Revealers will be attacked by the press and the media. And in no way, good. They'll claim alot of shit against you, so I reccomend watching out.

			Revealers should be attacked! They have nothing to fear though. As long as their proof is foolproof. You gotta be good first. Right now I am just recruiting new people and becoming better, covertly. There are huge flaws in letting yourself be known without backing it up. I have heard the arguement I don't care who knows or not; that's bad too. It means you wanna keep this little treasure locked up to die. I see can finally answer the ultimate question: why dosen't everybody know about psionics if it's out in the open on the internet like this and in our government? It's because of the anti-skeptics who are afraid to send it. Since I am not good all I can do now is try to get revealers and recruit.

			If I'd someday manage to use psionics I wouldn't want to be show it off, no matter if someone offered fame and money, or for any other reason. I wouldn't want asking me to levitate a pencil everyday at school, or having people call me a freak, a madman or god knows what else. 
<br />

<br />
But I do think that everything that is today called supernatural (or unnatural) will be more accepted in the future. Everything from magic and psionics to ghosts and, well ... most of that, at least.

			You get insulted more when you don't know how to handle people.
<br />

<br />
Shift attention away from your &quot;powers&quot; (I use the term loosely here), and point out that it's likely the insulter is jealous (I love doing this whenever someone points out <span style="font-weight: bold">anything</span> bad about me. &quot;You suck!&quot; &quot;No, you're just jealous because you're not as cool as me, and you're trying to divert attention from that fact.&quot;). Then, come up with a reason as to why it doesn't make you a freak (one reason is that anyone can do it if they try), and then point out some of their flaws. When they pick up their jaw from the floor after you tell them off, walk away and say something like &quot;owned.&quot; And if that doesn't work, just tell them to f**k off.
<br />

<br />
Also, if they keep wanting you to move things, tell them to get their lazy ass to Psipog and learn how to move it themselves.

			The problem is everybody is afraid to speak out, to do something. Some people have to be the ones to spread the word. Become not the person behind the powers, become the shower of the powers. Make people focus on what it is and not you. If you can't back yourself up then you have to just reveal the truth to people you think can handle it. I have only made one mistake with that method and the person has almost forgot about what I told her. Revealers have to not be involved with the media. They just have to be people walking around everyday showing people these things. With foolproof proof. Kinda like street magicians except without the pay and more magic. Once you spread it to the initial few they can spread that, unknowing of the consequences, to more people. Everybody wants to tell some one when they first find out; my friend told me and that was one of his worst mistakes. Then instead of you being called crazy they are called crazy but the word is spread, that's all that matters. It will be less of a shock when a revealer shows a told person. Also these people who have met a revealer may become psions and then become revealers themselves.

underground movements realy scare some people, combine that with what they see as magic and you could easily end up with the witch trials all over again

I personally recommend trying to RELATE to the person.  I find that 95% of people that I talk to believe in psychic abilities... they just label it differently.  For example, I use this line a lot of the time: &quot;Do you ever meet someone and just get a vibe off of them?  Like you get a gut feeling?&quot; - &quot;Yes&quot; - &quot;Well, I believe that the accuracy of your vibe is a skill just like any other skill.  It's something you can practice and get better at.  That's all.&quot; - &quot;Oh, that makes sense.&quot;

Most people have experienced some psionic occurence and are open to the fact that they might exist. Maybe if you keep it less serious and more like fun and games they will practice for longer. I have seen that the people I tell don't keep up with psionics. I'll have to do some tests using this method to see the effectiveness.
