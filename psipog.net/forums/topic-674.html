I have discovered something unique and interesting about our Psionic abilities, something that will dwarf other discoveries; Some thing so powerful that in the next 90 days you will say &quot;Holy Cow&quot;, &quot;Holy Quacamole&quot;, &quot;Wow&quot;.
<br />
When you impliment this key component into your Psi training your friends will say &quot;You make speedy Gonzales look like regular Gonzales.&quot;
<br />

<br />
How I came about this discovery you ask? Well, it was either divine intervention, strange coincidence, or just dumb luck. And I'm going to tell you again, this will increase your skills over the course of the next 90 days.  You're probably asking now; &quot;What the hell are you talking about Sheep?&quot;, or &quot;Just tell me!&quot;, or &quot;He's freakin' kidding me.&quot; (if your question is not stated here, please send me an email)
<br />

<br />
Well, I'm not joking. Something serious is going on here that we've only begun to grasp. Some see relation ships to Psi in many things in our world; Of course in the &quot;fantasy&quot; realm of our books/video games. Others see, or attempt to see, relationships to Psionics in our bodies, our biology. In our relationship to a &quot;god&quot; or deity, or just another &quot;energy&quot; that equalizes the universe. Let me tell you; What I have found has NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. In fact, I will have you wondering at the end of this post; &quot;Why DIDN'T I see that?!&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Well, there are a lot of reasons why you possibly didn't not see it, or understand that this thing is probably the only way you're going to increase your Psi skills in the next 90 days. You could have been stressed out; Gotten yourself down; Maybe you think you're no good, or that doing it isn't the best use of your time. Maybe you've been programed to NOT do it, or NOT want to do it. All reasons are equally acceptable.
<br />

<br />
Ofcourse in all things we must realize fundamental truths. In our life there  would seem to be so many variations of truth that it would be duely confusing to sort through all them. So, I'm gonna break it down to you with a truth. There is a LONG equation I'll write some of for you : &#968; = (X+(Y/2) - L +I) * P^4 The equation could definetly keep going, as there are so many freakin' variables in it. But, if you could manipulate one of those variables, it would have the opposite affect on another variable, and a positive increase in the &quot;Psi&quot; aspect (To the left of the equals sign). P. Practice EVERY DAY.
<br />

<br />
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings; I recently read that 13-1000 people actually prefer to perform the things they desire; while 987-1000 would rather see what they want and imagine it than do it. It takes practice; And if you want to get good in the next 90 days do it. Other variables include Y = Physical/mental health. L= Laziness (oppositive of your practice (P)), and ofcourse I, imagination and intelligence or your creativity.
<br />

<br />
I personally challenge everyone of you who wish to become good at Psi to practice EVERDAY for the next 90 days.
<br />

<br />
Oh? Your schedule doesn't give you enough time to do that? Right.

			No, what he's saying is to increase your psi abilites, you need to consistently practice. There is no secret technique or magical pill that will give you ub3r-1337 psi sk!1z instantly. If you want to have better psi skills, quit lollygagging (using that word makes me feel old) and start practicing.

Very amusing, Sheep.  But to be completely serious, I full heartedly agree.  With anything in this world, and I mean anything, if you desire to grow and hone your capabilities, then you must practice.  It's simple.  Stop searching for a secret pill, formula, or invention.  Maybe your genes or DNA have a part in psionics.  MAYBE.  But as of right now, there's absolutely no proof to that, so the best way to become stronger and more efficient at your trade is to practice, research, and study.  
<br />

<br />
Three very difficult words to come to terms for a vast majority of people, but quite frankly, it'll do you better.  Work hard and all shall come in time.  Hell, maybe you will become the next psionic god or goddess within 90 days.  You know what?  Either way, you're going to get better.  So practice and have fun with it.  Implement it with all of your general, rudimentary, and seemingly trivial chores.  I'm sure it will work wonders.
<br />

<br />
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I hate to be the one to have to say this,
<br />

<br />
When reading this post I found it highly interesting but I'm wondering where your getting your sources from. Also I don't recall reading any polls on people that imagine having psionics skills and people that actually do <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />. My job here is to manage this forum and make sure that members aren?t going to get harmed so I'll say this now; If you decide to practice  for 90 days straight please practice within your own limits. Thus meaning do not over practice and harm yourself. 
<br />

<br />
Practice safe, If you at all start to get a headache or feeling dizziness then please stop. I personally practiced every other day with a set time. Remember this, wanting something to much and going overboard with practice is NOT going to bring results in a faster pace. Please take that into notice.
<br />

<br />
I found this post very interesting and I'm looking forward on seeing the outcome of this. Please take in consideration that I am in no way telling people to avoid this experiment of practice. I'm just trying to make sure our members practice safe so they can avoid being harmed.

			Well the actual numbers are really not too important; But, hit up the chatroom or any other mode of communication (Even this one) and you will find people who say &quot;I am too lazy.&quot; to practice... Point is though, many people do not practice what they &quot;want&quot;; I know this first hand and second hand. Because if they did most of the questions in forums wouldn't be about the &quot;basics&quot; psiballs, and &quot;psychokinesis&quot; on smaller objects.
<br />

<br />
So Joe, you don't use psi more than &quot;every other day&quot;?

			practice helped me, I would practice making psiballs and PK everyday, that is how I can slide so much objects, plus I rushed...not a good idea, but I did it any wys knowing that it could be dangerous.

don't rush new psions, you might hit a learning spot like I did, Speed, all my object move faster then a fat guy with a 50 pound boulder dragging behind him.

When I first started to practice yes. No more than an hour a day, every other day. However, when I got decent at PK as well as other skills (Telepathy, remote viewing) I did practice them daily. What I'm saying is maybe practicing everyday for new guys isn?t the best way to gain results. However, your practice experiment might work. I guess will have to see <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.

			Hey Sheep, you got it.. at least a bit. 
<br />
One Problem i'm seeing everytime is that people think about psi and having no clue what it is. People think about reiki and having no clue what it is. People think about exciting buddhic monk-arts and having no clue at all. 
<br />

<br />
Then if they start trying to do any they have no clue about <span style="text-decoration: underline">what</span> to do, 'why' to do.
<br />
After they train some month in Psi and/or hermetic magic (it really IS the same) they start becoming a picture of it. They start seeing behind her own self-centered view of life, there self-centered view of world. Then they start to notice about things they never noticed before. This -maybe- is described as the opening of the 3rd eye or something similiar. 
<br />

<br />
After you work your way along the road you may become &quot;enlighted&quot; (or not). I'm amazed that (except buddism) noone cares about this &quot;magical aspect&quot; you could use the arts of psi, too. 
<br />
Enlightment is nothing more then understand your own environment in all aspects and saying &quot;what the fuck is this all? Why i didn't see this before, it's all in <span style="text-decoration: underline">front</span> of my eyes?&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Actually seeing and noticing -and maybe working in other spheres at the same time- doesn't give you the l33t strange psi-uberskills.. but if you understand you are able to handle volatile aspects of our environment such as time or light.
<br />

<br />

<br />
So whats about all this stuff: Let us make some evil dark Voodoo-Magic and bring love to someone other. The (normal) Voodoo-priest takes his voodoo-loving doll (not the plastic one) and a pin. When he starts doing magic he visualises the doll as the real person and the pin as the charm. When he pulls the pin in, the charm is accomplished. If he is good in visualisation the charm may work. 
<br />
But what he didn't know is what a doll is, what a pin is, <span style="text-decoration: underline">why</span> it should work. He cannot even prick the pin in the doll for real. All this missing knowledge will be replaced by estimates. 
<br />
Do you have a clue what will happen if he really whould 'know'? <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />
