			alright fellaz,I've read this whole topic, and so far I've seen that some of you are rather sceptical about using psi in combat, now let me tell you a few things I've uncovered. When you attempt to create a psiball you feel tingling and energy transference in your body, at least I do, now as I recall it is similar to the feeling when you attempt to hit someone with your fist, at the time you can surely feel the energy coursing trough your arm and it reaches its peak when you land a blow. My point is that we sometimes use psi unconsciously, when we fight, run, jump, swim, do homework or any other thing, psi is, to me, an integral part of our life, we just use it spontaniously, now if we could use psi to a greater degree in any task (such as in martial arts) and use it with more control, ofcourse we could strike faster, get fatigued less, or inflict greater blows, maybe even anticipate the opponents actions sooner. I hope this gives you some picture.

What the hell areyou talking about? I don't feel any tingling sensation when I'm about to hit something. Maybe after if I hit too hard a surface, but never before or during.

			look dude, you just might be a bit low psi sensitive, when I train with my friend I concentrate all my energy to be graceful and not strong, so that I dont damage him, after doing such, I had an increased balance and agility as long as the feeling was there, when I get angry my energy changes polarity and it goes all strength, raw and powerful. I belive emotions have a lot to do with Psi and our own abilities. Human psyche is very powerful.

I doubt it's my lack of sensitivity as much as it is your over active imagination. You sound like you've read up on jing or some trash like that. I think you should keep your imagination in check. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

I don't need to concentrate any energy to land a soft/clean blow... I have a good sense of timing, control, distance, etc... I don't need anything to help me out with that.

yeah yeah, I'm whacked you know. Psi can be incorporated in any aspect of life, it's multi-purpose, that is, if you can use it... can everyone use it? Hmm...

I don't know if he got the idea specifically from psi, but a lot of it definitely comes from Asian culture; samurais, kung fu, qi gong, etc.

About a year ago I stopped tricking; I had been tricking for about 6 months. I could do a front, and back flip, double leg, butterfly twist and kick, 360 crescent, 540 kick, and a few other basic tricks. 
<br />

<br />
Now I'm conditioning to get myself back in the groove. I can't really do anything right now.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
