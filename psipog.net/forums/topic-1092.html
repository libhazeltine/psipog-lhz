			Here are a few examples of things you should never do when experimenting:
<br />

<br />
Uncovered Psi Wheel: 
<br />

<br />
1. Never cone your hands. If you decide to use your hands at all make sure they are not coned in any way and they are at least 4 inches away.
<br />
2. If you use a laptop do not use the same desk.
<br />
3. Do not touch the desk at all (Not even leaning on it).
<br />
4. Wait 10 minutes before you start, changing surfaces until it seems calm.
<br />
5. Tilting your head while breathing might affect the psiwheel even if you are not facing it directly. 
<br />

<br />
Rolling:
<br />

<br />
1. If you use a laptop do not use the same desk.
<br />
2. Do not touch the desk at all (Not even leaning on it).
<br />
3. Wait 10 minutes before you start, changing surfaces until it seems calm.
<br />
4. Control your breathing and do not tilt your head. (As i said before you can never be sure of the outcome if you tilt your head, try to remain still after you calibrate your experiment instrument)
<br />

<br />
Psi Ball:
<br />

<br />
Things that do not indicate a Psi Ball:
<br />

<br />
A &quot;Magnetic Feeling&quot; is often misintepreted, this does not signal the creation of a psiball. 
<br />

<br />
Subtle heat also sometimes comes naturaly, make sure it is actully a change of heat and not subtle pressure that gives off the feeling. (The magnetic feeling can be interpreted as heat sometimes)
<br />

<br />
When experimenting in bed, it is natural for your hands to feel cold, due to your body heat increasing inside the bed covers making your hands (That are outside) feel cold.
<br />

<br />
If you keep these things in mind, you won't have any problem with Placebo effects.

			according to other people, the magnetic feeling is your joints getting stiff. i don't know about that, but it does have a bit of logic in it. meh... if you want to test it out, make a psiball untill you feel that magnetic feeling and move one of your hands. if you feel it in both hands, then it's a psiball. otherwise, it might not be.
<br />

<br />
that's my guess anyway.

			I dont just post things for no reason. I have looked into this.
<br />

<br />
Do this: Hold your arms out opposite to each other, relax. Push your hands slowly closer to each other but before they touch create the moving feeling with your mind, if you do this correctly you will emulate the magnetic feel. When i mean emulate the moving feeling i mean imagine your hands being pushed but a barrier is blocking them, so push harder with your mind. You will start to feel a tingling then a little pressure. 
<br />

<br />
Or: Hold your hands opposite in a cone for 15 minutes while having your eyes closed and concentrating on nothing. Sometimes you will get bizzare feelings.
<br />

<br />
The conclusion is that feelings can be created using your mind, and thats why proper procedure while identifying PSI is always neccecery. Personaly i do not trust my &quot;feelings&quot; as any reassurance for an effect, i prefer other means, there are other ways.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Also i would like to point out that personaly i feel the magnetic feeling on both hands when attempting to simulate a placebo effect.

			I find the texture of a &quot;magnetic&quot;  feeling of a psiball different then the &quot;placebo&quot; affect. maybe that what they should feel for, I feel a more dense feeling when making a psiball, but when I use my joints it feels as if nothing but air is in the middle.

			Yes i for one am not conviced because of one subtle difference in a placebo effect, who knows maybe it is boosted by confidence that there is something there. What i am trying to say is, try things, experiment. Some people practice for 15 minutes and run to post &quot;Yay i made a psiball&quot;. I just think research is something more than that.

			What if when you try to push your hands together they move as though there is really a ball there????  as in one hand wants to go up and over while the other moves down and under...
<br />
this is how I know (although I do feel the heat)  that I have a psi ball

			I am not saying you aren't, im saying to be careful because the same effects can be deceiving as a placebo, if your confident that you made one then i guess you can beleive it.
