			sounds kind of like glamour from the wiccan beliefs.  i don't think you can physically change your eye color or appearance, but it may be possible to use telepathic suggestion, or some other aspect of telepathy to make people <span style="font-style: italic">think</span> you look a certain way.  i also don't think this topic belongs in psychokinesis... <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Idk but that would be freaking sweet, but quite impossible. If i'm right I think even if you did change your chomosomes, it's wouldn't change.  Maybe you can take the pigment away, but that would have bad reprecusions.  And it would be bio-PK if anything.

Nightshade: How does that relate to the wiccan religion at all?

Glamour is a wiccan practice that allows the user to assume different physical characteristics.  do a google search on &quot;wiccan: glamour&quot; or &quot;wiccan glamour.&quot;  it should be the first site that pops up.  scroll down the left side until you see &quot;Glamour spells&quot; it should be right before habit spells.

			maybe someone should try it <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />
it might end relly bad like lose in vision but it would be cool like changing your eye coler like the guy of chronicles of riddick.
<br />
and maybe you could experement with it like on rats or somthing like the ones you get at the pet store for one doller.
<br />
Im not that good (i dont think anyone is at this point) to do it though.
<br />
and has anyone relly experimented with this? <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			Yes, it would be nice to have a testimonial. The other threads on this subject so far have nothing, and they only have posts arguing about the slang term of using psychokinesis to alter DNA.

			I havent reall modified my body but heres a story. I was really skinny in 7th grade, like underweight skinny. So I got into weightlifting. After awhile all i could think about was getting bigger and stronger, and without much work I did. I worked out for about 3 weeks straight (which isnt alot of time) and gained about 30 pounds of muscle. It was crazy.

			To make a long story short, quite some time back, I lost most of my vision. Vision was down to 20/50 wore glasses ect, didn't know that we could alter ourselves but over a period of 6 months my vision continued getting better, which mystified the eye docs as my vision lost was suppose to be permanent. The last time i've had it checked, vision is 20/15 with possibility of still increasing.
<br />
Really don't need to know the scientific form of our dna ect, just tell your mind what you want to do before you go to sleep and give it a lot of patience and you may find that your body will slowly alter itself as you sleep.
