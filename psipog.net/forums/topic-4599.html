			I have a problem: even after a lot of practice, my constructs can only exist if I contain the energy between my hands. The moment I take away either hand, or &quot;open a crack in the containment field&quot; the energy disperses almost instantly. I've tried envisioning a steel ball, a self-contained energy sphere, and many other images, but none of them worked.
<br />

<br />
The main purpose would be to create a construct that will absorb ambient energy from its surroundings, and use ~60% of it to sustain itself, and the rest to exert an outward force; plus it should adhere to walls.
<br />
I've envisioned a spider on the wall, energy streaming into the ball, and the force it exerts outwards(equal to the force acting on it). I kept charging the ball until I could barely feel my hands, then proceeded to stick it onto my wall. When my hands have &quot;cooled off&quot; a bit, I checked for its presence, but my met no resistance whatsoever where the ball should have been sitting...I say no resistance because when I create just an unprogrammed psi-ball, I know it's there because I can feel a resistance when I try to push my hands together.
<br />

<br />
I have managed to heat up a bal, but cold and everything else still needs work. Right now, I just want to create a self-conatined construc, that doesn't need the containment of my hands...then I think I can move on to one-handed psi-balls...
<br />

<br />
Any help in shelling a construct, and also programming would be very welcome...

			Personally, I shell my constructs to match the construct itself. For example, if I make a hot construct, I visualize steaming hot, glowing bricks forming themselves around it, and for cold ones, I imagine a thin layer of ice. This may help with your shelling, if not, check out some of the articles. Hope I could help.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			well, what i usually do, is make a seperate construct outside the original psiball, it is still between my hands, and then i program the next one i make that is all around the original, to bounce all the energy back into the middle if it tries to get out, and i just keep putting energy into that layer, and compressing it, adding, compressing, until that layer is adequite, ya, and with one handed psi balls, i just make this layer first, and then make a psi ball inside it, either way is fine, just depends on what ur good at,

			Thanks for the help, I'll try both methods...
