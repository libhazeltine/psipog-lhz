			i see people talking about how psiballs could be this but i recently learned about it in psycholigy and it seems to me that its just not possible biofeed back is controlled by some kind of sensory thing example to learn to keep ure heart rate below 80 you have it hooked up so a light goes off everytime youre heart goes above that so u try to keep the light off and you learn how to do it. next it seems to be a tool for learning so can someone clear this up for me

Biofeedback deals with many things biologically. I'm not going to go through details, as I don't exactly know what you're trying to ask.

<br />
A training technique that enables a person to gain some element of voluntary control over autonomic body functions. It is based on the principle that a desired response is learned when received information indicates that a specific thought or action has produced the desired response. 
<br />
</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Which means basically gaining voluntary controll over normally involuntary actions (such as heart rate).
<br />

<br />
But when I see people using the term in the psionic community, it seems to mean &quot;your body playing tricks on you.&quot;
<br />

Interesting, that thing on biofeedback... I thought it was more along the lines of &quot;I think I feel hot&quot; and suddenly your brain makes your nerves make you feel hot. Maybe that's what you were talking about, which is known as the placebo effect.
<br />

<br />
And, there's no way to be sure that the psi balls you are making are not a placebo effect until you get to the point where other people can observe what your psi ball is doing. Think about this: When making a psi ball, 2 key things are visualization and believing that it's there, forming in your hand, doing certain things. If you visualize it being hot, there is a chance that, instead of actually creating a hot psi ball, your brain is simply causing your nerves to say that they feel heat. Your mind is tricky like that, and can even cause you injury or give you a disease (known as a psychosomatic disease) if it believes on a subconscious level that you have sustained the injury or you have the disease.
<br />

<br />
The only real way to prove it is real is, keeping with the hot psi ball example, throwing the psi ball at someone and asking them if they felt it, and what it felt like. If what they say lines up with what you felt, congratulations, you have a psi ball. If not, you either need to work on your programming, throwing, general psi ball-making, or it may just be a concentrated placebo effect. The only way to prove for sure is to have a second party observe your psi's effects. I am still in the stage of getting it to that point, I can kind of feel the psi, but I can't be sure whether or not it's not the placebo effect. I don't doubt it, though, because there's too much evidence for it. I just keep trying, and I am confident that I'll get it soon.
