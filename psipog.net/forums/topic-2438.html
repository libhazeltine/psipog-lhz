			This question may be seem obvious to everyone, but I believe that this is something we take for granted.  I think that the root beliefs of people as to what psi actually is varied significantly.  This variety of opinion is part of the reason that some people get labelled as nons (not because they are any less capable) because they are being instructed by others who have separate beliefs about what psi is but didn't take the time to find out what their students beliefs and impressions were.  With various understandings of psi, the end result is a serious problem that could be likened to teachers who use base 10 math educating students who only understand math as base 8.  Confusion, frustration and a stunting of the collective learning process result from this misunderstanding.
<br />

<br />
So, to settle this problem, I'm wondering what people have found out through their experiences and what conclusions they've drawn concerning the nature of psi.  If you're inexperienced and you BELIEVE one option is true with no real evidence to support your beliefs, I'd prefer you didn't vote since this poll is not about beliefs but objective conclusions of those who are imparting their knowledge and experience to others.
<br />

<br />
I'd also like those who vote to elaborate on their conclusions and how they came to them.  Hopefully we can gain a better understanding of psi as a result of the evidence and conclusions of our peers and while I have no problem with questioning others' conclusions (I may do some myself <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />), I do not want to see any challenging or attacking.  Be aware that people who take the time to write down their conclusions are presenting the very foundations of their metaphysical beliefs and attacking something so deeply rooted in and valued by a person can only result in disaster so be considerate.

			I believe Psi to be a manifested form of energy. A dynamic energy. It is just one of the many forms. Personally I do not like the word Psi that muhc, hence I tend not to use it. I see Psi different from prana or chi since the latter two refer more to the fundamental level of energy in which all energy is just one &quot;substance.&quot; Psi is one of the many forms of energy that come to life from that static, fundamental one energy. Psi is used to dynamically manipulate the other forms of energy. I see it as just a very small form of energy, nothing important. But that is my interpretation.

			I think psi is more than energy, but I won't get into it because it involves religion how the world was created and my theory's on it. If anyone wants to know, then pm me.

			From my knowlege of physics, it's probably a particle, like light.

instead of photons, it's ....erm............ psi-ons?

			I'm going with a mechanism one uses.
<br />

<br />
Sometimes, it would seem entities can accomplish things. This, would be a mechanism of achieving things by definition.
<br />

<br />
The energy model, is useful because it gives you a paradigm to work within and use to achieve results. Yet it doesn't explain _everything_. Eventually, it gets too complicated to be useful. (Occam's Razor).
<br />

<br />
Projection of awareness, and other such phenomena. Not energy, not spirits. Awareness. This is another mechanism.
<br />

<br />
I don't think anyone will know what is behind 'Psi', at least not for a while.
<br />

<br />
I'm going to go with a mechanism. Probably a mechanism of the mind or will. It doesn't really matter, it still functions regardless of how you see it.
<br />

<br />
Aether.

			I'm gonna agree with Sparkz in that it's similar to light, only I'm gonna say that Psi also has light's wave-particle duality. Because Psi works through objects. People have done PK on Psiwheels under plastic cups and stuff, so it can't be strictly a particle. If it were a dual particle-wave, it would have similar properties to light, such as the ability to travel in a vacuum, and the ability to travel through objects.
<br />

<br />
And I'm guessing that the particles in question are like a cross between photons and electrons, with qualities of both.
