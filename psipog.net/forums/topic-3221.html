			You might need to just slow down and take a rest. Maybe you're practicing too much? Practicing telekinesis can be EXTREMELY strenuous, even though you might not think so (think lifting weights, or something along those lines). What I'm trying to say is that it's a VERY good idea to rest every one day out of every, say, two or three. You might even have to rest longer than that.
<br />

<br />
Another thing that might be causing your sudden lapse is your diet. Have you changed what you eat recently?

			i did not use tk from like 5 days or something and still cant move it and i think 5 days are too much for rest , i dont do diet ,im eating normaly as before and eat little as always^^ .
<br />

<br />
sometimes i feel that my energy are trapped in my hands when i want it to go out because my first days and they were good in tk and spinning the psi wheel i was not using my hands i was using my eyes only.
<br />

<br />
last hope for me and it is the last thing that i did not think about and it might be the reason and i will give it a shot is meditation , i forget meditate every day so it might be because of no meditation , i will try to meditate for the next 7 days and see what will happen . if you all have any thing to tell me please go ahead and say it^^ .
