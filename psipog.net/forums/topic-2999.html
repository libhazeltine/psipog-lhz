			Ok, I tried making two psiwheels move at once (which I did successfully, YAY!) But the one on my left hand was moving a lot slower than the right. 
<br />

<br />
I figured my left hand might not have been strong enough to spin it, so I thought I could bring it up to speed with my right. I moved my right hand over, and brought it up to speed.
<br />

<br />
But during that, the one on my right side was still spinning, with no hand to assist it in moving.
<br />

<br />
Could it be that I could just spin the psiwheel with just my mind with no hands? Or did the momentum generate enough energy to keep it moving?
<br />

<br />
I just thought this was a bit weird...

			You don't need your hands to do PK, probably you made the connection with the psiwheel on the right strong enough to allow you to take your hand away.  Your hands just give your subconscious a confidence boost, when I try, the psiwheel spins a lot faster with my left hand than my right (even though I'm right-handed), but I can spin it with no hands about as well as I can spin it with my right.

			that happened to me too.  it doesn't matter which hand is stronger, since psi isn't related to your muscles (at least it doesn't appear to be.)  i think it was all in your mind.  next time you do this try to move them in opposite directions...i don't know what this would accomplish, but it is challenging (sp?)  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Well, as was mentioned, your hands aren't required for PK. Once your mind connects and discovers that it can move the objects, you shouldn't need to keep your hands there anymore, unless you've trained yourself to use your hands.
<br />

<br />
When starting out many people find that using their hands is necessary. I think this is just because your mind has difficulty affecting energy over distance due to a lack of experience. Since your body is full of energy which is far easier for you to move within yourself, placing a hand near the wheel creates a 'path of least resistance', which we all know nature loves. Thus the energy flows through your body, out of your hand, and past/through/around the wheel.
<br />

<br />
Personally I find I need to use my hands as my mind is reliant on distance. Once I get a few larger items rolling I'll likely work on not using my hands, but for now they're pretty key to making progress forward.

			I've made them go in opposite and same directions the first time I tried with two psiwheels. Which I'm really proud of.
<br />

<br />
I tried with no hands last night, but I barely got it moving... Plus I was a bit tired and it was right after I took a shower so... that might be it.
<br />

<br />
I'll try again tonight...
<br />

<br />
EDIT: I tried a few hours ago, and I got to spin both with no hands! ^^ YAY!
<br />

<br />
Now, on to psiballs...
