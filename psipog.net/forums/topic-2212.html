			Sorry if this has been asked before, but... Do people use telepathy for conversations?  Like in 'The Chrysalids' by John Wyndham - the book that got me into all this!!  It's all very well to 'ping' people and play games, but surely there is a more practical use for this skill?

			Verbal Communication over a Psychic Medium... Let me put this in my own words! <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
It's pretty difficult to communicate verbally, word for word, using Telepathy. Not impossible, but difficult. However, you can express with &quot;equal detail&quot; what you want using Ideas/Pictures... Which is more likely to happen.

			That book is awesome.
<br />
It's about a bunch of Newfies about 2000 years post-nuclear war.
<br />
I still haven't finished it, but yeah they use something called 'thought shapes'.
<br />
I assume this to be almost exactly the same as concepts.
<br />
Reading it has made me think somewhat differently about telepathy, and I hope some day I will be able to use it with the same ease and detail the characters in the book can.

			Me and a friend are trying to be able to do this. Right now were are at two words under a certain category like greeting. EX. category: greetings message: hey man. That's is the most complicated so far. But we have been doing really well with gett multiple choice questions with 4 choices right. I got 7 in a row and then 2 in a row after that but then we quit because it was getting late.

			about 30mins ago i was at borders (a bookstore) and had a full conversation with a father and son. The father was helping his child learn empathy so we just talked about the basics. Then I told him what I knew about astral projection and his energy lit up.  I still have his sig so im actually still talking as i type.
