			Hi everyone
<br />
I quit my psi training almost 4 months ago because I just didn't have enough time to continue.
<br />
Today I got addicted again and started with making psiballs I didn't have any problems with those.
<br />
After that I tried the psiwheel it didn't move at all the first time just some little shivers and twitches.
<br />
I decided to make an alufoil psiwheel because I heard it's easier to handle.
<br />
Well the result was better I could move it but I couldn't control it at all.
<br />
It spun to the right, to the left, faster, slower, it even jumped off the needle once but I just couldn't control it.
<br />

<br />
It's been about 5 hours since that and I still didn't progress.
<br />

<br />
However the first time I used a (paper) psiwheel I could control it <span style="font-weight: bold">instantly</span> I didn't need any training I even made a video of it.
<br />

<br />
I'd be glad to receive any hints/help on how to solve this problem.
<br />

<br />
Edit : Sorry but it seems like I solved the problem...
<br />
You'll never guess how - <span style="font-weight: bold">MUSIC</span> was the key to success.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />
I couldn't concentrate in silence I just had too many toughts in my mind.
<br />
Therefore I concentrated on the beat of the song I was listening to and it worked, I went into a trance like state and it just worked.
<br />
I can't really control it yet but I managed to spin it to the right for almost 8 Minutes (that's exactly the duration of the song).
<br />
If you have similar problems, give it a try.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
