How would we gather to fight hurricanes? Easy

Tell each other where the next storm is and fly there. Go to the meeting beach point and start stopping the hurricane

We could have some people make a large sheild to help out too

			Yes going to hurricane would be extreamly dangerous considering we dont know if it is even possible
<br />
But if we had alsot of psions and some really good psions we could maybe pull it off
<br />
And think of how hard it would be to concentrate in a hurricane!

thats a good one! I, as always, agree with both sides here. I agree that if we all got together and tried hard enough, it would happen to our wills. I also believe that someone would either pull a Leeroy, or it would turn out to be beyond our ability after all, either way, we end up annihalated. also it would be too hard to get all of us together as MANY of us (including me) are young, and dont have a ride.

			No longer I can hold back my complaining about.. gah! chicks won't 'dig' this stuff, they won't go crazy over the fact you can move a pencil with your mind, or use teleapthy. Atleast I don't think it's very likely at all that they will, because afterall, EVERYONE can do this; you aren't some special gifted person. As for the chriss angel thing, the chicks drool over him probably because he is very attractive, and is most likely a very good illusionist rather than a psionic. *takes a deep breath*
<br />

<br />
Anyway back on track about the water thing.. saving people from floods only seems impossible to do by one person in their lifetime. Holding back water would take an incredible large amount of PK, even by a million people doing it at once. However has anyone heard of just sitting on the beach and making the waves come in more often or with more power using PK? It tends to work for me and other people I know but.. yeah, I donno  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />
