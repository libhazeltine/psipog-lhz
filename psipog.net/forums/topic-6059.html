			<img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> I don't really know what to say, I've been practicing off and on for four years now I can only move the psi wheel a good deal every once-and-awhile I can also charge batteries and make psi balls and I can affect others hand (I.e. Levitate them and make them twitch hhah). I can't move a soda can, pen,pencil,tooth pick either, what advice can u guys give me ill never give up I just need some pointers if any will be ever so kindly given ....thank you ahead of time all

			Since it doesn't seem like you've tried everything... I don't want to hear I can't.... until:
<br />

<br />
- You've meditated daily for about an hr a day.
<br />

<br />
- Practiced Pk as well for an hour a day.
<br />

<br />
- Don't take any breaks unless you MUST.
<br />

<br />
Just make a really strict training schedual... after all, it is training. You're training to become good.  Once you are good, then you can train less if your satisfied with your skills.

			ouch, I feel bad now... hmm, you should get a schedual so you can figure in time to spend with your family, time practicing and working.
<br />

<br />
If you meditate the second you wake up, your not taking much out of your day, so wake up 45min earlier than you would normally to meditate.... hmm, ok eat breakfast go to work, come home... eat dinner, play with your kids and what not, and before you go to bed or other.. do 45min of tk, it really isn't that time consuming.  
<br />

<br />
But yea, managing your time is a bit of a pain, and having less time then you already have can be a bitch, but I say go for it.

			Ur right its not that time consuming , though I also am in my senior year , I'm kind of discouraged bc I should practice a lot more and I want to and I am going to and my son is only 2 months old the schedule will be easy to make, how do all of u meditate for an hour straight? Its hard but I will do it. I tried moving a clear light plastic sphere and I thought I was wobbling it it was clearly visible but there was a fan on really close by... But anyways off and on for 4 years I just practiced for weeks when I first started but then over time I just didn't practiced and I think I meditated for like 15 minutes once I didn't see the point but now I understand how important it is , I want nothing more to be able to do tk (pk) and prove to my gf I am good for something lol
