Pepsiboy, that sounds very interesting, and do you have any idea where we could listen to the 7.81 Hz frequency? Like a website? or any programs on the computer that can perhaps generate the correct frequency, etc.

Go to a search engine and look up 'bwgen' and look for brainwave generator. Its binaural beats and they allow you to hear frequencies much lower than naturally possible by playing two different frequencies. The difference between the two is taken out by your mind resulting in synchronized brainwave activity.

			Eventually, when science reaches a new state (of which it is currently in transition) things like PK will be more explainable, to a certain point.
<br />

<br />
However, I have conducted my own experiments with a video camera and by watching other people (i told all of my friends and family about PK as soon as I learned, and now half of them can do it, and one friend I have even practises nearly every day like myself) and I can tell you for sure that it can be done with the eyes closed, and it can also be done with an object in one room and you in another.
<br />

<br />
So, he was wrong there.
<br />

<br />
He is probably on to something regarding the mineral and chemical elements within the brain, regarding PK. Just about anything that occurs can produce some kind of physical evidence. Psychokinesis included.
<br />

<br />
However, I think things like &quot;iron in the brain&quot; can only potentially ASSISST in the act of doing PK. They are certainly NOT the only factor, as this idiot believes.
<br />

<br />
Zero Point Emotion? Good method I believe, but that's all it is, -A- method. Not THE method. One method out of many many possible methods, and more than likely not the best one either, IF there is a best one.
<br />

<br />
Oh, and does his nifty equation explain why people get better with practise, and can control an object consciously when they get good (I can somewhat do so myself at this point)? No. I'm no physicist, but all those squiggly marks and numbers and letters jumbled together certainly do not provide such an explanation.
<br />

<br />
I'm not saying this guy is completely wrong, he may have created an extremely rough and disgustingly inaccurate and erroneous foundation for the mathimatical science behind psionics, MAYBE, but he's a fucking FAR cry from being on the money.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: oh yeah, and does it explain how iron can affect any object made out of any material?
<br />

<br />
I think this guy's given an equation for Magneto's power(&quot;I am the master of magnetism! muahahaha!&quot;). Go read some more comic books, buddy.

			Well here's my view on this thing. I say they possibly can't hope to explain Pk if we still don't understand about 15-20% of our brain. Also, the human genome is still half-mapped. I say they should start with the a's and b's and then eventually start thinking about the mechanics of Pk.
<br />

<br />
It's like trying to explain quantum mechanics by dropping a brick out of a window.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Here's another radical idea... If i was king of the world... I would certainly stop most of the space research and concentrate on human research. If all the research centres, universities and whatnots cooperate on this matter, we would have the brain and the human genome mapped in a matter of years.
<br />

<br />
If the scientists can spew forth a reliable theory on Pk, i think it would get the attention of millions. And if we had millions of Psions all over the world, we could gather them all into a company or guild of some sort. This guild would be powerful enough to solve most of the world's problems with their skills. Like the war in gaza sector for an example, they'd just send out a MASSIVE calming empathy wave over that area.
<br />

<br />
And yes, i probably need professional help.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			the only thing that would seem remotely plasuable on that is the iron thing, however only assisting me with PK. I ate about 30 strawberries in one day and it greatly improved my PK.
<br />
You don't need visual contact (example: JoeT's blind friend).
<br />
I've stayed up for two days straight, then performed PK.
<br />
I can forcefully spin a psiwheel with imagination and willpower.
<br />
I don't know about the vitamin E thing, but it's probably bull too.
<br />

<br />
I believe that PK has NOTHING to do with the body, even the brain. How could it be explained otherwise? We probably would have figured out by now about PK if it had anything to do with the brain directly. So far i've been thinking this thing all the time and alot of my mental barriers are wearing off slowly.

			It has very little to do with the body, and everything to do with the mind.... the MIND, not brain... the plane of mind exists on a quantum level, and is above and beyond any of the gross matter that occupies the physical universe, and even above and beyond all forms of universal energy, such as electromagnetism...
<br />

<br />
and that is where science is currently fucking up, when it comes to trying to pick apart thing that have to do with the operations of the mind... the brain creates chemicals in reaction to the mind's influence, not vice versa, as science would have it.
<br />

<br />
The mind is a quantum computer of sorts, but it operates on a level that no quantum computer man creates will ever quite equal.
<br />

<br />
Think of the mind as a normal PC with windows OS. We, in terms of mental evolution, have gotten as far as clicking the &quot;start&quot; button, but have not progressed to clicking any of the items therein, for they baffle our conscious operations.... ok, not the greatest analogy... meh. FUCKING WORDS AND THEIR INFIDELITY!
<br />

<br />
both equations are stupid and incorrect. the end.

I have a question.

<br />
So lets say the answer to F(x) is like..oh I dont know lets say its 42...
<br />

<br />
What does that mean?  The answer to my PK is 42?
<br />

<br />
What?
<br />

<br />
Maybe this is the equation that radki people get their &quot;power levels&quot; from. Numbers have no meaning without any labels.
