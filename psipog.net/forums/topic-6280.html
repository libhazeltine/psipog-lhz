			It was kinda cool. This morning I went to cash my paycheck, but because I live in MN, the window was iced over at 7:30 in the AM.
<br />

<br />
So I got to live the joys of scraping the window off. I decided to have some fun with it, considering no one in my neighborhood ever wakes up that early on a saturday, so I figured I could try a little pryo-PK.
<br />

<br />
Basically, I just did the psi ball, and did the pyro thing with it... put it on/in/around/whatever the window. I kept my hands down and away from the window(as in, I didn't raise them)
<br />

<br />
It worked- just not as well as I'd hoped. after about two minutes, it DID create a circular patch about an inch in diameter that had melted in the middle of a part I hadn't scraped off yet. 
<br />

<br />
So I wrote of my pyro-PK skills as an alternative to scraping the window- judging by what I saw, I don't have enough focus or power to do a whole window.
<br />

<br />
It didn't even occur to me untill about four hours later that I should have taken a picture. 
<br />

<br />
It was nice to see that it works, but my pyro skills need work.

			Yea, I've done stuff like this before....It's actually better to make it less concentrated so the ice comes off really easy but nice work, you beat me by about 4 minutes. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

Be careful when you say Pyro-PK, even though I know what you mean.

			It seems like in the world of psi :cryo-pk, bio-pk, and pyro-pk are swear words. I've been personally called out about using these terms, but not on this site. I was just saying that some people will make a big deal of out you using those terms.

on here its pretty much the opposite, pyrokinesis, cryokinesis, biokinesis etc. arent acceptable terms most of the time.

Well, if you can use pyro-PK to make steam come out of your ears... you GOTTA teach me how to do that!

But yeah, especially because I did it without hands, is what made me know it wasn't body heat.

You should try it again and this time have a camera handy.  Or... why don't you try and steam a mirror, or... freeze a piece of glass (in the freezer) and practice on that.
