			Hey does anyone have any good techniques on  Pyro PK? I read the articles on PsiPog....didn't really have much detail or techniques. So does anyone have any tips, techniques or a reliable website that I can go to?

			yar i have some experience. i can make the candles flames do vertical loops instead of just sway side to side....
<br />

<br />
basically heres the background to it: been doing PK on and off for a while, etcetc, had to go to a restaurant for my grandads birthday. it was boring and the food was posh nosh, not my liking lol.
<br />

<br />
either way it was candle lit, so we couldn't see what the fuck we were eating,  <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
there was a candle in front of me and i spent about 3 hours trancing into it and connecting with it. just by staring at it, like staring into space, but on the flame.
<br />

<br />
eventually i decided to see if anything would happen (my original intent want anything to do with pk, just the andles flame seemed interesting to look at)
<br />

<br />
and basically i just moved it. i wasn't really thinking of anything aT the time. you just gotta get yourself free from distraction and have a bondage session wiht the candle lol.
<br />

<br />
this is how it worked for me anyways

i gained control of pyrokenesis by using lighters, filling my hand with fluid, then igniting it (gas/vapor fluid via bic) ad then tinkering with the fireball effect.
<br />

<br />
make a 'tube' with your hand, enclosed, except on one end where the lighter will fit snugly.
<br />
fill 3 seconds,  one- two- three (sometimes a count less, or more ) then ignite as you pull the lighter away and sligtly open the hand.
<br />
hopefully your not new to this or it can take a bit to get used to.
<br />

<br />
if you want to pecker more at my knowledge-
<br />
i started by not letting it flame.
<br />
then letting it flame.
<br />
i then began to tinker with the size, brightness, color, properties (tactile feeling ) etc etc.
<br />

<br />

<br />
take control of that fireball!!!
<br />

<br />

<br />
now the only side effect of this is that your body becomes accustomed to this tinkering with fire, and sometimes your lighter might explode...
<br />
something about the gaseous fluid,maybe pores, and well my mind knowing theyres more in the bic...  its happened twice to me. be careful.
<br />

<br />

<br />
either way the fireballs from your hand are low risk to the lighter UNLESS
<br />
-its NOT a bic!!!! keep this in mind, bic uses glass and metal sealers instead of cheap bimetalic and plasics
<br />

<br />
-either the: the lighter is hot,   the 'hat' or flame protector is missing, or there is a weird hissing sound coming from your lighter.
<br />

<br />
-your mind has deducted the lighter is the better source for the fireball. in this case, dont bother.  no amount of homestyle gear and enviroment protection will stop searing hot plastic from chewing through your skin. trust me.

			Putting lighter fluid on your hand and then lighting it is beyond playing with fire, thats trying to get a darwin award. Theres plenty of less hazardous ways to practice, like the candle thing.

not LIGHTER FLUID.

LIGHTER GAS!!!

it just either dissipates or goes off in a small ball.lighter fluid itself would seriously burn your hand, and turn your fingers into hotdogs. dont.

That sounds rediculously dangerous.  Try doing the dancing flame or lighting a candle using the method listed in the &quot;Rainsong&quot; activity thing.

			i understand completely what you are saying smirnoff. I myself LOVE fire and LOVE to play with fire (note my name). I do this all the time when just playing with a lighter and sometimes wait about 8 seconds until you let go of the gas and then light it. This will sometimes burn a bit. But it is not like you are going to die from it. Jeeze, some people need to live on the edge once and awhile..........
<br />

(I myself would not recommend anyone doing this. This post was to simply let smirnoff know that I do the same thing.)

Indeed, why would you want to do that, when the liquid burns off, what the fire gonna burn next eh, whats the liquid sitting in, yes your hand, ive had burns from my pyrotechnics, trust me, its painful. Do not try this method of pyrokinesis, you will get burnt, by all means do it with a candle, or match.

maybe in some FREAK accident youl somehow burn your hand, hotdog it just a bit. but of course, life is full of possibilities.

<br />
tested and true, you CANT hurt yourself if youre using BIC FLUID, as in from the tiny lil plastic lighters, you stick it in a chamber you make in your hand, fill it for 3 seconds then fireball. its like touching a candle for a split second. not even CLOSE in pain, or heat.

if youre using liquid or other types of flammables. youre either an idiot, risky, adventurous, or ME.
