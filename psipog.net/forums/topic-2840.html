i dunno. i suppose it would take too much energy to molecularly alter an item, and since we don't know everything there is to know about molecules, the attempts may be too small to notice, or not work at all.

			Alchemy is a crock, that's why no one pays attention to it. Yes, this is my personal opinion, but I also think that it's enormously unrealistic to think a field like alchemy, with its 'turn iron in to gold' and 'elixer of lie' bull is something scientifically credible. Psionics has basic physics theories behind it. Alchemy is just a crackpot science.

			well, technically, if you were to use some crazy-strong PK to maipulate the iron on an atomic or subatomic level, moving protons, neutrons and electrons about, you could probably make it into gold. But it would be FREAKING HARD to do, and the source metal would have to be damn near 100% pure to do it. It would also take bloody ages. Think of all the subatomic particles are in just one gram of iron or gold. There's a lot, and they'd all have to be manually manipulated via PK.
<br />

<br />
The whole &quot;elixir of life&quot; crap is a crock though. I can't think of any way to make such a substance that would be even <span style="font-style: italic">remotely</span> feasible!

			Alchemy is not just energy manipulation and chemistry.  Most alchemy is &quot;internal alchemy&quot; and often requires no ingredients other than a human mind to perform the desired effect.  Alchemy involves vibrations (sonic, molecular, etc.), which ancient alchemists asserted could be affected by the human mind as well as crystals, sounds, elixirs, and potions.
<br />

<br />
Much of it was retarded experiments of old men who had nothing better to do with their time than use their chosen alchemical profession as a way to develop a mystical, holier-than-thou attitude.  The practice did stem from some very informed individuals though.  The Magi who followed a certain star to see the baby Jesus: alchemists.  Jesus, a man who transformed water into wine (kind of like iron into gold eh?): alchemist.  The &quot;wizard&quot; Merlin who advised King Arthur: alchemist.
<br />

<br />
I should also mention that &quot;lead to gold&quot; was less a literal goal as it was a metaphor for changing the vibration of one's matter to be in sync with the Earth's, thus facilitating ascension.  Again, this was internal alchemy, rather than some mystical pseudo-chemistry.
<br />

<br />
Lastly, I'd like to mention that this isn't bs like some ignorant people who have actually never studied alchemy would say.  Basing your opinion off of popular misconceptions is only going to keep you from acknowledging the most important mystical field one can pursue.  No, I'm not using that phrase lightly, alchemy is actually far more useful than ANY other metaphysical practice.

you don't get out much do you?  It is a proven fact you can turn lead in to gold with colbat60 isotope.  However, you will die of leukemia  a million times before you even get something worth it.  but it can be done, just like water can be compressed.

How exactly WAS it proven? If you'd die from lieukemia a million times (give or take a few thousand) before you'd get anything decent, then we probably would've given up due to the sheer cost of time and educated human life, no?
<br />

<br />
If you could give me your source of this info, I'd much appreciate it.

			Well yes, it is bullshit, unless you can manipulate pure metals on a subatomic scale. And I don't think anyone can do that yet. Granted, we'll peobably end up with technology that'll be able to do it, but we're a ways off right now.

			Wouldn't you have to fuse the atoms together through fusion? Like.. 1k heat? Too bad no one has ever gotten it that hot XD or no ship can go at the speed of light, you go so fast that the particles become more dense.. my sources are from my science teacher. He's crazy, blame him if i'm wrong.

			I don't think any of it is BS or Improbable, just, we would have to break known physics, but that's the most Improbable idea, then agian, psi did that...all we know psi would act as a enzym, PK mixed with Phasing, it could cause a chemical reaction, but that's just a brief thought, highly Improbable too.
<br />

<br />
but, How do we actually know it's bullshit? Have you tried? Have you ever seen a man do it? have you heard a reasonable Scientific explaination? 
<br />

<br />
Not saying it's not or is. I'm just irritated hearing that's it's impossible with out any way of showing it is and is not. Just as bad as hearing skeptics yelling about psi.

By the way, Lucidness, Your Kirby thing is creepy.

			Okay has anyone even bothered to read my post before posting themselves?  Almost all I see is a page worth of &quot;alchemy is bs because you can't turn lead into gold&quot;.  Yeah thanks, we got that, but it's been specifically written down in many alchemical texts that the phrase is a bloody metaphor.  No colbalt 60, heats of 1K, etc. required.  Get a clue before posting a completely unimformed opinion.
