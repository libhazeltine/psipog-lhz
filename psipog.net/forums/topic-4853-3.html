<br />

<br />
you say, the heat we create rougly converts to energy, so how about this, we drink water, and heat it using a pk, by accelerating the atoms, moving them more quickly
<br />
thus we would create heat, that our bodies could 'roughly' use
<br />

<br />
if were still hung up on the arguement that i pointed out, that we can only use psi from energy we gain from food calories and energy we put into our bodies, then i feel were at an endpass
<br />

<br />
i would like to know if you agree or disagree with the above statement, our energy exerted through psi (if you believe that psi exists) cannot exceed the energy recieved from food, air, or beverage
<br />
and if you disagree i would like a clear statement of how you feel, not an explanation of food</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
No, we don't get energy from hot water.  I understand the analogy you're trying to use, and it doesn't make sense.  Use PK to create something like a nutrient that would give us energy to expend.  That's basically saying expend energy to create a nutrient to use to expend energy.  It's a zero-sum game.  Spend 100 calories to make a nutrient that can provide 100 calories of energy.  Waste of time.
<br />

<br />
The current understanding of where psi-energy comes from is the human nervous sytem.  It is released as a byproduct of nervous system activity, if I'm not mistaken.  Maintaining the human nervous system, like everything else in the body, expends energy and requires nutrients.  Lack of nutrients will lead to impaired functioning of the nervous system, and therefore, impaired production of psi.
<br />

<br />
As far as taking energy from another source to use as a replacement for nervous system-produced psi-energy, I was under the impression that this wasn't what we were originally discussing.  If I recall correctly, we were debating whether or not outside energy can be taken in and used as a nutrient to keep the human body going during a fasting period.  If we can't stick to the subject, then we can't talk this out.
<br />

<br />
As I've stated before, the production of psi from the human body is contingent on the functioning of the nervous sytem.  Nervous system functioning is contingent upon the intake of nutrients in the human body.  No nutrients, no functioning nervous system.  No functioning nervous system, no psi production.

   I can't blame you for your own stupidity. (I know you didn't say that). That's something you have to take care of on your own though. I made a point and I was being seriously. I said yes. I mentioned IVs and how I don't think they give you food. What did I say that's not serious?
<br />

<br />
   No, I don't. People get tired when they do psi. At least lots of it and correctly. Without energy you can't really do much.

			so you do not feel, that other energy sources, such as gathering energy from the earth, could not be used to create psi (not in the sense that plants grow from the earth and using them, but drawing energy throug meditation)? which inturn, could not be used to supply the body with energy to continue function?
<br />

<br />
you basicly feel, that in order to produce psi one needs energy from food, and one cannot run their body on psi, to create energy needed to live, because there is no energy in the first place to generate psi?

It is from my understanding that when some authors say to draw energy from outside sources, such as the earth or the sun, they have you do so as merely an exercise in visualization, not because you are _actually_ drawing some form of energy from them.  It is my understanding that a defining characteristic of psi-energy is the fact that it is produced by an organic nervous system.  Saying that earth energy can be made into psi-energy would then seem silly if you use this definition.
<br />

<br />
But yes, I believe that to produce psi you need a functioning nervous system that is maintained by proper nutrition.
<br />

<br />
With this information, you can see why I would frown upon the idea of using psi to sustain your body.  You'd be expending energy to create psi, and then use that same psi to give yourself energy.  Again, that'd be a zero-sum game.  And this is assuming that produced psi _can_ be used to provide energy to the body, which I don't think it can since it carries no nutritional value.

well, the body can be stimulated by electricity, to stay alive, you know those defibrillators that they use in hospitals to revive people i assume

so if you recognize that life can be maintained by energy, do you recognize that life can be maintained by chi or psi?

			a couple of months ago i had a problem with sleeping. i couldnt fall asleep wich ment i by the time it was time to go to school i couldnt get up from bed let alone spend 8 hours of facts i know better than the teachers. Well what i did was one day a couple hours before my eyes got drowsey in the early morning hours i sat on my bed meditating to try and refresh and concentrate on getting to school. It worked brilliantly. I got my ass to school and the next afternoon i fell asleep pretty easily and got up at sunrise to walk my pup. So in my case it helped to put off sleep untill the apropriate time.

Electricity does not provide nutrients that your body can digest to produce energy.  Defibrillators are used to jumpstart a stopped heart and get the circulatory system going again.

There's nothing strange about this as far as I'm concerned.  A good meditation session when you're tired is akin to taking a power nap.  You're slowing your system down for a short period of time and are allowing some of the &quot;recharge&quot; processes to happen.
<br />

<br />
You are not, however, creating an energy during meditation that you use to sustain yourself during the day.
