			If you're trying to use telepathy on a computer, it won't work, it only works on concious minds. (If you get a computer to do something, that's PKing it, you can't get a telepathic reply from the computer)
<br />

<br />
If you're trying to control a computer using PK, it'll work and you don't have to be a computer whizz to do it, this is because the mind seems to know how to control complex things with PK, no-one knows why yet, it just does.
<br />

<br />
If you're trying to use telepathy on other minds, but encoding it with binary, it'll work, and just like above, the other mind will know how to interpret it. I don't know why you'd want to though, thoughts work fine enough.
<br />

<br />
If you're claiming that the universe is programmed with binary, toss it in with all the other theories about the universe.

If one was to transmit binary rather than raw thought would the brain interpret the binary as the correct data.....there are plenty of engish to binary converters through google....anyone who want to try this with me my addy.

Telepathy is languageless and sending message can be described as &quot;thought forms.&quot; A spanish telepath could speak to a japanese telepath through thoughtforms.  You know that millisecond idea of what yoru gonna say before you say? That's a thoughtform. If you just send 0101010110 to someone then the brain won't interpet it. But if you send those zeros and ones with the idea of your message attached to them they will.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Or you could just send the original thought form and not be a punk about it.
