			I really can't say when or if this ever stoped but I use to or still can (not sure) if I can tell the future though dreams. When I use to dream every now and then I would always relive a moment but about 1 or 2 years ago I had the same dream about 20 times and I just don't know what to think of it. Yes this dream did stop but this was my dream, here goes.
<br />

<br />
Ok so me my brother and my cousin are at this place rock climbing for the first time and it isn't a big hight like a pro it is very small but not too small. Now you can either drive up a inclined plain to the top or you could rock climb. So my cousin drives up to the top and me and my brother are just rock climbing to the top. Now my brother makes it to the top about 2 minuets quicker than me but... When I am just getting ready to get to the top I sense something. Then I am thinking but I as I am thinking I just put my hand on the very top but not my body. So I am holding on the the edge and the sense just gets stronger and stronger and then I yell Ryan (my brothers name) watch out thats not our cousin. but while I am saying that my &quot;cousin&quot; hits me an I fall all the way down and once I hit I wake up all sweaty and such. Now I know this sound like a pure nightmare but I think there might be something to it because a nightmare unless it really happened and it haunts you shouldn't happen around 20 times.
<br />
Also every time this dream happened it always started and ended in the same place, I never got anything else out of it. Any ideas..?

			I'd say be cautious CB. These things can be dangerous. I've seen deaths happen before and didn't warn anyone. Those didn't end well. If you need help you can email or PM me.

			Thank you TruePsion I will if if I start having those dreams again or just if I see something in my dreams like that (death). That mush have made you felt bad about not warning anyone but it is a dream and you don't always live dreams.

			True, but you can &quot;feel&quot; the dream which is the weird part. Usually it's just your sight, not other senses.

			Ok so today I was awake for 2 hours with my sister watching TV and then we both went to bed. She slept on the couch and I went to my bed and fell asleep for about 7 hours. Now that whole time I was aspeel I had a dream which I had before, but I haven't had this dream in a while and I also had this one a lot. Ok this is the dream. Wow its been a while.
<br />
Ok...
<br />

<br />
There is a car with very bad people in it and they go around my neighborhood once. Then they start waving and shooting guns and get a lot of people into a building. [Now I don't have buildings where I live but I have a little circle in my neighborhood which has houses too but I guess they had a building put in or something]. They get everyone and put them into a room and gas them. (including my parents and everyone I know almost) but they didn't get a few people including my sister and I. My sister is 18 by the way. Now we went to the building and ran in. When you walk in there is a door to the right and then stairs and then an open room with another door in it. My sister and I ran into that room and wwent to the right so we were behind the wall not being seen. I told her to stay and I went up the stairs. She didn't stay, she followed me to the stairs but not up them. I walk up half way and I see a guy but he doesn't see me. So I look into this room where I see people getting gased and wow this is so real in my dream. So I go back down and we sneak out the door and I look to the right and there are some people that they didn't get hiding and one bad guy facing the house and he sees us. He starts yelling and chasing us shooting his gun at me but yes missing. Next to the building there is a little ally with bushes on both sides, baseically a walk way. We run down it and look down another ally connected to the one we were in while running still and saw another guy with a gun. He got cut off and we kept going down another one. There we see our cousins in a car and we started yelling saying drive back to your place. He lives far but in the same state. They start driving the speed limit and then see the guy with a gun who shoots only once then we floored it. Then the dream got cut off.
<br />

<br />
Ok thats it. Now I know that sounds like it would never happen and I know it never would I am just posting this because I thought it would be smart to see why I have dreams like this a lot in a row. I mean I haven't had this dream in lets say 3 years.

			Yah that does seem farfetched but if that does happen, well, follow everything in the dream to the tee. Seriously, you know what to do, you know how to escape. But I hope it doesn't happen because it is odd.
