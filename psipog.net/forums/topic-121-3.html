			what i've seen from personal experience is that nowadays nothing is unique. not even human being personalities. i've grown up and seen how all my friends have changed, grown, bettered themselves more times than not. i can even sit down with a toddler and be 90% sure of what kind of social steriotype the person will fit in to someday. the indigo children are just one of these socal steriotypes. one that probably is only recently being clearified.
<br />

<br />
and i have to say its way to common for psycologist to misdiagnost ADHD. I was misdiagnosed. She said i dont concentrate on one thing at a time and that isnt exactly helping my acedemic career. Once she sat me down and got me paying attention to one thing and one thing only she relised i do better as a multitasker. I'm willing to bed alot of you out there are taking some form of attention defiset medication. In my case it was concerta  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			The idea of a new human evolution is kinda dumb I gotta say. The idea behind natural selection and evolution is that there has to be 'selection pressure' in order to force evolution and adaptation to occur. Under a selection pressure the organisms with the most advantageous features are more likely to survive and have offspring...leading to an increase in offspring with the qualities. So what selection pressure is there leading to the increase of indigos among us? Its a nice idea that somebody might come along and save the world etc, but how could evolution be forced in that way?

   Please post more stuff in your future posts so that you don't flood this forum with useless trash like that. That's one of the reasons we have a post limit... even this is actually pointless, but I wanted you to elaborate.

People don't like admiting that they aren't perfect and need a lot of work.  So they construct mental prisons where they are king.  I think the Indigo theory is one of these prisons.

anti-social is only one of characteristics of an indigo. some are social so you cant base your furryness on just that alone. i know that when i read that i felt like it was discribing me most of the time. it felt a bit trippy but soothing at the same time. or maybe its just an way to make myselfe feel better for being condecending and pompus  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			I don't know whether I believe in the Indigo theory or not...It's...Weird?  It seems that everything I read describes these children very broadly and very loosely or else absolutely no proof is given.
<br />

<br />
And the wikipedia article I read made them seem jerks...Like &quot;I'm not going to listen to your authority cuz I'm better than you.&quot;  To further this, I've talked to some people who claim that they are indigo children and that they possess &quot;unconditional love&quot; but they certainly didn't act like--they acted just like the rest of us.
<br />

<br />
Maybe Indigo Children exist, I dunno, but I think a lot of people like to think of themselves as indigo either a) cuz the lists of characteristics they read are really broad or b) because today's generation of kids and teens are grossly egotistical.  *shrugs*  And just cuz a kid acts like he/she rules the world doesn't make them special.
<br />

<br />
Also: a lot of really great psychics i know are very full of themselves...i think they  believe so strongly in themselves it helps them to overcome self-doubt barriers the rest of us struggle with--that's why they're so good, that's all.

The &quot;Indigo Child&quot; was a new-age marketing ploy designed to make mothers feel that their kid is special.  After all, who's seen a toddler that <span style="font-style: italic">isn't</span> full of themselves?
