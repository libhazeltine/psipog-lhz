I've been having this feeling lately that there's a shield on the back part of my head that's limiting what I do. It's really bugging me and I wanna know how I can get rid of it.
<br />

<br />
Thanks.

<br />

<br />
im no expert but if its your own shield you should just be able to take it down yourself, then agen if some one else has put it there ( which is a wierd thing for some one to do in the first place ) then i dont think you will find any help in the articles, there should be someone on hear that knows about shields but its not me sorry, have you tried making a psiball and programing it to distroy the shield around your head ? that might work.

			If you are good at visualizing, practice imagining something (like I dont know a bunny) and making it dissappear. Then just try to make the shield dissappear.

wow...yeah that sounds really fun!! <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  *makes hammer*
<br />

<br />
But yeah that would probably not do good. Well, I'm not sure, I've never took a shield down so violently. Try it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

EDIT: btw, if you do it, don't get toooo angry...You might do something unintended. Like kill someone or something. Maybe.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

I would agree with you, if only for the sheer fun of smashing it, but having read <a href="../art-psionic-shielding.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">this article</a>, I would recommend otherwise...

			Yeah, taking down a shield too fast normally could be dangerous, but one isolated completely within your head? Even worse.

			Not only is this completely off-topic, but it's a stupid question. Now, let's look at why, shall we?
<br />

<br />
You asked if there was a place that the elite psions gathered at, which implies that there are some of us who have advanced past what should be considered kindergarten psionics (which if there are, there aren't many of us). Moreover, it implies that such people would gather for some reason or another, and exclude everyone else. If they were to gather, they would more than likely allow other people to join in, as they would probably want to spread such knowledge around to advance mankind. 
<br />

<br />
Now, for the sake of argument lets say there are a bunch of elite psions, who like to gather to discuss the finer aspects of reading people's deepest thoughts regardless of the amount of shielding and lifting tanks with psychokinesis, away from all the beginners. That would mean you'd have to be an &quot;elite psion,&quot; as you put it, to get in. Now, logically, you'd have to prove to them that you were an elite psion, which would be difficult due to being unable to find where to go without the aid of others.
<br />

<br />
Oh yeah, I almost forgot, you also resurrected a dead topic.
