			So, when I first found out about a psi-ball, I told and taught all of my friends about it. We all got really into it, this stuff is pretty fun, and we get results, though they're usually mild, they're still results.
<br />

<br />
So, one day we decided to play 'hot lava' tag up at the elementary school. I'm not going to explain what that is if someone doesn't know, but the person who is it has to have their eyes closed. So instead of trying to listen for someone, we sense for where everyone is at, instead. It's been going well for most of us, we can pick up where people are almost right away. We've also been practicing cloaking shields, and I got one up in 10 seconds once, it was pretty sweet, but my friend heard me breathing.
<br />

<br />
So, the question of this topic really is 'does anyone practice sensing people?' Cause my friends and I have found that it's a really usefull thing to be able to do. That's how I found a 'ghost' in my friend's house, too. I thought someone was standing behind me, so I picked up where everyone was in the house and didn't recognize who it was, so I turned around and no one was there. It's weird. The thing is attracted to energy, and from what I've heard about 'ghosts', they can't manifest without energy. Coincidence?

			That's a very interesting game. I practice sensing people quite a good bit, as well, but I don't have many friends who are serious about psionics. Actually only one... But that's beside the point.
<br />
I don't personally believe in ghosts, as far as them being roaming spirits of dead people, but I do believe that it may be possible to leave a &quot;psychic imprint&quot; in a specific location that could look like supernatural activity, and energy would be a very convenient thing to imprint into.
<br />
Also, I think that maybe if there's a lot of psi around, people, even non-psions, may put something of a presence into that psi if they're thinking of you, maybe a primitive form of remote viewing, and you can feel it better because you're more sensitive and there's more psi around you.
<br />
Those are my theories... Funny, I'm not skilled at all as a psion, but I have so many theories.
<br />
I should keep practicing.
