			I'm just starting psionics, I'm working with psi balls and very light PK at this point, and I wanted to know a few things, just personal opinions and experiences from other people. 
<br />

<br />
For one, how long does it take, on average, for someone to reliably and consistently spin a psi wheel like the one mentioned in peebrain's basic PK forum?
<br />

<br />
And also, what exactly do you envision happening when you use PK? Please be as descriptive as possible, I want to collect a lot of methods and then figure out which works best for me, and then maybe make my own method from them.
<br />

<br />
Thank you!

			I tried PK for about a month with the only thing me being able to do after that was tilt it a bit. But I'm generally bad at psionics. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
The only way <span style="font-style: italic">I</span> can get results is by imagining sort of wind coming from my finger tips.
<br />
And the gnomish method doesn't work for me at all.

			Well.the time taken for the breakthrough doesn't depend on person to person&gt;its based on your belief, focus and your effort.I don't mean to practise more than the prescribed time by peebrain,but practise,practise,practise....
<br />
In my personal opinion,I got my psiwheel spinning from my second day onwards.I think myself as a superhero,or a man with great potentials.And as if I am waiting impatiently to let my powers go wild.Just imagining.Also,I use the method of putting a timelimit.These are my personel opinions.Take or reject-that's up to you.
<br />
Good luck! <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I had a very interesting experience last night... I was typing up a lengthy response to the thread about stopping wars with PK, and my psi wheel is taped to the table right beside my laptop. Interestingly enough, even as I typed, it began to rotate, spun about 540 degrees around and then stopped (a full turn and a half) the second I looked at it. I almost got the sense it didn't want to be caught cooperating  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

Hey, keep posting, I want more advice from people, specifically what exactly you guys visualize.

			I actually tried and pushed with my eyes on one of the folds, and today, on my first day with the psi-wheel, I moved it 180 degrees twice. I had my hand next to it, and associated myself with what disturbes it so I could know it was me doing it. Whenever a breeze came in and moved it, it rocked a little. When I moved it, it just spun slowly but steadily. Also, I gave it a slight push with my finger, it spun about an inch, stopped, and went the other direction 180 degrees. That was the first major movement. I also visulized psi coming from my hand and pushing it. I can't believe I got it to move my first day, and the results have been replicatable the same day. You definately have to just know you can do it. The 'just do it' method seemed to work as well, just not as much, but I need to grasp the feeling I get when it moves. I can feel the energy. It's weird.

			Amazing. I've heard that it takes most people as long as a week to several weeks to even show good results with a psi wheel. My hat's off to you, man.

Now if I could just get some of whatever it is you're using... <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
