			I agree with some of the above...the apocalyptic dreams seem to be the most vivid.   I tend to either dream of nulcear war or meteor crashes.  Dunno why, but their always so vivid I wake up shaking and looking out the window for mushroom clouds or falling stars.  
<br />

<br />
I think the slight fear (excitment, love, sadness, etc.) lets you associate with the dream a little better.   just my guess.
<br />

<br />
(I have only pulled off the flying when no one was watching me.  I couldn't ever prove it to the 'dream people'  LOL)

			Interesting... I have a buddy who had post &quot;end of the world&quot; dreams. The stuff he'd tell me was just plain freaky.
<br />

<br />
One of my more recent &quot;fav's&quot; was just plain KOOL!
<br />
It was like a real kickass movie, it even ended like one... complete with a song playing just like they do in movies... the only thing missing was the rolling credits LoL, instead I just woke up. ( I dont usualy finish dreams, but I finished this one)
<br />

<br />
It was, from what I remember, a small group of people who got screwed over by their previous emplyer... and seeked to get whats owed to them (money) lots of it.
<br />

<br />
so they broke into this building and managed to pull off this massive heist, then escape by blending into the crowd, making their escape in a small crowded elevator...
<br />

<br />
It was weird cuz at times I was in the dream... then other times I was watching as if it really was like an interactive movie or someting...
<br />

<br />
eitherway... it was cool

			pretty much all of my LDs involved flying or jumping very high, and sometimes I felt like shooting blasts of energy and blowing shit up, and that was fun too. I especially liked one where all of my friends and I were at a friend's house, I went lucid, and told them all they were just mental creations of my mind, and they were all disbelieving, so to prove it to them, I switched the minds of my friend's dad (who was also there) and his cat. The dad started meowing and had a weird smile on his face, and his eyes were only half open, and the cat started freaking out hardcore, and everyone there was freaked out, and to prove it further, I took them out onto the patio and jumped into the air and started flying, one friend ran inside the house screaming, another started rubbing his face and shaking his head and walked into the house, and the third friend just stood there with a big goofy smile on his face, watching me fly. I got excited, heart rate sped up, and I woke up.
<br />

<br />
I've also had many apocalyptic dreams, involving shadow peoe killing everyone, zombies, aliens, and nuclear bombs going off. also had dreams of travelling to different solar systems and even galaxies and seeing strange and messed up planets and cities that I can still picture in my mind fairly clearly but are beyond my capacity for description.
<br />

<br />
My favorite dream of all time however, was a LD.
<br />

<br />
I once went lucid while dreaming of being inside my house. I realized that the house didn't look right, and then realized I was dreaming. Everthing was extraordinarily clear and real looking, and my perceptions and senses were almost identical to waking life. It was the most grounded I've ever been in an LD. I realized I could do anything. And I mean, ANYTHING I wanted. I thought for what seemed like close to a minute and came up with an idea! 
<br />

<br />
I would transform into a dragon!
<br />

<br />
So that's exactly what I did. I concentrated on a mental image of what I wanted my dragon form to look like. The image I came up with was a large, sleek looking white-silver dragon. I then held that image and concentrated on BECOMING that dragon. What happened next I remember with the glee and vivid detail. 
<br />

<br />
I felt my body begin to shift. There's no other word to describe it. It was like an odd gurgling throughout my whole body, and then I started to get taller. The whole scene I was standing in vanished automatically (at least I don't remember making it vanish) and I was surrounded by white. Standing on nothing. There was nothing, anywhere, except me, changing. I raised my hands, and watched them go from my skin color, to a grey, and eventually they started getting covered in scales of a shining silver.
<br />
I felt what seemed like a ball or something rolling in my stomach and then it went to my lower back and a tail began to sprout. I could feel it getting longer, and when it was done, it was weird, I only had like 70% control over it, although when it moved on it's own I could still feel that too. I was still growing, and suddenly wings exploded from my back. No pain or anything, just a rush of energy-like sensation all over my back and then wings sprouted almost instantly. I felt my head and face shift. I felt my face elongating and suddenly I could see my own snout! I have no idea how big I was when I finished transforming, but I would guess around 60 feet long, including the tail. I looked again at my hands, and they were covered in scales that were now covering my whole body. I could literally FEEL an odd numbness throughout my entire body. It was the numbeness of being plated in scales. Yet, when I ran my hands over my arms, I could still feel the sensation acutely, even though it was through a layer of hardened scale.
<br />

<br />
I looked around and everything was still white, so I created a scene in my mind and manifested it. The scene was endless ocean, expanding as far as the eye could see, with white blue skys and big fluffy clouds. I started flying around. I could feel the wind rushing around me and I had COMPLETE control over the beating of my wings. I could feel the wind collecting under the membranes of my wingspan and WHOOSHING as I pumped my wings up and down, and I could feel the immense speed with which I moved when I glided and did dives, coming close to but never touching the surface of the water. I decided to test out my breath weapon and pictured a beam of white pure energy as I inhaled, and sure enough, when I let the blast out, I felt a huge rush of energy coming from my lower stomach and up my elongated neck and out of my snout in an instant, and a huge blast of energy spewed out of my mouth, right through the cloud I was aiming at. (or maybe it was water i can't remember lol) I decided I wanted other dragons to fight and I thought of the classic DnD colored dragons; green, black, red, blue... And moments later there were several dragons of those colors, flying through the sky, and coming to attack me. This part here is where my accurate memory of the dream starts to fade because I lost the sense of calm euphoria that was within me this entire time.
<br />

<br />
I blasted apart the first few dragons with my breath weapon as they were coming at me, but one clashed with me (the red one i think) And tore into me. I felt little pain, but it was surely doing damage to me because I saw my blood and scales flying as it tore into my chest. I did the same thing to it and although we were high up, we were falling toward the ocean fast. I can't remember exactly what was going on, on the way down, but when the moment came where we hit the water, my teeth and mouth were wrapped around the other dragon's throat and im pretty sure it was dead or close to it. 
<br />

<br />
As soon as we submerged, the dream ended.
<br />

<br />
If i ever learn to master lucid dreaming, I WILL become a dragon again, while I sleep. No life experience measures up to that dream. It was by far the coolest thing that has ever happened to me in memory, dream or awake.
<br />

<br />
Though if I can ever MOVE something psychokinetically, that MIGHT top it. lol.

			My favorite dream involved some strange metapohircal stuff that doesnt seem to make any sense. The gist of it is that my and my brother climbed up a hill that was divided into levels that were like alternate levels of reality, all very different from each other. This dream is my favorite because of how vivid everything was, it wasn't a lucid dream but it was close. After reaching each level of the hill/mountain we would jump off and land in a lake, upon emerging from the lake we were always dry. Upon reaching the top and looking down over the last cliff, I could see the land around us for hundreds of miles. It seemed alot greener than the turf I'm used to. The feeling of accomplishment and bliss that swept over me as we jumped off that top was completely indescribable, you might call it ineffable : P. I woke up when we had fallen about one third of the way down

			This is not &quot;the best dream ever&quot; but it is the most realistic dream I ever had; also, I will never forget it. It happened years ago and I still partualy remember it... I think I was like 10ish years old when it happend. (so like 10 years ago)
<br />

<br />
I woke up, like I was going to school. I showered, and ShAVED! so... this is obviously in later years... anyways, I put on a fancy suit and headed off to work in like a flying car.  I get to this very tall skyscraper type building.(some stuff happends i can't remember) The next thing I remember is I am in a office with a window near the top of the building... I am sitting there then I see the strangest thing out the window. It is very far away, but it looks like some kind of flying saucer. Then (i can't remember what happens here its been to long) The next thing I remember is that the thing is on fire and falling right for my office.
<br />
Then the strangest thing happens... It was like a freeze-frame
<br />
millaseconds before impact, before I died. then I woke up scared out of my mind.
<br />

<br />
Also I remember 2 other things...
<br />
1. there was a TV somewhere in the dream(I can't seem to remember) and when I pass it, it is a news program talking about a war.
<br />
2. Right before the freeze-frame all I was thinking was &quot;I can't believe it is happening&quot; over and over and I really felt that state of shock.
<br />
3. Durring that freeze frame I had one Thought. &quot;This is the end of the world.&quot;
<br />
4. When I woke I still felt that state of shock.
<br />

<br />
It was creepy

			So many end of the world dreams... It's a conspiracy, I say. The government is obviously using their advanced mind control techniques to make you think of the end of the world so that you will think of something other than the government conspiracies...luckily I am immune....Worship Me!

			my best dream was REEEALY odd. for some reason i was getting on to a train. turns out the train was very cramped and going the wrong way.
<br />
we went over a bridge with a river underneath it (the odd thing was i recognised this river from another dream) then i think the train turned into a car, that i was on the front of. winding in and out of trees in a park.
<br />
then the 'car' steered upwards and i was flying. now that was cool.
