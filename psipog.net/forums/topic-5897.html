			sorry for re posting this agian,
<br />
not trying to annoy but please listen...
<br />

<br />
i know people always ask this but.. im not asking if i made one, im not asking how to make one, i read all the articals, i praticaly go to this site 5 times a day. i having been trying to make these for 4-5 weeks. i got know results. i dont understand why i cant make them but i do feel tingeling. 
<br />

<br />
all the things that could result in these feelings could be anything.
<br />

<br />
the tingleing- 
<br />
having your hands bent over for to long,resulting in blood not cerculating in your hand(the tingeling)
<br />

<br />
thinking you see light (flare) could just be visualizing a color and all you see is an after image afect.
<br />

<br />
not to annoy just i cant realy believe in something that i have no actual proof shown to me. i can listen to storys but i get to x ited and end up not being able to do anything.
<br />

<br />
if anyone could help me trying to make one i would appreaciate it.
<br />
i cant use msn or anything like that so if you could help me just post them here. thanks <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			Well, unless you have a natural talent for flaring, I don't think you're doing it yet. However, perhaps you could try a little method I use. Try to pulsate your psiball. If the tingling in your hand increases and decreases in pulses like you're making the psiball do, chances are you have it.

			Not enough is known about psi to know if it is your stanima, but I don't think so. What are you asking, exactly? Your doubt acts as a barrier in the progress of your skills. If you do not believe 100%, you will never get results.
<br />

<br />
Do NOT try to sum up the feelings as no circulation or something. This is part of the mental block you are creating for yourself, as it will severely hinder progress. Visualizing a color does not create an after-image effect. The after-image effect is a result of the photons being temporarily imprinted on the light receptors of the retina, which only happens when you look at physical light.

			Being directly related with stamina, we don't know. However, trying to do psionics while tired won't yield great results.

tired = low psi content in psi reserves , might be = to stamina....

			The only tingle I ever got from a psiball is literally on the surface, not literally in my hands.
<br />

<br />
We probably use some of our useful chemicals to gather psi, but we can't truely answer whether or not psi is part of our natural energy.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I say, if a results happens on the surface, it's probably a psi construct.

Yeah, so?
<br />

<br />
There is a difference in the tingle of what I get and the tingle of blood flow. Usually I can move my hand away and it'd be fine, unlike blood flow. usually it's only on surface area of my hand that touches the psiball and not feeling all around.

			u meant the tingling of numbness (bloodflow)? and the other tingling the real tingle of psi?

Also, it could be that you're making one, but you just aren't sensitive enough to feel it.
