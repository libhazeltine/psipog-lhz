			Well i will explain a construct that i've been using for sometime and I think it works pretty fine.
<br />
The objective is to make a normal psiball that when you touch it you notice it clearly.
<br />

<br />
1st make a normal psiball (as always  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> )
<br />
2nd program your psiball to release its energy and make it vibrate when someone or something touch his shield
<br />
3rd Shield your ball to keep it alive for some time.
<br />
4rd touch your ball and see your results
<br />

<br />
I think its pretty easy to make and the results are really awesome You can make your ball to release all the energy in a time or to only release a little when someone touch it.
<br />
This balls gives you a sensation of a little spark and you sense like ants runing on your hand since the energy disperses.
<br />
I think its a good technique and will help people to see his own results more credible than heat or cold or magnetic sensations  
<br />
<img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> hope it works fine for all of you  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />
You can try this with other people i have some friends that have noticed it already  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			wow, quite cool. I didn't think you could program a construct to flare like that. That is what you meant, right? Or was it just to tingle?

			This technique is not visual, its tactile, the vibrant psi that touch your hand makes you feel it really clear. It's useful for those that don't know very well if they had maded a psiball or not  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			In order to shield the Psi ball, wouldn't the psion have to know s/he'd created one?  Maybe it's just me, but I always thought people learned to make Psi balls and then how to shield (unless born with psi awareness, of course).

			<img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> I really like this idea, I am going to try it, right now. I thought I had a couple ideas but this one is really creative. Would it also be possible to shield the ball and make it instead of vibrating when you touch it to suck a small amount of enrgy from the one touching it and lighting up on the touched surface?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
