			I was thinking... I remembered having a dream before and it lasted for three days... As in I spent three days doing normal everyday chores and stuff but on a more extreme scale. As in I could fly, phase easily, read minds with ease, turn invisible easily and all that. And it was lucid. But a whole three days of dreaming?!?! In one night?

			Quite possible. I've read about a guy who did 100 <span style="font-weight: bold">years</span> in one night. Of course there is <span style="font-style: italic">no way at all</span> to prove any dreams, namely becuase they are a completely subjective experience. So take or leave any of this. 
<br />

<br />
This is one of my goals, and if I accomplish a year long dream, I'll post about it. But I personally believe it is possible, I have experienced dream time distortion, and I am fairly sure the limit (if there is one) for time is quite high.
<br />

<br />
Note the above is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> presented as fact, but as personal experience and the experience of others. Wouldn't want to start another &quot;chakras&quot; argument.

			If you're lucid, you can control dream time
<br />
a dream can last 1 second or one millenium...personally, I wouldnt want to have a dream that lasted more than a week...You might get too used to it and it might make your waking like seem insignifigant.
<br />

<br />
A good method is to use the lucid pill
<br />
Never heard of it...
<br />
basically, you reach in your pocket (in an LD) and pull out a pill (conjure it).  Then you say &quot;When I swallow this pill, my dream will last *desired time*&quot;  Then you swallow it. (duh)
<br />

<br />
The lucid pill can be used for other things too
<br />

<br />
e.g.
<br />
&quot;When I swallow this pill I will turn into a wolf.&quot; 
<br />
&quot;When I swallow this pill I will be able to fly.&quot;
<br />

			i've read about somebody who learned a certain piano sheet within a few minutes, for which people usually needed like half an hour or something like that
<br />
it was about auto-hypnosis, i think it was like he was in some hypnotic state while playing, and that afterwards his fingers hurt ...
<br />

<br />
i dunno if it's true, and i can't find the link, believe it or not, i don't know
<br />
maybe you can find something about that anywhere
