			video of me doing pinwheel is almost up, i had to hold my breathe when i did this, as mum is using the big mixing bowl, hence the short-outbursts of movement when im focused, and not needing air. and the spins would have been faster and more directional if i didnt feel sick, so after the vids uploaded, im going to bed.

if you saw my face, you would see how purple it was from holding my breath, im still having a little trouble with the pinwheel under the glass, although i have been getting 1/2 rotations at a time. Enjoy  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			maxus, you must be feeling great right now, I bet you can move pretty much anything (within reason) if you want - keep up the practice, and I recon you'll keep advancing just as quickly... Just believe!

Maybe try levitating? and have a camera ready!

			Hmmm the wheel doesnt seem to be moving that fast. Well not fast enough for someone that moved a mixing bowl. I still believe you but I would need to see a video. As for the spoon, the only reason I highly doubt is because you just started and you dont know the way you bend a spoon. You dont bend it like you move an object, you make it maliable by putting energy into it. You dont just try and bend it with forceful TK. Ive been practicing for nearly 2 years and have never bent a spoon by forceful TK. Yes, I have moved things before so Im not just talking from what Ive heard. I have some experience.

			To bend spoons by forceful pk means, you would have to be some kind of master at it. Never the less, he could have read articles on the correct way to bend spoons. 
<br />
Without proof, I don't think I can completely believe you. Also, I'm not being picky, but the way you said &quot;amazing...&quot; at the end of your post just seems like you can't do it. It's like you're admiring something that you can't do. If I could bend spoons I wouldn't be wowing it. I would always try to improve. I am almost never satisfied with what I can achieve with pk. But that's just me. It does seem a little fast, I agree. It's like you're pulling something new out of your ass every post; you research and then say you can do it.
<br />
 But I'm not accusing, I'm just thinking aloud really. I also understand that although the wheel didn't move as fast as I expected it at first, we all do at some stage exagerate to an extent and think it's amazing. Take neveza as an example, he can slide objects but not spin the psiwheel. Just because you're not incredible at the wheel doesn't mean you can't nudge a mixing bowl.

what an asshole, you have absolutely no idea about me, do you?
<br />
Why dont you shove an object up your ass and try and make it move, i heard thats a great party trick....Ever heard of complete beginners bending spoons, who the hell are you to say that i cant bend a spoon, i dont use forceful Tk, i store energy in it, then i give it no attention whatsoever, then i bent the bowl in with no more forcee than a small mouse can give.
<br />

<br />
And terrancoleman probably cant move the fucking pinwheel, you guys are just a bunch of complete assholes, it didnt happen to you this fast, so you stand skeptical, i find that unbelievable for someone who says they can do Tk, to tell others they cant, as i said earlier...Asshole.
<br />

<br />
Is there anyway to quit this fucking website, i dont need you assholes to tell me i cant do things with my mind.

Christ, bending spoons is less common than i thought, i said amazing after my post, as ive never done it before, this spoon is made out of iron, i tied it in a knot, i didnt use forceful Tk, i read what it said on <a href="http://www.fork-you.com," target="_blank">www.fork-you.com,</a> i felt like a real twat shouting bend at it, and going through my cutlery and asking every spoon to bend for me, bending that spoon using the method on for-you.com took me 3 hours for four days to have enough energy into it to make it have the consistency of butter, and visualising helped alot, i visualise it kind of dipping to one side, as in the matrix, but still, it took me quite a while before it became slightly maliable.
