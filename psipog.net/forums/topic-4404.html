			What if you could control water? You could be able to stop floods, or maybe even tsunami's?

Has anyone ever tried this? Has anyone in here ever controlled water with their mind, and say, stop movement of water? Like have u ever stopped a wave at a beach from hitting you?

I believe controlling water can be a good tool to save lives.

			Erm... I can't say that would be anywhere close to something many here could do. If our collective best psychokinetic act is to move something as large as a chair (going by the &quot;largest object ever moved&quot; thread), then stopping several million Newtons of force would be nigh impossible.
<br />

<br />
If we were to all work together - perhaps, but I would still seriously doubt it. To be fair, the first &quot;major milestone&quot; of this type would be stopping hurricanes, as a well placed area of calm could disrupt the entire movement and dissipate the storm. Still, I believe even that is beyond our ability.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Note: I have <span style="font-style: italic">no</span> idea what I'm talking about, and everything above is just an educated guess. For all I know, someone has developed a special technique to use PK to affect water (and, much to Sean's chagrin, has called it &quot;aquakinesis&quot;  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> ), or we simply have some very powerful lurkers.

 To stop a flood, you'd need to be like, a X-men guy or something, or train in about 10 lifetimes, but I suppose it could be done, with an almost infinite power...

but could you imagine gathering all the psychics from around the world to stop 70ft tall waves of a tsunami, with us all gathered on the beaches to try to level out the waves coming to destroy the world?  Even if we could stop such waves, how would we gather to do so?
