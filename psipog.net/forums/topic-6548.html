			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
Before I begin my rant, I would like GreenMango to know how much respect I lost for him (As if that wasn't low enough already). You're a disrespectful fool in my eyes. The utter audacity you have to create this topic based on two staff members of this communality is beyond my compression. This topic being created is extremely rude. I hope you understand that.
<br />

<br />
Both Roy and Dan haven't posted on this forum in quite a while. Neither have you, GreenMango. The last time you contributed to this forum was Nov 14, 2006. Please, explain to me why you would show up two months later when PsiPog is less than one week away from shutting down just to complain about two individuals that are no longer active on this forum? Explain that to me. I haven’t got a God Damn clue as to why you would waste not only your time doing so, but everyone else’s. I find this entire topic as pointless as it is rude and disrespectful.
<br />

<br />
I can’t explain the utter hatred I have towards individuals complaining about another without them knowing that you’re doing so. That itself is quite cowardly and disrespectful. It’s one thing to confront and speak with that individual that you’re having issues with, but to do so behind their backs unable to defend themselves? That’s extremely cowardly. 
<br />

<br />
People are more aggressive than others. That’s life. Both Roy and Dan are close friends of mine and I can tell you right now that they have reason to be aggressive towards others. Simply because, they’re usually correct concerning their statements and they‘ll certainly debate another who disagrees. They’re both adults with a considerable amount of intelligence towards psionics and other general areas in which they have participated in on this forum. Please, do not misinterpret their statements as rude because they’re aggressive towards their meaning. Both Roy and Dan would not share their opinion nor debate their statements without having a reasonable cause to do so. You’re not being specific enough when you stated “They need to lighten up”. Being aggressive in this world is not an negative attribute. Perhaps one day you’ll realize that. 
<br />

<br />
Once again, I found this entire topic quite disrespectful and I certainly hope others realize that as well. GreenMango, if you had an issue with both Roy and Dan, why didn’t you bring your complaints directly to them? I truly believe that would have been the smarter route to take. Both Roy and Dan have been members of PsiPog for many years. A lot longer than you have been. Please understand that I have full confidence that the reason individuals stereotype people like Roy and Dan (I’ve even been accused of being “harsh“), is because they have confidence in their opinion and statements. Which people misconstrued as arrogance. It’s not arrogance they’re showing, it’s confidence. Both Roy and Dan have enough experience and intelligence to come up with their own conclusions based on various topics to share them and explain them to another. 
<br />

<br />
Roy and Dan have contributed to PsiPog for many years. I firmly believe that members should be more appreciative towards the staff members who have spent their free time sharing and expressing their opinion by having the intentions of enlightening members with intelligence. These two men are great people. Please do not think otherwise. 
<br />

<br />
Take care,
<br />

<br />
- JoeT

Greetings.
<br />

<br />
I figured that I would take this opportunity to make at least one last post before the forums, and Psipog in general, closes shop.  I'm not quite sure why you'd want to bring this up at this moment in time, or why you couldn't devise any other intelligent topic of conversation, but I'm sure you have your reasons.
<br />

<br />
In regards to &quot;lightening up&quot;, I'm not sure what you mean.  If by &quot;lighten up&quot; you mean &quot;undermine my serious study into anomalous cognition by humoring the painfully inane musings of the occasional half-wit,&quot; then no sir, I will not lighten up.  If by &quot;lighten up&quot; you mean &quot;let unfounded, unsupported, and logic-void arguments stand tall upon fallacious legs,&quot; then no sir, I will not lighten up.  If by &quot;lighten up&quot; you mean &quot;attempt to inject a shred of intelligence and order into otherwise murky waters,&quot; then once again, no, I will not lighten up.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps the defining characteristic of Psipog was the community appeal.  I remember a time when this wonderful website was populated by mature critical thinkers who would rather think first, and then speak, and not vice versa.  I've watched as they were figuratively chased out, one by one, by a new wave of buffoons who devise these ludicrous techniques and try to pass them off as valid methods of psychic development.  To make matters worse, it usually comes to my attention (in a roundabout way) that these &quot;teachers&quot; are utterly incapable of the abilities they profess to master.
<br />

<br />
Psipog is widely regarded as a website for the &quot;newbie.&quot;  Certainly this is appropriate, but there is this constant problem where a &quot;newbie&quot; just learns introductory techniques and completely glosses over learning the appropriate mindset for furthering their studies.  I don't believe you come to Psipog to just learn how to make a psiball.  You come to Psipog to learn how to make a psiball and also how to critically view psychic science in general so that you do not fall into the fluffy pitballs that other websites prominently exhibit.  This is why there's no religion.  This is why there's no spirituality.  Critical thinking, my friend, is the way to start, and if in your later studies you find some value in the former ideals, then you explore them.  It's not the other way around.
<br />

<br />
The current generation of Psipoggers has totally lost sight of this goal, or they have missed it completely.  This is the message that I try to convey in my discussions and arguments here on the forums, and since it is a message that I deeply believe in, I will not &quot;lighten up.&quot;
