			Ok so i was watching those videos of jack that dude who can levitate things.  Well if you noticed he only uses a ball(a very light one, it's made of foil).  Why? well because a ball does not have corners so you can focus on the thing as a whole and if you try to levitate the psiwheel you have to focus on the four corner the whole object and keeping it stable(if you lose a corner it flips or something you will probably lose the concitration).  When it comes to a ball stability is not a hugh issue because if it flips it just like it was up.  Get where i am going.
<br />

<br />
I have never levitated anything but when you use common sense the best thing to start would be a ball.  
<br />

<br />
And just another i idea put the ball in a tube(clear tube) that is just a bit bigger than the ball so you dont have to worry about handling where the ball starts moving to!
<br />

<br />
Just an idea

			Thats a good idea to start with.  I have heard that pingpong balls work well also.  I also wonder if that guy is a fake or if he is just amazing at pk.  I guess ill never know.

Ping pong balls would be great.  They are a simple, pleasing shape to look at, they are light, and correspond with kikaida's &quot;theory&quot;.

			I hate to be the one that breaks it to you, but I'm almost certain that Jack is a magician.  Everything he does is EASILY explained with invisible thread.

			That would definately explain the jerky movements, and why the jerky movements only happened when he moved his hand in a particular way.

			yeah, I now think that he is a big fake.  This is because I use to be a magician and this all seems so plausible with an IT but, who really knows for sure.  He really could be great at TK or it could be a magic trick.  Never assume anything.  
<br />

<br />
Maxus- if he was doing tk, then that could to explain the jerky movements since he might lose focus for a sec although your right, and he is probably a magician.

			Yes, but I've seen videos of him with the ball inclosed in the glass. How's that them? The movement is jerky because not all TK is smoth. Mine isnt.

			The point is round is still easier than a square would be.  Just think lift four corners now lift on object at once round is easier.
