Thank you for sharing your opinion.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I have trouble dealing with anyone who doesn't exist, or even almost dealing with such. But that's just my opinion.
<br />

<br />
For the record, OBEs are not generally considered Satanic, devil-worshipping, witchcraft, or cult practices by those who know about such things. They're considered crazy and figments of your imagination by the majority of the populace who have heard of them. Go figure.

I agree that is you are not meaning it to hurt anything or anything of the such, it is probably not a problem. But I have this bad feeling in my gut that someone will misuse it for the wrong things for self pleasure. <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />

<br />
And this is for everyone, not just felix the cat. So im not a hypocrite in saying that some messages should have been pm'ed. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> haha!
<br />

<br />
And Zaxol? I.E. Sean? You have no saying in this, but I want to say something. If you get it accidentally, you are not dealing with the devil. If you get it on purpose, then I feel you could be dealing with the devil.

Just like, say, a car. If you use it in the correct way and drive places, cars are good. If you use them in the wrong way and run over people, they could be bad. Yet cars are not evil, bad, Satanic, or anything else of the sort.
<br />

<br />
It's the same with OBEs. Think of them as a tool. Like any other tool, OBEs are not inherently good or evil; they simply exist, and can be used for good or bad purposes.

			um....how could an OBE be used in a bad way? If you saw like a naked girl across the street, how bad could it get? Tell the girl what you saw and she either slaps you in disbielf and for &quot;lying&quot; or punchs you in belief but thinks you have a telescope. I mean come on now, how bad of a thing could you do? You can't kill a person (living) or harm them (also living &gt;.&gt;)
