well wifi sources are where you actually can connect into the net, though now that i think about it, it might  be possible to make a construct work to send your signal to the internet... almost like telepathy with the internet?
<br />

<br />
anyways, being worth it... i'm not sure, most of us use the net for recreation, but then in the off chance of emergency that the internet would be a good resource for help, it might be. 
<br />

<br />
well, if you could make a construct to store information you could in essence make a mental internet browser and you would not need to consiously translate it all. but i am lightyears from that personally. ^_^;

			I think something was mentioned in the arcticles about sending constructs over the net as a fun game, but as for making a system for it all i'm not too convinced, although you might be able to make a construct to inhance the speed of your original one, effectively giving you a better connection somewhat. Then again it would probably fry it completely! Interesting to see if you can actually affect electronical chips...might try it when I get good enough. Has anyone here tried sending a construct into an electronical device before?

i dont think a virus would be cappable of dammaging the mind though, a windows virus cannot harm a mac, because macs operate differently. same way, a virus for a computer shouldnt be able to do dammage to the brain because it is also operated differently.

			I'm not sure how this would work really, but when you brought up this thread it got me thinking, if the internet exists in computers, why not in some sort of psi form? You know how people over chatting can use TP, why not have many people create a network of constructs that can broadcast information? That might be just as difficult as the WIFI thing.. but what do you think ^^

			But just think, if you were a gaming freak, you were good at lucid dreaming and you had a wi-fi signal near your bed, you could play games while asleep! *drool* Maybe even 'hack' into servers to play on them! The possibilities are endless! I've got to try this...
<br />

<br />
On the more technical side of things, it would probably be more a case of mimicking the router, and making it send the signals into your brain. The making of the psi-router would be quite simple, as long as you have some experience of self-programming constructs. Though a large problem I can see is about where would you 'plug' it in. That would probably be important as plugging it into a random place would be rather useless. I'd imagine it would need to be connected to somewhere that either processes information generally, or into an area that processes information from a certain sense, i.e. sight. And I'd also think viruses wouldn't be a problem, they're designed to work with 1s and 0s, not chemicals and cells. A good imagination would probably help with this too, visual information would be easiest available via the 'mind's eye' so you'd need to be practiced at visualisation to see much XD So from this we can make a minimum requirements list!:
<br />

<br />
-Brain with at least 2 terrabyte harddrive
<br />
-Psionics v2.7.4.0
<br />
-Experiance with self-programming constructs
<br />
-Wi-fi interent connection
<br />
-Latest drivers for Mind's Eye (C)
<br />

			You'd have to be insanely fast to comprehend all the data you'd be bombarded with.  Let's say your connection speed was 20Megabits per second.  That means 1,000,000 bits of data per second.  Yes, all your nerves are sending data to your brain more quickly than that, but your brain developed to process that kind of information.  There is no part of the brain that processes that kind of data.  If you somehow did manage to do it, though, you could probably access the cellular network too.  That would be hot.

			You might be able to counter that with lentating (I think that's what it's called), but I think you're underestimating the brain quite a bit. I'm no neurologist, but there's probably a hell of alot more than 20 megabits going around now, what with sight, touch, hearing, perhaps smell and taste, and alot of conscious thought as well as unconscious. If you were browsing the net, it would just be visual data, if you were a playing a game, it would be visual and tactile. The brain can process this type of data, but you may need something to change it into a format the brain could understand. I wouldn't have thought brains work with .jpgs and .dlls. This could be built into the router construct. But then again, the brain may just interpret these as if they were direct sensory feeds, so it may not matter at all.

			&quot;Psinet&quot;! That's actually a really cool name. Or we could have instead of wifi, psifi. And instead of myspace, psispace. We could take over microsoft and make contruct computers called psiPods.

actually, a 'brain virus' would probrably not work like that. if it was set for translating, you it would still just be technically thoughts. if i thought of a brain eating virus, it wont kill me. now, on the other hand, a program to repeat phrases and try to subliminally control you would be the major consern.

and why not make a shield for a 'firewall' ya know?

			i suppose it'd have to be a very careful thing. the major problem with the idea is the difficulty of the programming, as the person would need to understand the source code of the web page in order to see the page. it'd be a lot of work, i'd assume plain images floating around the internet would be easier to see though.
