			I've been trying these psi balls out for the past 3 days, now i know thats not much time but I'm not sure if what I'm feeling is really a psi ball or is it just because my hands are tightening up? It feels as though there could be something there after like 2-3mins ill move my hands closer and further apart and it kinda feels like when you put to magnets with the same charge together, however when I move my fingers it goes away....so is it just that the muscles in my hands are tightening up or what???

			Well, I can only speak from experience, but.... 
<br />

<br />
When I first started making psiballs, I got the exact same feeling.  Why don't you try an experiment.  Hold your hands in the exact same position.  Now, move them back and forth like you did before.  I would suspect that you will get the same feeling.  What happened with me, is that I relized that it was the same feeling which meant that my muscles were just tightening up.  Keep at it though, and I'm sure that in time you will make  a real psiball.
<br />

<br />
Also, some advice is to not move your hands back and forth.  If it is a real psiball, your hands will move apart with out you moving them in first! 
<br />

<br />
Good luck, and let us know how you do!,
<br />

			Your first days in psiball training will be rather experimental, and you'll need to find out what method you use to sense your psiballs. When I first started out, I got the magnetic feeling. However, that quickly transformed into a temperature-based feeling, where my psiballs are quite warm (or cold, if I wish them to be so). So, keep practicing, and you'll find a way that suits you.

			Clover just brought something up that I forgot to say!  Don't expect a feeling...just be receptive. In other words, if you expect the tingling or magnetic feeling, it might come, but wouldn't be a psiball, only your mind. You must let your feelings go, and just be receptive to the new ones!

Good luck!,
