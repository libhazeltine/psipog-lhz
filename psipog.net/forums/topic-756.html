			I'm just voicing my opinion but I think not talking about combat is a pretty stupid rule, I mean, there's a good chance people will get attacked at one point or another, and if the attacekr won't listen to reason, the person should know how to fight back to SOME extent, as opposed to just sitting there keeping up your defenses. and also, knowing about these things helps in coming up with ways to defend against them.

Well, I would think combat would take quite some time to bear fruit. A bad situation is a psinoob getting mugged and saying &quot;mind attack! nunununununuunununununununun!&quot; Then, after he learned something, starts giving random people migraines in the mall. Little positive would come out of it, and a load of negative. If you want to defend yourself, learn akido or some martial art.
<br />

<br />
Unless you were talking about defending yourself from a Psiattack. For that I would think passive aggressive is the way to go. Eventually the psiattacker would just get bored and move on to giving headaches to people in the mall.

Well, if you are saying &quot;attacked&quot; by the fact that it is physical damage to your body...you should just learn a form of karate to defend yourself instead. Because lots of people have argued about it and I don't think they have gotten anywhere.

			I think it is pretty obvious that he was talking about psychic combat.  You cannot learn karate to defend yourself from that.  But to refrain from going on and on, here are <span style="font-style: italic">two</span> links to threads that already talk about this:

			I don't find it too obvious that he meant psychic combat because he said that you are bound to get attacked eventually and to my knowledge getting randomly attacked by a phychic is pretty rare. And yes it doesn't necessarly have to be random but if it isn't random then you would probably know it was going to happen and then you would be able to refrain yourself for doing and covince the attacker that violence is not the answer. I am insulted and I am going to go to cry in me room and eat 2 more pizzas now...how do you feel? Huh?

This hints it majorly.  How do you &quot;keep up your defenses&quot; in physical world?  Plus, i dont think he would be talking about something like karate in a psipog forum.

			I can understand why not, and I also realize that saying you are bound to get attacked was a little exaggerated. But the chances of it are increasing, because psionics as a whole is increasing in popularity. But whatever, I guess I was just discussing the positives without looking too much on the negatives, and I can understand it what with this being a very popular site in the world of psionics, and therefore it's much safer for a smaller site to allow combat discussions. But these are all just my views on the subject, which I can't stop saying. If you want, Just forget I said anything.

			I think those are good rules, but a tad overcomplicated. To me they all say the same basic thing - Show respect in everything you say. However, I feel it is wrong to say 'Dont talk about this'. Limiting freedom of speech never solved anything. However, thats just my 2 cents.
