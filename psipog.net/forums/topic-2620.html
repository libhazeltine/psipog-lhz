			Alright guys, I don't know much about the Ear Drum and what happens from loud noise mix with compressed air can do to it, But I do know that I went temperarly deaf untill I put psi on my ear drums and imagine a bunch of blue men with weilding torches, sealing up the cracks and reconstructing it to work more effeciently.
<br />

<br />
It first went for pinging to this pressure which i didn't enjoy so I blocked some air from my Ear Canal to stop the pressure and eventually, it went back to normal, took about 30 mintues, but it eventually ended.
<br />

<br />
so, is this DMILS or my ignorance believe it was psi.
<br />

<br />
No, I didn't get my ears checked.
<br />

<br />
OH, I never put what caused it. A kid behind me with bubble wrape, popped a bubble into my ear.
<br />

<br />
I just had a bit of Deja Vu.

			Hmm, it's hard to tell.
<br />

<br />
Could have just been, temporary pain that would have gone away anyway; and your blocking the air into your ear canal helped numb it quicker.
<br />

<br />
Or maybe you numbed / healed it psionically. If so, that would probably be classed as DMILS.
<br />

<br />
I really can't make my mind up on which one it could have been.

			Aidis|Thantos said he had the same exprience with his ears (not what happened to them) and said that it healed around 30 minutes without psi on the chat.
<br />

<br />
I just was confused about it since it happened to fix right when I started the proceedure.

			this kinda happened to me once when my (now Ex) girlfriend slapped me and hit my ear quite hard, i went temporarily deaf in that ear for about 2 hours, but my hearing went back to normal by itself, you probably sped up the recovery using DMILS.

			i dont know DMILS or what it mean but i tell you something when your ear have noise like sssssss or zzzz <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> i dont know how to explain it . or like you get temporarily deaf then put your 2 index fingers in your 2 ears or block your ears little strong from hearing for 2 seconds or so then quickly remove your fingers then your hearing will become good again ^^ .
