			The whole point of Psi is to learn how to mentally both recognize and manipulate energy in order to acheive our desires. But few people recognize how important UNDERSTANDING energy and its effects on us actually is. Well I've been theorizing a lot lately. (About 10 pages worth so far) and I've decided to split them up here for you all to enjoy. I'd really appreciate feedback on this. So far, everyone I've talked to about this makes sense and I may even go as far as writing a book on the topic. It actually links both science and psi and spirituality together.
<br />

<br />
Before I begin I want to make this clear that when I say &quot;spiritual&quot; I'm NOT saying &quot;believe in God&quot; or whatever else. I'm either A, relating to a certain frequency (which you'll read about later) or B using that as a picture since that's the only way I can describe or relate to it. Are we all straight now? Good.
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />

<br />
Energy is constant. Being unable to be created or destroyed, it's constantly changing and being manipulated as it transforms from CHO molecule to glucose, or a ball sitting on top of a hill to rolling down. My point is that it's always changing. FYI manipulating energy is the basis of all spells. 
<br />

<br />
Here's where my theories actually start: 
<br />

<br />
My theory is that energy is arranged in frequencies that your mind picks up and translates. Think of it like sound, an infinite number of sound frequencies exist but we're only able to pick up and translate a certain range of them. It's the same type of thing with energy. 
<br />

<br />
Okay so you have your different frequencies. What do they do? Energy is what gives you a stimulus to turn into an emotion. It has 3 levels: Dark, Neutral and Light. 
<br />

<br />
Now for the spiritual part: 
<br />

<br />
Only about 50% of the energy around is dark or light and the other half is neutral. To get this theory, you would have to learn how to recognize both dark and light energy: 
<br />

<br />
Dark: Think of your worst nightmare you had. If you concentrate on it enough, that dream omits a general signal that remained constant throughout that dream. The signal that you feel from this is dark energy. This makes up the bottom portion of the energy scale. It's the lowest frequency of energy. 
<br />

<br />
Source: Well it's hard to say for this one. On a spiritual sense, we have things that are evil, Hell, Satan, Demons. On a down to earth sense we have common emotions such as fear and anger. 
<br />

<br />
Light energy: (Trouble for the Atheists). Since I'm very spiritual, I can only explain this in a spiritual way: Think of a memory of some spiritually significant moment. For example, being at church, a certain moment on a mission trip. One of those moments where you feel really close to the source of life. You feel safe and happy. This signal that the memory brings to you is the light energy you felt at that time. Light energy is the highest frequencies. 
<br />

<br />
Source: Emotions: Happiness, peace, contentment. Spiritually, we have Angels, and other celestial deities, also stars, and the moon. 
<br />

<br />
Neutral: Neutral is the most complex and there are a few different theories for what causes neutral energy and that is an equal amount of dark and light energy reacting together and energy that has no specific signal. 
<br />

<br />
Well if you're still having trouble with that, think of the pH scale of acids and bases. Below 7 is an acid, above 7 is a base and 7 are neutral. It's like that but on a much greater scale.

Yeah sure. I just figured they would be easier to read broken down.

			I'm gonna rephrase what I said in the other topic in this one too. You have no connection yet between the forms of psionics AND you're very misinformed. Energy does not take forms and good or evil. You're taking the easy way out, it seems logical energy, which moves at high speeds, would be the force that creates these ESPs. ALso that this energy has frequencies. Slap on some ignorant spiritual crap and you sure have one pile of bullshit. If there really was dark energy we would see it because no matter what science would pick up on these frequencies since our mind can. There would be some variation between evil matter and light matter and neutral matter. Since there isn't evidence and you just made logical assumptions, your hypothesis is nothing, for now. The basis of everything can be traced back to a single thing, energy. We are still peicing things together but einstein made a big leap by showing how matter was basically frozen energy. Energy even behaves like matter at high levels. When something gets really fast its mass increases. I even believe that dimensional space and the laws of physics relate back to a source of energy. Leave out the different frequencies and just say energy comes in complex patterns that our subconscious understands.

That's fine if they're broken down.  I just want them broken down in ONE thread.  That's why I suggested multiple replies to this topic, with each part.  Either you can do it, or I can do it.

			Ok...to my honest opinion is this
<br />

<br />
part 1:.........lets just say it was hard to contuine reading...
<br />

<br />
part 2: I can understand where you come to some of this and some of it makes sense but I just don't agree with a lot if it.
<br />

<br />
part 3:........I just don't agree with it, but enjoy that you bother to think about it.
<br />

<br />
part 4: Some sense...but some of it is rather fluffy.
<br />

<br />
First thing I thought is that you keep calling it a theory and when people corrected you (which what I would have done) you then said you have evidence but yet I have not seen a single bit of it.
<br />

<br />
Part 1: You just repeated what so many other things are in such as ripples of light waves or sound waves. You didn't say anything about what form this energy would take in. To me it just soundes like you toke the word energy and put togather the good, the bad, and the strange in order to make sense out of the spirital realm. Its like you believe you found the absolut form good and evil and what lies in between in a &quot;simple&quot; energy form. Far that I am adware of nothing like this is ever so simple. I know you gave this some thought but none of this adds up. I'll be more then happy to hear your reply on this. But seeing religionish views might lock this I am willing to hear this from you in a private message still.
<br />

<br />
Part 2: I'm just going to say that the main problem I had with it is that you speak of receptors being able to tell what the energy means. Now I'm no brain surgon but from what I know about the brain is that certain signals to certain receptors tend to give certain thought. But from what you have told me that any receptor can read it and be able to tell what it is to everyone else.
<br />

<br />
Part 3: I only like to ask a certain question. What do you think of infinite?
<br />

<br />
Part 4: I won't even bother with answering this but I will say its better then what I have seen. So I give you thumbs up on that.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
If you say you have evidence I would like to see it...but right now I hardly beleive in this at all and go on so many things but I would rather not till I can hear your reply. From what I saw on that other topic you seem to be connected with &quot;theory&quot; of yours rather strongly on some form of sense...
<br />

<br />
I will say no more...like to hear a reply soon as possible. <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" />
