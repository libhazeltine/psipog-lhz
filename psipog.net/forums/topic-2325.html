			I was about to suggest the same thing myself. There haven't been any events for nigh 2 years now. A flare party or a TK party would be cool. Is there a specific reason this hasn't happened? Or is it lack of planning? Becuase I think somebody should get behind a new event. I know I would.

			Most of us don't have the time or the patience to run events. Before I became a moderator, I ran both private and public practices. I stopped because of attendence issues. People said they would show up, and they didn't. Quite simply, it wasn't worth my time.
<br />

<br />
We get a lot of people crying &quot;MORE SEMINARS! MORE EVENTS!! MORE MORE MORE!!!&quot; but really, what do we need seminars on? Telepathy? Check the existing telepathy seminars section. Why repeat what we've already done? From my point of view, it's just really not worth it.
<br />

<br />
Something that also must be kept in mind is that we all have lives to live. The majority, if not all of the moderators, are adults, and as such, we simply do not have the time to run extra programs that may or may not be attended by a substantial amount of people. I personally work shiftwork, which is four days of 12 hour shifts in a row. These alternate between four days and four nights. On my days off, I'm busy catching up on those days that I've missed, with family, friends, and a significant other that lives approximately seven hours away. Even if a flare party or a tk party were the slightest bit interesting to me, which they aren't, the time commitment, which is dependent on those who wish to attend such an event, isn't something that I have time for.

			What eversosleepy said is really true...
<br />

<br />
What sorts of events would you be interested in?  Seminars are ok, but honestly I think they are a little boring.  It's just like a huge Q&amp;A session, mainly.  If you have questions about something, just ask... you don't have to wait until a seminar <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

PK Parties are fun.  We just had one a little while ago, on January 28, 2006.  I couldn't make it because of an emergency, and I think Kingcob and Roy ran it.
<br />

<br />
We've only had one flare party, and it was challenging to run, and took up a LOT of time.  It's not just the event that takes time, but setting up a webcam, getting a server, creating a way to stream videos to a large audience (around 100 people), and keeping it all up and functional is really hard.  Then the event takes up a few hours, on top of all that time.
<br />

<br />
Usually I spend maybe an hour or two on PsiPog a day... and that's just to catch up on the forum, chat, email, tech support, and blog.  That sucks up my time real quick.  On the weekends, I try to program on the next big update, and relax too.  I mean... I work 40 hours a week in the Air Force... that's life.
<br />

<br />
*shrugs*  Perhaps I'll run another PK Party soon... I was bummed out I had to miss the last one.  My days off are Wednesday and Thursday, and I'm trying to get them switched so at least part of it is on the weekend, so more people can come... but that takes time too.

			I say that we get a big vote of how many hours a day people are usually free...and maybe one for the days also...that way you can pick out the most available people who are also responsible ...but mostly the parties are quite time consuming as mentioned....so far aim and msn have served well enough for gatherings <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />
