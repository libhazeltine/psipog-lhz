			I'm VERY sad to hear PsiPog is going....<img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> even though I haven't posted much, and didn't join till june, I've been lurking these forums since they came online.
<br />

<br />
While I'm not sure that I understand(or agree with) why you are doing this, I  respect it.   And I very much respect you for giving us not only time to deal with this, but also just letting us know, no matter what others think of you for it.
<br />

<br />
With that said, PsiPog will be SORELY missed by me.   It's the only place that I can find that I can read/talk about this subject(which is actually very much a part of me) without either getting flamed to hell by skeptics or without reading about new-age fluff. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
I SINCERELY hope you consider putting PsiPog into the hands of a prominent member of this site instead of taking it offline.   I see no reason not to(If you do, please tell us so we can understand).   To lose this site(not only the articles, but the forums; and the attitude/frame of mind that PsiPog represents) would be such a shame. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />

Good luck on your future endeavours, Peebrain.

Solus me and a couple other people go to PsiOnline if you'd like to hang around there, its a good place, right now its just missing some people after a string of server problems <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
As to the site closing, I wish Peebrain and the one's who choose to follow him in the new community luck, unfortunately that path you have chosen I am not meant to follow for quite some time due to personal reasons, so I will probably not be joining you on the new community. Thus I have to say my goodbye.

			Wow.  Just wow.
<br />

<br />
I read your blogs and I don't think I've ever been so inspired before.  Some of you may be laughing at that, but over the years I've been entirely too cynical for my own good and for once I felt a sense of... I don't know?  Peace?  Excitement?  Motivation?  As though I were starting a new adventure?  And as I read it, the psi wheel on my desk (which I could move with some success before) started spinning madly in circles. xD
<br />

<br />
I knew I couldn't accept the mechanical world for what I saw it.  Thank you for starting me in the right direction to prove that to myself as well.  I will be sad to see this site go, but I hope everything will get archived and I hope others will have the motivation to start their own sites as well (I'd hate to have to resort to Astral Society for my PK needs =/)
<br />

<br />
Thanks Sean.  Thanks for everything.

I was thinking this, and i also couldnt agree more. I have been a member for a while now, and i think that it is just stupid to shut down a site that has made me and hundreds of other members happy and feel good. 
<br />

<br />
Its sad to say, but before i went to psipog, i felt alone in this world. I had no skill with anything. No talent. When i started reading your articles and learning how to do things, i became a very good healer and an OK telepath. If it wasnt for this site, i would have just been depressed. I would do the same thing as i was before i found this site. I would go to school, come home, go straight to my room, and just lay there for the rest of the night, being depressed. Psi might just be a fun little hobby to you, but it means a lot more to me and many other members. Psi is hope to me. Hope that someday, i will be good at something. Hope that someday, i will help someone. Hope that someday, it will all be right.
<br />

<br />
If you take this site down... if you destroy this community, i will just fall back into depression, and probably end up the same way as i was before i started psionics.
<br />

<br />
Please Peebrain, keep the site up. Give it to someone else if you want, but keep it up.
<br />

<br />
(while typing this, i almost cried thinking about how i was depressed before this. but then i didnt, because i remembered that i can still do psi if i wanted to, and that gives me hope)

			Well, this is a surprise.  Maybe it should be in the Hello and Goodbye section lol!
<br />

<br />
I think taking Psipog offline is a mistake.  I appreciate you want to do something else with your life which is, of course, fine and totally your responsibility.  What about the newbies?  What about the people who are sick of stupid books that, under telepathy, can only suggest card guessing for practise?  
<br />

<br />
When people initially become interested in psionics, the first question is: how do I find out about this stuff?  The answer is: nobody cares, nobody will respect you for asking questions.  Now shut up and get on with your homework!  For those who aren't put off by this, the next source of information is usually from a series of misguided and badly presented books in the darkest corner of the remotest bookshop.  So you do a search on the internet and discover there is even more fluff around, and when you start talking about your interest you are either thought of as not quite sensible and laughed at or treated with suspicion.  Psipog is one of the few places where people like this can talk without worrying too much about fluff or other peoples attitudes.  Wouldn't the destruction of such a place seem foolish?  
<br />

<br />
Of course Psipog has to develop and progress and sooner or later, various mods will end up leaving for a variety of reasons.  But I don't think that is a valid reason to remove the website and its community from the net.  Youve founded a great site and a great forum and as you admit, the emphasis has changed from proof to teaching.  That surely isnt a bad thing!  The idea that because the ideas behind a site have changed means it should be taken down is similar to the theme park owner who says, at the back of my mind I know I dont like rollercoasters or rides or anything.  Ill sell the park to a developer who will demolish the park and build houses, keep the cash and live life in the fast lane. without any regard for the impact of the park on the local town.
<br />

<br />
I also think that a lot of people come here for reasons other than to prove psionics to themselves.  For example, when I read The Chrysalids by John Wyndham at about 13 or 14, I didnt become interested in telepathy because it is cool.  Well, I did, but my aim was to be able to hold conversations telepathically like the characters in the book.  It is only 8 years down the line that I have any semblance of telepathic ability at all, and that is due to Psipog.  Your goal might have been reached but mine has not.  Im sure others here feel the same way.  We still have people signing up who have never done psionics before and want to prove it to themselves, just like you did at 16.  Should they be prevented from achieving their dreams, just because you have achieved yours?
<br />

<br />
In short, when you leave Psipog (and you will be missed) why not hand over the management to someone else?  Certainly the articles should stay as theyve helped a lot of people, but the sharing of experiences on the forums and chat is just as valuable.  Perhaps a new forum could be created with two sections: one for newbies (essentially what we have already) and another for advancing beyond the basics.
<br />

<br />
Finally, I would like to thank you for all your hard work in creating this site, and especially for putting up the forums.  When I joined Psipog last summer, it felt a bit lonely and clinical but now it is a much more friendly and vibrant place.  It is certainly great to know that there are other people out there who believe that telepathy and psionics are real.  Viva Psipog! <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Well, sad as it is to say this, but this day had to come.  Sean has his own ambitions, his own vision, his own path.  Whether or not we like it, it's his choice, and I deeply respect it.  It is a shame to be &quot;losing&quot; one of the greatest Psionic sites on the internet, but times change my friends. 
<br />

<br />
 Sean, (like I said in your blog) I wish you luck in whatever it is you are hoping to accomplish, and your journey in life in general.  You have been a great teacher to us all.  You taught us the value of healthy skepticism, you wrote articles that helped us with psychokinesis/telepathy/energy manipulation ect... I know that I would have never moved the psi-wheel if it wasn't for your articles and the way that you write and &quot;speak&quot; just for the newbies.  
<br />

<br />
This is (IMO) the best beginer's site on the internet, and I believe that &quot;giving&quot; it to a respected member, or at least keeping up the forums (or archiving them) is a wise choice.  The friends I have made, people I have helped, and people who have helped me out will always stick in my head, and I will always remember them.  I think every member here has touched another in a very good way; hopefully, a rememberable way.  
<br />

<br />
Members, whether for 5 years, or 5 minutes, remember everything you have learned on this site.  This was a great site, and the forums were an excellent &quot;icing on the cake.&quot;  You all have learned sooo much from here, never forget it.  If you choose to continue your psionic journey you will have the skills you need to succeed from this site.  If you don't choose to continue your journey (not sure why!) then you will have excellent life skills and knowledge attained from this site.  Retain everything you have learned and teach others as well.
<br />

<br />
I hope we all can remember how this site affected us, and all the things we learned.  But don't think of this as the end, think of it as a fork in the road.  You have two roads, everyones' is different.  Both will lead you to success in your enlightenment, and the skills here will come in handy.  I appreciate everything Sean has did, and everything PsiPog has done for me.  I'm glad that Sean has reached this point in his life and this understanding.  I hope that we all will  meet again someday, somewhere along the road, to share what we have experienced, and what we have learned after this change takes place.  But until then, let's make the best we can out of this situation, have fun, and learn from each other.
<br />

			All I can say is  that, you are most certaintly aware of your life. I feel many of the things you also feel about skeptism, I'm sure many of us do. I just hope you will leave the articles or archive the site. We don't want to see all these articles, like the libary of Alexandra, go to waste.

I don't know what to say - psipog taught me so much...without it, I wouldn't be able to learn so much. Psipog was my foundation of psionics.

			Not sure what I can say here that doesn't sound cheap <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

Psipog was an awesome place to hang out for, these 6 or so years. It has helped me grow alot, in many ways. It has helped many people overcome some problems that they have had with Psi. It definetly has helped prove Psi is real to many people. Peebrain included, me included, and others.
<br />

<br />
But, I think it has ended it's useful life for me, as well. This is not something that I have been &quot;hiding&quot; and waiting to tell, I enjoy perusing the Psipog forums and helping people out. I know there are many people who do still need help, too. That is why it is very difficult for me to &quot;say&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
I think we all should reflect on ourselves. What does Psipog do for me right now? I spend most of my time dealing with Psi by going on the forums. Going on the forums, and reading/responding to peoples questions. But, not focusing on the most important thing to myself, my growth. 
<br />

<br />
Not to sound selfish, because I do not intend to come out that way. Everyone of us should look at our own personal growth as the number 1 thing that we consider. Because, as you grow, you are inclined to help people more and more. Until I grow more, I know I can't help people out without repeating myself to the bitter end. 
<br />

<br />
I am currently seeking &quot;Truth&quot; in life. This applies to all aspects of life. Psi included. It is time for a change. Because unless we change, we will only stagnate.
<br />

<br />
I hope that everyone can understand this, even though some of you have been here for a short amount of time. 
<br />

<br />
Just remember, &quot;Psi is not over.&quot; You will ALWAYS be able to practice, and I will definetly NOT stop. But, there are other things, that can help you on your way. Other areas of your life you need to grow in. Because unless you do, you will have no true purpose. Just a set of goals that will repeat itself in a viscious cycle until you can't think of more goals, or until you can't complete anymore.

I'm not gonna talk about psipog closing down because yeah whatever its gone. 
<br />

I'm gonna talk about what you're doing now Mr. Peebrain.

I always said to everybody that they should find some purpose to do psi and they never had one. The real quest should be about what me and you are doing. We are trying to find the real meaning and the real existence. Meditation and OBE's are good ways but I found a better one. A little while back I meditated once and had an experience that was unforgetable. It was my first true meditation and it led me to a place (mentally) that I cannot describe. Ever since I've been trying to ratify this with practical thinking because the experience itself was important yet I didn't understand any of it. I've come to the conclusion that this state of mind is a place where understanding does not exist and thus you cannot understand it. I think me or you should start something to teach people about just these things. Teaching others will make them think about it and give us insight about these types of &quot;spiritual&quot; things.
