			Regardless, you don't know what I've seen or experienced. Simply put, I've observed strange occurances, and just as much as what I believe in is argued myself, and you if you fail to see such things, then so be it. Let your ignorance be your downfall.

are you serious? i've never heard of quantum cults not that they don't exist because i dont know of them, but please ellaborate a little.

Exactly how is knowing that quantum physics is not an explanation for these phenomena, if these phenomena do indeed exist, being ignorant?
<br />

<br />
Did I say you cant have experienced strange occurances? Did I say what you can or cannot observe? No. I merely explained how quantum physics is unlikely to be anything to do with it. Your assumptions and insult would suggest you are insecure in your beliefs, because unless quantum physics was your only means of explanation, I really havent attacked them at all.

I mentioned one in my post. RSE or Ramthas School of Enlightenment, it uses quantum physics as a scientific basis to attempt to explain the effects they claim. They also show a distinct lack of understand as to how quantum physics actually works. 
<br />

<br />
There is also The Secret. A movie behind which is a group that is essentially all about positive thinking but take there views a step further (for a small fee of course...) and believe you can actually alter reality with your will. Once again they use a poor grasp of the quantum physics to back it up. 
<br />

<br />
I know there are others I believe one was started by a quantum physicist but ill have to look it up. Oh and note that while The Secret and RSE do have scientists to back these claims the same two scientists speak in both of there connected movies. There is a reason for this. No quantum physicist worth there salt would want to be associated with these groups. (RSE had one other physicist but he was furious with how they edited his interview to look favorably upon the group, while he was adament that quantum physics does not support there belief system. A rather underhand tactic in itself.)
<br />

<br />
Quantum physics is very prone to these things because it is so bizzare. It is easy to take people in with real physics experiments demonstrating the seemingly impossible at quantum level. Its then a much smaller leap to get perfectly rational people from the science and in to the absurd.

The secret is by no means a cult. They don't want you to worship them or try to recruit others for their cause. It's just a movie they sell for 5 bucks a view. I've seen the movie and it is loosley connected with quantum pysics and isn't necessarily made to prove its own existance. It mainly focuses on that it isn't impossible and how it is useful. I have never heard of the RSE, but I have seen The Secret, and it isn't a very good example of a &quot;cult&quot; formed because of Quantum physics. They are also not the first ones to present their particular theory.
