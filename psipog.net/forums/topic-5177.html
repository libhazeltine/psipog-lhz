Thought it was time enough that I joined the forum. My real name is brian although I would appriciate being called leo. I been actively studing psi since I was 13 (now 20). Mostly recently I have been jumping from gift to gift studing what I little I can. My current obsession is psychokenesis where I am working on a pencil. That about all there is so ill see you all around the forum.      </span>

			Welcome To the PSIPOG forums, Brian.
<br />

<br />
just a couple of things. don't forget to read the rules here&gt; <a href="topic-756.html" target="_blank">http://psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=756</a>
<br />

<br />
and here's a list of valid 'kinesis terms &gt; <a href="topic-11.html" target="_blank">http://psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=11</a>
<br />

<br />
'gift' is a bit of a fluffy term to be using around these parts, and it's more commonly accepted to say 'skill' as it sounds far less amateur.
<br />

<br />
practice well, have fun, please keep all arms and legs inside the ride at all times, etc.

How isn't psi a gift? It enriches our lives, developes our minds, and gives us an edge over the non-practitioners. How doesn't that qualify as a &quot;gift&quot;?

			Gift makes it sound like it was given to us by a bigger force (a god) which can get into an arguement of religion and get locked.  It also sounds like it was given to only a few of us.

Ability or skill is more accurate because it is practiced and increased.

Mind if I make an example of you? Not a bad one, but a good one!
<br />

<br />
See, I'm glad that more members like you are joining. The skill part is a very excellent asset of being here, but there's something I'm personally very excited about.
<br />

<br />
THIS GUY USES BASIC ENGLISH! 
<br />

<br />
Seriously. Just forming good sentences that begin with a captial letter, end with a period, and don't run on for an entire paragraph puts you in the position to be very welcomed by people here. Having that been said, I welcome you, with open arms. Contact me if you have any questions about the forums, and even about the main site.
