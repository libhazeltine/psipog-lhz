			One time when I was waiting for a friend of mine in the school library I got anxious and tried to tell him to telepathically come to the library.  I visualized a link between us and pictured the words going through the tube telling him what to do. After a few minutes he came! He said he came to the library and said I wasn't there so he went to his class. This is where it gets weird. He said after being in class for a while he felt a random impulse to go to the library probably around the time I sent the message!

			Aw man. Whenever I try that...it never works. I'd say it was possibly recieved telepathically by him. It also could have been a coincidence, or something from his part sensing to go to the library. But either way.

			Thanks for responding. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> When I tried it again it didn't work except one time where I thought I influenced my mom to change the radio station. I thought it might have worked because she wasn't doing anything for a while. Then suddenly she changes it. More unlikey than the incident with my friend. Perhaps they had weak minds! Muhahahaha! I read about this guy that could rob a bank via telepathic suggestion and he did as an experiment and returned the money. The teller got a heart attack from the shock! But luckily he survived. Although I have doubts I still practice now and then.

			that sounds more like just telepathy.  Telepathic suggestion has the connotation that you are making them do something against their will.  With the incident with your friend, he said he felt that he should go to the library.  should is the key word.  you didnt make him.  Remember, if this topic turns into a topic about telepathic suggestion (which it is close), it is regarded as combat.

That doesn't make sense. I mentally SUGGESTED that he go to the library. He didn't say anything about hearing me telling him to go there.
<br />
And by the way, you can't stop me from talking about TS (not against the rules as far as I can remember). And about the bank robbery it was an experiment that the teller didn't know about. It happened in Russia. I think Joseph Stalin put the telepath up to it (Stalin scared the crap out of him when he pulled up next to him in a car telling him to get in). Here are the details: Stalin tells the psychic to steal a certain amount of money from the bank by using a blank piece of paper as a check! He commands the teller to believe it's a check and the teller gives him the money. The psychic comes back later, gives him the money, and shows him the piece of paper he passed off as a check, then the old teller gets a heart attack but still lives. They also performed other experiments. To Apollo: I guess I agree that it was more of suggestion than commanding. And I didn't mean to hint at warfare. I just wanted at least one person's opinion on the occurrence.

I agree with Roy. To me it sounds like advanced pinging or a normal instance of telepathic communication.

And I also don't like the topic of telepathic suggestion.
