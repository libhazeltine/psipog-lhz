			OK, I know the title sound like a lode of rubbish, but just read on anyway.
<br />

<br />
When I?m trying to induce an OBE, the biggest problem I have, which results in an unsuccessful attempt, is that once my bodies asleep, my mind goes into a wild state where it just makes up a lode of crap ? like voices, strange scenarios, etc -.  As one of the key components of having an OBE is clearing your mind, this can be a bit of a problem.
<br />

<br />
So to prevent this wild state of mind, I have created the ?Yabba Yabba? technique.  Where I quickly and continuously ?yell? ?Yabba Yabba? in my head, from the moment my body starts to go to sleep.  Concentrating on saying this, in my head, over and over again as fast I can, stops my mind wandering of onto crazy things and also allow me to divert my entire attention away from my body.  
<br />

<br />
After continuously repeating ?Yabba Yabba? in my head for a while, I tend to ?trance out? and, more often then not, leave my body.
<br />

<br />
I don?t know if this will work for anyone else, and that it sounds crazy, but I thought that I?d put it up hear in case it helped anyone.
<br />

<br />
Happy (if a little crazy) OBEIng to you all
<br />

<br />
~ Andy
<br />

EDIT:  You obviously don?t have to use the term Yabba Yabba, that?s just what I use

			In my head, this seems like a really good idea.  Yabba might not mean anything, but you flood your head with it anyway, thus bringing a blank mind. Yabba Dabba doo!

			Sounds interesting, I will prove it tonight. My problem is that I only can have an OBE when I'm already in a dream cause I can't stand awake (of mind) since I trance out of my body. I hope it can helps  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

<br />
Well i've tried it, with this technique i can get easily the body paralysed but after that my mind started imagining and i couldn't concentrate, so I slept.
<br />
I've to try this again  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  it seems a good technique but i need to be &quot;stronguer&quot;  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			Thanks for the complement, I?d like to hear how you get on with it.
<br />

<br />
I think that I forgot to mention in my original post that I have found the more I use this technique, the much more effective it becomes.  Possibly due to my subconscious creating an ?anchor? between thinking ?Yabba Yabba? and inducing an OBE.
