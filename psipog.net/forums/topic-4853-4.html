			Meditation is essential in fasting, since it slows down all of the bodily and mind processes, less energy is expended. We do not know enough about psi to know if it could sustain the body. You can program it to do some very cool things, but it remains to be seen if it affects the physical. I don't think that psi has any nutritional value.
<br />

<br />
Well, maybe, but not for your physical body, more for your mind, but only for balance and to promote better functioning. Food is still needed whatever the case may be. Of course, that over 1-year fast tells us how much we do not know about the subject to argue it endlessly.
<br />

<br />
After I read it though, it just says he claims that he did this, with water, and occasional tea, coffee, and buttermilk, which all contain nourishments in one form or another. It doesn't say how often he consumed said substances, either. I do not think that is very credible. It said that according to his website the fastings were under supervision. Biased source right there. It's <span style="font-weight: bold">his</span> damn website, after all.
<br />

<br />
I believe it may be a useful source for using solar energy as a method of mind/body/spirit healing, but that is about it. It is said that our skin takes solar energy and creates nutrients from it when the light hits the skin. Dunno to what extent, just something I heard. Anyways, interesting thread.

			I am not a doctor, but I'm a Physical Therapy major and when people fast the body gets energy by using the fat and water reserves it has saved up.
<br />

<br />
To make this a little more scientific for you DanielH, how about we conduct experiments, edwardHowl, what if you went to a doctor, got a physical and find out how healthy you are and then go get a body composition test done. Fast for a month or how ever long you want and then when you're done go back to the doctor and find out what he says. It's as simple as that.

Are you directing that towards me? If so, perhaps you should learn to chill out a bit. I was only stating that because I do not generally go through 4 pages of information to catch up to a thread unless it is quite interesting. That means I respect you and your thread. But if you just did insult me, you have lost some of my respect (as if you care). Well, I am sorry for your anger.

			Fasting is eating <span style="font-weight: bold">no food at all.</span> Even if it is liquid, it is still food as it provides nutrients just the same as food does. Your body expends less energy to digest it even, so you get more than you think from liquids. A true fast is the complete absence of all nutrients in food form, solids and liquids.

I agree. Otherwise you would be able to just use a blender and liquify all your food.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  The only thing that should be allowed is regular water. Without any food <span style="font-style: italic">or</span> water your done in 10 days.

			Hi
<br />

<br />
Again this thread is ridiculous. Actually, in this forum it's even double ridiculous.  Why you argue in this way i ask to some of the people out there. Why get so upset? It's just funny. You hear about a guy who can do stuff like that or at least he claims to being able to do it and you get so upset, because either you want that it's proven to be right or to be wrong. 
<br />

<br />
I think when you master your own mind you can do some amazing stuff.   Like Psychokinesis and all those stuff and eventually being able to control your own body. Normally, your body will get energy through food that is being digested and therefore giving energy to you, by burning the calories. 
<br />
Now, imagine your mind being able to draw energy from for example the sunlight, which provides a big amount of energy and bypassing that energy directly to the physiological functions without the digesting part. Maybe you just got the idea of it wrong. I don't say it is easy, but i don't doubt that it can be done. By saying it is not possible or it is fluff or anything you don't change anything, except in your own mind. But you don't really get near the truth.
