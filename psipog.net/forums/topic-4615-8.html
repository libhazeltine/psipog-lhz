			I'm not entirely sure I believe in all of this phasing stuff.....  I mean, it just seems so fluffy.
<br />

<br />
I guess I might have to give it a try, are there any other articles other than Rainsong's out there?   Or any information on this at all?    I'd like to do some more research before attempting it.

			I've been a little preoccupied with my cancer for a while, so im a little out of practice with the old psychokinesis, and ive been finding it hard to phase again. Does anyone have some websites with a good article on phasing?

			no, but you can try to practice your energy manipulation.  if my theory is true (&quot;fluffing&quot; out your sheilds to break the electromagnetic repulsion of atoms) than that would fall under energy manipulation and should help.  we don't know a lot about phasing as of yet, so it could fall under pk or energy manipulation.  try both:  &quot;once the impossible is eliminated, all you have left is the possible&quot; (something along the lines of what sherlock holmes once said).

			lol maybe we could all practice and start one?
<br />

<br />
anywhoo im gonna start practising phasing, defintalely gonna try n put 2 objects together and lose my concentration hehe.... btw i will probably record it on my webcam if am able to phase objects with me. 
<br />

<br />
hmm...my dog has given me an idea, what if you were to phase through anything organic? like for example My Dog! or another person or tree or something...hmmm  it would be cooler to see than walking through a wall thats for sure.
<br />

<br />
also maxus can you possibly describe to us what it looks like when ur phasing? is there like just your body dissapearing or is there some type of distortion?

			Ummm... guys, can you give me some help on controlling phasing anyone? As in concentrating...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />

I sent this post so late because just now I PHASED THROUGH MY BED... again  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" /> 
<br />
Some of you might know I've been accidentally landing in the living room recently  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />  And I need your help because this is getting frustrating...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" /> 
<br />
The last time I done it was last week... the gaps between spontaneous phasing are getting shorter  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> 
<br />
What the hell does that mean?!?! I'm not going through anything am I???
<br />
I might start phasing through the floors of my school!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />

			Hmm your very hard to  take seriously. I don't think you honestly would be here without a broken limb if you phased through your 2nd floor bed. You actually witness yourself falling through it? Your consious but in a trance the whole time? Give us something to go on, otherwise just focus on not phasing, programming shields to prevent this. As rainsong has done.

Well, shit happens. Do they actually believe what they saw though? I think if you just let it go they won't say anything, cause I mean if they tried to tell someone else, they probably wouldn't believe them.

I wouldn't worry.

			my mum HAS saw me falling through the bed and I land on the sofa (right below my bed in fact) but I didn't break any limbs and besides, our house is tiny my head cold skim the roof if i tiptoe  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  But anyway, I'll try strengthening shields and I am kinda in a trance but in a dream (this is so hard to explain <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> ) But I do know that I am falling through because I land on the sofa and it's been witnessed. I'll try and make a video but how do I know when I'm going to fall? I can't control it or anything it just comes randomly.

			Hehe, now that's cool. I mean that you can phase to that extent. No pain no nothing. This is where it could be actual fun and useful. I mean if You gain control of it, then if you get into a fight and are stuck in a hold then you can phase out, or even so phase whenever. Watever, point is you should control it one step at a time. Control it so it doesn't randomly happen and only when you want it to.
