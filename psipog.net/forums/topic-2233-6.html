			I did it while staring at the smaller hand of the clock all the time today. Had to cut off at 45 mins though, because of some blood trouble/ burning sensations in my foot. I ignored it for a while, and it was swollen when I chose to stop. I could have gone much further, and will in the future. Damn foot.

			Tell me about it! <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />  I tried a bit of motionless when my parents where out couple days ago and the kept ringing me. <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />  My mum rang me 30 mins into it, and my step dad rang me 45 mins into another one after. Pissed me off. It was a good thing I stopped after that because someone else rang and when I looked I didn't recognise the number. Imagine if I had got up for <span style="font-style: italic">that</span>. That really would have pissed me off.

			I don't know how important the phone calls are, but wherever you are, try to test yourself to the max. Ignore phone calls, people, animals, tv, everything. Sometimes I like to say to myself when I motionless meditate &quot;Nothing else matters right now&quot;.

			Everytime you notice that something in the outside world is tempting you, or making noise or other disturbances, you should immediately ignore it and deepen your meditation/focus upon your inner self. Just get entirely lost in your own consciousness. Focus on your consicousness swimmin in black empty space. Just totally get emerged with that emptyness in your mind/consciousness and if you do that, you'll soon notice that you forgot about the phone ringing. This is real meditation. Wait this reminds me of something I read in an article on psipog, I believe it was NI's. Let me look it up and quote it here.

<br />

<br />
I can?t answer that question. But if you think for example about the following situation it might show you a possible answer. 
<br />

<br />
Imagine yourself meditating and suddenly something explodes in front of your window. In the same moment your meditation is over. You get up and run away to see what?s going on. It happened because the energy provided by the explosion was stronger than the energy invested in your meditation. 
<br />

<br />
Now imagine yourself meditating very deeply. Someone outside calls your name, but you don?t realize it. Your body still hears it physically, but you don?t realize it and keep meditating. This time the energy invested in your meditation was stronger than the energy used to call your name. </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

			Other than MartialArtist, have any of you guys gotten up to 2 hours? (this might be a bad thing, [I bet it is]) but I would feel more motivated if I actually had to compete with someone...so if any of you guys have gotten up to 2 hours I will have to challenge you and get higher.
