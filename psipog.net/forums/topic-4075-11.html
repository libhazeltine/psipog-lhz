			Well, I successfully got violet, only it was incredibly hard to notice.
<br />

<br />
As for red. I have a theory.
<br />

<br />
People tend to be discouraged after one attempt because they associate red with eye problems. STOP DOING THAT. That's why it's going painful Associate it with something good happening to the eyes, then it should work without any pain.
<br />

<br />
First time I tried violet, I did that, it ached like crazy. Now I don't and it's fine.

			I'd like to add, that I've been working on this for a little over a month now as well. 
<br />

<br />
I've personally been trying to get two different colored eyes, one blue and one green. I have naturally blue eyes, and I've noticed that the one that I've been trying to change to green has indeed changed to a much lighter color, but the other eye has been changing slightly as well, creating the image of still similar eye colors.
<br />

<br />
My question is, does anyone have any tips that may help this situation a bit?

I think as you make the affected eye green. The eye you want to stay &quot;dormant&quot; should be affected also. In your mind you can do it whatever way seems best, but as I read your post the first thing that came to mind was a small circle/sphere of color just a little darker then your own closing in on the eye you want to keep the same color. And esentialy 'dying' the eye its own color or... mentaly letting your brain/eye know you want to lock that eye the color it is and the sphere closing in around it would be like a &quot;seal&quot;.

			Well I've been at it for some time now, and learned a few things..
<br />

<br />
 Using a gem is bad, unless you can put it under the same light all the time, so that it looks the same... 
<br />

<br />
I'll begin looking in the old mirror again, but even if there is no visible change I noticed one super important thing and that is.. my subconscious or something close to it <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> must be listening to me because I've found meditateing on this works best when my eyes are being hit by light, its really hard to do it in the dark ( who would have guessed those words would come out of a guys mouth ). 
<br />

<br />
Back on topic: I was siting there with a light on overhead, and I thought to myself, something I never noticed before... when I do this thing I meditate and imagine my iris almost completly closed, I noticed it was having some inital reaction because... the light as seen through my eyelids, wasn't as bright as when I first closed them, it was almost black. At first I thought maybe it was just my eyes adapting but as we all know... when your eye lids are closed... its pretty dark already <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  and normally the Iris' opens when you close your eyes, like anyone will remember, when you make those late night bathroom runs... or, when your mom cuts on the lights to wake you up in the morning.
<br />

<br />
What are your thoughts on this? Espeically those who have done it before....
<br />

<br />

<br />
P.S. when I was doing this same thing earlier, I never noticed it being as dark as it was when I closed my eyes, just noticed this today....

At least try to go for something natural, otherwise people will just assume it's contacts, no matter what you tell them.

			Solus is right.. .it is dumb...
<br />

<br />
not because its naruto
<br />

<br />
im a naruto fan, i know what the sharingan is, and i know what the magenkyou sharingan is (ppl who are american &quot;fans&quot; arent cool anyway cartoon network naruto sucks)
<br />

<br />
the design isnt amazing and everyone would think its contakts... i assume it is possible.. but not to someone who hadnt &quot;practiced&quot; changing there eye color on more then 2-3 ocasions SUCCESFULLY because its red wich isnt natural ive only seen one person in RL with red eys and her eyes are usualy brown/gold but sumtimes get a dark crimson or maroon look. and alsoo it has another color.. black and that isnt only hard because you must make it dark in one area and not the othe rbut you have to make a small precise design also
<br />

this isnt true (directed to whomever said that) because i have a couple friends who's eyes have red in them. One is a very pale blonde boy who has green eyes wich transition slowley into an orangy red now and again. then theirs another one, named ashlee who has beautyfull blue eyes with a ring around her pupil wich is very obviously red.
