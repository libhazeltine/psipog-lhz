			This is a technique for drawing energy. Previous to learning this I was only able to make a psi construct. 
<br />

<br />
Sitting outside in the sun I went through a relaxing meditation. With an eased mind I placed both feet shoulders distance apart on the ground and imagined a pipe running from my knees to the center of the earth. 
<br />
After I could hold that image/feeling in my head I added the pipe from my knees to hip.  Waited for memory to catch up, then hip to heart.
<br />
Theses simple pipes could be ran though the rest of your body, however for my arms and head I was more interested in drawing energy. With the pipe work already laid out I just placed palms up, spine erected and added deep breathes. 
<br />
Visualizing on the in breathe energy being drawn from my arms and head to my heart. Then exhale, running that energy through the pipes to the center of the earth. I guess if you thought of energy as water the pipes might be easier to sense.
<br />
After a energy flush I capped the pipes on my feet and filled it up to the brim with pure. Think about how a seal works and re-centered. The most important thing is the small details.
<br />

<br />
Now the way I came about this information is from a number of sites and personal trial an error so if you?ve read something similar its because it is. Placing it here is my way of giving it more attention. Also, if anyone has advice on getting higher volumes of energy to start running please feel free to post.

			frequently my energy load is imagining myself part of the electical sockets which gives you that magnetic/static electricity feeling and also imagining myself as a ball of fire which done right will heat up the whole body rapidly but you channel that heat into the hands. Hands will get extremely hot but those are the two main ones that i use. I would be very careful on the fireball imaging one as i think that one can lead to being a fire starter.
