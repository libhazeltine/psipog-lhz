			That would be using Psionics for combat and such talk is frowned upon here.
<br />

<br />
Why would you want to do such a thing anyway?
<br />

<br />
You're talking about using this on a NON-Psionic? If you used it on a Psionic, at least they'd have potential to defend against it, but a NON-Psionic who has absolutely no defense whatsoever?
<br />
That's malicious and cruel.
<br />

<br />
I'm sure you have your reasons, but ask yourself if they are 100% justified. There are other things you can do.
<br />

<br />
I'd suggest that you NOT practice such things on other people, as you don't know what you're doing (from a training perspective), you may end up causing severe damage to someone, or yourself.

It's good to talk. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

also i dont have intentions of draining psi off other people just for the sake of it or combat, in fact, i dont intend on doing it anyway, just wondering how harmful PSI can be.... also if i were to use it, it would be used for self defence <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

I think it would be extremely hard too, but I still think it's possible. Even if it took 100 years or more to accomplish, I still think it's plausible. True, lack of oxygen would make you faint, but we also don't know what an extensive lack of psi energy would do.(if anything) Especially losing it all very quickly and without any exersion of energy from yourself.(The one who's getting it drained). If it's possible to gather/manipulate it from anywhere, why couldn't you gather/manipulate it from a person? ..Just a question
