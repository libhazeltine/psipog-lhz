			what do you mean by &quot;invite&quot; if your inviting them then how would they get to your dream without being aware that they are in a dream state??
<br />
i guess theres gotta be a method to go and get them yourself.
<br />
hmm but it sounds difficult  <img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" /> 
<br />
how about hmm while your in a lucid dream .. imagine a big door with a pic of the guy/girl you wanna dreamwalk into, drawn on it.. then open the door.. and maybe youll see that persons dream and just jump in there and kidnap him  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> and do the same again and again till you gather all the peeps you wanted  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

wouldnt it work? <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

			SamuelDKelso = naughty mind, but unless you could enter their dreams, how would you 'invite' them, you could just make a time for it, say 4pm GMT, then everybody meets in a particular place, like near a train station, or the north pole, but you would have to be connected telepathically aswell, otherwise everyone would be 'nonexistent' in eachothers dreams.

That very well may be true. =) I can't play a lick of guitar, but in my dreams I can play complex songs. I mean, I instinctively know the chords. Imagine having a whole band of people, that would be amazing.

			Shared dreaming???  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  You can count me in any day!! My time zone is pacific and I live in California. The only thing left for me to do is experience a lucid dream. Can someone help pull me out of the dream world and wake up my subconscious enabling me instant lucidity....sorta like they did with neo?

Thanks!

			hm.... of course if this works, we'd all have to send pictures of eachother.
<br />

<br />
I don't think this'll work though.  What you could do, is create a separate universe in your dream, take people you know, create them, program them as you think they would act, react, and see if you could like... save your progress for another dream.

			You don't need pictures of each other; all you need is a pre-existing location in the dream world. A popular one is the lucid crossroads, because it?s well, cool. It has a detailed site about it so that you can envision it correctly and get there. <a href="http://www.lucidcrossroads.co.uk/" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.lucidcrossroads.co.uk/</a>
<br />

<br />
From there you can just all go through a door to another place and mess around, or stay at the crossroads. Try not to screw the place up too much though, other people use it. As far as being lucid, all you guys need is one person to be lucid and &quot;wake up&quot; the other people. Although if you incubate your dreams so that you start out at the lucid crossroads, you'll probably be lucid anyways. Some people claim that shared dreams don't depend on time, but I think that?s false. So I would recommend that everybody is dreaming at the same time, however you want to accomplish that is up to you, but I would recommend a Wake Back To Bed at the same time. And make sure to take time zones into account. 
<br />

<br />
And last, to make sure you were actually there, everybody should do the old password swap, so that when you wake up, you can compare it on the forums by PMs. That is if you weren't doing that already.

			Sounds like a neat idea, but I can't lucid dream  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> .  Mostly because I forget to try, though.  Maybe this could be a motivation.
