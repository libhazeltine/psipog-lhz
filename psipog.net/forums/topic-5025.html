			Since I began practicing making psi balls a couple weeks ago, I find that whenever i cup my hands in a similar manner to the one I use when practicing, that I feel the same sensations as associated with making psi balls.  Is this psi or my mind messing with me?
<br />

<br />
Thanks in advance.

			I'm tired of you newbies and your skepticism. If you don't feel that you aren't making one then cease in all action and stop, apperantly you don't have enough confidence in yourself to do such actions.

One and only way, I could think of that shows it's a real psiball, without another, is to fucking move it to point A (your hand) to point B then back to A. If you still don't know if it's Biofeedback or a real psiball, then get over it or stop doing psionics.

			I'm afraid that you misread my post.  Allow me to explain.  I have made psiballs before, but when I cup my hands in the way that I do when making them, the same feelings occur, even when no focus is put into making a psiball. Is that biofeedback or a psiball?

Could be both, I mean, they say you can develop type of reflexe, such as a muscle memory, because you do the same thing over and over again so it become a reflex. Then it could be biofeedback..that's up to you.

			I would say biofeedback. In my experience psi doesn't just go somewhere that easily, it takes some concentration on my part. But everybody is different, so take that into account as well.

Hostile much? Sometimes it's good to be a bit skeptical and not think every possible feeling could be psi-related, otherwise you're not going to improve.

There is a fine line from Smart skepticism and stupid skeptism. There is a fine line from too little skepticism and too much skepticism.
<br />

<br />
Most psions so far, use the stupid and a bit over the line of too much. To the point where they need a hand to guide them back. It's really pathetic to see such thing.
<br />

<br />
I understand a little help goes a long way, but I'm tired of those that expect step by step explaination on how to do something,  from detail after detail, just learn something as simple as a psiball.

			Maybe we're inferring differently, but it sounded like he was asking an honest question on whether what he was feeling was a psi ball or not.

			First off, I agree with kcirbmab. Neveza, he asked a simple question, and you lashed out with him. You called him stupid, a newbie, and a couple other things he didnt deserve. Heres a thought, instead of making yourself seem like an ass, try to help others, or just dont respond, nobody's holding a gun to your head.
<br />

<br />
As for bart, I think that may be BioFeedback. Now, I'm not highly educated at all, but I'm assuming your brain notices that you have your hands cupped together, and tries to just emulate the feeling of holding a PsiBall. I don't think it should feel like a PsiBall without concentration. Instead of focusing on what your hands are feeling, ignore that and keep concentrating. If someone else can feel it, you've made a PsiBall.
