			For the past year or so, I have had occasional encounters in the second half of the night. I'm not sure if they are entirely products of my own mind, but nearing the end of my sleep, I'll have the feeling of being in my bed, asleep, and something will be on top of me trying to drain life out of me. I attempt to fight, but it's vaporous and intangible, and I try various things to drive it off. Usually I fight it with my will, sometimes attempting to reverse things and drain the life out of it. IN any case, over the course of time, I seemed to win most of these encounters, and it gradually grew weaker.
<br />
Then, 3 months of NO encounters at all, followed by ONE encounter. At that point, I could tell it was considerably weaker than when it first begun, and I was able to easily dispatch it. It then did not return for quite some time after that.
<br />
HOWEVER, very recently, it has returned, stronger than ever before. I was not able to dispatch it this time, and had to force myself awake several times, then changing sleeping positions (Which is a good way to avoid a repeat of a dream) however that had no effect on things. I was fairly tired, and fell back to sleep easily. At one point I attempted to draw the being's body into my hand, basically preforming a psi-ball but using IT as the source of power. This disoriented it for a bit. I ultimately escaped and woke myself up enough by moving my thumb to my mouth while still in the dream state, and biting my thumb, allowing the pain to awaken me. Despite being asleep and dreaming, I had an awareness of what position my limbs actually were in, and was thus able to manipulate them.
<br />

<br />
I'm a bit worried at this recent development in things, however. Perhaps some of you have experienced similar, or have some knowledge on this.

			Uh ya.... This sounds borderline fake but if had to say something to help then... Ignore it. And pray if your religious cause from what you said its obvious it's trying to hurt you. Unless it's another person doing this to you then praying should help. It always does in one way or another.

			I don't really think this thread should be locked just because of one post. That's a tad overkill, don't you think?
<br />
And, it's not exactly hurting me, well, not in a sense that I'm feeling any pain,  anyways. It USED to try and drain my life out by sucking the air out of my lungs and making it hard for me to breathe, but this recent time, it just kind of immersed my entire head within it's.... whatever the hell it's made of, and I could feel a strong pulling, vaccuum type thing.
<br />
And any attempts to talk to it tend to wake me up. I've thought up a strategy or two, but I won't know if they work or not until the next time it happens.

			How come whenever someone posts saying they're under psionic attack, then everyone says it's fake? It's possible to be attacked by someone, you know.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Anyway, here's what you do:
<br />
1. Before you go to bed, meditate for 5 or 10 minutes and then charge.
<br />
2. Make a shield programmed to protect you from the attack.
<br />
3. The shield probably won't last all night until the attacks, so make a
<br />
     psiball. Crunch it down and put a ton of psi into it, until it's really powerful.
<br />
4. Take the psiball, and shape it into a harpoon gun, like the one in Jaws.
<br />
5. Program it to shoot a harpoon with a cord attached to your bed, and to stay up while you sleep.
<br />
6. Shell it really good.
<br />
7. When it comes, shoot it, and then you'll have a cord of psi to track it down. If you can locate it easily, it's easier to deal with whoever or whatever it is than trying to communicate while it's attacking you.
<br />

<br />
Hope that helps. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I had a very, very similar experience. One night, about 6 months ago, I was pulled out of my body (obe). I saw a shadow moving shape that was holding me like a prisoner. I felt like this thing wanted to harm me or use me. I try to escape by moving but without success. Then I fought by will. A strong will feeling and I felt I was back in my body. Then I awaked very freightened.
<br />

<br />
I then programed a shield made of golden energy around my bed and my house. Never had a similar experience after.

			A: Im not entirely sure it's someone else &quot;attacking&quot; me. I didn't make that claim myself, I just thought since you guys have dealt in alot of &quot;above and beyond the normal&quot; that you might know what's going on.
<br />
B: I'm not that good with psi stuff yet. I can do psiballs, and thats about it.
<br />

<br />
Also, I neglected to mention that in the most recent encounter, there were brief shots of some sort of... scream. Like the type you would associate with some sort of stereotypical ghost or... banshee or something. Just real short bursts, periodically.
<br />

<br />
And mordak... pure will has been how I fought this, but I believe I remained within my body during each esperience. And there was no visual to go along with this, as any time I would attempt to open my eyes to see it, it would stop, as well.

			Just to clear things up. I said IF he's religious. No one has to do what I type. I'm not saying pray or your going to die. All I'm saying is that it's an option just like shielding...
<br />

<br />
Anyways IF you don't pray and are not good at psi... then try to ignore it. Don't focus on it or give it any attention. Don't be scared of it. Just pretend it's not there and it should move on.
