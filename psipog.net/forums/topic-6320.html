I hate people all the time, but then sometimes a cool person will come along that I like.

I think you misunderstood Lightbringer.  What he actually said was: &quot;I think you have many more lessons to learn before you have enough of a handle on the metaphysical aspect of our world that you can write about it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I think by saying 'our world' he meant the world we all live in - Earth, not just a clique of psions.
<br />

<br />
One place you could start is the Psion's Handbook, though sadly I can't find the location of it right now.  Good luck! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
