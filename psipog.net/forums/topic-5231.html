			Wouldn't it be cool if they taught telekinesis, cryokinesis, pyrokinesis etc. at school. And maybe ki but people on this website dont believe in ki. Well anyways that way everyone could learn this kind of stuff.

			yeah, only one problem.   Most people are so close-minded and do not believe any of this.  Also, it touches into a religous argument (which were not alound to talk about here) and thats not really aloud at any public schools.
<br />

<br />
It woudnt work, but it would still be cool!

			People here ( a few at least, myself included) do believe in energy; ki is energy, and therefore we believe in ki. We don't believe in fluff, which is what many ki things on the internet are. Real ki practices are in the martial arts and not shared on the internet, and they are absolutely NOT like dragon ball Z. Next time, please use pyro-pk or cryo-pk instead of the words you used because they are more tolerable in this community.
<br />

And yes, I think it would be awesome if psionics was an elective in schools.

			I think it would be great. The only thing I think would be bad is if someone really hateful learned it and went on a psi hurting spree or something, but most people like that don't have enough patience to do it, so it's all good.

			It would be fun to learn in school about this.  But then, their would be assh*les that would be intent on learning it only to hurt people. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> And then it would be cut from schools for danger policies.

I wish there was something like that in my school...
<br />

<br />
The closest thing to that here is a seminar dedicated to healing, obe, premonition, and anything related to psi or astral travel.
<br />
The one who leads this is a guy very used to OBE's, his name is under my sig.

			I kind of like psionics being a secret.  At school I just act like my normal nerd self then when at home act like my seclusive self, but when I meet up with my friends (all of whom are psions, which would be great if I had more than 2 friends) we practice stuff and talk about psi.  It's like we hold a secret.  If everyone knew about psionics then it would sort of lose it's meaning.
