			There are many threads on the subject of 'Did I make one?'. This seems to agitate a few people, and generally take up space. Ironicly I've made another. If you have a question about if you made a PsiBall then read the quotes, and answers below. If none of them are similar to your experience then just reply to this thread, and someone will give you there opinion. Please be kind to your fellow Humans when replying, everyone was a first timer once.

If you want to know about making a Psiball it is best to go to <a href="../articles.html" target="_blank">articles.html?cat=201.</a>

If you have another question other then if you made on this thread is for you. You should glance at it anyway. ^_^ <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=935" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=935</a>

I found this site a month or so ago, tried for a bit, and stopped until a few days ago. Well, here are my questions: I tried making one and my hands were being pushed apart, but that might've been from not moving my hands for a while in one spot. In school today I tried making a cold one with one hand, and felt it too, but that might've been biofeedback (I think?). I also tried a hot one and it only worked a tiny bit, like it was my hand heat.

All in all, what are you opinions on these three cases? Could they have been real psi balls or just my imagination? I want to test it with another person, but the only other one who knows I can only see in a few days from now.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Confusion: JAMmaster, if you are worried about it being BioFeedBack then without Psi try making the feeling. BioFeedBack is harder Psi the way I hear it. The Wiki artical of it is in serious need of fixing last time I was there, but there are alot of other BioFeedBack articals on the net that might be worth the read.

Vladimir: Well, psi energy seems to radiate off constructs (unless programmed accordingly, not sure. Never tried) so feeling the edge of it can be difficult, so try to shell it and make the shell VERY dense. This should help.

When I go to make it in my hands, they get warm and then my fingers starts to move apart on their own when I think of making the psi-ball bigger. Also, when I try to put my hands closer together, I feel as though they are being pressed away from each other, sorta like magnets repelling.

pryoman098: i dont think your hands repelling eachother are it(i have reasons for thinking so) but if you feel warm like you said you did then it most likely is a psi ball.....

			Well...
<br />
I've been tryed to do a Psiball 2 min ago.
<br />
Ok... i visualize me in a hill, receiving energy from her, and focused it to my hand, molding a ball...
<br />
I felt my hand shaking (it is shaking even now) and some vibrations in my head and body...
<br />
I saw some... but i dunno if it was only my imagination or my eyes get tarnish, or if it were true, but.... I felt vibrations and stuff...
<br />
My arms and legs are little tired now, like i trained Martial-art 
<br />
DID I MAKE A PSI BALL??

			I dont know if you made one Conr4D, but it sounds like you definitely tired yourself out attempting, or actually making one <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.  Is there any more that you can describe around where you were making the psiball?

I posted here not to ask a question, but to say hooray <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> I didn't want to make a new topic for a useless comment, so I found one to post in <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  I have always had trouble changing the temperature of my psiballs, they usually come out warm, or I don't really feel a temperature at all, and that is usually when the magnetic repelling feeling is prominent.  So I decided to give a good try at making a cold one after skimming through <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html155url" target="_blank" class="postlink">The Art of Programming</a> I managed to finally make a good one using conceptual programming <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.  Ive made cold ones before, but they never stayed like that for very long, they would start to cool down then rapidly get warm, but this time it was getting really cold <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  Yeah... thats my little accomplishment for tonight <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Im pretty sure I have made a psi ball, maybe a psi blob? I could definetly feel warmth between my hands and a tingly feeling, also, is their a way to make this tingly feeling go away? The reason why is because everytime I try anything with psi, succesfull or not, my hands get really warm and tingly, it feels wierd, but after im done trying to do whatever, it doesnt go away right away, is that good or bad?

			Just a quick question about all this. Haven't read through any other threads yet as this is my first post so theres most likely an answer there but I'd rather just ask......Tried a psi ball for the first time the other day and almost instantly could feel tingling sensations on my palms and my hands were kinda getting pushed away. Wasn't sure if thats what it was supposed to feel like or not, thought maybe it was just my sub-concious doing that for me.

			ahhh so much of the same questions ^_^; if you feel the gravity, it's a psi ball! it's not your muscles playing tricks on ya.
<br />

<br />
Lately i've been telling others to make a psi ball out of random.. and they got it on their first tries. It could feel like gravity, but for the beginners, try visualizing a balloon! a small balloon at that.  It can totally feel like a balloon XD the first shield I made was a balloon shield, and it was VERY easy to make.

			I just started making psi balls last night. The first one I made, it made my fingers tingle a lot. I chucked it against the ceiling for lack of anything else to do with it. When I came back to that place a few minutes later, a nickel fell from seemingly no where. Do my psi balls know that my poor ass needs cash? Has anyone else gotten money from a psi ball <img src="images/smiles/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" border="0" /> It might have not been from the psi ball, i don't know though. 
<br />

<br />
Then, I was trying to get my dog inside. He went a far ways from the house, over 10 feet, and I was getting kinda mad. So I thought up a psi ball in my stomach. I think I used umm... gold. Yes gold and I was thinking the words &quot;follow, come, entice&quot;, things like that. Anyway, I chucked it at my dog. He came, but slowly. Like a trot. I threw one at him when he was half way to the door, that got him in. I guess it was a psi ball, not a coincidence right? What do ya'll think?

			Animals are pretty sensitive to psi, so its a good possibility that you made your dog come by sending a message in the psi ball. I threw one at my cat who was sleeping.. and started to twitch everywhere.

			Hmmmm, I can make psi-balls fairly easy now, yet to try programming or a shield though. I'm not sure though, I tend to not use a source and it works fine. Was trying to make a larger one the other night and my fingers started to tense up and twitch while the rest of my body was totally relaxed, any ideas what that could mean, if anything? Also, I tend to get the feeling strongest for some reason when I breathe in, as if my breath brings everything down to my hands...Any advice would be appreciated.
