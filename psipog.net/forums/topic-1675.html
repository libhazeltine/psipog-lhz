			What do you think? I personally think most psionics are just two skills: energy manipulation and energy sensitivity. PK is energy manipulation, but directed at a physical object. Telepathy/empathy are just reading patterns in energy, etc.
<br />
Emotions and thoughts are pretty differently interpretted/created by the mind, so reading them can take a bit of practice to get used to, but in my opinion, it's still the same skill.
<br />

<br />
Just my theory, what do you guys think?

			I think they are sooooo different
<br />
I mean Telepathy is reading someones thoughts
<br />
Empathy is reading someones emotions
<br />

<br />
Thinking &quot;Pain&quot; and Feeling &quot;Pain&quot; are sooo different
<br />
but I think they are equally important

			My choice was other, let me specify as to why.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Alrighty now then in my experiences, which is marginal mind you, when trying at telepathy in the form of receiving or reading anothers thought I generally get a jist of what their current emotion is as well. See I can completely understand where people say its different skills and what not, but one must look at how interlinked thought and emotions are.
<br />

<br />
Conscious mode of concepting, thinking, or communicating would ofcourse be thought, this is how we can express abstract ideas. But our mind isnt all thought, as said the subconscious, deep within it the concept of abstract thought and symbols is a mystery and the mind communicates in emotions, infact if memory serves all of you subconscious does.
<br />

<br />
Also look at the fact of how they affect one another, thought does influence emotion, emotion does influence thought. If you angry are you going to think sadly or depressing thought? No you will think agrivated ones, vindictive ones, and the likes such as that.
<br />

<br />
Though to sum up my thoughts on are they different, in some respects yes, on one your focusing more on one aspect then another. Are they completely different? No they are not. I beleive they are the same in some respects, the only difference is that in one your focusing more on one motive of the mind then another, but in truth its all linked together.

			Yes. I agree. The way I see it, thought and emotion are two very different things to read, but they're read using the same mechanism.

Any more input, guys?

			The question is flawed. They are not the same, but they are not completely different things.  They are basically the same skill (to scan or send) but they are on different wavelengths.

			I selected &quot;are the same skill&quot; because as you increase your general sensitivity, telepathy and empathy alike become more easily manifested &quot;by accident&quot; or spontaneously.  The type of information is different, but you're essentially doing the same thing.  I believe that's the consensus though, so no point in elaborating...

			I picked 'other', what I mean by this is as follows: They are closely related skills, and if your good with one you probably will be ok with the other, but they are not totally the same. In telepathy, you are communicating with someone, but with empathy, you may be subconsiously suggesting something to them to make them feel different. They are related because either way, your getting into thier head.

			I chose &quot;other&quot; because they are both using the same method, but the info they receive are different. I would say they are similar but not exactly the same skill.

			This question has been going around for as long as I've been around psipog, and probably alot longer, the difference is that the information that is carried goes on a different wavelength. Empathy is lower, and more simple, and telepathy is higher, and more complex. That's it. The end of it. The answer. It's been asked and answered many times. Thats the difference, but besides that it's completely the same. Think of it as an earthquake. If you have a catagory 1 earthquake, it's different from a catagory 5 earthquake, but still an earthquake. They are the same, but different. Coke and pepsi. Both the same... just different. E-mail and regular mail. Both transfer information, but are different. Yet nobody is puzzled about if they are the same thing. The answer is, they are different, but based on the same principles.

			I think they are close.  for empathy, you need to pretty much get &quot;inside&quot; the other persons head.  That is telepathy.  You can obtain emotions through telepathy...is that empathy?  If so, then they are the same ability.  If not, what is the difference?
