			im so happy and this is the most gratifying feeling ive ever had! i saw one persons post saying that he just puts his hand next to the psi wheel and just stares at it. i thought how can that ever work? but i decided to give it a go instead of hurting my head concentrating all the time. so i tried it and it moved a quarter of a turn. im 100% sure i didnt breath on it because it was too smooth and if i did it would have shook which it didnt. and im so surprised i did it only after 2 days because usually im a slow learner. im not too sure how it actually happened but i know my mind was completely clear the second i did it. I've tried it a couple times but it hasnt worked again, i guess im too excited, but i know for sure im bringing my psi wheel to school tomorrow and hopefully i can amaze some of my friends:)

			Be careful about putting your hands right next to the wheel, your body heat can create convection currents by heating the air, which can produce false results.

<br />
If that wasn't the cause, then congratulations!

well my finger tips were about 4.5 centimetres away from it and  my palm was like 7 centimetres away. could i have created those convection currents and moved it like that from that distance?

			I think you were far enough away, but I can't say for sure. There are tons of factors involved in convection currents, such as the shape of the room, the way you were holding your hand, your body temperature compared to the room?s temperature, and many others that don't know about.
<br />

<br />
My advice is to gradually work on pulling your hand farther and farther away until you no longer feel the need to use it, that way you can be sure. Your hand is just a psychological aid anyway.

			wow i dont know how i did it but today at school i was practicing with my psi wheel and i could do it like nothing. in fourth period i even made 5 rotations without stopping and made a half rotation without my hands. people in my class were kind of staring at me like im a freak but i dont care. and also i told my best friend about it all and he thinks im going crazy and i dont think he believes me. but when i got home and went to spin the psi wheel, it was barely working anymore, it moved once in a while but not like at school. could me feeling more comfortable at school or the room tempurature have effected it?

			It's because your friend didnt believe you. When someone tells you its not real, it kills your confidence. That sucks when people try and &quot;slap you out of this dellusion&quot;. I've had that before too. Just try and make yourself believe that it's true. Keep telling yourself that itt's not delussion and you will do it again. 
<br />
Either that or you might be tired from it. When you do it really well one day, sometimes you can't do it at all the next day. Nothing to worry about, it's just normal.

			It could have been due to tempurature diffrences, or it could have been your own doubts.

			it kinda stopped working for me again a while ago so i tried to use the bigger psiwheel and i got it spinning quite fast, but whenever i get it spinning it never lasts more then 10 seconds and it stops and goes in the other direction, i try to turn it back but i cant so i start again. and also, if im looking at the tv or not concentrating on the psi wheel and right when i look at it it sometimes is shaking or spinning slightly already, even while im typing this its spinning. do you think this is me doing this because ive become used to it? because there arent any windows open or fans on.
