			I read somewhere about phasing, probably the Articles. I was wondering what everyones opinion was on it? Possible, not possible? cool? not so much? What about phasing objects through other objects? Just tossing around a few ideas.

			Perhaps it was because they &quot;willed&quot; it not to happen. Your mind seems to be able to do very complex things with very little instruction. Or perhaps it seems very complex to us but isn't to our mind. Either way, our mind is capable of doing things beyond our comprehension, as shown by the fact that we still have no real idea how most of psionics works. I would think that if your mind could let you pass through a wall, it would be equally capable of preventing you from passing through the floor at the same time. Just my opinion though, as always.

			I'd be careful if I were you. If I remember correctly, i heard that you can not force phasing. If you force it, things will kind of... bend is the qord i guess. And then they snap back and you feel like you got hit by a hammer over most of your body. That might just be hearsay, but I'd still be careful if I were you.

			After some thunderstorms you might find a stick phased through a piece of glass without breaking it, so I think it's definitely possible. I think it's very advanced though as it is a form of teleportation and even though Rain did it accidentally she is a very advanced natural telepath and psychokinetic.

			Lol, last night I was trying to practice phase wasn't having any luck, but then I stretched my arms out in bed over my head and back and I realized afterwards &quot;Damn I just phased my hands and wrists&quot; through the ah wood headboard. It's like a foot wide kinda like a shelf then couple inches thick and then there spacing to put in pop, clocks and what have you, but there was absolutely no sensation as went through just like it wasn't there even though it was.
