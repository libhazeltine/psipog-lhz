			I'm experimenting with psionism for few years now and I'm starting to feel the growth of my powers.At the beginning, like most of beginners, I started with Psi wheel.I did that for about a year and a half with brakes in between and I found that a time off can really help developing psychokinesis abilities.
<br />
I practised pk/tk for few months and then I took few months off and when I returned to my exercises I could spin the Psi wheel at that very moment although I haven't practised tk/pk for months.That helped me alot so I continued with this kind of schedule.
<br />
During last few years of my life I tried to perform or exercised many branches of psionisc, such as tk/pk, remote viewing, communication with subconscious and lately I started to feel my 'powers' are getting stronger.I decided to open my mind very wide and that nothing can be impossible or unnatural.I gave a chance to everything to be accepted by me.
<br />
I don't know what causes this, perhaps something during those few years of psionics I did, but almost anything I think of, comes true.This started about a month ago.I cannot control it and I cannot affect greater things but I influence everyday decisions.Let me explain this by examples:
<br />

<br />
For instance, today I went downtown to do some things and when waiting in a line I thought &quot;ah, I bet my mother will call&quot; and a minute later my mom calls.Next I'm walking through downtown smoking a ciggaret and talking to myself &quot;I shouldn't be smoking, what if some relative I know sees me and thinks - look at him, such a nice boy but smoking&quot; so I decide to drop my ciggaret, turned around a corner and there I see my aunt and my mother's friend.I said hello and thanked to <span style="font-weight: bold">it</span> for helping me out.
<br />

<br />
Yesterday at work, I'm a part-time seller in a Wallmart-like store, I had many customers in my work area and I said to myself &quot;please let them go away so I can rest for a little&quot; and suddenly people just left and there was nobody for like 15min in a crowded hardware store so I could sit back and relaxed for a while.I thanked to <span style="font-weight: bold">it</span> for helping me out and in a few moments people were crawling around me.
<br />

<br />
Sometimes when I'm bored I think &quot;ah, I wish my friends were call me&quot; and not a minute from that moment someone I know calls me for no reason.
<br />

<br />
Same happened when I was out on a smoke the other day, somewhere during the night in front of my building.I live in a small city where there is no &quot;night life&quot; like in big cities so there were no cars on the street and I thought &quot;man, that BMW 7 is a hot car&quot; and to my surprise the same car I thought about just few second ago passed by me and I was in kind of a light shock.
<br />

<br />
It goes the same for everything I do during the day...traffic lights, people I know, busses, internet forums...For example, yesterday I was not in a good mood and just surfing the web for no reason I thought &quot;I wonder if we could be immortal and how could we acomplish that&quot; and suddenly the banner pops up on the immortality of human beings, and I was on a HipHop forum.
<br />

<br />
This happens all the time and I feel like I'm slowly gaining more control every day but I cannot control it fully so sometimes things I don't want to happen and I think of them, happen.Or just randon thoughts on how would it be if a certain thing would happen and then it really happens and I'm in an awkward position.That's the bad part.
<br />
I talk to myself all the time in my mind and when I want something to happen I start like &quot;please, do this or that&quot;, &quot;please, let this happen&quot; and so on and things happen in 90% of ocasions.At the end I thank for it.
<br />

<br />
I would like to know what causes this and how can I learn to control it and to develop it even more.I belive if I learn it well and get to control it I could change my life and perhaps influence on something more on a global level.

			Interesting...I Don't know if I can beleive the words, but I'll tell you this.
<br />

<br />
Keep up with it, keep practicing. You'll gain more control over this.
<br />

<br />
What causes it...well, nobody really knows for a fact.

			Kinda reminds me of that law of attraction... XD I have my obsessive moments but meh. 
<br />
I want to apply the fact that if I believe I can do it, it should/will happen eventually. It's sounds fluffy, it's so hard to get even my mind to believe it happens! But you just might be one fine example of the laws of attraction.

			this sounds like &quot;wishful precognition.&quot;  (made up that term).  kind of like regular precognition, but it plays into your wants.  maybe something was making you think about your mom calling, or dropping your cigarette before it happened...almost like passive precognition.  like your sub-c knew your mom was going to call, but it relayed the message to your conscious (sp?) as a thought, so it seems like you are willing these things to happen...i dunno, just a thought.

That's a new one <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> but it sounds like you have some good precognition and telepathy skills <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Yea, I'd say I'm about as perceptive as a rock. I've been in and out of practice in the psi community for about 7 years or so. One thing I do have a lot is uncontrollable precog. A lot of the time I just pick up my cell phone and open it because I know I'm getting a call, and that's before it rings. Now, I'd say the reason that doesn't happen all the time is because I'm not as aware all the time. For example, if I was busily doing something my attention doesn't always snap towards my phone like it would if I was just lounging around.

			I've never practised telepathy or had any experience with precognition.This all started like a month ago so I don't know what could cause it.So should I practise any of those skills now or just leave it as it is and see what happens next?

			I think theres a time of your life where your abilities begin to peak naturally, meaning without practice. Usually around age 17 for males or adolescense for females. That could be one explanation. When you take breaks, sometimes that really helps because it gives time for things to catch up, although I'm not a big believer in latency phases as they are usually inconsistent. I'd say just play around with your abilities a little bit. Something that helped me develop precog was messing with clairvoyance. What I would do is look at objects around the room and try to picture what each one would look like from a 360 degree view. For some reason my precog accelerated after doing this excercise, even though it was still mostly uncontrollable, I gained a little more control, and it happened much more often.
