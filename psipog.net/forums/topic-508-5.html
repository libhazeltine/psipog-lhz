			That reminds me off a few years ago. There was flooding going on somewhere else in the world, I do believe, and they were really out of control. We thought it was bad, and that we should try helping. So 4 of us, got together, went in a circle, said some stuff, and cast a &quot;spell&quot; to discontinue the flooding. Well, it stopped, but it was invetable that it wouldn't go on forever in the first place. I'd say it wasn't us. Back to the now, I'm not saying it isn't possible. I've considered trying it myself before, and think I might have. I can't remember. But I used to be completely terrified of tornados, and I put it together that if I screwed around in the wrong way, there might be some sort of drastic consiquence such as so, what with the widfronts and hot and cold air or whatever. So wether probable or not, and I'm pretty open minded about it, I'd say that if you are going to play around with that, that you should probably be careful and make sure you know what you are doing.

			you know whats really creapy is i have a friend, that any time he throws his hands in a direction, wind picks up in that direction. its like, how the hell does he do that!?! if it takes as much energy as some posts say, is it possible to make wind like that or is it a string of lucky coincidences?

			Since this thread's been bumped again, I suppose there isn't too much harm in adding my view.

<br />
I describe the larger-scale application of micro-PK as &quot;chancing&quot; in my article <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=1609" target="_blank" class="postlink">here.</a>  I find the earlier reminder that weather patterns already contain massive amounts of energy particularly apt, and the huge random factors involved should make it quite plausible for an individual to &quot;tip&quot; the chances via expectation or concious manipulation of the storm.
<br />

<br />
The individuals who described their process as &quot;becoming one with the storm&quot; or something along those lines may quite possibly be legitimate because that is a fairly usual step in affecting something.  The more you understand the situation you are trying to influence, the easier it becomes to see results.
<br />

<br />
As far as snapping your fingers and conjuring a cloud, I think that's silly.  Using your own energy to heat or cool a cloud is equally futile.  Concentrating on a result and thinking about each of the minor probabilities that could tip in favor of your result can have a result.  As far as directing lightning... I'd be careful.  I've had it strike exactly where I &quot;expected&quot; it to only once, but it was immediate and quite startling.  Of course, I'd been meditating with the storm for nearly an hour so it's possibly a manifestation of precognition, so don't expect to go summoning lightning down wherever you please.
<br />

<br />
Good luck guys, and be careful.  It just started snowing here. ^^
<br />
As far as consequences, if the weather can do it by itself and you simply prompted a possibility you would enjoy... well the weather's doing it own thing really.  There are a billion butterflies to blame weather problems on...

well ive started my psi training a little diffrent...
<br />
i started in a traditional way. with the normal energy gathering and psi balls and wasnt havent much luck...
<br />
but then one day i was siting at my desk and there was a plant, i just &quot;felt&quot; the plant suddenly. it was like I felt is essence, its energy, its being. afterwords things just started coming to me. without practice i could instantly make psi balls and other constructs and i just keep geting more and more powerful. all i do is just &quot;feel&quot; essences of things like plants, fire (candle), water. also i dont relly gather energy. i just have this store of energy that i have constantly and the more i use it the more of this &quot;resserve&quot; i get..
<br />
i guess you could call me an elementalist
<br />

<br />
You all keep going back to how it takes all this energy to do all this stuff.  I don't think does.  Why can't you just take the energy out of the surrounding air, or even out of the earth?  I like during meditation to have something like a hot water bottle to draw energy out of.  There was a story in a book at the public library that talked about a woman who used TK to lift scissors and the temperature in the room went down 10 degrees.  Then there was a person who lost 5 pounds doing TK.  The point is you can use energy form other sources like the air.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

You can draw energy from just about anywhere you like, and I'm certain the atmosphere is no exception to this rule.
<br />

<br />
As for changing the atmospheric conditions themselves, that would require a huge amount of energy, and seems quite unlikely.

			galdon branching on your message of before of a friend who can controll wind. I totally believe you. why cause I am one of those people. you guys might think im crazy but i have a relationship with the wind like on of my friends. when i'm bullied it blows real hard. sometime i ask it to blow but it wont listen.[/quote]

			right now the only thing im focusing on is nature. ive gotten ok with wind gust, sometiems i wander if its me or just luck but it seams to work 90% of the time and ive found it possable to control energy thats allready in the air or other surrounding envirements why draw energy when you can use whats allready there?

			Okay, so while we're all laughing in your face, I'm going to say something about my personal experiences with this. It might sound weird, but whatever.
<br />

<br />
First of all, I'm pretty sure that changing the weather in really huge ways ie: forming clouds, would use a LOT of energy. For one thing, it's a process that takes days, and a ridiculous amount of energy from the sun in nature. (Think of it like this: whatever you accomplish with psi, you use the same amount of energy that it would take to accomplish this in the natural way) So in theory, if you tried to evaporate large amounts of a lake and then move it across a vast expanse of sky and have it rain down upon the heads of various passers by... you would use up all the energy in your body and DIE! That's one reason I've never thought about posting about this sort of topic before. That's the thing about psi. Most of it is theory. Then again, gravity is just a theory.
<br />

<br />
Now, for my personal experience. We were holding english class outside because the air conditioner broke in our classroom. We were sitting on the picnic tables and I was trying to work, but the sun kept bothering me. So I snapped my fingers and told it to leave me alone. I know you're looking at me weird now, but it's what I did. And the wierd thing is that almost immediately a wind started, big, thick rainclouds covered the sun, and in under 5 minutes, it had started to rain pretty hard and our english class had to go back inside. People now have this strange habit of calling me God, but that's besides the point.
<br />

<br />
I've had this happen numerous other times, and I find that it's usually involved somehow with wind (like if I'm hot and a sudden breeze blows through). I'm not saying I can control the weather, because I think the idea is a bit ridiculous, and I'm not saying that I am a diety, because I know I'm not. I do know that people will sometimes speak of being able to use wind, or to move it. (I recall reading an article where someone visualized wind moving the psi-wheel and then were confused as to whether they'd used pk to directly effect the psi-wheel, or had used wind).
<br />

<br />
This brings to my mind another theory. We're all connected through all these numerous particles. Every time you move your hand through what you think of as &quot;empty&quot; air, you affect something around you. I'll call up the common image of throwing rocks into a pond. You throw a pebble into a pond, and it causes little ripples, and can effect things to a small degree, but still it will effect things. There aren't too many people who can pick up a boulder and hurl it into a lake, but if you did, it would cause lots of ripples, and probably kill a few things, too. If you practice enough, you can gradually throw bigger and bigger rocks (but I still don't know if you could throw the boulder, no matter how hard you practice... and I suggest not trying because YOU might end up being squished yourself.) or you can skip rocks, so that one action can cause multiple reactions.
<br />

<br />
Do you catch my drift? Maybe?
<br />

<br />
I know it looks like I'm a newbie and all, but I've been practicing psi for a while. I only recently joined the forums. I don't have much of a chance to get online. I just thought I'd put in my two cents. If you don't believe me, that's fine. If you do, that's fine, too. 
<br />

<br />
I'm just interested to find that there's someone else besides me thinking about this topic.

			I'm sure the &quot;calling me God&quot; point may attract some unpleasant reactions from some of the forum's users, but that being said, I understand your position.  Giving your subconcious a cue to run off and finish a goal, completely free of the impediment of doubt, you can do some pretty bizarre things.
<br />

<br />
I can't pull a tennis serve facing the sun... clouds are nice to have around sometimes.  Asking the rain to hold up while you run between buildings, etc. or teasing your girlfriend's hair with the wind, whatever you're up to, there's plenty of opportunities to mess with the weather.  If you understand specific attributes of a storm, you can focus on manipulating them.  Playing with thin layers of temperature in the clouds is probably the easiest and fastest way of triggering quick bursts of rain.  I've demonstrated it for my parents, so they're reasonably cool with it.
<br />

<br />
A benefit of wind is that it's very random, and there are plenty of powerful visualizations to use, such as the rustling of leaves, the feel of it ruffling your hair, the smells, the pressure as it tugs at your clothing... the more you can mentally recreate the experience of a strong breeze, the easier it is to let your subconcious reach out and affect the world around you.
<br />

<br />
Your ideas about the ripples... I like it.  Intelligent, deliberate series of &quot;stones&quot; can recreate the powerful ripples, and with careful aim, you can reach further than possible by simply brute mental exertion.
<br />

<br />
Your observations indicate that you're genuinely seeking more than amusement or admiration.  Avoid tripping on people's egos, and you should find that there are plenty of other interesting individuals &quot;thinking about this topic.&quot;
<br />

			i don't have a hard time Believing that a person can manipulate the weather, i would think it would take alot of energy to do it but you don't have to use only your own. manipulating the weather would be very useful but if done to much it could cause a Serious Imbalance that would not be good so unless you have to like if a hurricane is coming at you and you do have the ability than i would but nothing like making it stop raining just so you can have a nice day.
