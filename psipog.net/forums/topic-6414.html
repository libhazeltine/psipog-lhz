			Not so much lost as stolen. Some guys (supposedly) in my year hid my brother's school bag. Regardless, it's missing and has been since last Thursday. 
<br />

<br />
I've checked the school several times and if I knew who took it I'd have it right now...But I'm surrounded by cowards who'd pick on a guy three years younger in a group of 20. Typical. 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, if you could give it a shot I'd really appreciate it. Any information you need just pm or email me (better luck I'd say). Thanks.

			Could you post coordinates? If you don't know how to assign them then go find it in the RV articles.

			I don't understand why I have to do it though. Because I have a connection with the object? Do I basicially pick a random 8 digit number and imprint on the object with intent and visualisation? That's how I interpreted the article anyway

			Well if you don't want to assign coordinates, I could try RVing without them, but it might not be as accurate. I guess after reading an RV article for the first time, it burned the rule that I need coordinates to RV into my sub-c or something.
<br />

<br />
But if you still want to know how to assign coordinates, yeah, you gotta pick a random 8 digit number and link it with the object.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, here goes the RV:
<br />

<br />
The schoolbag is grey or beige, or a combination of both.
<br />

<br />
It is not in the school, I sensed it being east of the school, in someone's house, I got the feeling the house wasn't yours. It is in a room with a carpet floor, leaning against the wall.

			It wouldn't be, no....hmmm. Thanks...The only problem is the school is in the middle of town, surrounded by houses...hmmm. I didn't really follow the RV article to be honest lol. I could try get a hold of a picture of it and assign coordinates to it? You just mentally imprint/impose the number on for several minutes yeah? 
<br />

<br />
Thanks again dude *manly irish handshake*

			Uhh, so my RV attemped didn't work? Alas, I have failed you, fellow psion, I will now go ask the Psi spirits for forgiveness.
<br />

<br />
Umm, I think a mental picture would be best, you might unintentionally make the coordinates go to the picture of the schoolbag instead of the schoolbag itself. And yeah, just like you said, imprint the numbers on the image of the schoolbag for a few minutes.

			Hey, thanks again. Sorry, I've been kinda distracted for the last while. Yeah, he found his bag. Whoever took it just dropped it back in school because we had scoured the place clean...which makes your reading interesting and seemingly accurate. Good job!
