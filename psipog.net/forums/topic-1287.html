			Just as a future note, all that I post here is not what i believe whole heartedly.  I am just posting observations and logical explinations.  Here are my growing thoughts of psionics:
<br />

<br />
I came upon a couple facts the other day that were this:
<br />

<br />
Isaac Newton discovered that all objects were attracted to eachother. This has not been proven wrong yet so lets go with this being correct.
<br />

<br />
To do psychokinesis, maybe all you do is eliminate the opposing forces so that the psiwheel is attracted to your hand (since your hand is so close to the psiwheel). Maybe that is why it is harder for people to do PK with their hands further away. Then when you can move it from further away, your brain is stronger. By stronger this is what i mean: We know that the human brain releases brain waves into the open. We know that these brain waves never completely die away, they just get smaller and smaller and smaller but it never goes away (kind of like gravity). So there are brainwaves coming out of your head (hence telepathy) so when they get strong enough, they can increase the attraction between the two. This would explain why PK gets small bursts. If you are moving a book, that is why the book shoots forward and stops. Maybe there is no &quot;psi&quot; and just brain waves and the laws of gravity. I hope this challenges your theory right now. I am just trying to make people think things through and maybe do a little research.
<br />

<br />
When you imagine things, they go out with the brain pulses (as i said earlier). So that might be why visualization is important. So when you imagine something happening, it is in your brain waves (hence programming) and so something happens when your brain wave hits the object that you are imagining about, it does what you are imagining. But how could your brainwave choose that specific thing out? hmmm. How can something in an electric signal affect a physical object? And what is a psiball? Maybe that is what is psychic about it. Your brainwaves get stronger and stronger until they can move a physical object (that is why it is hard for noobs to move the psiwheel). It is proven that when you are mad or other emotions, your brainwaves become more dynamic and pick up in intensitiy. Maybe that is why emotions count when doing psionics? When you get mad and you already have been doing psionics, maybe that is why you can break things (windows), etc. It is like i have noticed that since i have been practicing, i broadcast a lot more unintentionally than i used to. Stronger brainwaves? I think this is interesting. My theory makes sense, does it not?
<br />

<br />
Ok, comment or whatnot.  (please comment nicely though)  I will say again, this is not my personal theory, it is something that i am making up with proven facts and just observations.

			Thanks <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  The only 2 things that I can think of that is does not cover is psiballs and precognition.  I will do a little research and some thinking and will get back to you all.

			So, like, the theory of gravity is not equated to mass, but mass can be a factor? I had similar thoughts a while ago. Then I drifted off with pink bunnies on the astral plane or whatnot.

			Nice job, I double read it and you made some good points.
<br />

<br />
About the psiwheel:
<br />
It works best if you put a glass over it. That way there is less chance that your hand will move it.
<br />

<br />
Had to move this up to the top, some good thought.
