			hey guys!,  i get the exact feeling, maybe we are just waking up from a sleep that we dont even know we are in.(like the matrix)  lol j/p guys
<br />

<br />
explanation 1:
<br />
but really i think that it is related to meditation.  last year i was walkin around and suddenely it felt like i was in a dream like state.  This was after a hard meditation for like 30 mins(long for me)
<br />

<br />
explanation 2:
<br />
another reason i could think of is the fact that you might just be traveling a path that you walk a lot so it's almost as if your body doesn't need you mind to point it in the right direction.  you also might just feel so comforablein you environment that you wont jump at the little sounds anymore because you are use to em.
<br />

<br />
these are just my ideas on it.  maybe it helped maybe it didn't but i just tossed in ym 2 cents!

			Thanatos,
<br />

<br />
You are awakening from the illusion my friend. Don't be afraid of that. Your consciousness is getting less attached to the physical world of the manifested forms. Your consciousness is being freed. Please do not fear this process, since this process will make your consciousness and presence stronger. The mental concept of time that your mind has created for you will dissolve, and you will be able to maintain pure consciousness in the present moment. It sounds to me as if you are walking the bridge from the world of illusions, to the world of the undefined source.(enlightenment)
<br />

<br />
What you are experiencing is that your consciousness is shifting to a deeper reality, that is why the forms of this manifested world may seem like a dream to you. Though if you make it through the process, you will be able to see the source of live in every physical form thats out there... You will feel inner peace that has no polarity.. You will feel inner joy without any polarity. That means that your inner peace and joy cannot be ruined by situations that happen outside of you. No matter what happens, you will feel a deep sense of peace. Your sense of self(personality/ego) will gradually dissolve, and you will be able to see life as it really is <img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" /> . Have no fear, keep on meditating, it will benefit you in every single way you can imagine. Your ego may get frightened, because you are now walking the path of the conscious death(death of the ego). You are choosing for a new kind of consicousness that transcends the ego. So don't let the ego's fear, take you over and pull you back down into the realm of attachment to the illusions and creations. As your ego might fear to dissolve (since it wants to sustain itself) keep in mind that: <span style="font-style: italic">That what is real, can never die or leave you.</span>  So this &quot;death&quot; you are undertaking, is just the death of illusions, and the becoming of a new consciousness. If you let this process free your consciousness from its prison, then you will, from that moment on, always be aware of your true self. This proces is like a wave, suddenly realising that he is not just that wave, but the entire ocean. Then that consciousness can offcourse still act and interact with the surface through that one wave, but he will always have a deep sense of himself being the entire ocean that lies underneath, and everything he does on the surface, gets a thousand times more quality.
<br />

<br />
Keep in mind that what is probably happening to you now, is what many seek to become. You are doing it. Keep your meditations up and running for now.
<br />

<br />
Keep me updated, if you like.
<br />

<br />
MA

			MartialArtist, I'm mildly curious to know.  Do you meditate on a frequent basis?  Have you yet reached this state of elation, or are you merely still on the 'journey' as so many others?  Also, I wonder whether you've tried the undertaking of awakening your kundilini on a large scale?  
<br />

<br />
I'm sure you're wondering why I'm asking this, and to be quite honest, it's bred of curiousity and more than a little bit of fascination.  You seem to be well versed in the laws of the conscious awakening, and I can only assume that you've either tried to, or have reached this state, or that you've done extensive studies on the topic.  If it's the latter, then I suppose it has to do with the fact that you're a practitioner of the martial arts.  Well, assuming you truly are a martial artist to begin with anyways.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Thanks.  I'm really just interested to know.
<br />

			Hi seraven,
<br />

<br />
I don't want to steal topics, so I will create a new topic in the technique area, by the name: &quot;spiritual enlightenment&quot;
<br />

<br />
I'll answer your question there, and if any other questions or remarks will follow, then post them there. I haven't spotted a topic yet specifically about spiritual enlightenment yet, so it will also be an addition to the forum this way(since I believe it is an important subject, especially in this time.) Cya there <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

			Hey there Sean,
<br />

<br />
I wonder if you have read my topic &quot;spiritual enlightenment&quot; in total, because I have said there more than once that I am just sharing my view on things. I didn't think it was nessicary to repeat that after every post. Also have I said that I am <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> bringing any kind of religion in here, in fact it is the opposite.
<br />

<br />
I respect your decision, though I pity it that you are excluding spirituality from your site. It walks hand in hand with the paranormal abilities you teach here, it just takes you to a deeper reality, so you can use those powers in a good and more effective way. Spirituality is after all just a name.
<br />

<br />
Greetings,
<br />

<br />
MA
<br />

<br />
ps. I am still willing to share with those who do feel that I was credible. Feel free to pm me.

			When you talk about everything seeming like a dream, is that from meditating? I've gotten that feeling randomly a couple of times in the past 7 or so years, and I havn't meditated a minute of my life. If this ever happens again, what exactly should I do?

			If you meditate alot, then you might sometimes have the feeling as if you are walking in a dream.. in some kind of illusion. Well the truth is not much different from that, but eventually, you will be able to become much more grounded and you will be able to feel the life in everything around you. then you have opened your eyes so to say, and you are looking at things as they really are. So you can have experiences of not feeling like you are your body, and that everything is a dream, but don't worry. That is nothing bad or dangerous.
