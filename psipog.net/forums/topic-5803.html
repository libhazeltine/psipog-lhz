			I have been practising PSI for a year or so now, and every time I do my psi-balls I seem to be able to see a small blue shine light coming from the middle of the psi ball.. Now I am unsure if this is just my mind playing tricks, but when I turn away from it and look back again it's gone..
<br />

<br />
I just wanted to know if it happens to anyone else, and also what does this indicate, or mean... thanks guys..

Yes TrueGoldenPhoenix
<br />

<br />
I agree with you, don't forget it's not just programs like Charmed that drives people here it's the like of films such as Star Wars etc...
<br />

<br />
I came here because I want to learn and progress my experince, not just because of some fancy little show. And to be quite honest I don't even watch Charmed I don't like it at all, the only show which intrests me is Quantum Leap and the X-Files..  I think the majorite of the people here the one's with the lower posts are here because of tv shows and stuff like that..
<br />

<br />
And btw True GoldenPhoenix
<br />

<br />
If that post was also resembled to me read above, I do not like or even watch Charmed I hate the show, and don't find it intresting.. 
<br />

<br />
Like I said I have been practising PSI for around 1 year, and I am good at it, I also practise Remote Viewing and I am very exellent at senceing energy and stuff like that.

Just to stay on topic....try making your psiball in the dark..it may help you distinguish whether your mind is playing tricks on you, or you have some illumination going on.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
