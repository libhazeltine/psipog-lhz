if you look at the idea of an &quot;Indigo child&quot; more as a old soul, a spirit with experience. the idea that certain things are easily learned to them has true validity.  i suppose you have to believe in past lives for that 'theory' to fly, though. 
<br />

<br />
dont get caught up in what people believe to be the fine print; most of the people who are giving you the details, probably dont know them or have mis-interpretted them.

			Everything is just a state of Mind. This &quot;Indigo&quot; theory seems like a very bloated concept and is not fit for human consumption. Though it does seem interesting, but not really dependable. 
<br />
As long as you have a Mind, and patients, you can develope these abilities. You don't need to be something &quot;special&quot;.

			i heard about this a while ago. This is nothing new. I read up on a site that had &quot;indigo symptoms&quot; and i matched them all too... the only thing is, they are so general and so &quot;anyone could have them&quot; that i couldnt take it seriously. I was diagnosed with ADD, but at times i feel like im smarter than most of the &quot;normal&quot; people. 
<br />

<br />
I have a scatter brain, that is true. Im not very graceful when learning something, but i have high attention to detail, and once something is learned it is rarely forgotten. especially psionics and &quot;chi&quot; and the like. 
<br />

<br />
I started to read up on &quot;chi&quot; a year or two ago right after i heard about indigos. catchy satiree. They used a color of a higher chakra and applyed it to a group of &quot;special&quot; kids, ranging from ADD, to ADHD, autism and ect.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Something that i read up on in AD (astral dynamics) is that in a certain religion (hindu, buddism cant really remember) that the females where born with the three higher chakras already opened, explaining womans intuition and other things. And that males where born with the root, spleen, and solar plexis chakras open, explaining the male sex drive. 
<br />

<br />
Then this person (aunt clair actually) goes on to tie this &quot;theory&quot; (i say theory, because thats what i take it as) to some gender attribute blending. Males with more mind power and love. Females with more of a male sex drive and showing of feelings. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
To make this really long, and perhaps utterly mistyped post short, i dont know about indigo children, but something is indeed happening to humans. There is indeed a blending of attributes that, years ago, were said to only be acredited to certain genders. Mabye these people saw this, and went off the deep end with it...

			I guess i believe in it.  Alot of it is total crap in my opinion.  But I keep seeing these kids that are off in the corner, but when you talk to them they CRAZY wise and understanding.  And they are like 10!  But there is always that really good apple in that sack so that doesn't really mean anything, but it could.
<br />

<br />
And it makes sence that my generation is REALLY radical(with all this OBVIOUS crap in the Gov.), but too afraid to do anything about it, hence the anti social ness.  And it's kinda fishy that autism add and adhd is up 600%(i think this was a cover of a TIME mag., idk some magazine my mom gets)

			My sister is indigo and ADHD, and from early childhood has been seeing spirits, auras, she even claimed to do PK (I was skeptical back then).  However, one theory I have is that being ADHD, and having a shorter attention span can increase the power of the subconcious - like when you try PK, then think about something else and the psiwheel moves.
<br />

<br />
I believe in indigos, but I'm not sure how far this concept goes - and I believe we can all do PK.  Just like riding a bike - some people get it faster than others.

			I believe in indigos to a point. I don't think they're here to save the world or any of that other fluff attached to it. I just see it as some people being born more &quot;awake&quot; than others. I like to think that we'll evolve into people who are more senstive and aware but I haven't really observed enough to convince me this is happening. Evolution takes a pretty long time.
<br />

<br />
I forgot to mention that being more aware of things can make you seem like you've got some sort of disorder. Theres nothing wrong with the kids that are true indigos but they have a great deal more to deal with than average kids. 
<br />

<br />
Just my thoughts.

			The Indigo theory is a very elaborate invention. While I believe that it is definitely true that some people are far more naturally in tune with their psychic abilities, it most certainly doesn't make them BETTER than people who aren't. The problem with the Indigo theory is that it puts people with strong natural abilities on a pedestal- and children raised that way turn into those assholes in resturaunts who send their food back a million times because the tuna isn't at just the right temperature. Also, some of the levels websites report &quot;Indigo Children&quot; performing at are just unrealistic- I think in some cases, believers in indigo children are being conned, much like followers of David Blaine. People who want to see amazingly gifted psion children will- even if it's just a simple magic trick like a magnet under a table. Either way, children with psionic abilities still have to be held to basic standards of society, because that's the way a society works. It's not society's fault- it's the kids. Sorry, truth hurts.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

I disagree. Its not the kids fault that they're different. Its the ones that raise the child that contribute to if the kids an asshole in later life. I don't think I've encountered a site that says that indigos have a special right to ignore the basic standards of society but then I haven't looked at that many indigo sites. Yeah the sites I've looked at exaggerate things sure but if the parents are too stupid to realise this then again the fault lies with them. I don't think society takes this sort of thing seriously enough for indigos to be put up on a pedastal. Most gifted children find themselves alienated from &quot;normal&quot; children because their different and perceived as weird. 
<br />

<br />
I'd say it is soceity's fault as well as the parents. Modern day soceity can be very damaging to any child.

I've looked at alot of indigo sites and the only triat they are associated with heavily is that they are reclusive.  Not highly social.  I met a true indigo or something.  He was 14 i think, and i met him a this festival.  He was really differnt.  His eyes had a penetrating look.  Like he could read your mind.  And i think he did.  Cause he'd act differently every time I started thinking &quot;He really is something different, special,&quot; and walk away sometimes.  Probably hates the word special by now.  But he was really cool.  Very calm.
