			There's something that is beyond our strength to carry, beyond our capability and also beyond our imagination to even think about. E.g., for most people, even with physical strength alone can't really lift a car with both of their hands, because there's a limit / border to physical strength.
<br />
So, i'm thinking that there should be too, for tk. I don't mean that you should stint yourselves, just try your best to bring the best out of yourselves. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			While I do think that there may be an eventual limit to how much energy a single mind can manipulate, I don't think even the most advanced TK'ers have scratched the surface.
<br />
It takes us years to learn how to sit up, crawl and walk. Beyond that more advanced coordination takes a long time to develop as well. We don't notice so much because we do other things that develop those skills in everyday life.
<br />
Right now we're all still comparitively asitting up and crawling as far as TK goes. Few have stood and I doubt anyone has walked, led alone run (metaphorically of course). 
<br />
Then there are 'strong men' who train for years at being able to lift more, or marathon runners who train to run longer - all of these things can be compared to TK, but we're nowhere near that far along yet. If I practiced TK for another 25 years (bringing me to 50 years old) - every day for hours a day - I *might* be to the point, comparitively, that I am now in terms of physical capability - and I'm no athlete.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, the point of my confusing rant here is that, as far as we're conerned, there may as well not BE a limit because we still haven't reached the limits of our physical bodies, led alone our mental abilities.
<br />
Yes we all have 'soft limits' that will require practice to overcome, but they CAN be overcome - they're not actual limits in the truest sense.
<br />

<br />
In my mind I hold no limits on the world. I try to be as open as possible. As far as I'm concerned a toaster could sprout wings and fly away, though it's unlikely and would surprise me to see it. I try to see the world as an infinite possibility, not a limitation. And I think that's why TK works for me.

Ooh, minimalist.

I think in some sense I agree with V-Man.
<br />

<br />
However, there are people around who have done things (I'm assuming...) beyond the capabilities of their physical strength, <span style="text-decoration: underline">now</span>. [i.e. Moderator of psipog, Rainsong, who allegedly lifted a canoe, etc.]
<br />

<br />
No-one really knows the exact nature of 'Psi', and so there isn't a real way of measuring what is or is not possible beyond what has already been done. 
<br />

<br />
Plus you have the annoying factor (in this case) that, everyone develops at different speeds and has different potentials - with all things. Psionics is no exception.
<br />

<br />
By the way, I like your approach to the world - and the flying toaster image. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			The only limits anyone has is what they think their limit is , if there was a feat ``beyond physical limits`` then how could it be done? , the limit to any kind of strength is up to you how much you wish to attain and train for. and you can lift a car if you want to , your physical body limits you? , then make it stronger .. its as simple as that...your tk has a limit of only lifting toothpicks? .. make it stronger. therefore a limit is only what you wish it to be. Oh and yes as stated already we ae nowhere near our ``limits`` , as an addition to that .. i would say that everything is possible we just need to keep training for it.your only limit is if you are not immortal , your can only train as long as you live for , like 100 years , lol , but hey your kids can continue to further the limitation you left  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> or become immortal  <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />

			Well, here's my opinion of the limitations of our minds.
<br />

<br />
The limits are there, but we do not know them, I think. Limitation, as it is thought of, may as well be limitless, because our minds have not yet reached the point where we can conceive of the limit of our potentials. So, to speak of a limit, &quot;as such&quot;, is futile, fruitless, and will server only to barricade your efforts at progresss. To speak of a limit as something beyond our reach, means that we can reach as far as we like, and will serve to strengthen our resolve for progress in strength and ability.

Limits on Psi will probably change until we know what it is.  Like what if there is a psychic internet then we could tap into others minds to help us do the task.

			I agree too, time is our only limit, that is to say, time is only OUR limit. Time limits people and most things on earth, but psi (which is what i assume) has an infinite amount of time.
<br />

<br />
From what i can see, every new generation coming up is a bit better than the one before it at something else. My friend luke lenard on my old Rams team (football team) ran the 40m in 4.45s. Another friend Tyler Nelson on the rams ran the 40m in 4.4s. This year theres new kids coming to the team and one of them, Luke labocaine ran the 40m in 4.2s. Luke lenard is in grade 10, Tyler Nelson is in grade 9 and Luke labocaine is in grade 8.
<br />
I am not certain but a long time ago, i think around the 1920's or 1930's, the world record for the 100m dash was 10.2s. The world record for the 100m dash right now is 9.78s (until i go to the olympics <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> )
<br />

<br />
Sorry about that rant but it has a point to it. My point is as we go on, we evolve more (so to speak) and become better. A hundred years ago people may not have even known what psi was, then we evolved to what we have now and the knowledge we have now. If i practice until i am old and i am only able to levitate a cell phone, that is my accomplishment. If i teach my kids what i know, they might be able to levitate a cell phone at the age i started. By the time that happens, new methods, possibly better, will develope to help people along the way. Each generation improves the one before it, so in a hundred years people may be flying instead of walking (hey, i can dream)
<br />

<br />
anyways, if we teach what we know, we can further evolve and become a better society, and hey maybe in a hundred years this site will still be up and they will still be praying to the moderators that first started this site! <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> Well theres my thoughts
