			Okay, I'm going on my biology class with this one, this is how evolution works (at least physical evolution, mental/spiritual evolution touches too close to religion and conjecture for me to explain):
<br />

<br />
We're gonna assume you're a wild animal of some kind, for the sake of the example. You're born. Based on your parent's DNA, you get a certain set of random characteristics which are, to my knowledge, effectively random. So you might end up with all your mom's characteristics, all of your dad's, or (much more likely), a random mix of the two. 
<br />

<br />
Now, let's say you inherited some really crappy traits (like being really short, overweight, and un-intelligent). Now, for most animals, this means you're probably going to die. (For humans, you'll probably live unless one of the traits you inherited was directly fatal (perhaps a genetic disease), since we try to keep everyone alive.) Since you died, due to the bad genetics, you won't be able to pass on the bad genes. 
<br />

<br />
Now, let's say you inherited some good genetics, like being able to run fast, and being strong. Since you have these good traits, you're more likely to survive, which would cause you to pass on the good traits. Over time, the bad traits would be weeded out of the gene pool, and the good ones would be continually passed on. 
<br />

<br />
Evolution does not change an individual, evolution changes the group. If your DNA was to somehow change (psionics, technology, whatever), then you shouldn't notice an immediate change. It would take time for your body to start producing cells with this new DNA, and for the old cells to die out. Also, if your DNA changes during the course of your life, it wouldn't be evolution, it would be mutation.
<br />

<br />
Also, evolution as a rule does NOT cause negative traits. Negative traits get weeded out through survival of the fittest, and positive traits get passed on for the same reason. If negative traits are occurring, they were already there in the DNA, they just haven't been weeded out. It's why natural competition is a good thing, and probably why the human race is a sad, pathetic group of slobs (does that make me have self-loathing?). There's no competition on any direct level (I don't have to fight any of you for a food source, nor do I have to escape from predators), and so our negative traits are not being weeded out.
<br />

<br />
I would say that's just my two cents, but it's closer to like $10, due to the amount of text. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

			Yeah, thats what I'm trying to say.  I just lack fluidy with this kind of thing sometimes.  lol
<br />

<br />
What your(MA+others) saying could be happening with somthing else in our bodies, but it isn't DNA.  Evolution is clearly stated with all it's rules and explinations all over the place and in school text books.  Though it is a mere theory, it is rediculously in-depth.

That's still only for so long, which is not forever. Point is, when you stop meditating, you gain nothing.

 Completely Depends on the type of superconscious state that you are in in the time you spend in delta stage of the brain. You can stay for weeks (if your trained enough) in a row in complete emptiness, then you will not find any new wisdom, insights, realizations or enlightenment no. But there are many, many other states that deal with delta and that do give you those insights and experiences. All done in Delta.
