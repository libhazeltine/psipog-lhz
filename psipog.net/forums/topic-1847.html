			Well, this is kinda a difficult position.  See, we could all tell you how we do it,  but that wouldn't necessarily work for you.  I personally use the &quot;jsut do it&quot; method.  I cut out all the enrgy adn conneciton stuff (because I suck at it and can't tell if its there or not) and just move it.  It took me about a month of dedicated practice, about half an hour or so a night.  I jsut looked at it, placed my hand near it (not too near though, convection currents are the bane of my existence) and &quot;expect&quot; it to move.  SOrry, btu thats really the only way this method can be explained.
<br />

<br />
The best advice I can give you, if calm down and take it slow.  You can't rush these things, adn getting frustrated (pun intended) will only delay matters even further by dirupting whatever concentration or dedication you work for.

			I understand what you mean, the &quot;just do it&quot; method is practically impossible to explain.  Although I told you to take it slow, you said you have been trying for over a year now (sorry about the useless tip there  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> ).  To be honest, I feel that having tried so long, adn never getting results is whats stopping you from getting results now, rather than any real confusion.  A common theory about PK around here is that part of the ability to perform it is to convince yourself that you can, &quot;expecting&quot; it. (I see waht you are saying about expecting something to happen.  It's actually more like knowing it will happen.  Its confusing I know, but like I said its really hard to explain.  You should try reading gnome's article on it int he article section)  However, this isn't as easy as it sounds.  
<br />

<br />
To take a line  from &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know&quot;: if you fully believe you can walk on water, you will.  
<br />
However, as it also states, teh problem is that the general public perception is that you can't.  In order to do so you would ahve to convince your own mind against all it has been hard wired to believe from years of socialization.  Positive thinking (for example telling yourself &quot;i can do this, I will move the pinwheel&quot;) won't necessarily bring quick results because thats only a small layer of positive thinking providing a thin veil over an ocean of negative thinking(doubting).  Merely covering the negative doesn't cahnge the fact that the it is still there.  Your goal would be to get rid of the negative or change it to positive. 
<br />

<br />
Your lack of success and the negative mental state that tends to create, I think, is whats crippling you rather than any inability or technique.  I personally believe anyone can do this, not a select few.  I would suggest taking a small break and trying something else.  If you get some success in an area related to Pk (energy work, meditation) then perhaps that could provide the boost needed to break your mental barrier?  
<br />

<br />
Just my thoughts and opinions

			lol  know what you mean sorta. try this:
<br />

<br />
when your in a good mood, possibly energetic, just sit down for a minute or two, and think &quot;yeh i really wanna do this&quot; if your using two hands, visualize a stream coming from one shoulder, through your arm past the wheel into the other shoulder etc like a cycle. 
<br />
keep the visualization, and the good mood. its such a pain to do TK if your bored or you cant be bothered.

			I'm not sure about the energy part either.  However, they do say that energy goes where attention does...  If I'm using energy when i'm doing PK I honestly cannot tell.  However, my hand is often warm and sometimes fuzzy feeling when i'm doing it.  I've heard of these as being symptoms of energy use.  But still, like I said I suck at energy work so I can't tell.  I do knwo that I've never experience what one might call a &quot;burn out&quot;.  If PK uses energy then apparantly I've never practiced long enough to run out.

			Frustrated, whatever technique you decide to use, I'm sure you'll find one that works.  I still think that your biggest problem is your own doubt, but finding a technique that feels right can only help.  A few have been mentioned here already, some involve energy while others don't.  Just experiment, adn find what is right for you.  ALso, give each technique a decent trial period.  Just becuse one technique doesn't work teh first time doesn't eman taht it won't.  It took me about a month or so of experimenting before I got my first results.  However, I knew to remain patient from what I had read on the subject, and give each technique a decent shot.  I was rewarded,a dn I'm sure you will be too if you keep it up.  I'm surprised you have kept it up for as long as you have.  Anyone else would ahve given up long ago.  That kind of determination will come in handy when you do get results.  It takes determination to progress in PK, as it can get kind of dull at times.  Lol, but its worth it in my book.
