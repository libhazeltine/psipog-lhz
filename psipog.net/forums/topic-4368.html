			Tai Chi, well to do it properly i'd suggest a trainer, but if not go for a book, dont really trust net sites much, most I see of them are just book ads and second rate sites.
<br />

<br />
I'd just mosey down to Barn 'n Nobles if your really interested in Tai Chi. Now wether or not it moves energy around, I dont know, but it is relaxing, or so I've been told.

			Tai Chi is like a more violent form of yoga. It's main target is your joints and getting them to work like they should. An important part of tai chi are the weapons, they're all used for bending and warming up, but you can learn some pretty nifty moves with a staff.
<br />

<br />
For an example, i've seen a Tai Chi trainer break 3 staffs during warmup since he used to much strenght on his moves.

			I learned a little bit about tai chi.
<br />

<br />
It is supposed to be a way to stretch and train your body your will and your spirit-body to work together in combat.  All the moves are meant to stretch your muscles and your energy channels all through your body and also to concentrate your will on your motions and on connecting to the spirit-body of your opponent and use his energy against him.
<br />

<br />
I was shown a few moves and I can feel how it stretches the arms and the aura.  When you are learning it, pay attention to your aura and your energy channels and make sure to stretch them and you will feel energy flow much smoother afterwards.

			I believe Tai Chi is considered to be an internal martial art.  An internal martial art has an emphasis on the use of the mind to coordinate the leverage of the relaxed body as opposed to the use of brute strength, and the internal development, circulation, and expression of qì (psi).

			Almost a funny thing this. I've been doing lots and lots of research into all three parts of Tai Chi recently. What do you want to do Tai Chi for? Give us some more information on yourself and what you expect so we can give you better information.
<br />

<br />
Keep this in mind though: The best advice anyone here can give you is to go to a qualified instructor.

			ok well im really into psi but im doing my HSC now so its alot of study and not *that* much time on psi...but im trying to find out ways that a person can control psi better...like ive been learning about chakras...my main problem is with my 'power', i can create sheilds and constructs, but only to a certain extent. by that i mean a certain density of energy, then no matter how hard i concentrate, or how calmly i let it 'flow' it wont get denser (im trying to make solid like constructs to advance into force sheilds, and prolly get more luck with telepathy). basically it feels like ive reached my somewhat limit and i was hoping for ways to; in a way, increase my 'power'

			with practice your energy manipulation skills will increase.  when you are done with your HSC you will have more time to practice, and if you practice enough, you will notice your &quot;power&quot; increasing.  i think the main problem now is you don't have enough time to practice, and when you do, it's not enough to make a significant difference.  the cool thing about energy manipulation is you can do it just about anywhere.  you may be in HSC (which i don't know what that is) but you can still charge your hands, or your body which is related to constructs and sheilds.  even just charging your hands 6-7 times daily and holding the charge will give you results.  just find ways to practice so you can do them while in HSC easily (while still paying attention, or doing whatever it is you do).  if you need some information on charging, or want to ask me a quesiton regarding this issue, feel free to PM me.

			oh the HSC is the higher school certificate in australia. its like a certificate you get after doing year 12, and it has your marks from the actual HSC exam. the courses at Uni have certain mark cutoffs, i need like an average of 88 from all of my exams to do my course at uni.

			OH, ok, i see now.  well, i guess when there is a hiatus you can always charge your hands, or when reading or something...after a while it takes little to no effort, and that's when you know your &quot;power&quot; or skill should be increased in energy manipulation...or at least an aspect of it.
