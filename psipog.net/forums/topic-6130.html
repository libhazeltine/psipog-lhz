			Great show I have to say, yeah my favorite guy is the Japanese* guy. Sorry, just felt like correcting that since I'm taking Japanese... it's nice, I start to pick up a few of the words iwthout looking at the subtitles. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
The end was even better, with the Japanese guy coming from the future. Man his little patch of beard + the sword looked freaking cool. XD
<br />

<br />
Anyways back on topic, I wonder if there will be a psychokinetic character, though I guess that's a bit too... unoriginal imo, for a show. The &quot;mind reader&quot; is cool though.

			Well, Hiro can bend space and time, and thus far he's only used that to stop time, go to the future, go to the past and teleport.  But that's obviously not the extent of such a broad power.  I'm sure he'll figure out that manipulation of space includes TK. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I personally like the girl with split personalities.  And the fact that Peter guy is like the Rogue of the Heroes universe was a very cool plot development.  Hell, let's face it, they're all interesting characters.  That's what keeps drawing me in since the writing is pretty mediocre overall.

			haha its an amazing show i freaking love it. except for the japanese or chinese guy or whatever. my mate and i feel he over does it. i love the killer guy  though. when he willed the cop backwords and forced her pistol to her head i yelled in excitment because he was a telekinetic lmao. i was so excited for some reason. i think it was because we were yet to see that skill represented on that show and its so common soo.....
<br />

<br />
but yes i love it. cheerleader has the best power. sucks about her papi though

			I'm just wondering how credible this show is... 
<br />

<br />
I mean, first of all, how do you go about finding these people, conduct a survey,? or just say hey all those with crazy powers come over here, the rest of you can leave.
<br />

<br />
Now think about the on set filming.  Do they really do it? I mean we were so excited when we found vids of nina kulagina, are these real occurences.  Anyway, they may not have to use their &quot;powers&quot; on set, they may do it like any other camera trickery.  The cop that is &quot;willed&quot; to shot herself, could be just acting...
<br />

<br />
I'm just sayin, this kinda junk would've been in the news a long while ago.  Guy flys and saves a falling woman!!!  Someone brings items from the future!!!  ...   I'm sayin it would be in the paper because most people would notice some guy flying.
<br />

<br />
Lol, I still have to watch the show... I'm only basing this on what I've heard, and by what I saw online.  Well, when or if I move to Japan I'll let you know if I see Hiro (or whatever his real name is) and ask him to teleport.
