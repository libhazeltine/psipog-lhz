			And your own memories are just that... your own... you know them intimately... And they are boring, really, unless it happens to be of a one-time thing that only YOU experienced and held great value to you (generally romantic...) But on the other hand, browsing through other's memories would be like watching a movie, you could learn anything they know, watch their memories in HD quality whereas maybe they could only see them partially and not sure what happened except for some basic points... i could see MANY uses for this, both as fun and as being practical.[/quote]

I was thinking of maybe... OTHER sorts of memories... you gave me a twitch in the eye right there... ewwwwww...  (pepsi as lube?? <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />) um yeah... not like youd have to sit through it, theoretically you would just use the NEXT SCENE button ASAP. And if thats all there is... you have... a very active pair.

			a twitch in the EYE is exactly my point.
<br />

<br />
how could you exactly stay in control of what memories you are to view or not?
<br />

<br />
i dont think its possible to be in complete control of someone elses memories and blah blah its just going to give you another twitch in the eye.
