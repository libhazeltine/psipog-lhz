			Ugghh!! Ive been practicing this for probably well over a year with just spinning the straw and foil. I havent had a major success with any other object since i started the straw about 5 months back. Yes ive practiced with other objects. Rolling a can and such but not really any success. I put it on the edge of a binder and got it to roll down the slope. But that doesnt mean that i was rolling. It means that i was pushing the can until it rolled by itself. Im seriously considering either starting over with a new technique and mindset, or just flat out stopping. So, any imput?

			man i dunno i strongly think if you can push it to roll that halfway there. I know youl probably want to stab me in the face for saying this because youve heard it so much but just <span style="font-weight: bold">keep going</span> i know you can do it. ANYONE can do ANYTHING they put there mind to.

			I dont feel any stronger in TK though. I feel the exact same as i did when i started. I had a lot of belief in myself until I notcied that I havent moved anything significant. I hear stories from all these people that have success in a week of practicing, and it really brings me down. I mean they can move something that i have only dreamed of in a week and all i can do is move this damn straw? Where the hell is the justice in that? I havent skipped a practice day this whole year ive been practicing. When I was a kid I always thought TK existed and now I find out it does but im not good at it? Its one of the worst feelings.

			Just calm down.  Take a deep breath.  Relax.  Its all going to be ok.
<br />

<br />
But seriously...
<br />

<br />
Practice other areas of psionics, and I bet that if you give it a month away from TK while you practice TP, RV, etc you will come back to TK stronger than ever.  Just like physically working out, dont do it every day, every other.

			Meh, ive never been interested in any other skills. The telepathy practice ive been doing from here seems like just one big guessing game. I believe in TP, but all the practice ive done with it everybody was just guessing. Maybe I need to take a break, or just stop altogether.

			Well, if you wanted to practice TP, I am an excellent sender.  Let me know.  Trust me, a break from TK helps.  I took some time off and came back stronger than before.

Edit:  Btw, im from indiana as well...

know EXACTLY what you mean...
<br />
sometimes i even think it isn't possible.. i doubt from myself and others. but fortunantly im able to repel this ideas VERY fast now.
<br />

<br />
it took me some good time to have my first real result, actually 2 days (LOL JOKING) ew, i got so very excited. it was 4 days ago, on daddys birthday. but it took me like, ew! 11 months , i did acc on psipog on august 16 of last year!!, almost an year ^^
<br />
so, i had my first sucess on june 16. i was so lazy to pratice half an hour each day and stuff, i felt bored to hell, didn't think that would work, and had no enthusiasm either i think, you know, that thing you feel that makes you want to do something despite it not being the most funny stuff. now i do have this feeling, i was  feeling like that some time until now, so it wasnt like from nowhere. and it took me much mental programing, like being able to read all this guys ojn foruns without having that background think annoying me with: omg, this guys must be lying. i can't believe it. and so on. and convincing myself that i was able, and so on.
<br />
maybe you trained but without actually believing it (althou i think it would be difficult to train so hard as you said if you didn't believe)
<br />
try to refresh your ideas, leave it for some time, but think about it, and try to rework your mind to accept it better.
<br />
hope i was helpfull ^^
<br />

<br />
ps: this is real, really ^^
