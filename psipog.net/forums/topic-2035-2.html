			I don't understand the attitude.  Does that make you feel special when you flame and bash?  I come here for understanding of things that have affected me both positively and negatively for the last 34yrs of my life.  I greatly appreciate the kind words and insight given by the others on this board.  You, my friend, though you asked not, are still forgiven.  Lighten up man, there is no need to do all that stuff to people.  I have done you no wrong.

			lol. You know this sounds awfully familiar. hehe anyone who has seen harry potter will know. That ball that dumbledore has that he can relive memories from? lol maybe thats where the idea came from. And it actually seems like a really cool and useful thing to be able to do. If you forget soemthing you can go back and remember it again. How useful!

Filter? Wouldn't filter (in terms of memory) be otherwise known as delete? Im not sure if our minds can filter like a computer can filter on google. If thats what you mean anyway.

So you've been mentally going back in time? That's interesting. Perhaps you can search the web to gain conscious control so it won't keep bothering you. Or you could make your own exercise by concentrating on a memory and going from there.

			You have done me no wrong. Eh? Howabout lie. Lies are all around this god forsaken forum. All you noobs come and lie, I don't know why. It doesn't make you cool. People don't like you more because of it. I'm a skeptic, especialy when people who are &quot;new&quot; come in claiming to do something that nobody else has ever mentioned. I mean, listen to yourselves, buying into his crap.  He's claiming something that, while not impossible, comes with so much improbability, that it might as well be impossible. Plus he did it by &quot;accident&quot; which further goes to show that he's just trying to act cool. I don't believe your lies for a second, and I don't think others should either, but of course, nobody says anything to the morons on this board who come in and bullshit everybody. So I do. You fluffers can all band together if you want, your opinion doesn't matter. The truth is what matters, and the truth is that this guys a bullshiter. And also, don't &quot;forgive&quot; me. Because there is nothing for me to be forgiven for. You're a liar. I just called you on it. That's the reason I flame and bash. After a nice telling off, most people stop with the bullshit. Apparently you got a load of suckers to believe you though. It's a shame.

			what makes you think this is bullshit?  this isn't a rare phenomena (sp?).  just the fact that i knew what this was called should give you a clue that people have heard of it!  i respect that you are skeptical and all, but don't just go around calling everyone fluffs without research.  now, if you did a search on this, and found no one else this has happened to, then maybe you have grounds to judge.  but since this has a name, then i guess it must have happened before  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> .  besides, if you are skeptic to psionics, then wouldn't you be saying everything is bullshit?  what's the fun of being on a forum that pisses you off?  there's no point to it.  if you don't like the content, then don't come here.  there is a disclaimer after all.  and what do you mean our opinions don't count?  that sounds like communism to me, and you aren't stalin (nor is this russia).  also, wasn't it considered &quot;truth&quot; that the world was flat until some &quot;moron&quot; by the name of christoper columbus proved it was round?  no one did any research when they said it was flat, and he was considered a moron and a fluffbunny (or 1400's equivilent) for saying so.  now we know that the world is round thanks to his courage to &quot;bullshit&quot; the king and queen.  the same thing is happening now, only you are the king, and we are all christopher columbus.

BTW, i believe that you ARE entitled to your own opinion, but lets speak our 2 cents in a civil manner.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Honestly, whether or not you believe it does not mean you have to force your opinions on other people and try to convince them. I'm skeptical about this but then I take in the fact that this could be real but you don't see me trying to enforce my opinion on anyone. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

He did it on accident.  If he didn't do it on accident he wouldn't be asking what the heck is going on.

			I moved this to the Dream Phenomenon as it has nothing to do with telepathy. It may or may not have been a dream I think this is the best location for it because of the lack of psi topics in the General Discussion area.

			Man, what is that dude's problem?  I admit that there may be liars posting here and there but that is just the way it is.  You can call me what you want to you but the &quot;TRUTH&quot; as you say, is that what is happening to me IS happening.  I neither know why nor what it is.  Therefore I have &quot;humbled&quot; myself (something you seem to have a problem doing) and asked for understanding.  No pride here, I KNOW that i do not know about this so I am asking your more experienced guys.  No worries though, I'm not offended as I am here to gain insight and understanding, not to wage a war with you.  You can rant on and on but you'll do it alone.  To the rest of you, I wholeheartedly appreciate your responses in ways you will never know..but then again you might  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Everybody think for a moment. You don't start trying to OBE and as soon as you try, BAM! You're out of your body, flying around with perfect sight/touch/hearing/smell/taste. You start out like a vegetable(maybe some people start out better then others, either way you don't start out perfect.) and you work your way up. Basically he's claiming to be able to OBE into his memories, and he has perfect OBE by accident. Come on people, use your brains, that just doesn't happen. (And by the way, you guys brought up the christopher columbus thing, so it is relevent.)
