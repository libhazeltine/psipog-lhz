			Yeah. Well i'm not too sure if i'm posting in the right spot or not, but I thought i'd give it a shot. A couple of things have happened out of teh blue and I was wondering if it was possible to verify wether or not I was doing something or i've lost the plot.
<br />

<br />
Both involved possible PK but were spontaneous. One was at work, heightened state of emotional distress, didn't feel out of the ordinary, got home and my key was bent. It spent the whole time in my pocket.
<br />

<br />
Second one i went to open the medicinal cabinet and something on top got pushed off as i was sliding the door across. Didn't seem as if something fell on it to knock it off, but looking back on something weird like that you start asking maybe it happened like this, or like this and things get muddled.
<br />

<br />
And plus the whole thing of spontaneaty poses a few questions that I wouldn't mind discussing. Namely why it happens (if it happened).
<br />

<br />
Yeah so anyway, if I am posting in the wrong spot sorry. But yeah, thanks for reading the post anyway.

Your not crazy, I'd think you're learning.

			You aren't going crazy. But that key thing sounds awesome.

Was it bent to a degree that isn't possible by normal means? (via hands, etc)

			I don't think you're going crazy. I've had the same thing happen to me with metal and emotions.

			Well, as for the keys, they were bent as if they'd become pliable for a moment, like twisted slightly instead of just bent in one direction. Being an uber weakling/slack person at the time, I had a couple of shots at bending a key of similar alloy physically and got nowhere incredibly fast.
<br />

<br />
As for the learning part, that's where the problem lies. It wasn't a conscious decision to do anything. How can I learn something I didn't mean to do, why does it pop up (if it is an exertion of something more than physical), how do I even know it was me, etc.
