Though in Japan the PS3 has sold a lot more units that the 360 even though the 360 has been out longer… But the Wii has also sold A LOT more units than the PS3 (even tough its been out longer)

			The Wii, in my opinion, will never be as good as consoles like the PS3 and XBox 360. Now, I hear you asking why. Because it's not built for gamers. Now, when I say gamers, I don't mean people who enjoy playing videogames from time to time, and play often enough to keep the console from getting dusty. I'm talking about people who's primary means of entertainment is videogames, people who spend the majority of their extra money on them. Now, gamers are, by nature, not physically fit. So the Wii won't fit them well, as it requires some level of endurance. Similarly, once the original novelty of &quot;actually swinging the sword&quot; wears off, it's gonna be any other console system, just with a weird controller. The controller also limits the style of gameplay that games can have. You won't be able to play games like Final Fantasy and Unreal Tournament easily. I see the Wii not so much as a mainstream gaming console, but more of something one would break out at a party, sort of like those DDR mats you can get. Something that would be the center of attention in social gatherings, not something you would be able to play for 3 hours straight. Gamers are the ones who buy the majority of the games/consoles, and if the console isn't built for them, then they're less likely to buy it. If gamers aren't buying a console, then they've lost a huge part of the market, and aren't making any money.
<br />

<br />
However, if I had the money, I would still definitely buy one, for one reason and one reason only: The exercise. I could get on the machine and get an hour workout, all by playing videogames. My laptop and PS2 would still be my primary gaming systems, however. I would only be using the Wii for exercising. But, since I'm broke, I'm stuck with exercising the old-fashioned way.

			Eldibs, I disagree with your statement that the Wii is not built for gamers.  I see it as being built primarily for gamers, but still being easily accessible for ‘non-gamers’.
<br />

<br />
My primary means of entertainment are video games (and hopefully I will be apart of the industry in a few years) and I can safely say that the Wii is currently offering the most entertaining games I have played.  Yes there are a lot of multiplayer party games, such as Wii sports and wario ware, but doesn’t the PS2 have a lot of stuff like that too (Buzz, and I-toy for example)?   And don’t forget that the Wii isn’t limited to using motion sensor technology, a Wii game could be developed to use the classic controller, or even a gamecube controller, though I don’t see why a game like final fantasy wouldn’t work on the Wii, Zelda worked a treat.  And lets not forget the virtual console.  If that wasn’t made for the hardcore gamer, I don’t know what was  
<br />

<br />
And didn’t Sony say that the PS3 isn’t a games console?

			It's all opinion and preference. One might have quicker loading times, another might have more pixel display, and another more leading game titles, yet none of those things make any of the sysems &quot;better&quot; than another. Some people don't mind the loading times and they'd prefer to go for graphics. Some like specific types of games that are exclusive to a specific system. Nothing makes one &quot;better&quot; than the other. Some may carry out tasks more efficiently than others, yet they all have their pull factors. It just depends on what you prefer and enjoy. 
<br />

<br />
But I still say, in the long run, ps3 is going to stomp the competition lol.

			Hmm... I think I might have to agree with derrick here. Every console has its place.
<br />

<br />
Though I will say a game like Final Fantasy really wouldn't work well with the motion-sensor. It worked for Zelda because Zelda is an Action/RPG. There's lots of moving around and the combat is in real-time. Final Fantasy has typically been more of a free-roam turn-based game. I don't really see the new controller working with something like that.

			Hahaha.... you barely even have to move for the Wii. Exercise? Yeah; right. You can SIT and play Wii games quite comfortably. I have a 'larger' friend who has a Wii and loves the hell out of it. Hell, it's a damn cool system and the concept is something that has been needed for a long time. I can see using the controller to aim help console FPS's a great deal. If you so choose, you can imitate a full-sword swing, but all's is really needed is a little flick of the wrist. That's it. If it gets the general idea for the movement, it executes it without any trouble.

			That's great UltimaRage, but that's not how it's being advertised. Every time you see the Wii on TV, there are people jumping around, swinging their arms and such. Besides, if you want realism, you'll have to be moving around swinging your arms. Flicking your wrist is not how you swing a real sword, you have to use your whole arm. And it's common knowledge that people like realism.
<br />

<br />
Also, aiming to help console FPS is a thing of preference. Personally, I'd rather stick with a mouse/keyboard or a controller, because aiming is only half the battle in an FPS. There's a lot of running and dodging as well. However, the Wii may bring back the &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; and &quot;Time Crisis&quot; style videogames, and I really hope it does. Time Crisis is the only reason I ever go to an arcade, and for me, games like that would almost make the Wii worth buying by themselves.

Every milestone increase in videogame popularity has come from inducting more people into the ever-growing community of &quot;gamers&quot;.  Atari came out with video game systems long before Nintendo, but Nintendo made it more accessible to the mainstream and reaped the rewards.  It wasn't necessary the most sophisicated combination of the technologies at the time, but it's mainstream appeal powered it's success.  The Halo game franchise is another example.  It was not an amazing game technologically, plot-wise or gameplay-wise.  But what it did was made first person shooters more accessible to the mainstream because it didn't require a good computer and frequent upgrades to the system.  Is a first person shooter really BETTER with a controller than a keyboard and mouse?  Most gamers will tell you no, the joysticks are more clumsy and thus there is not really much success in bringing twitch shooters to consoles.  But again, Halo made it mainstream and is huge as a result.  The Wii looks like it's following this formula.  It's not the technologically best system, it may have some shit games for it since developers aren't really used to dealing with such a controller, but it's making gaming more mainstream by not forcing you to perform a static activity (often in a sort of social isolation), and that's where it's strength lies.  Sure, gamers may prefer a more puritan experience of gaming, but they're still a minority regardless of their evergrowing numbers.  The mainstream, non-gamer market is where the money is to be made because it's untapped.
<br />

<br />
Also, on a different note of dispute, the PS3 has been doing terribly in Japan.  The PS2 had sold 1.5 million units by this point after launch, the PS3 has only sold .5 million.  Remember that the PS2 at launch was a bit cheaper, but was still a strain on the wallet back in the days of launch.  As a result of the poor selling Sony has ALREADY dropped the PS3's price in Japan.  That's how badly their selling, a price drop this soon after launch is a pretty desperate move.
