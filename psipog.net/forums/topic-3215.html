			I am new to the forums of PsiPog but have been a member for over a year, I did switch usernames however. I was always wondering about a rating system for psions based on overall accomplisment and knowledge. I was thinking on a Leve/Class 1-5, used strictly for quick reference so you can help beginners and more advanced people at that. The overall rating will encompass different psionic skills. This is not meant to boast, because I assure you I would be the lowest class/level rating with a 1. Tell me what you think.

			It's been mentioned quite a few times now and it can make people make mental blocks about stuff because it's not on their &quot;level&quot;. If someone was very gifted with pk and they wanted to move lets say two psiwheels in opposite directions(and let's say they could) but they would see it wasn't on their &quot;level&quot; and would be discuraged....

			Well, instead of that, which would incorperate ALOT of authority to people who aren't mods, we could try a list of skills that the person practices and can do. That can help new people know who does what and who they can ask or pm for help. Good idea. 
<br />

<br />
Perhaps, we could then go deeper and rate how good they are with each of those skills. For example:
<br />

<br />
Psi_manipulator_3000
<br />
(insert avatar here)
<br />
(insert location here)
<br />
Skills: PK, energy manipulation, TP
<br />
PK: 5/10
<br />
Energy manipulation: 5/10
<br />
TP: 2/10
<br />

<br />
Ok, that may seem complicated to make, but maybe it could be simplified?
<br />
I personally, think this could work, especially for noobs who don't know who to ask questions too. It could be added to the profile section so it can be edited whenever. The only problem I see with this is that people may lie...

			how would we go about rating all 1796 of you?  What would a rating of 10 mean?  Absolutely perfect?

Read the above. It can be edited by the members. It was just an idea, and try not to be overlycritical.
<br />
I don't know what a rating of 10 means since I just pulled that out my ass. What would your idea be?

My question was a serious one.  i am not overlycritical.  If an idea is going to be submitted, it has to be completely thought out

			How about just a reputation system -.-
<br />
there can be a + and - and a number below the names on the left of the posts(you know what I mean).  You can click the + or - button once every week per person(or ip address).. or something like that.
<br />
Put a - if they're rude.
<br />
Put a + if they're nice.
<br />
