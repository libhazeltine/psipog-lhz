			hey,
<br />

<br />
alot of people that ask questions here have not takin time to read shit.  seriously before youve asked a question make sure to read the psions handbook (on the main site in the newbies section) and peebrains psiball article (on the main site in the articles section).  every single question they ask could be answered by doing a little reasherch and trying for a month or so.  so stop and think, &quot;have i accualy read the shit on the subject&quot;, cause there are people who have made an honest atempt that we're trying to help and your just using our time.

That was uncalled for....you are a hypocrit from what you posted above. You're ranting about people asking for help then you ask for help. You said study gets you places, then study, psipog isn't the only place like this there are others that might have article psipog doesn't have yet......

If someone needs help they may ask, that's why PsiPog is around.

If you want to help people to learn how to help themselves don't make a post which rude language and without some type of description on how they should help themself.
