			I dont thinkyou can become visual, but if you GF is senseitive to energy the she may be able to sence your presence. Me and my Gf did an experiment where i would go out of body at a random time of the day (or try) and i would try to make her feel me by passing through her, she would thennote down the time and see if it matched the time i went out. we had good results she was right 4/5 times.

			NO. you can NOT become visual or make sounds in an obe. when your obeing your still dreaming, your not in reality. an obe is just a dream that is pretty much real time reality

I'll correct you. An OBE is not a dream at all. I would say it's more like another state of consciousness. You are in reality, just not the same one your used to. While in OBE you are still traveling around the real world and real places, which is nothing like a dream. A dream is 100% in your head. An OBE is your conscious actually LEAVING your body, and travelling wherever you want to go. Secondly, Robert Monroe has said he was seen by people many times while in OBE, he just does not know why only some few have been able to do so. I'm not saying it's 100%, but this is what his claims are. (I don't think there's anyone more reliable to go to.) He said he's just been on the street sidewalk before and for some reason this girl could see him as soon as she came into visual contact, and started going crazy calling for her b/f and freaking out, so he just flew away.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
P.S It's also nothing like a dream because your mind is not asleep. Your body is asleep and your mind is 100% awake and fully functional and in control of what your doing. EVERYONE who's experienced one knows it NOTHING like dreaming.

			Acording to robert monroe, you can interact with peoples &quot;etheric&quot; bodies - on a etheric level, not directly on physical. So you can talk to people's subc (?) or ther &quot;etheric&quot; body. Though acording to the chakra system the etheric body is our nerve-body in a non-physical way - so through that you can interact with peoples &quot;nerves&quot;/senses.
<br />

<br />
In Journeys out of Body Monroe described one such encounter. He went out of body, and went to his friends house, where there were three women talking. One of them was his friend. He could talk to that person on an &quot;etheric&quot; level, even though she was talking to those two women at the same time on a physical level - unbenotes to his presence. So it was something like she was two people, one one each &quot;level&quot;. So anyway he asked her will she remember him being here and having this conversation. She said of course. He than pinched her in the vaste area, although she insisted that he shold not do that. In that moment her physical self jumped up as something pinched her in physical reality. He later had a conversation with that woman, she couldnt remember anything abot the coversation they had on an &quot;etheric&quot; level, although she confirmed that she felt the pinch and even shoved the redness on her skin, caused by the pinch!
<br />

<br />
So unless monroe was lying, etheric and physical are not so far away..
