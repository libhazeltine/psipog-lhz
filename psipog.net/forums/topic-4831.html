			Well, since you folks have a section for this....
<br />
I've been practicing at lucid dreaming ever since I read about it as a kid. I can lucid dream whenever I want. Most of the time, I tend to grant myself abilities that I've seen in cartoons I used to watch. Dragonball Z style flying, for example.
<br />
The only times I dont lucid dream are when Im bored of always controlling things, and I just sit back and let my subconcious entertain me, and when my mind or something else is trying to tell me something.
<br />
I can also will myself awake with ease.

			you know, I cant remember if it took alot of practice or not. It was easily over ten years ago.
<br />
It was just one of those things after I read about it I was like &quot;Yeah, I'm gonna do this.&quot;
<br />
Mainly because I used to have ALOT of nightmares, and I wanted to be able to do something about it.
<br />

<br />
My advice? Its easy to start yourself on the right path.
<br />

<br />
Every day, a few times throughout your day, repeatedly tell yourself &quot;Tonight I'm going to dream about *insert something here*&quot;
<br />
lets pick flying for example. Telling yourself that you'll dream about flying will imbed that thought in your mind. Tell yourself it again when you go to bed, it might even help to put a drawing or a photoshopped printout of you flying under your pillow.
<br />

<br />
After a few tries, you should have a dream about flying. The more you work at this, the better you'll get. This isnt lucid dreaming itself, but its practice to strengthen your ability to influence your dreams, which LEADS to lucid dreaming. If you can control your dreams from the outside, thats one step closer to doing it from the inside.
<br />

<br />
Once you get good at that, start trying to NOTICE when you are in a dream. The way I do it is I bite my bottom lip. If it hurts, I know Im awake. If its numb, Im most likely in a dream. Once you have your &quot;marker&quot; the next step is to affirm that. &quot;I'm dreaming&quot; - say that IN your dream, to reassure yourself. Once you know its a dream, remember a dream happens in your mind. YOU call the shots. At that point, you can do ANYTHING you want.
<br />

<br />
I grant myself dream abilities. I work at them over time, since many of them are sensations I've never actually felt (Flying, shooting lasers out my eyes, conjuring things out of nothing, regrowing a severed limb) I have to practice them in-dream until my mind can come up with a good approximation of what I think they would feel like. Just recently, I mastered walking on water. I used naruto and chakra as a guide for that, and thus mastering water walk allowed me to walk on walls as well. Now that I've mastered it, I will ALWAYS have that ability in my dreams.

			this infact is a problem for me - you said NOTICE when you're dreaming.. i never notice; im just watching stuff unfold.. nothing bothers me, not the inverted colors, not the changing of shapes etc.. nada.. the only time i noticed sth was of is when i drove my car to the garage taht day, and then in my dreams i saw it on a parking lot.. than i said to myself no way, it cant be here, am i dreaming? HURRAy! Lucid for the firs time! anyway.. the car wasnt red in my dreams as it is in reallity.. it hade some different rims on, it was even a bit of a different shape.. and it was changing.. and nothing bothered me. Just the car not beeing in a garage.
<br />

<br />
So how do i start noticing ood stuff?

			You do reality checks throughout the normal day. Ask yourself if you are dreaming, and then test something. Pain doesn't usually come through in dreams. (I have never experienced it  but others claim to have) A popular check is to look at your hands and actually count your fingers while asking if you are dreaming. However, this has failed me personally and my freinds as well, so it is always good to do two reality checks at any one time. Another good one is to plug your nose and try to breath through it. If you can, you are obviously dreaming.

			Biting my bottom lip has never failed me, and it's inconspicuous enough that you can do it throughout the day without people looking at you and wondering what the hell you are doing.

			I have only had 3 or 4 lucid dreams and that was before I knew what they were. I haven't had one in a few years. It sucks.
<br />

<br />
I go to bed in like.. never mind I should be asleep now but I'll tell myself that I am here and stuff like that when I lay down.
<br />

<br />
Does sleeping medicine like Melatonin effect lucid dreaming at all? I have had normal dreams when I take the stuff.

			This is totally inspiration to write that dreaming FAQ...i'm getting tired of answeing these questions. Melatonin is reputed to be a dreaming/sleep aid, yes. However, I have heard that it helps to keep you in the dream and to increase the vividity but not neccesarily to make you lucid. Besides reality checks, about the only other way I know of that I can think of is subconsciou programming. Peebrain has a few articles about talking to your sub-c. And the forum has a few as well. All you have to do is ask/tell (depending on how you view the sub-c) that you will notice dreamsigns and will become lucid.

			bah, ive been wanting to lucid dream for so long now, i have about 3 times before but they were all because i noticed something in my dream (one time i was in school, and i went &quot;wait, i cant be, its summer, im dreaming&quot; then i got excited and told everyone in the class room, thus ruining it and making me wake up <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> ) and yet when i start flying in a dream i dont notice it...
<br />
and i must be weird or something, i once tried biting my lip and pinching myself in my dream, but i felt the pain...i have no clue why...

			You know, I think one thing that's been holding me back about lucid dreaming/OBEs/AP is that I fear that I will wake up and my mind will be so tired out from doing all that, that I'll be dead for work the next day.  When you work full time, that gets to be a pain because you can then only practice 2 days/nights a week.
<br />

<br />
So... <span style="font-style: italic">do</span> you end up feeling mentally drained, or do you simply feel rested?

			Your mind still gets the same amound of rest it would during a normal sleep.

And yeah, I take melatonin and a couple other over the counter sleep aids, and I can still lucid dream with ease.

			People you should really try not to take pills, specially so young. I have heard that melatonin might be healthy, but the sideeffects are not yoet prooven.. but your body can make plenty of melatonin on your own, this is how we were designed; not to be dependant on some pills. and every such thing might cause an addiction over time and then the pills have you in control. Take control, dont take any aids, nor meds unless you really have to. And you people in the states are even more expossed to such life. And its bad.
