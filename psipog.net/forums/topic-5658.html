			So... Im very intrested in OBEs. I was just wondering if you can feel the air and still breath oxygen when your in OBEs. I was also wondering if you could ACTUALLY feel the pressure when you fly. Or, is it just like a dream type of feeling...

			Umm I dont think we have a penis as our spiritual self so good luck with that. And by the way how do you know that you don't start leaving your body in random places like your arm first before your completely out? I'm pretty sure it doesn't all just happen at once.

			In my honest opinion I think the body is still connected to you even after you leave it. I wouldnt really know because I never been able to OBE succufuly yet (well not exactly possible on this). But its how I think so far. I just think you can still feel your body when you OBE.

I know there's proof in these and I shouldn't have to go find and quote it myself. You guys need to go and read actual experiences in this seeing as NONE of you have done it yet. Go LEARN something and not just make assumptions because it sounds right to you. And Ryanb21 why do you think it doesn't happen all at once, because just to let you know Robert Monroe, who has experience in HUNDREDS of OBE's and is founder of the MONROE INSTITUE actually says it does happen all at once. He never once mentioned one part of him slipping out into it at a time. His CONSCIENCE slowly slipped out at 1st, then after more experience it was instant. INSTANT! And the penis thing was sarcasm based toward your empty arguments. Sorry if it went over your head. But seriously, read the books and you'll see your wrong.
<br />

<br />
P.S you cannot feel your body when in deep OBE...At least thats what he says, although I'm sure noones tried to push him while he's under. but he's had his cat and other things walk, or touch him and there was no feeling of the body....Just sort of a &quot;signal&quot; to return to it
