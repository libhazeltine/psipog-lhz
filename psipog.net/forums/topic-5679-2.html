&quot;Many of the top Mentalists in the world have no idea how Uri Geller can make a compass needle move. Since he does so in his bathing suit and has been checked over by ultra sensitive equipment for metal or magnetic radiation, he obviously is NOT using a hidden magnet to move the compass needle. Since reliable sources (and knowledgeable magicians) have not only witnessed Geller make spoons bend but have witnessed them to continue moving long after Mr. Geller has left, I would challenge these so called protectors and magic geniuses to explain how he does it. If they reply, “I don’t know for sure” then they have no right to say that he is a fake.&quot;

I don't have a belief in Uri's powers. Simply because, to date, I've never met him. However, I dispute all so-called exposures by Randi and others that claim to be the methods used by Uri. A viewing of the Stanford Research Videos and various lab reports show that most methods touted by the sceptics are almost certainly not those used by Uri. This is also backed up by personal reports from people like Barrie Richardson and others I know who are experts in the fields of close-up magic &amp; mentalism with an in-depth knowledge of misdirection techniques. These guys would not be fooled by the spoon-bending methods published Randi, Ben Harris and others. Bear in mind that with spoon-bending, the audience know &quot;in advance&quot; what the effect will be. There is no surprise element - no twists or final kickers. A spoon is held, and the spoon will bend. Yet, Uri has succeeded in fooling some very clever magicians with just that. The very idea that one simply has to create a method that &quot;resembles&quot; the phenomenon = fraud, is totally silly.

I am a true skeptic and had also read books and viewed videos on how magicians bend keys. 
<br />

<br />
Uri got in my car, pulled a spoon from the hotel from his pocket and asked me to examine it. It was solid and hard to bend by force. He held it between one finger and thumb by the bowl and g-e-n-t-l-y rubbed it with a finger of his other hand. It began to bend! 
<br />

<br />
Then he placed it on the dashboard near the windshield and as I watched, the spoon bent by itself until it was at a ninety degree angle. I was later told that this is referred as &quot;after bending&quot; although I had not heard of it or had it described before. 
<br />

<br />
There was no switch of the spoon or secret bending after I had examined it. It simply stayed in plain sight at all times. 
<br />

<br />
By total coincidence although Uri would call it something else I had just received a book I had ordered about him by Margolin (?) -- an English author. (I'm typing this in Florida and the book is in Toronto.) I had not read it when I met him but, naturally, I raced to it the next day. Therein, I encountered for the first time another's description of the after-bending phenomenon. In the author's case, the partially bent spoon was placed by Uri on Margolin's son's hand where it continued to bend to 90 degrees. 
<br />

<br />
We invited Uri and his partner (who was not with us in the car) to a charity event that evening emceed by magician David Ben. I had shown David the bent spoon earlier. During the evening, Uri volunteered to bend a spoon which could then be auctioned off for the charity. David watched him like a hawk as Uri borrowed a spoon from a guest at one of the tables. Again, with gentle rubbing, the spoon bent. Then Uri placed it in that condition on the lectern David was using and stood well back. David had other duties to perform, but when he next looked at the spoon it had bent some more to 90 degrees.

That's all I can tell you. I have no explanation.

&quot;The newest and most sensational outcropping of supposed PK powers has happened in the form of a brilliant young Israeli magician, Uri Geller. Geller specializes in bending metal objects like spoons, keys and nails by concentrating on them. Unlike his predecessors, he is amazingly versatile and constantly changes his feats and methods so as to defy detection. His brand of working is totally new to both magic and psychic investigation. He is totally unpredictable and completely natural in bearing. He is not a showman in the usual sense of the word. Yet, drama is inherent in what he does. His methods are unorthodox and clever. Even magicians can only guess at them. At the time of this writing Geller has yet to be caught and, if he keeps operating in the same manner, is not likely to be. He is riding a fantastic wave of publicity - everyone knows about the man who bends keys with his mind.&quot;

Here's some more &quot;liars&quot; quotes that <span style="font-weight: bold">AREN'T</span> from his site...And how do you expect me to get scientific papers if they were never posted on the net. You know it would be impossible. What a dumb fucking argument. Everyone says he cheats it's easy. A lot of magicians can do it. Show me ONE magician who can do it the same as him then. Since it so easy. ONE person who can bend the spoon without even holding it.
<br />
And yes, my fault for posting I don't want your opinion. I forgot you guys are all smarter than all these phony, money hungry, and must-be moronic scientists and people. Fuck this, fuck you, Jesus Jesus religion religion lock this shit up I'm done with this thread.
