			I do not practice empathy often. Although, I do know how to do it. I woke up, this tuesday. I had this HUGE feeling of sadness, trying to figure out what was the matter. It was like a cloud of depression. I sat there for at least thirty minutes. Suddenly I heard a scream. Not a playful one, but one of those blood-curdling ones like you hear in horror movies that sends shivers down your spine. I tossed on a pair of pants and ran outside to see what happened. There was a mexican lady standing outside of her garage crying. I ran over to see what happened and when I looked in the garage, a young man was hanging from the ceiling. I can still see that guy.... Lifeless, swinging from the rope teathered around his neck, with that saddened look on his face. For the past two days I have been really depressed. And anyone I talk to seems to make me angry, even though they do not intend to do so. What should I do? Is this something I can fix psionically, or should I go se a psychaitrist?

			How old are you? And yeah, you should maybe see a mental health professional if you can't get over what you saw.

			I'm 15. I think what I'll do is just give myself a couple to get over it. I think maybe some of the anxiety is maybe coming from the fact that this only happened a couple of days ago. If I'm still overly depressed by Monday I'll seek professional help.

			It's pretty normal for 15 year old kids to have huge mood swings. Don't worry about that too much.

i second that. seeing a hanging corpse would be incredibly traumatizing.

Sorry you had to witness this.
<br />
It has only been two days, it is to soon to say that you need a psychiatrist. Just let it be for awhile, accept that you are feeling down and depressed and give yourself the time to recover. It is just like a physical wound, only now it is mental.
<br />

<br />
Also, perhaps you could meditate on your own center, to get into your own energy and strength again. With the center, I mean the second chakra if you believe in them, just below the navel, the stomach area. Or meditate on anything that you consider to be your own source of energy. This will get rid of the empathic emkotions, and will get you back your own emotional system.
