<br />
Why does Kief say in his second post in this topic that he's seen psychokinetic stuff when he's a kid, then goes on to say it's not real? 
<br />

I can quote if you want to start frothing at the mouth.

			And I'd like to see Kief quote his supposed evidence, yadda yadda, etc, etc, stuff.
<br />

<br />
He claims he's done research...you want to, um, you know, do what more or less, most of the scientific community does? Back it up? With factual evidence, rather than 'word of mouth'? 
<br />

Newton didn't just say OMG! GRAVITY! and everybody believed him.

I could of course be wrong, but you seem to be a very unbalanced and confused (angry?) person, and I bet that in real life situations you have problems because of your i'm-all-knowing attitude here, in cyber-reality. Don't get me wrong I'm no psychologist and I'm not here to judge you, in fact like most of the people here I'm trying to help you but since you've decided to live in your blind little world, nobody can really help you and this debate could last another century or so.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

o and by the way infected i am 16 yrs old. heheh. we arent all as stupid as some ppl think. and i would actually think kief has the mind of a neglected 8 yr old looking for attention.

			Yeah I know that was the use of a stereotype I'm sorry.
<br />

<br />
But MOSTLY people that go write in such an idiotic manner are usually 15 year old kids with nothing better to do <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />. I didn't mean anything bad, I know people from this site that have like 13 years and still they are more intelligent writers than Kief.

			im not sure its possible to get much dumber then kief... but anyway i didnt really take much offense to it. most ppl at my school can be incredibly stupid most of the time. so ur probably right about most 16 yr olds.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Well I wouldn't call him stupid. I mean he's definetely stuborn and arrogant and so one, but those are not factors of stupidity, at least not directly anyway. They are more follish than stupid. 
<br />
He is actually quite intelligent, he's just very flustered on the idea that this is real. I've met more stupid people. One of them being the finger pointing bastard on the msn forums.
