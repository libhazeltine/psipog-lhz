			Please people, for the love of God read through this thread, the responses to these last couple posts have been stated multiple times.
<br />

<br />
A) A construct cannot do what you cannot, so it would give no skill bonus
<br />
B) Unless you wire it to take energy from yourself which is unrecommended (because you might not be able to stop it in time from draining you dry), a construct is a small and finite source of energy so it would expend itself much faster than you would trying to levitate yourself
<br />
C) Yes theoritically possible, effectively possible is questionable, it would take an extreme amount of skill and energy, which is something that takes DECADES of practice, and all for that you might be able to get yourself into the air for a couple seconds before you burned yourself out. Its really not worth it unless someone finds a way to make tk work more efficiently, theres a lot of other cool stuff that you could actually get to a lot faster and have some effectiveness.
<br />
D) Just no about the not believing in the laws of reality, I mirror Dan's comments.

In some post, or was it on the learning page, someone talked bout shelling a psi-ball so, that it pushes back the harder it is pushed. It needs PK. I believe its possible.
<br />

<br />
So...
<br />

<br />
As we know psi &quot;balls&quot; can be made of any shape, like a rectangle.
<br />
Now I would make a psi &quot;plate&quot; the size of medium table, shell and program it to push outwards, lay it on the floor and sit on it. Guess what happens?
<br />

<br />
Theoretically, using PK, you should be able to levitate. WHich is actually sitting on a psi plate Razz
<br />

<br />
Logical, no?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Why don't we make a psi wall and move the planet? Or we can make one and flare it so we can use that as a security wall. It'd take a lot less energy to make a security wall than it would to make someone levitate.
<br />

<br />
This is one of those things that sounds good on paper, but sucks in real life. Like communism... though I hate all forms of communism. Even those on paper

			I practiced a certain meditation for about a month. One that MartialArtist brings up in his lovely post about Self Levitation in the General section. I only got off the ground once and for only a few seconds. It's a waste of time. People keep chasing wants. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> I was once like that...

			Then if you want to talk about the belief thing, what about this. If you think about it, you say you believe you can fly, so then you can, but then lets think, howm any of us ACTUALLY believe. I mean really believe, its all well and good to say I believe I am immortal, but everything tells you no, people die, so you dont fully believe and die. Nobody every really fully believes because everyone is efraid of commiting to an idea that may or may not be wrong. If everyone could believe in somthing, anything, wether it was true or not, that would be cool. You know, just once I would like to see some sincere beliefs.

Anyway, thinking about something more do-able relating to levitation, push off of psi balls inbetween you to help you balance on a beam or wire. Maybe tight rope walkers do that  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

1) No religion please. At all. Ever until we allow religion.
<br />

<br />
Like you said... mostly... not always. Some things are just plain impossible. Experiment all you want... I'm sure people have been trying to fly for a long time now. I know lots of radki teenagers have been trying for at least a few years now.
<br />

<br />
If you really believe that everything is possible do you believe that everything is not possible too? If everything is possible then you have to accept the fact that it's possible that not everything is possible. If that's true then not everything is possible which makes &quot;Everything is possible&quot; useless. Not everything is possible... yep. That's about right. Not everything is possible.

			I think levitation utilizes a rather different mindset that is quite not the same as the one you use to perform tk. However it's not a simple feat because it's all about perseverance and determination. It's no wonder many will have to spend so much time beavering away at it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

hmmmm i wouldnt give up too easily. innerfire seems to be too pushy for me. ya that's nice to have your own opinions but it seems that he's sort of limiting himself because he thinks he's logical when he says you can't fly. yes it's probably really hard using tk, but that's just the surface. be a little more creative and look deeper into the skill. there's more than just tking and pking and whatever.

Its one of easiest ways to hurt yourself with psionics. And yes, if you're trying to do it when you're nowhere near experienced enough you can get hurt, a human being is a 80-220 pound object, its like going to the gym for the first time and desparately trying to lift the heaviest weight there, you're asking to be injured. It takes YEARS to gain the necessary experience to even think about attempting this, and since you guys don't have the initiative to even read this thread (which I can tell since the answers on this page along have been said 4-5 times already), I really doubt that any of you guys should get the benifit of the doubt that you're going to do this the right way.

			I understand completely. there are definite risks but that's not necessarily what i meant when i called you pushy. you were being protective and i appreciate it. i didnt mean it in a bad way. it just seemed like you were being a little closed minded because it seems that you only think there's one way to levitate. thinking that way isnt a bad thing and im not judgemental or anything. 
<br />
you're right when you say its dangerous, but when you use tk to levitate. it could be dangerous using other methods, i dont know. but i'm just saying it helps to sort of look outside of the box. 
<br />
i didnt mean that in a disrespectful kind of way.

			Technically there is no way other than tk (except maybe teleportation but thats even harder to do so that's not moving up) to levitate as any lifting of objects with your mind is defined as tk. Now you might be able to find a different technique that's more efficient which is what I think you have been trying to say, but that's no walk in the park either, if it was easy to find such a variation someone would have done it already <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> I really do wish you luck as long as you go about it safely, I'm just a very cynical person.
