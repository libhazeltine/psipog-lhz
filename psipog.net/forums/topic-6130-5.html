			The fact that Hiro was in that picture was because he went back in time right? And yeah I would think since he can travel to any point in time, even if he spent days in another time he could always choose to go to the point that he left that time... or 5 seconds after anyway. Although, even though I know nothing about traveling through time <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> if he did go back and change the fact that she is dead, he is now in a different timeline isn't he? One where she is alive, so his friend isn't waiting around for him to come back. So if Hiro actually did want to &quot;change&quot; time, he would have to go to another timeline and keep her alive, but then stay in that timeline, because if he traveled back to the same one he left nothing would have changed right? Anyways I hope at least someone can understand my ramblings on speculations of changing history... sorry bout that.

I think it could be Mohinder's sister... maybe the visions... therein lies her &quot;special&quot;ness. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

And for how much suspense they are building up for the next episode it better be <span style="font-style: italic">dizzamn</span> good.

arg!  your stuck on one theory of time travel wich is the one were some people believe that you cant acualy go back in time and change anything rather you go back and change something that is already supposed to happen in another dimention... in a nut shell lol
<br />

<br />
i believe that time doesnt realy excist. the closest we might ever get to traveling back into time is seeing what happened but we can never ever interact because it already happened and time doesnt excist. time is human made. just like money its only backed up by trust. if you dont trust in time and stop disregarding it than it being midnight wouldnt be any diffrent from it being 4 in the afternoon you know what i mean?

			Uhh...grats on not believing in time and time travel but in the context of the show <span style="font-weight: bold">it's already happened!</span>  So ssssshhhh.  I agree with Aleph though that since Hiro can jump to any point in time, he would technically never have to leave his timeline.  So the whole disappearing from the &quot;present&quot; and not coming back thing is a bit weird since he could just jump out, spend as much time as he likes in the past, then jump back to the time he left.  Best guess: it's his first time going back in time so he's a little fuzzy on the details still and will probably just teleport back into the show at a slightly later time by accident.

I was freakin' out about Peter, 'cuz I thought Claire was outta there... but then she ran up to him and I was all &quot;YAY!&quot;

on a side note: has anyone ever watched &quot;The 4400&quot; that weird chick that hangs out with the old guy does the same. Its kind of a bad ass skill if you realy think about. Imagine having a couple minutes on national television while possesing that power.
<br />

<br />
what i dont get is this &quot;power&quot; that the waitress has. erm... photographic memory? lol not much of a zinger if you ask me. i bet further on in the series she'll be the bookworm with all the facts on the whatever things they have to do (i know lol, very vague)
<br />
wait though... while i'm on the subject... if Hiro went back to save her why does everyone still think she's dead? People were still sobbing at the dinner. Also why did he go back so far into the past? 6 months? hmm....
<br />

<br />
Is it just me or do they add a couple new &quot;skilled&quot; individuals every other episode? hehe. Its not too cool if the heroes arnt unique :[

			I think the murder still happened but not in the diner, as it wouldn't be serving customers if it had been in there, but I don't think Hiro prevented her death 'cause he 'disappeared out of her life 2 weeks ago'. My theory is that he teleported back to Japan, 'cause in the previews he was on the roof doing the aerobics like he was when he WAS in Japan.

...Are you new to this show?
<br />

<br />
I think you're referring to Sylar, Claire, and Peter.  There have already been theories about Sylar being Peter from the future, but I don't think that's true.  There was part of a recorded conversation with Sylar and Mohinder's father, where Sylar said that HE woke up his power (in some form).
<br />

<br />
Also, remember that Sylar thought that Jackie was the cheerleader he was supposed to kill (the same reason Peter thought she was the one he was supposed to save, at least momentarily), when he read the article praising her for Claire's actions.
<br />

<br />
If Sylar was Peter, he would have remembered Claire, I'm sure of it.
<br />

<br />
He would also have been trying as hard as possible NOT to attack Peter, out of some fear that he might negate his own existence.

			I thought of another theory for Hiro's time travel... Harry Potter! (I know, lol... but it makes sense!) In that movie/book, (don't hurt me XD) they went back in time three hours or so to change some stuff. But instead of going back to where they left, what happened was they just basically waited it out til their other selves went back in time. So maybe for a short time there were two Hiro's, one travelling with Ando, the other with Charlie. Both in the same timeline. And probably, (like in the HP movie ... XD) the Hiro with Ando will go back in time again for some reason, but not-so-far-future Hiro will stay. Ando will probably find him soon. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
And I can't wait to see Sylar and his talk with Chandra, and what Eden (suggestion girl) and Mr. Bennet will do with him. I wish I had enough practice (and time to practice) to maybe slide a cup to my hand across the table... even a few centimeters. Even an empty one. That would be sweet.
