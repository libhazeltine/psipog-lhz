			I had heard that there is a method to do that. I am also curious as to how you do it. I would greatly appreciate anyone's method. I have only OBE'd three times and it's very hard to get out. That sounds like it would be a hell of a lot easier.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Well there is a method, I usually use it for my OBE's cause it's too hard to stay conscious in all the proces to achieve an OBE so what i make is to awake in dreams and break those dreams and start an OBE.
<br />
First of all you have to realize that you're in a dream and then you have to break it. Try to modify the dream, when you can for example create houses or mountains then you will be able to break the dream (close your eyes and imagine your bedroom, and say to yourself that you're in the astral plane in the reality world or something like that) you will appear in your bedroom and you can start your OBE travel easily.
<br />

<br />
PD: you can experience an OBE by this way but you will not be able to ensure if you have had a really OBE or not (try to go places near your home that you don't know and remember some things to prove that you've been really there) cause it can be a lucid dream if you haven't break the dream correctly     <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			As soon as you go Lucid, you are officially OBE, in my opinion. When you dream, and you become lucid, you're in the astal plane, within a &quot;projected environment&quot; meaning you're in the environment that your mind created for the purpose of your dream. Once lucid though, you can change that environment. You become aware that you are dreaming and that your body sleeps. 
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure what defines the difference between a projected environment and the environment that is naturally on the astral plane. From personal experience, I can say that when I am lucid and I go to a place that is there in the waking world (say, a playground near my house), it seems far more solid and is harder to alter certain aspects of it at will... Also, unexpected things can happen, such as people you didn't conjure yourself, etc. I would say such times are when I am within the free roaming environment of the astral plane, rather than my own personal, created area.
<br />

<br />
What I can say for sure though, is that Lucid Dreaming and Astral travel are nearly the same. I would define an OBE as an experience that you have where you travel the astral realm (like in a Lucid Dream) without first going to sleep, or at least the REM stage of sleep.
<br />

<br />
While lucid, I am as I am but so much more. I am free to do what I want, without the limitations of my physical body. And I am certain that I, and everything around me, is as real as the world I experience while I am awake. I am certain that were my physical body to be vaporized at that moment, I would still be wherever I am at the time, and simply unable to &quot;wake&quot; back into my physical body.... But that is just my opinion, really.
