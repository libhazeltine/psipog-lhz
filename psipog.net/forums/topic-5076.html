If there ever was such thing as a &quot;psisoldier&quot;, you'd either see it in a movie, or some crazy theories from your crazy friend that wraps tinfoil around his head thinking the aliens are trying to read his mind. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			Those were both real organizations from what I understand, I know very little, only half references made by old members. I don't think they'd want me to elaborate much more anyways...

Drop it guys, there's no point in trying to figure out about some online drama of the past.

Stick with Psi, that's what we're here for.

			PsiSoldier was an old psionic community, with a focus on combat.  The reason we don't talk about it is because ... it focused on combat.  Which is against the rules at PsiPog.
<br />

<br />
There really isn't anything else to say.  Some of you guys are making this into a little too big of a deal.  I know you love to sit around and dream about conspiracy secret organizations, and all those cool ideas, but it really wasn't that big of a deal.  It was just like any other small psionic community that you see in the Links and Advertisment section.
<br />

<br />
There was some drama in the past, but who cares?  There has been drama between PsiPog and other psionic sites in general in the past... Veritas, The Psion Guild, BioProductions, Etelekia, UYTA, Wingmakers, UPC sort of, various MSN groups, and recently MPW-13 hates us... it's really not that amazing that drama exists.  We've had multiple hackers, and a hacker &quot;organization&quot; take interest in us too.  It basically comes down to: who cares, and why is it any of your business?
<br />

<br />
The truth is it isn't any of your business.  I'm sorry that your life is so boring that you need to turn this into a soap opera.  Try getting some sun, and exercising.
