			It seems that no matter what I do, I can't quit asking myself: &quot;What the heck is Psi?!&quot; Now, it might not appear to be an &quot;important question&quot; and in some regards it can, infact, be insignificant. But, what if we where able to really discover what it was? Right now, we all have our theories. Some of us say that Psi is some type of particle that we can manipulate, some say it's a spiritual force, others a mere bioproduct of the nervous system and thought, it is sometimes thought as the interconnectedness amongst all things, or even acknowledged to be what ever you think it can be. 
<br />

<br />
We all believe in Psi, or the psychic aspect of our lives, in some way. However, some of us still only believe in certain aspects of things. For example, I may believe in Psychokinesis, but maybe not believe in the manipulation of an &quot;Energy&quot; that can be manipulated. Or, maybe you believe in telepathy but nothing else. Who knows what you believe in, and I'm not necessarily saying disbelieving any skill is a bad thing. What I'm trying to get at is that even though there seems to be some sort of consensus that Psi phenomena exists, there isn't really one on the extent to which it is acknowledged, even by us. 
<br />

<br />
I propose the following:
<br />
We create a unified effort to discover exactly why Psi is, we research the scope of the abilities that Psi phenomena holds, we discover the nature of Psi (How it works, how it moves, how it's created), and we try to create a 'universal' method of Psi control, if one can be created. 
<br />

<br />
What do you think?

			The problem with your proposal is that allot of people in this community are underage and dont have the time in there life to dedicate to PSI.

			Actually you're both right...most people in here are young (although not perfect, there was an age poll somewhere....), and even though we all have a certain degree of spare time, it would be hard to develop a &quot;unified effort&quot; because of several reasons.  One of them being people have lives and such outside of psionics and this site.  Another being it would be extremely difficult to get a uniform definition of 'psi' because we can't even objectively quantify it or consistently manipulate it.  
<br />

<br />
For example, two people could scan the same construct, and depending on their level of experience, each could rate it differently.  And unless someone out there has a psionometer, this would be the one of the only ways I can think of for trying to measure any amount of psi.
<br />

<br />
But really, I'm not trying to tear down any ideas or movements towards what you're suggesting SK; I would probably support it in any way I could if people really got a structured effort together.  I was just pointing out some obvious road blocks...

...Sad, but true.

I still have to finish alooot of school before I can even attempt anything. I'd be glad to help with this, though.

			I would love to be able to devote myself to psi, but again, life takes its tole on my free time. Most people here are underage. It would take alot to make such a thing real. Governement involvment would be a neccessity. Otherwise you get a bunch of wise-arses all day asking for proof. I wish it could be done, and would provide my support, but we would need a plan on how.
