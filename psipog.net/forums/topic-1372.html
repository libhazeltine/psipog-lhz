Okay, i've read up on your articles on speaking to your subconscious and i thought it would be fun to try. At times i'd clear my mind, but nothing would happen. For a few weeks nothing would happen, then as i was playing video games i'd get these wierd messages telling me what to do.I figured afterwards, my mind is only clear when i am playing video games.Sometimes i will try to force the thought to help me, and realize that i'm just trying to make myself do something that doesnt really need to be done. Other times i wont know if i am or am not, so i decided to keep a journal of events that happened while i play games. Here are 3
<br />

<br />
1: I was playing Socom: FireTeam Bravo for the PSP, and i got some sort of message,as if someone were yelling in a really big room but i could just barely hear them. &quot;They&quot; said turn around, but i figured i was trying to force my subconscious to say something, so i ignored it. 2 seconds later, my teammates and me were destroyed from behind
<br />

<br />
2: Resident Evil 4 - I was low on PTAS(currency in the game) and needed to go look for some, and i happened to pass by a cabinet. I got that same &quot;voice-in-big-room&quot; message, but decided to ignore it again, thinking i was just pretending to have something cool happen. I checked it later, and found 1,000 PTAS.
<br />

<br />
3: This time i actually listened. I was running down a hallway and i stopped in front of a ladder when i got a &quot;message&quot; saying &quot;step back, and look up&quot; and i saw a lamp. I figured &quot;it&quot; meant shoot it down, so when i did, i got a piece of Spinel, treasure i could sell at 5,000 PTAS later.
<br />

<br />
Could you try to help confirm if these are real or just coincidence?

			but he didnt mention telepathy, he said comunication with the subconcious. i dont think its a coincidence. one of the ways that i can explain it is your subconcious compares situations for ones in your long term memory and their outcome and then yell guidance to you.
<br />

<br />
thats my 2 cents.

			I think its possible. Often things like reading, daydreaming or even...video games, can put people into a light trance. Being in even a light trance, would make subconscious thoughts more accessible, even if only a little bit. So then you could be getting instinctual help from your subconscious.

Wheee trances!
<br />

<br />
Seriously, though, I would agree that your startling intuition is what we would term your &quot;subconcious&quot;.  Usually your subconcious recognizes patterns and subtleties that your primary awareness is programmed to ignore.  (I'm big into psychological programming... anyone have a good book on the topic they'd recommend?)  I suppose this is as good a place as any for the discussion, because empathy and telepathy can often rely on your subconcious in its weaker manifestations.
<br />

<br />
You can get all kinds of apparently outside thoughts from your own head.  My psipet seems to be autonomous and quite intelligent, but if I bother to sit and concentrate, it eventually begins to just look like an expansion of my own logic, so I'm guessing it's just an offshoot of subconcious thought I've deliberately cultivated and given a psi-form.  You could do the same and make yourself a little video game genie programmed into your controller...

Is it cheating to use precog and run around noscoping with a sniper?

			Well Keithd I dont see it as cheating I see it as using all the resources we have at hand, I mean is it cheating to use Micro-Psychokinesis to effect dice rolls when playing games like, oh say, DnD, RISK, and the likes? 
<br />

<br />
Heh, well onto the subject matter though...
<br />

<br />
That does sound like a subconscious jester, in my non-expert opinion. It was wierd that you mentioned RE4 though, I believe I had a few when I was observing my brother play the game, let me share them. Now then mine wasnt really hearing anything, but rather just knowing it, then again I do need to work on listening to my subconscious in a better form, since usually I get some like all of a sudden when writting I just get the sentences to flow to mind in a &quot;spark of genius&quot; I guess some would say, but the thing that makes it interesting is that my mind will use words I dont even know. I use them and use them correctly and dont even know what they mean untill after I look it up, odd no? But i'm sorry I trailed off let me explain,
<br />

<br />
Alrighty so im watching my brother play the game and when I was he was in the Castle at the time. Anyways hes going around and im sitting there clear minded on the couch. Every so often i'd just say &quot;look to the right&quot;. &quot;one is behind you&quot; and the likes like that. Each time I did I got it right and there was infact an enemy, and I did this about 8 or so times.
<br />

<br />
Now then im sure you'll all say that it was just from hearing the ramblings of the spainard enemies, but thats the thing they didnt make their battle cry. Most of the time it was before they did or he was in a room filled with them and many infront of him were saying it. There was no noise or visual sightings what-so-ever on them.
<br />

<br />
Although this is just my thoughts on it, im sure a more seasons subcon talker can give a more accurate second opinion.

			The subconscious is an amazing thing.  It has an eidetic memory (photographic memory).  It could very well relate your experiences to past experiences, find hidden algorithms, or even calculate what day of the week it will be on July 4, 2043.  It's a genius part of the mind that one must learn or maintain access to.  An interesting thing is that it can be fully accessed as a baby.  Some people maintain the ability to access the subconscious, while most people do not, and have to learn how to again to gain the ability.  That's not to say that accessing it cannot be learned.  I believe that anyone can learn to access their subconscious or even communicate with it without knowing.  For instance, when one is planning to jump somewhere, they can predict where they are going to land depending on how much force they put into their jump, but they do not subconsciously calculate it.  Also, when one wishes to ride a bike, they just know how, after being taught long ago.  They do not have to consciously think to remember what position they need to be in, and one does not need to consciously think to pedal the bike.  These are all examples of subconscious thought.
<br />

<br />
  Savants have greater access to their subconscious, and many can do incredible high speed calculations and memory feats without having to consciously think.  I've accessed my subconscious before, but I do not believe I?ve actually &quot;talked&quot; to it as if it was another person.  I can make it do calculations for me as long as I know the rules that apply to the calculation.  I have a friend that can multiply three digit numbers in his head using his subconscious.  The subconscious is probably used in many psionic abilities as well.
<br />

<br />
  IMHO, your experience was probably your subconscious telling you where something is based on a past experience.  It could have found an algorithm that the people who made the game subconsciously use to determine where to place items, or maybe it has calculated a high probability of the location of various in game items.  It is certainly possible that your subconscious is telling you where it knows an object is or anything for that matter using psionically gathered information.  
<br />

<br />
The mind is an incredibly complex tool.  Never doubt its power.
