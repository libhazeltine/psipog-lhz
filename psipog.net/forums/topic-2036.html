			ok, this is just an idea I had about a minute ago. What about TK in space? Not sure whether anyones posted this before but if you think about it it must be so much easier. There is no GRAVITY! And im pretty sure there's never been a telekinetic out in space before, well, not on a large scale before anyway.As for myself, i used to practice it, but after nout results i decided to move onto energy manipulation which is working much better. It's just a thought really.

			Sure I would, hell I'd go to space just to marvel in its beauty and experience what few have, but there is one major flaw here, space travel isnt widespread for the masses.
<br />

<br />
The closest thing we have to commercial &quot;space&quot; experiences is those extremely high altitude planes which go so high you experience weightlessness but you technically don't leave the atmosphere. These are ofcourse very expensive to ride in and the prototype was made if memory serves and not a produced line for wider use.
<br />

<br />
Psychokinesis is space is no doubt easier with less, well no, resistance from gravity, friction, those likes. Though there is really no way to levitate something in space, it would be all pushing.
<br />

<br />
In short, nice idea if space travel ever became more commercial and available for John Q. Public, but right now it's not, it's for the extreme wealthy (and excentric) and astronaughts/cosmonaughts.

too much of a burden just to do PK in space, plus, if I wanted to, I could try and move a space shuttle or something out of orbit.

			Good thought really.It is possible only theoritacally.But when thinking practically,can you imagine if anyone would go into space for testing PK ?PK is becoming known to people day by day.Only after the world realizes PK,anyone would go into space for trying PK and that would take a long time.Anyway,good idea and keep thinking for more. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I probably wouldn't go into space either but i would really want to see a video of it. And moving a shuttle like that too sounds incredible to watch! You could maybe chuck it around a bit. Iv'e also heard of those planes that you can experience low gravity in because one of my friends said he went in one, or maybe someone he knew did...i'm not sure but yeah.

			Hay,even if you watch a vedeo,how can you sau it is real ?you know as there is no gravitation,objects can fly around for ever without stopping and no object can be fully stopped there.So,how can we say if the vedeo is real ?

			If you tried to move objects in space, it'd clear the mind block about levitating things and how it'd require force, as there's no resistance to movement within space.
<br />

<br />
Say, if you wanted to 'push' an object in space, though, it'd have to be in absolute standstill (which is pretty hard to maintain in space, as you should probably know), then to psi it around.
<br />

<br />
But it would help against the percieved 'impossibility' of moving things along the Y plane (vertically), rather than just X and Z (horizontally).
<br />

<br />
Although, it might make it harder when you get back to Earth, being that it's easier to move things without any friction whatsoever.
<br />

<br />
Just my 2 cents.
