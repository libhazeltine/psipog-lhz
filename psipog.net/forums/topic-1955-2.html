			Maybe you should get one of those Shaving Blades... You know, it's not a razor... You know what I'm talking about. Use it for a while until it becomes dull, repeat... Might take longer, but it'd be more reliable. Those russian guys didn't have those disposables anyway.

			&quot;This was on mythbusters and they said it was busted. 
<br />
so unless it is done with unintentional psi, 
<br />
or you just dont trust mythbusters and beleive that they are a part of a big conspiracy ring trying to supress us through entertainment and science&quot;
<br />

<br />
uh... yeah that's what the problem with blindly believing everything mythbusters says is. listen Mythbusters is reliable and all, but don't just accept their experiments as undeniable proof, it's still possible that for whatever reason the pyramid must be perfectly designed, maybe it takes energy from the sunlight, with a perfect pyramid the light would travel exactly evenly around all sides.
<br />

<br />
Balance is the key to power.

			Well, from my visual inspection, the fruit looks to have dehydrated at the same rate.  I checked it about once a day.  I want to retry the razor experiment with better razors, and dulling them only slightly.  As a side note, one day I checked it and the fruit had fallen off the platform (because the dehydration made it shrink, and become unbalanced), and I'm unsure how long it was off the platform for.  Perhaps that had an effect, I don't know.

			To Peebrain: I have some questions about your experiment. 
<br />
Where is the opening on the pyramid? 
<br />
Is it perfectly designed? 
<br />
Do you have a &quot;lid&quot; or &quot;door&quot; to close up your opening? 
<br />
What materials other than cardboard did you use?

			The opening of the pyramid is on the bottom.  It's like a hat <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  &quot;Perfectly&quot; designed?  I used trigonometry and my ruler to do the best I could.  I used cardboard and tape.

			I cannot imagine at all how any of that would work. 
<br />

<br />
So pyramids magically make things better, newer? Decay slower? Reverse a problem?
<br />

<br />
There is no logical mechanism that any of that would work, insofar as a pyramid channeling magical energy or the divine will of the Egyptian gods.

			Wow Peebrain, I am impressed, looks very good. But you read what I said earlier right? I was saying maybe there are certain factors that must be accomplished other than it just being a pyramid. Maybe it has to be made out of limestone, or maybe it has to be in the sun...etc. You know what I am saying. I think it is just to hard to experiment.

			I have a book by Albert Veynik(If I'll try to translate the name of the book it will be something like &quot;Thermodynamics of real processes &quot;).
<br />
I dont think you'll get many results in a search, unless you are searching in russian.
<br />
(In russian by the way, Author:&quot;&#1040;&#1083;&#1100;&#1073;&#1077;&#1088;&#1090; &#1042;&#1077;&#1081;&#1085;&#1080;&#1082;&quot; Book:&quot;&#1058;&#1077;&#1088;&#1084;&#1086;&#1076;&#1080;&#1085;&#1072;&#1084;&#1080;&#1082;&#1072; &#1088;&#1077;&#1072;&#1083;&#1100;&#1085;&#1099;&#1093; &#1087;&#1088;&#1086;&#1094;&#1077;&#1089;&#1089;&#1086;&#1074;&quot;)
<br />

<br />
Anyway, he talks about pyramids there and he says that pyramids are energy accumulators.
<br />
And if taking into consideration that psi cannot be explained without some form of force or energy, than its very possible that a pyramid would be a psi amplifier.
<br />

<br />
The pyramid proportions I have here are: (Base : haight : side) - 1.0 : 0.63 : 0.95.
<br />
Which in you case is 10.9 : 6.867 : 10.355
<br />
He doesnt says about accuracy he just says &quot;the proportions are about 1 : ...&quot;
<br />
And he does mention the sharpening effect, aside form the fruits.
<br />

<br />
Interesting thought: what if you use a pyramid-proportioned psiwheel I mean instead making the normal one make a pyramid and put it on the pin?!
<br />
 I think I'll try that because I still dont have succes with the normal one <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> .

			so whats the progress on this experiment. What happened to the razors?
<br />

<br />
The point isnt to explain this logically. The point is to see if it works. When it works, then if it can be explained thats when you try to explain it.

			The razor didn't do anything, as far as I can tell.  The fruit also rotted at the same rate as the control fruit.  Right now I'm waiting to buy some different razors to try it on.  I want to dull them only slightly.  Any ideas on how to test for sharpness?

			well tons.. you could use wood, a peice of paper. The best way would be something delecate that you know a razor would be easy to cut through. Also you could shave with it? Brand new razors should beable to cut facial/any hair with out much tension.

			Yeah, but him measuring the 'sharpness' of anything is nearly impossible, as it's quantitative (I think?) meaning that you can't assign a number to how sharp it is.
<br />

<br />
That's the only problem I see with this experiment.

			ya i know, but what you do is take the brand new razor, cut a line through a peice of paper, and lable that &quot;before&quot; then do the experiment. Once the experiement is done, you take the same razor, cut another piece of the same type of paper. What you would be looking for is how clean the cut is. The cleaner, the shaper. And vice versa.
