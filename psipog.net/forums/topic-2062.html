			Ok. First of all I am quite speechless at this website i have found, not only because he is able to fake pk vids but he is also really bumming the phsychic comunity down with it. And don't get me wrong, people who look at this will become skeptics really easily and i must say it squandered me at first! Although he must have a noodle in his head to know about it but... well go to this link and you will see what it's about&#058;  <a href="http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/Psi%20wheel%20video.html" target="_blank">http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/Psi%20wheel%20video.html</a> 
<br />

<br />
And read it all too. In contrast to this annoying site it has also given me the idea of actually testing this myself. Anyways, any comments about these vids would be good so we can bi*tch about it.

			Yeah but my hands are never as hot as just boiled water 100Celcius sure,
<br />
Ive seen these before he just shows TK videos can be fakes so? 
<br />
We learned nothing new...
<br />

<br />
What if you can move it without your hands less than an inch away?
<br />
Is it then still body heat? I dont think so.
<br />

<br />
Havent seen him demonstrating TK is fake just that videos can be faked.
<br />
So he wants to show people its fake let him do that if he wants, I dont care, I know it is real

			I have run across this site too.  He is a skeptic and skeptics try to discover things that are fake.  He has done actually a great job because he proved that heat can be a big factor in moving a psiwheel.  I applaud him for attempting and completeing a proof on heat effecting the psiwheel.

			He does not explain how the wheel is moved under glass containers, or any container. He does not explain how the psi wheel moves with one hand. He does not account for the moving of pens/pencils, and more recently a stapler. While he has a nice evidence that the psiwheel can be manipulated without psychic means; We indeed already knew that.

			its apparent that skepics will pick apart things that you say and make you look stupid rather than actually argueing the point. The keith guy totally threw the arguement from &quot;how can you move a psiwheel under a glass container with heat currents from the body?&quot; to.. &quot;i know more about the temperature of the human body than you do.&quot; Awsome way to be a skeptic.. oh wait, lets take two weeks out of our dull, 9-5 life for mabye 20 minutes a day and give it a real try. I bet i know who will feel the most stupid...

			Ehh,. I guess I can agree that there are the unexplainables and that there are many skeptics that you will never ever change their minds. No matter how many conversations I get into or fight (over Tk) I can never prove them wrong since there is little evidence unless I can move a car... then they would be satisfied. I still think it isn't fair to call them stupid though. Where were you before this (though you may have been lucky and born into a psychic family) but if you stumbled upon these teachings then you were no better, no worse. 
<br />

<br />
So what am I saying? I'm saying don't try to bother people that don't care. Your just trying to convert them or make them believe something they don't want anything to do with. (the common reasoning they can just walk over and pick it up O.o..) But yea leave them alone..
<br />

<br />
As of how this pertains to the topic .. lol you decide.

			Rahmid, good.. lol but still it's mostly determined on how much they respect you. If they are friends with you and care for you then they should be like, I respect what you beleive but theres nothing you can say that will change my mind but good for you for practicing. Hopefully they would say that.
<br />

<br />
Apollo, well then they may think your a magician or a wannabe so to speak. I have no idea how magicains do their tricks (besides buying them) so they do create a great illusion which they may beleive you are doing. By the think that fasinates me the most is how people believe magicains over real psychics. I think it is because they are so dramatic in their preformance and when an accual psychic does it they have a blank focused stare which isn't very dramatic or fun to watch... or believeable.

<br />
Your hands don't need to be that hot to produce the effect, as you can see in the video. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;ve seen these before he just shows TK videos can be fakes so? 
<br />
We learned nothing new...&quot;
<br />

<br />
So? It means whenever you think you are moving a psiwheel with your mind, you are just deluding yourself. 
<br />

<br />
You may not have the intent of trickery, especially when making a video, but the point is that the effect is purely natural, not paranormal. It just appears paranormal to you. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;e does not explain how the wheel is moved under glass containers, or any container.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The same mechanism is at work - heat is transferred from your hands through the glass and causes the warming of air currents which in turn causes the wheel to spin. Indeed it may be easier to produce the effect under glass than not as the warm air is trapped underneath the container. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;does not account for the moving of pens/pencils, and more recently a stapler.&quot;
<br />

<br />
You can fake pencils with string, or by merely blowing on them. A stapler as well can be string, magnets, or other camera tricks. Its easy and I could make such a video now if I wanted in under 5 minutes. 
<br />

<br />
Sorry kids, I've pretty much said it before and I'll say it now even more clearly - moving a psiwheel has nothing to do with psionics unless it is levitating in the air on it's own. Do not delude yourself. 
<br />

<br />
There is a reason skeptics will laugh and make fun of you when you claim debunked phenomena is real. &quot;But I still KNOW I was moving it with my mind, I felt it and I know it!&quot; No you don't, that's exactly the kind of illogic that causes you to lose all credibility.

			Why are you here?  What is natural?  What everyone can do?  then all of psionics is natural.  We are aware that everything can be faked but we make the videos to help others and to show our progress.  Everyone here who has tried telekinesis, knows it is real.  you keep saying &quot;Do not delude yourself&quot; when you are the one deluding <span style="font-style: italic">yourself</span>.  &quot;There is a reason skeptics will laugh and make fun of you when you claim debunked phenomena is real&quot;  Is this statement true for all paranormal phenomena?  There have been experiments in all different research centers on different phenomena (telepathy, telekinesis, remote viewing, etc.) and they have gotten results that do suggest that it is real.  Want to know my sources?  Well, there is <a href="http://www.lfr.org/LFR/csl/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Cognitive Sciences Laboratory</a>, there is <a href="http://www.rhine.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Rhine Research Center</a>, and many others.  Skeptics do not believe us because their culture (our culture) is sci-fi movies, video games, jokes about it, and parents telling us how fake psychics are.  When we tell them that we can do something paranormal, they automatically &quot;know&quot; it is fake.  Then they either verbally attack us, lower our moral (ie what you are doing to newbies here), or nicely have a discussion with us (which, sadly, not many people do).
<br />

<br />
If i make a video of moving a psiwheel in 98 degree weather under a glass bowl (after the temperature in there is equal to 98 degrees), and it shows my whole body <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> the news so you know that it is indeed 98 degrees, will you be satisfied?  Of course not.  Because it is against your culture.  I respect you, but not as much as if you kindly stated what you believe.  Please, next time you post be nicer about your views.
