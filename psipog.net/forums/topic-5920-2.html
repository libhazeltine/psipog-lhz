			hmmm.. it seems to me that he should care very much- there's something about having someone you know and love, such as a family member, think you're crazy. He probably just is skeptical because he likes to believe that the world is completely normal and it is the way he's always believed it is and now that you have kind of started to prove differently, he can't accept it.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			perhaps you should try a different angle. say to him that you want to experement with what is possible with the human mind. tell him you'd like for him to be supportive. if you show how much you care about psionics (if indeed, you care about it. i don't know.)
<br />

<br />
try printing off that letter to parents on the main psipog website. maybe that'd help.
<br />

face it. you won't get him to believe in a heartbeat. stuff like this takes time.

			Well, i'd think, (If youre really good at TK), put a psi wheel under a cup, then tell HIM to tell YOU the way to turn it. Then he can hardly say &quot;The wind goes in both directions&quot; (&lt;witch, imo, is childish. He should know better). 
<br />

<br />
If he even then is still a skeptic try the telepathic things <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

From that point on I <span style="text-decoration: underline">never</span> talked about anything psi related in real life again.

I'm not saying that it's a bad thing to try to prove psi but if he really doesn't want to believe then maybe it's for the better to just let him be.

I got observed for a couple of days, it wasn't bad (like in a hospital) but it was boring as hell.
