			Now I always was and probably always will be a skeptic, but I can beleive things that I have experienced. Allthough that doesent meen I wont believe in things like psi (personaly I do believe in bio-energy that I dont have a name for). 
<br />

<br />
The brief and abrupt change in my mental state for the thought of having a telepathic ability was very interesting and a relief. But what about &quot;psi&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Psi-balls/shields sound &quot;insane&quot;. I have experienced bizar things when     &quot;experimenting&quot; with this &quot;so called&quot; ability. Though I did say I believe in bio-energy and I did say I CAN believe things I have experienced. I have experienced the existence of bio-energy.
<br />

<br />
I guess I am just a skeptic. I believe anyone can do anything but video/audio and pictures can be edited. people lie (alot).
<br />

<br />
Bottom line I dont go by some article on the internet and a book I found in my sisters house. I would like some feedback. Oh and P.S. sorry for wasting space on this topic forum thing <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" /> .     -Aims_

			Oh no problem, you're one of the good skeptics out there, you get a pat on the back for that.
<br />
Question, do you want to believe in psi?

			I don't understand what you are trying to say.
<br />

<br />
You are skeptic, but you have experienced things related to &quot;Bio-Energy&quot;, so you believe that it exists... But it sounds insane?
<br />

<br />
Yeah, it does, doesn't it? However, a lot of things kind of sound insane to me. The fact that we can build cars the size a grain of rice with nano-technology, or blow up missles with laser beams. Implanting devices into the human body to regulate its functions... All of these things sound quite &quot;insane&quot; to me. But, I suppose that doesn't justify human bio-energy, does it? <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

The more you experience Psi, the less doubt you will have about it. If you want to see for real, practice.

			An I in the skeptics forum, or is this in the wrong place? Sorry, didn't mean to be rude. I can understand that you're new. I thought it sounded insane the first time too. It's just natural, only because, (for most people) it goes against everything they have ever learnt in life. Sheepking is right, if you want results and want to see if it real, then practice. I get really annoyed when people at my school ask me to do stuff, like make a psi ball or move a pen right in the middle of a friggin corridoor. I just tell them to practice and see it for themselves, lazy bastards. Didn't mean that towards you Aims_ btw.
<br />

<br />
But really, there can't be thousands of book and sites on the net about something that no one has ever proved for themself, or experienced. e.g. I wouldn't start a site about what going to war feels like if I had never done it.  eeerrr....I'm just rambling now.

			Your attitude seems healthy, Aims_. Don't let go of healthy scepticism, but you gotta try both sides before you judge. Most likely, you'll see more than just interesting results before long if you just give it a honest try. And remember, keep it funny.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Lol. Actually, the more I think about it, the more 'insane' it sounds. &quot;I can make an invisible shield around myself to (for example) block out other peoples thoughts and keep my own inside.&quot; Lol.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
&quot;I can make invisible miniature-pyramids.&quot; Rofl.
<br />

<br />
Oh well. Let's just face it. Most people would label me as insane if they knew what I'm doing in my spare time. Strangely, that doesn't make me feel like a secret superhero. At all. It's like a hobby, just not quite.
<br />

<br />
Sorry, it's late in the night here in Norway.. I'll stop rambling.
