			Well I'm bakc again. I've been hanging around the boards here and reading up, not to mention practicing when I can and so far the results are good.
<br />

<br />
A few interesting items however...
<br />

<br />
After my first post I headed off to bed and got some shuteye and the next morning I woke up with a pretty nasty headache. I've come to call this my PK Hangover. I don't know if there is such a thing but I think I overdid it on my first outing and paid the price. I tried again later that night and had no success at all (not even a wiggle), which had me doubting myself.
<br />

<br />
The next evening (I practice mostly at night for privacy) I went back to the wheel and wasn't having much luck. Took a little more focus, but when I hit the zone it was butter. 
<br />

<br />
I also re-made my Psi wheel, this time out of tinfoil as I found I was having a harder time with paper. The tinfoil wheel really showed results quickly, and I was afraid that the whole time it was the air from my PC's fan reflecting up the wall and under the monitor (I was sitting in front of my PC at the time). Armed with this possibility I moved out to the dining room of my apartment and set to again. I made sure there were no drafts and I wasn't breathing on the wheel (even covered my mouth, held my beathe, breathed out the side of my mouth - which makes it had to focus BTW) and the wheel went back to spinning. It stopped when I asked and went back the other way easily, though I have to be careful because I tend to lose my focus occasionally and I find the wheel gets a little ornery at that point and doesn't listen to well *L* .
<br />

<br />
Anyway after all that I headed to bed and found I couldn't sleep. All I could think about was how I was managing to move something with my mind. It still blows my mind now. Anyway, I was lying in bed and wanted to do more so I thought about Psi balls. I hadn't really sat down and tried one yet, successfully anyway, so I figured I may as well try since I'm in a good frame of mind.
<br />

<br />
I sat to trying to gather energy in my abdomen as described several places on the site but wasn't having any luck. I was too easily distracted by other feelings in my stomache (was a little hungry at that point being up late and all) so I decided to pool it between my hands. At first I had a really hard time keeping my visualization of a little white ball of energy, but after focusing long enough, I didn't even need it. I felt my hands being pushed apart just a little with some very gentle pressure. That really got me. So I decided to push back. Sure enough, there was resistance. Not enough to keep me from pushing my hands together, but almost enough to hold my hands apart (I was laying on my back with my elbows against the matter and hands up in the air). I was pretty impressed. I also felt just a tiny little sensation in my left hands - almost like pins and needles, but much softer - not sure if this was related or not. I also seemed to get a little circular afterimage if I stared between my hands (I could only see the wall, no other light) and then looked away - but again, I don't know that it's related since I didn't actually flare the Psi ball despite an attempt).
<br />
Eventually I decided to see just how much pressure it would take and began pushing my hands together. It didn't take a lot of effort, but there was resistance when I finally squashed my Psi ball - or at least that I what I think it was anyway.
<br />

<br />
Overall I'm totally hooked. It's almost like an addiction now. Actually I have a little paper Psi spinner on thumbtack here on my desk at work that I play with. The problem, until recently, is that there's a vent over my desk - but I've overcome that and now play games where I try to spin the wheel the opposite way the fan is. Lots of fun and unless the fan goes into high and makes the Psi wheel go crazy I can usually push back to get it turning the other way, or at least stop it form moving. Good exercise I think.
<br />
I've also tried rolling a pen on my desk but since I don't have long to focus here at work, I probably won't have much luck for a while yet, but I look forward to when I do.
<br />

<br />
Ugh, long post but I think it may be helpful in conjunction with my other 'Starting out' post for other folks that are new to TK like myself as well.
<br />

<br />
Oh but one question - has anyone had any luck lighting a candle or similar object? Just curious <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Those are good psiball signs.  Especially the pins and needle feeling.
