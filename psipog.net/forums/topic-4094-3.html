			You got a lucid dream on one try? Good job. If you want to astral project (OOBE) the lucid crossroads has that capability, its supposed to be easy from a lucid dream. I think they have a mirror and a pool of water for that specific purpose. Question though, what do you mean by &quot;double dreaming&quot;?

Hey man, scientists didnt think blackholes existed until a picture was taken of one, afterall, were talking on a forum about using your mind to move inanimate objects, some people would say thats impossible, but we know its not, the impossible is not as impossible as it may seem, but yes, that was a rather silly idea  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I guess you would call it dream walking.  I read the article shortly after posting that to figure out how to do it.
<br />

<br />
The easiest way to dreamwalk, is to use a combination of the WILD method, along with the ROPE method of OBEing.  instead of pulling yourself out of your body though, start focusing on hypnagogic imagery, and after becoming sort of lost in the images, pull yourself into them. You should project yourself into a lucid dream. That's how I got it on my first try.  since OBEs are sort of deliberate, yet they are so similar to LDs, why can't you branch one into another.  This is THE way to do it. and yes, you can dreamwalk from a Lucid Dream. I think Rainsong has an article on it.

A Make a dream guitar properly

B Make it so it worked
<br />
C Be able to play it.

I've been unable to do tons of things that I can easily do in dreams, and the stuff hardly ever works correctly. Lights turn half on or not at all, keyboards don't type or type the wrong letters, monitors are extremely dim, that sort of thing.

Im not done readin all the posts yet... but the answer to this is they will apear in your dream... they might at that point realise they are dreaming... or still be unaware as if they were in a dream that made a drastic and random turn (into your dream) at that point you go to  them and calmy explain to them that they are dreaing and voala they are lucid.

Not likely. I've had dreams where I've actually died before, and a dream where I hit the ground from a mile high. It hurt (no, you don't always wake before you land). My body was fine.

The reason I would be skeptical is because you can create copies of your friends that aren't really them. The only way I've heard of to get people out of shared dreams is to go find them, not to drag them, but I may be wrong. Next time you do that, try and each make a password and give it to the other. 
<br />

<br />
Let me know what happens, I'm interested in the result.

This is an awesome web stie, and I encourage anyone interested in lucid dreaming to visit it, especially if you are at all interested in shared dreaming. The Lucid Crossroads can help you stay lucid, increase your lucidity, and take full advantage of your lucid dreams, as well as serve as a meeting place for shared dreams. There are features like multiple dream doors, a mirror and pool for astral projection, and a dojo to practice martial arts. It's a great resource for all lucid dreamers! Sorry if this sounds like an ad, but lucid dreaming is what I've been focusing on lately, and I wanted to get the word out about this site before the forums shut down.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
