			I just want to say thanks to everybody for sharing their experiences, because I was inspired to go give it a shot today and it was really great.
<br />

<br />
I left the house at like 2:45 to go walk around outside, and sat down to try it in a quiet spot. I closed my eyes and basically struggled to get thoughts and T.V. images out of my head for most of it.
<br />

<br />
But it was really cool. When I was able to banish a distraction it would rocket forward out of my mind's eye. I never really left my body, but it was my first try, so I figure with practice I can really benefit fromt his exercise.
<br />

<br />
When I woke up/swam out of my trance/meditation thing; there was a five inch lizard sitting on my leg staring at me! It was so cool, he crawled on and got comfy without me noticing!
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I had no idea how I long I had managed to go for, but when I got back it had been more than an hour, with almost no effort! 
<br />

<br />
I shouldn't sit cross-legged though, it hurts my knees.
<br />

<br />
Sorry for the novel, I'm just a bit excited about a new exercise.

You may blink, dont be too hard on yourself, just be strict. It should go in this order: 
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">You meditate properly&gt;&gt;&gt;automatically you dont need to blink.</span>
<br />

<br />
It should <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> go in this order: 
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">You try not to blink&gt;&gt;&gt; because you want to meditate properly.</span>
<br />

<br />

<br />
So dont force yourself not to blink, instead, relax and enter motionless meditation. There will be a time in which you suddenly notice: &quot;Hey...I have not been blinking for the past 15 minutes!&quot; - Then you were in real meditation. So all the aspects of motionless meditation come automatically once you enter real meditation. So dont focus too much on the aspects of not blinking, just sit still and dont move, observe the mind for its needs and wants to move, and tell it to stay still. 
<br />

<br />
When you feel a need to move, just ask your mind kindly: 
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">&quot;What do you think to accomplisch with this movement? Do you think it will make you more complete? Do you think it will make you happier or that it will satisfy a certain need? Really.. dear mind, do you think it is better to be over there, or to be in that posture than it is to sit here like this? It all doesn't make a difference, you will only feel true satisfaction, endless satisfaction, when you manage not to wish for something beside th?t.. what you already got. So dear mind:p, Dont long for anything besides the current situation in the here and now, and you will experience a wholeness that goes beyond the satisfaction of whatever movement you can think of.&quot;</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
It isn't actually a quote, but it looks more structured like this <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> .
<br />
You can have conversations like the above mentioned when you are observing your mind in meditation. This is called contemplation. It is very effective if you want to experience enlightenening realisations about yourself and your mind. It will deliver liberating experiences.

			Think about it. When you are really absorbed into something, like a movie or whatever, you might blink, but not notice it. I think it's the same for this. You get so absorbed that you forget about not blinking and just don't realize you've been blinking.
<br />

I also forgot about this. <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" />  I'll get back to it, though.

Meditation leads to know yourself, or whateva, but here are so levels with many explanations, to check in what level you reached! Thats so not true.Its far from meditation with such directions and explanations about levels and so much information with can make your brain work...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />  
<br />

<br />
Its good because it can atract different ppl who like such style of information, but to other maybe it doesnt look nice all information...

			I hope I don't get flamed for bumping this, it being about a month old.  But what I have to say is relevent to this type of meditation.  Besides, as said earlier, it seems quite good.
<br />

<br />
Anywho, I decided to give this a go, not really thinking that I would do very well with it.  Surprising myself, I actually did go half an hour and it felt like less than 5 minutes!  Save for a few jaw twitches, it was nice and easy to get into.
<br />

<br />
I would have gone for longer (I had planned an hour), but the phone rang and I went to go answer it.  I had barely remembered that I wasn't supposed to move when I was already sitting up *slaps forehead*.  Anyway, this is a bit of a problem I've encountered in other meditations.  I'll do a guided meditation once, and slip so far into it that I somewhat lose awareness - of EVERYTHING.  Then I sort of snap myself out of it suddenly, heart racing.  I'll try it a second time, determined to stay aware, but then my heart stays fast and I can't calm down enough to relax.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I don't know if some of those times I slip right down almost into delta or what, but it's rather frustrating.  It's like I'm aware (I'm not asleep), but I only realise I'm aware once I'm not in that state of mind any more.  Is this how it's supposed to be?  Any tips would be warmly welcomed.

			Say hi to meditation <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
There are many forms of meditation, and the one you are slipping into is one of the deeper states. It may even be Delta yes, though Delta is not easy to get into but perhaps it goes naturally for you. It sounds like a beginning form of Samadhi, in which you do not realise where or what you are or what your are doing, but you just <span style="font-style: italic">are</span>... If half an hour feels like 5 minutes, then you have been in real meditation and you surpassed the stage of concentration which means forcing the mind to focus...trhen it runs again, and then you bring it back on the object or subject of your focus. When this is practiced firmly, the flow of cognition becomes steady and concentration comes easily and automatically...then we are really meditating. Then if we practice meditation alot, we might experience Samadhi, which is a state in which there is no distinction between the meditator and the meditated upon. And because there is no longer an subject/object seperation, there is no proces of meditation either. Time and space become totally irrelevant, the mind transcends bodily consciousness and your consciousness becomes what it focusses on. 
<br />

<br />
If this is too far fetched for you, just view it as a deeper kind of meditation that you are doing. But it is not bad I assure you. Though try next time, to remain in that deep state, and still be fully conscious. As you said you are aware, but only knew it once you gotten out of that state. Try to become conscious without thinking, while in that state. Then you can surf through your own consicousness as if you are swimming in an endless pool.

			Sorry this sounds a little off subject even though it is about motionless meditation. And it is vulgar as well. 
<br />
Can you fart while meditating? Because sometimes I get some gas during my meditation and I usually let it out slowly so it doesn't disrupt my meditation but I was thinking it was bad because you have to use your stomach muscles to do it. So what is the answer?
