			I finaly got almost out of body tonite. I woke up about  3 am in the state before sleep and awake.
<br />
I remember waking up autamaticly thinking about the people who could leave there body and still have concioseness in both body and spirit ( this mite have been a dream its hard to tell) But my last thought was that maybe i have to will a obe to happen, like moving ur arm sought of, u have to infuence urself into it when ur in the rite state. Immediatly it felt as if i stoped breathing ( sleep paralysis)(gained full conciosness)(i didnt freak out because i no already that i was still breathing). I tried to get out of it becasue i didnt know if i was ready yet mentally to experience this but after about 10 seconds of fighting i new i was i for a ride. I suddenly heard a super loud wooshing sound. This was extremely weird becasue It felt like my body was in extreme motion while hearing the noise.
<br />
I got freaked out a little so, i snapped out and soon i felt the paralysis coming again and didnt fight it this time. I willed my self to sit up and it really felt like a sat up it was insane, i couldnt see though at all i had
<br />
no astral site at the time. Well rite after that i went back to body and came out of paralysis( the trick is to remain calm and you will come out smooth and quick.) I feared the noises which is what kept me from moving on. Im glad i got this far tonite, and i no once i go back to bed, im gonna hit another obe again, i could jsut tell by the feeling im geting as i lay back into bed <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> . i also had about a 4 hour nap about 3 hours before i went to sleep. Sleep paralysis is the key to this whole operation, if u can obtain it, your well on your way. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />
