			Ive been jumping around from technique to technique and ahve been trying things out. I have found that whenever i want to move the psi wheel it would just edge a bit and then stop . After eviewing it many times i have come to relize that everytime it twitches i star thtinking &quot;wow its gunna move&quot; and so it stops so i thought to myself stop thinking about it when it starts to move and it worked. 
<br />
.
<br />
..if you want to know what im using it it a paperclip with one of the ends bent up and a quarte on the base to hold it down ..and a paper regular psi wheel mounted on it 
<br />

<br />
..Now i have just tried this technique with  a pencil with no avail... I have read all of the sticky posts but they tell me not to think into it to much and just do it, but i need to know am i supposed to be just staring at it blankly and all the sudden it will move because i do not do this with the psi wheel ?
<br />

<br />
Any thoughts?

			How long have you been doing the psiwhaeel? It could just be that you haven't gone far enough with the wheel to try to move pencils. You have to have really good control over the wheel before you can attempt to move pencils. 
<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that you are using a hexagonal pencil instead of a round one. Those are the ones you want to start rolling with, and then you can go back to the hexagonal ones when you're good enough.

lol i've been using the hexagonal one opps... but i thought that it would be eaister to start with sliding but i guess rolling a round pencil couldve been better ..wonder why i didnt think of that
