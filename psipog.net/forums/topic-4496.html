			This was a random idea that popped into my head a few hours ago. What if everyone had the ability to do amazing things with psionics?
<br />

<br />
The World Cup would be different. All the players would just stand on the sidelines and make the ball move around with TK. The crowd would be completly silent and just cheer for different players through telepathy. xD Dude, that would rock and suck at the same time.
<br />

<br />
No vacations, people would just sleep for a few days straight and astral project everywhere they wanted to.
<br />

<br />
Games of catch would just include throwing psiballs around.
<br />

<br />
Now I'm just saying this if the world had amazing out of this world psionic abilities all the time, on command. Of coarse, that will never happen and it takes a person years to even develop things like telepathy or clarivoyance. But hey, its a cool thought nonetheless. And scary too...who knows whats trying to get into your head.

			Everyone does have the ability to use psi, but not alot know alot about it yet. I can see this happening in a few more generations however, i'm planning to raise my kids with psionics, in a healthy way of course ^^ We should all try and do that if we ever plan to have kids, or even our nephews, or anyone at a young age, of course you should get the parents full permission to do that &gt;_&gt;; don't want any behind the scenes brainwashing XD might look weird.

			Heh, I can see the future with more people into psi if we begin telling our kids about it. It'll be an interesting change...
<br />

And when I say play games with psiballs, I do know people toss psiballs around already. But imagine games in PE at school replaced with psiballs instead of real balls. Tennis, handball, basketball... xD Awesome.

If we did that then the next generations would become fat and out of shape..&gt;.&lt;

On another note, I was really excited about the thought of teaching my children psionics. Now, I'm not so sure I will because i might stop practicing once I enter college.

			(I was thinking the same thing, only on a smaller cale, as if everybody knew about it, but not everybody used / had it.)
<br />

<br />
I think it would be a very different society. It would be impossible to keep law and order, and contitutional rights could be taken (I.E. Privacy [Telepathy/Mind Reading]).  People would learn to shield in P.E.  Electrokinetics(is that a valid term?) could electronically steal money, and there would be no way to prove they did it.
<br />

<br />
Unless, of course, somebody came up with some way to monitor a person's psionics usage, which again, would be a violation of Constitutional rights.  Or if there were a way to monitor psionic actions in important establishments, and trace who used those actions, and could detect what kind of action took place (I.E., was it TK or TP?).  Like a Psionic Security Camera.

Yes I agree, If I have kids I will train them on a regular basis at a young age. I wish my parents would of done that, or at least back me up...but no they think this stuff is a bunch of garbage...lol.
