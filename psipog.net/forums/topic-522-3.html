Did you read I said depending.

Since you are a driving you have responsibilities. You are willing to take the heat for whatever you do I think that's a good thing, but like I said I don't think it's right to jeopardize others. Don't take this personally but I think you need to GROW UP.

That's weak? I think that shows complete arrogance on your part. You have a brain, it doesn't hurt to use it 360 sometimes.

Your right, its not right to jeapordize others. But you can do the wrong thing for the wrong reason, or the wrong thing for the right reason. Although regardless of what you do it for the end result is always wrong. I'm don't think like this cause i need to grow up, I take this risk simply because the convience is to great. Thus I resolve myself towards any fate .
<br />

<br />

<br />
I ment that I thought 360 about things so I know how its gonna feel before I experience it. Not the other way around.
<br />

<br />
I'm not stupid. In this situation i'm just being an jerk, an ass, a inconsiderate jerkoff. 
<br />

<br />
But not stupid. For I know full well what could happen, I just don't care.
<br />

<br />

<br />
But that's just when it comes to driving. My views on other things are completely opposite in tonality.

It's just the topic sort of hits a cord with me and I apologize for any offense I have caused you. I just wish maybe you could at least consider rethinking what you do. That's all.

Then we have come to terms.

You understand that I know full well what I do, and that I know its wrong.

I understand your point of view and agree with you.

So often do arguements never even reach this level. I am thankful for it.

Ya there are a lot of arguments on Psipog that are left open ended. I try to be considerate and at least have a level of respect for other opinions even if they differ from my own.

			Driving whilst using a mobile telephone is mad.  The only reason these drivers aren't dead is because of sensible drivers who don't, and perhaps sheer luck.  Oh, and since someone asked, it's illegal here in the UK anyway.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

It's not fair to the person you collide with.

You're just being inconsiderate. I don't think you realize the implications of your actions. If you get into an accident and survive, you do not know how that will affect you mentally. It can actually scar you. I know because I'm speaking from experience. It was so hard for me and for a while I was suffering from post traumatic disorder (I'm not sure of the exact name I can't think of it right now.).
