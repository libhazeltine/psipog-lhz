			I can't really explain this but I can make a certain something flow throughout my body on command. I don't think it's psi because I've tried maniplating it in my hand and so far, no results. I've had this feeling for a few years now(I'm currenty 15). It's origion feels like it is inside by head but more in the back of the skull. Whenever I make it move, my whole body kind of twitches sometimes and if I make it move for a long time, its effect starts to fade away. But if I try like a day or two later, it is back to normal. It also is more &quot;active&quot; or &quot;vibrant&quot; when I'm in an unusually good mood.

			You are probably just directing energy through your light body/astral body/energy body. You say its origin is in the centre of your head, but a little more to the back of the head? 
<br />
Then you are probably using your Ajna Chakra/Third eye. The ajna chakra, which lies in the energy body, has a point of correspondence in the physical body, called the pineal gland. When you are directing energy through your body, it is highly probable that you are using this energy vortex, since it is located at that spot you are referring to.

			Welcome to charging if I understood what you're doing right. Basically what happens to me that sounds really similar to this is I kinda move something inside me (one of the places it works being in the head, but i prefer the torso - safer), and it sends out nice bursts of energy (hence the twiching/jitterness while doing it), afterwards you should feel pretty good/energetic.

			You may have a link with somebody else...I would expect to feel it in the back of my head...

Well, the only thing I can say for sure, is to check the article, and always ask questions when you're not sure <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			From what I've heard people's explanation, charging is forcing your body to generate more energy through some means.

			If you are reading this I would like to let you know that I feel a water-like sensation when I focus psi onto specific areas of my body.  It can happen automatically too.  Usually in my legs.  If feeling like an icy yet comforting stream flowing quickly. Certain emotions seem to cause me to feel tremendous amounts of this energy. In my opinion it must be psi. You are not alone.
