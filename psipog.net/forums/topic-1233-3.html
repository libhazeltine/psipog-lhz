I know that.  I'd have to hurt myself if I didn't.  And to give you some confirmation i'll tell you more about it.  Gravity is the attraction between two objects which is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their distance.  That is.  If each mass is 4.  the product of their masses is 16.  16/(distance from their centers).  Let's just call that 2 because that's the first number I thought of.  2 squared is 4.  16/4 is proportional to the force of the gravity, 4.  (huh, ironic).  Other than the math, gravity has an instant affect on objects.  It takes litterally no time for an object to be affected by gravity.  Geeze, sorry for being silly.  I thought I cleared that up by saying sorry for being random on that post.  I won't do it again.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			As an afterthought, the magnetic field of the earth is caused by the movements of the molten iron core of the earth in relative to the rest of the earth.  Now I have to work; so I probably won't post for the rest of the day.

			I have barely any memory of when I was 5.  So, I do not know.  Allow me to elaborate on my memory situation.  I was held back in kindergarten when I was 5, and I didn't even know about it until I met someone that I had apparently either been friends or enemies with in the past.  I think this happened around 5th grade.  He told me I had been held back in kindergarten.  Naturally, I did not believe it.  I then talked to my mom about it, and she told me that I had indeed been held back in kindergarten.  It's just really weird that I can't remember it.  I have never been hit hard in the head or anything like that at that age or later on, and most people say I have a good memory.  I've been really curious as to how that is possible.  I can remember before and after that period in time, but I cannot remember what happened in that gap in between.  That curiosity is what drew me toward that time when I figured out that it might be possible to link to a person in the past.

			well, if your past self did link to your future self, then you probrably would have been smart enough to pass kindergarden, and skip to high school. so it's either a plausable past self that never happened, or you might be messing with a spirit wanting to make himself appear to be your younger self.

			Or perhaps the loss of the memory occured some time during that school year or maybe more than once.  Maybe, back then, something was different.  I did not even know what the word psi was until I was 14...  I could do stuff before then, but I did not have the ability to intentionally connect to a person at the times before and for a few years after I was 5.  The connection is still fading in and out, and at the moment I cannot ask the question...

			one thing, this past sefl might be a time travelling entity. it sounds stupid yes. but say if there is another version of yourself, in another time and place (i.e your 5 year old self) and this entity is constantly travelling through what we call time, then maybe he has travelled to the point that he entered your subconcious plane, but say he is continuously travelling (like we continually age, theres nothing you can do about it) that the connection is weakening because he is passing through this plane.
<br />

<br />
aak! this sounds confusing. 
<br />

<br />
maybe you should try and ask this past self, or see for yourself if he ages. 
<br />

<br />
another thing, this could be an alternate reality version of yourself, like parallel but has a whole different &quot;timing&quot; system. actually i think im looking a lil too deep into this, im confusing myself now <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			Well, I dropped this post a while ago after I felt that about half the people that read this thought I was in sane or some random fake seeking attention.  Well anyways, just a little update:  The process seems about the same as If I was growing backwards.  In other words, it's really slow.  When I posted for the first time on psipog.net, I was 5' 9.25&quot;.  Now I'm 5' 4.5&quot;... Just thought i'd share the info with anyone who might be curious.
