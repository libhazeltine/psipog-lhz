			Well this may be a solution to the levitation thing...kinda. I read in the Common and Not-So-Common Shields by Peebrain stating that you could make a cloaking shield around yourself or shields around objects. Well my theory is you could make a cloaking shield around some box or other sturdy object and stand on it. Presto you are levitating. Of could no one could sweep their foot under you because they would hit the box.

			thats interesting, but makinga  shield under yoru feet would allow you to walk on top of water no? 
<br />

<br />
walking on top of water, thats a nice technique how would you do it?? simple just concentrate and focus energy on the soles of yoru feet, since water is material, is physical, teh energy will simply create an invisible surface surrounding the foot that's touching the water.

			First off for the love of God people let this thread die, its been necro-ed so many times its not funny, you CAN make a new one, in fact you're supposed to if the thing's been untouched for months.
<br />

<br />
Still same amount of effort as levitating since you'd still have to fight gravity, and as far as I know you can't use tk to simmulate a physical object (someone confirm that), so making invisible shoes is out of the question, even if it wasn't said shoes would have to be the size of a raft, each, which would make walking difficult. Remember, nature even has a hard time trying to do this. Theres only one type of animal that can walk on water, the Basilisk (lizard), and that's because it has special feet AND it moves incredibly fast.

			LOL i've been searching for that lizard name for a while now, thanks for the name.
<br />

<br />
and i agree i dont see action inthis thread for a while lets drop the levitation issue for now.
<br />

<br />
besides innerfire has experience with energy, so he knows what his talking about, while i still think that psy energy have different properties then the type of energy innerfire reffers to... i belive psy energy has to do with spiritual force rather then normal energy.
<br />

<br />
while i think we can manipulate both, spiritual energy seems to have diffferent properties(hence the astral body) you can float while in astral why?
<br />

<br />
and astral projection is an OBE, wich means the astral body is released from the physical body, and let go of the physical body's limitations
<br />

<br />
either way just a thought. inner if you want to say something about this, PM me this thread is dead

			ok, get over it...nobody here is advanced enoph to make a psi construct to leivtate themselves...it would require a VERY strong force bubble, and force bubbles require experience in psychokinesis....so you would need an ENORMOUS amount of skill in energy manipulation and an ENORMOUS amount of skill in psychokinesis...so dont bother....at least not until your better than JoeT, Peebrain, RainSong, and Not_Important COMBINED <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

I believe this sort of thing falls into the catagory of mind-over-matter.
<br />

<br />
Imagining &amp; strongly believing in your reduced weight somehow can effect how fast you can run, and how long you can run.
<br />

<br />
I believe this has to do with slightly animate matter being able to slightly modulate its own physical laws.

			I would like to say something:
<br />

<br />
I have read every post in this thread and its soooo boring <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> 
<br />
Everyone is just saying the same darn thing! <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />

<br />
So I thought maybe: you could use like a group of psions to levitate a person.but then I remembered that all TK users have an Anti-TK shield, so I say levitate a casual passer-by,BUT wait! they would be too heavy right?So why not a child!!
<br />

			Dear Aaront,
<br />

<br />
really, that trick isn't going to work here <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> . You should know better than trying to fool a critical audiance like this. We have met and we have seen many fakers. Besides that, the method you use is widely-known. So for your own good, stop saying that you are levitating because no-one is going to believe it anyway <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> . Oh and next time you make a levitation vid and you want people to believe it is the real thing, be sure to make the atmosphere in that video a little more mature by taking out that music for example. Now it looks like you are trying to be a famous magician and make it exciting with music and announcement texts. But really, as soon as I heard that music, I already knew it could not be real <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> .

Cya,
