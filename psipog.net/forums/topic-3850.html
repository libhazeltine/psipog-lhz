			Haha it's funny because I have the exact same idea to do in the summer, is to move sand. No no it's ok it's not a fluffy term to move sand. Just don't call it ____kiensis, because then it gets fluffy. It's 100% unfluffy when you say move sand with TK. Think about how much of a large psi ball you can probably make, now imagine all the molecules within it. That's alot! Try to relate the lot of molecules to the sand, as they are very tiny, and large in amount. Alot of other methods probably work, relate to the sand, be the sand, move it!
<br />

<br />
Another thing.. if you can't really think of yourself move sand around, then maybe you should watch alot of garra <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> I think he's awesome, it inspired me to do the sand idea.

Gaara is neat though.

But yeah, moving sand with PK is exactly what it sounds like. Just practice moving sand just like you'd move a psiwheel.

Maybe start with 1 grain, and work your way up.

			what i think: don't see sand as a lot of stuff, see sand as just one thing.
<br />

<br />
you know when you study physics on school, there are like 3 blocks system, like block A-B-C, all of them in a line and conected by strings? so when you apply a force F to block A , it will move A B and C all in once? and you use this to calculate acelaration from the system, not calculation with just block A, but with all of them like they were just one thing? so, do it with sand too. see a bunch of sand, try to &quot;delimitate&quot; it with your mind, how much you want to move and do it. you can think like the outer grains floating first, then the next, and next, and next... for me is the best visualization... i think
<br />
or just see as a handfull of sand and lift it all at same time.

			I don't mean to go off topic, but i'd like to say that I really admire rock lee and gai's attitudes on life, extremely positive and awesome! I'd think of them as a role model when I think of all the things in life that get ya down, or mess up yer thinking. You can move the sand! yaa! positive attitude!
<br />

Hell, I even have a rock lee clay model I made in art class next to my psi wheel XD
