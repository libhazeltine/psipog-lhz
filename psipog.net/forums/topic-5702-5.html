<br />
Just because they're aware of the fact that they could die or be injured doesn't mean they want to die or be injured. Every ethical means should be taken to preserve life.
<br />

<br />
I would also like to agree with Roy there, the .00001% chance to stop wars should be shot for... but, the method must be secure and beneficial to both sides. If you end up accidentally disabling all of Israel's weapons and leaving Hezbollah's intact, you're going to have a crisis on your hands, and it will be partially your fault, because while Israel may stop after Hezbollah has been wiped out, Hezbollah has made it clear that they will not stop until the entire world has been forcibly converted to Islam. It'd be a slaughter, put simply. You would have to be absolutely sure that what you were doing would not backfire in a major way, that being just one example.
<br />

<br />
Additionally, the point has been repeatedly made that taking away weapons will not stop wars, that people will be reduced to breaking each other's necks with their bare hands. What could you do to stop that? Get in between them and subdue them all psionically? Then you get to the issue of one person or organization having too much power. What if you become corrupt? Then the world is unarmed, AND under the control of a superpowered madman. The situation gets worse.
<br />

<br />
I'll say it one more time. Although loss of life is something that should be avoided at all costs, the best and fastest way to stop wars is usually to kill everyone who would continue it.
