			I'm not sure if this has been said before... but how possible would it be to move sound waves and create &quot;psycho-music&quot;? Has anybody ever tried? I think (if possible) it'd be very interesting.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

			I think you would have a better chance via construct because you can program it to manipulate the sound waves.  It sounds possible.  Quite hard, but maybe possible.  I dont see why not.

PS: thank you for not saying &quot;sonokinesis&quot; or whatever people call it.

			Sonokinesis....hehe. Wingmakers should add that to their dictionary. Yeah construct defintely sounds better than pk. With pk it would be impossible; you would have to know exactly how particles moved proportional to the sound, which would be hard. The vibratiuons would have to be sooooo precise and perfect or you would just get something that sounded like this: kjsfhdkfhkjdhgvshnfdkvuhnbbbbbbbbbbgzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, which wouldn't sound very nice. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			Well... when you move a psiwheel, you don't necessarily know where every particle is going... It'd just take some &quot;tuning&quot; (shortening and lengthening the waves) and you'd be off fairly quickly.
<br />

<br />
I'd just like to know if ANY kind of sound can be made from PK. It can work from there.

			Please don't invent random kinesis terms.  It's unclear whether you're joking or not in your post, and some fluffball could come in here and start using that term.

			Peebrain, was that referring to me? I didn't invent any kinesis terms, &quot;psycho-music&quot; (which I used in my first post) is just a more accurate description of what type of effect &quot;psycho&quot; is doing. For example, you've got psychology (the study of). Although from my term, it could just mean music in your head. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> And music is really just movement of particles... but then again, the &quot;study of&quot; something is also the movement of chemicals/electricity in the brain... but that's going a bit far. <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I understand how labelling something as like, &quot;insert word here&quot;kinesis and stuff doesn't make sense though. I'm with you on that one.

			I think if you want to do something that would achieve that effect, I would suggest to develop telepathic speech, then literally sing the music you want to create. I do believe you could do it in another way, but this would probably be the most practical for humans.

			after reading these posts an idea hit me, what if you were to create a speaker with psi, only to use your body as a speaker connection and allow the real speaker's vibrations to reverse imprint your aura (run on but im amid thinking here) then allow this reverse signature to flow through you to your psi speaker. this a theroy only so dont kill me over it if theres no results xD
