Instead of asking why &quot;someone else&quot; hasn't done something, why not ask yourself, &quot;why don't I do something?&quot;.  Give it a try.

Erm... I don't mean to be obstinate, but this <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> the skeptic forum. The lottery is set up on a system of statistical balance; basically, you get just enough money to keep you playing, but they still come out on top - fairly common knowledge. If one were to alter the odds, whether through precognition or PK, even by only a small amount, you could have a substantial form of income (even if you never won the jackpot). 
<br />

<br />
I have some small success with micro-PK, but not any at all when it comes to precognition, so I can't test this myself. However, it seems that <span style="font-style: italic">something</span> should come of a psion trying to play the lottery...?
<br />

<br />
Hypothetically, one could get into conspiracy theories, saying that the lottery uses government psions to counter such acts. I personally don't believe this, but you should at least be able to alter the odds in every game of Poker, Monopoly, or anything else - so the same applies.
<br />

<br />
---------------------------
<br />

<br />
I'm not one of the pseudo-skeptics, but this particular fact has always gotten to me: namely, that of psions not having supplementary income from their abilities. I'm not saying that we're all immoral bastards who would leap at a chance for extra cash, but neither are we pure monks who turn away from a chance at winning the lottery or raffles. 
<br />

<br />
I can't come up with any way to use my meager skills to produce even a $5-a-month income... but if I could, I would. I believe the same applies to others here - if you were to spend your time studying to be a doctor instead of practicing with psionics, would it be immoral to use your skills to aquire money? There's nothing (in my mind) that sets psionics apart, unless you use it to pickpocket or something similar. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
So, the question remains: Why does no one here have at least <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> form of supplementary income from our skills?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />
