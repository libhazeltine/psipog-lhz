			Yes, I have this question that I hope someone can answere. I have not been sucessfull of rolling a pen or levitating stuffs and so on, But I?m wondering if (for example) I want to learn rolling or levitating a pencil. Would it not be more effective to try something heavier to start with? I know of coure that it probably won?t have any effect, But say that you train for months with something a bit heavier, and then go back to try rolling (or lifting) the pencil. Would not the outcome become more powerful?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			Well im no expert on how the way psychokinesis works in those regards, but I can make a guess.
<br />

<br />
If its anything like a muscle then lifting the heavier is good and if you can achieve it it will help with the smaller, but if you cant, what good is it? Your not really toning it but putting stress on it.
<br />

<br />
It's as if your pushing a boulder, but can never move it, maybe you spend your life and never can, but you work up from pebbles, to rocks, to large rocks, to ect... Then when you reach boulders, you'll have trouble but you know the technique and the prowess to get it done, it may not move as fast or as soon but you'll have more success then those who havent gone through it.
<br />

<br />
Also you may get discouraged easier, since heavier it will be harder to your mind, thus less likely to get results, the dampering of this may damper the skills overall, but I could be wrong. All and all i'd say work up, is it impossible to work heavier then down, no and for some it works, though does it for all? I'd probably have to say no, you just have to find out what works well for you.

			I think it has to do with focusing the PK on a particular spot. Moving a large object that is relatively light or physically easy to move might be easier than moving a pencil.  To move a pencil you might have to focus it in that particular spot, controlling it might be difficult, depending on what your visualizing.  A large trash can, rollable, very large, therefore easy to push with large amounts of psi without the stress of focusing. Thats my guess.

			I found practicing on heavier objects, and making them light in my mind, helpfull when I returned to something light as foil. It suddenly seems very easy and very light. I even believe those were the times I had most succes in lifting up foil. So Yes, try it.
