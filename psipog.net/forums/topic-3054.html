			Precognitive Control: Lesson #3
<br />

<br />
Hearty congratulations if you have reached this stage.
<br />
Well so far, y?all have learnt partial precognitive control over yourselves and inanimate objects, as well as a hint of retro-cognition.
<br />

<br />
This article will cover some of the final steps towards precognitive control, they are: natural precognition, and attachment of this ESP as a sense.
<br />

<br />
You will achieve the ability to attach precognition as a sixth sense. It will always be activated, just like seeing, hearing, touching, smelling and tasting.
<br />

<br />
Infinite Natural Precognition
<br />

<br />
This is the ability to master the precognition, and see the whole event itself down to the utmost detail.
<br />

<br />
Right, assuming you have completed both clock exercises, this will be something that needs to be carried out every evening. What I want you to do is to not touch the clock at all. I want you to do the precognition on yourself. If you do this in the evening usually you will see the next day.
<br />

<br />
You do this by preparing the third eye, supercharged and fully activated. Now I want you to close your eyes, and go into a meditative state. Keep your intent strong. You want to see the day ahead of you.
<br />

<br />
This technique is extremely difficult to pull off, as you get so much feedback within a few seconds. What should happen is that you will get a stream of pictures. Acknowledge each and everyone.
<br />

<br />
The pictures are like a Zip file on your computer. They are extremely compressed. Usually you receive a flurry of images, like in telepathy. Now what happens is that your brain will decode this and give it meaning.
<br />

<br />
If you are unsure about a certain image, you can skip ahead in time and take a closer look. The key to this technique is to receive the images, decode them and then look into them.
<br />

<br />
To access a time period, you must keep the picture strong in your mind. Now feel the time period, just like with the basic clock exercises, you can feel what is correct and what isn?t. Once you have locked on, you can enter the pictorial premonition. Just like you do with the clock exercises. You keep your intent, and go into it. Pretty simple, ey?
<br />

<br />
The reason this technique is called infinite is because you can keep scrolling through time. When you are in the pictorial time period, you may receive more images, in which you can also go into. This can be strenuous on the mind though, so use it at your own risk.
<br />

<br />
Sense Attachment 
<br />

<br />
This is the ability that allows you to attach the precognitive technique as a new sense.
<br />

<br />
Don?t try this unless you have completed the above exercise. 
<br />

<br />
Right, the next thing I want you to do is to cut down the time it takes you to see and decode. This should come fairly naturally, until your able to do it within seconds. 
<br />

<br />
Keep practicing cutting down the time. 
<br />

<br />
Once you feel happy with the amount of time saved, I want you to do the following: this requires one deep meditative session
<br />

<br />
I want you to go into such a deep meditative state, that your mind is completely blank, that there are no thoughts running through your mind. Now what were doing here is programming your mind to activate precognition subconsciously.
<br />

<br />
You must first think about the precognitions you?ve had before, start recalling the sensations you felt at the time, until it feels ?natural?. Until your used to the feelings.
<br />

<br />
Now think about how you do precognition. Basically what im trying to say is keep recalling how it is done, what you have seen, the sensations you have felt. Now keep a super strong intent here, keep the intent that these events are part of your senses. 
<br />

<br />
What I did was recall all precognition sensations, events etc, and then I recalled what sight, touch, sound, smell, and taste felt like. I kept scrolling through these senses until it seemed as if precognition was just another sense. I did this for roughly 30 minutes before I felt that I had embedded this activity as a naturality of the human sensations within the body.
<br />

<br />
For me, I can just look at something, and just know its future and past. That?s how I could tell that precog was now another sense.
<br />

<br />
So in a nutshell
<br />

<br />
Reduce time taken for precognitive events
<br />
Repeat until satisfactory
<br />
Enter meditative state
<br />
Recall the feeling of precognition
<br />
Recall 5 senses
<br />
Repeat several times
<br />
Acknowledge that precog is another sense
<br />
Go to Sleep
<br />
Wake up, and feel free to play?
<br />

<br />
Hope this has benefited you as much as it has me,
<br />

<br />
Huggles
