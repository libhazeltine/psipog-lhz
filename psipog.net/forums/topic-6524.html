			I don't think there is any one technique for opening the third eye. I don't even know if there is really a third eye. Just try to do some empathy and telepathy techniques without it.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

Don't worry about the shit and just practice.

			that place called third eye or first hern or focus place , some scientists say when your brain left and right sides work together you will feel tengiling sensation in that point , some people say when you are focus enough you will feel that sensation in that point , that sensation people call it tengiling and some say openning the third eye .
<br />

<br />
anyway for my own experience you need to be focus to feel that sensation and that mean you need to clear you mind from thoughts and as long as you clear your thought your sensation will increase .
<br />

<br />
you want method to do it , try this one : look at one dot or close your eyes and dont move your eyes and clear your thoughts and put your attention in the third eye as you call it , spend some time doing so and after while from that trainning you will feel it , if you succeed you will feel it all i mean you dont need to train for some years or monthes like all people say <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
other method is to point your index finger to the third eye but dont let your finger touch it and put you attention to your index finger and look away from your finger and your hand but put them in your sight.
<br />

<br />
good luck. it is realy easy to be done and to feel that sensation of openning the third eye but dont expect much from that , you said do what every you want <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> no it will not and it only help you to be focus and it will increase your confidence and feeling your will and can help you in fast recovery in meditation and calm objects like wind and calm people or help them to remove or decrease their pain and you can remove your headaches by being at that place and feel that sensation . for me when i learned that and got all the information about it , i dont need to drink tea or anything to help me to remove or decrease my headaches.
<br />

<br />
edit: if you reach that state it will help you in telepathy and empathy.

			The Ist method's good.But,about that second,I think it'd be better not to try that  because some people might get confused and may self hypnotize or do something wild,while some others may not.It depends on people.You might also get a bad,really bad headache. Meditation is the right way to open the third eye,but that takes a long time,like 30 or 40 years.You may do the Ist method,it helps in long run and doing telepathy and all those stuffs.
<br />

<br />
You are free to take your own decision,I just suggested a 'safer' method.
<br />

<br />
And besides,when our third eye is opened,we achieve eternal bliss and will be totally spiritual.We will be able to do things even more advanced than telekinses.But,only if we open our third eye in its correct and right manner and,especially,not focusing on goals,but on becoming one with the Almighty.
<br />

<br />
Enough for the spiritual stuff,I say again that this is just my opinion and you are free to take your decision. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			i put that second method because i think it is hard for begainers with doubts and might not believing in that sensation , so i put it to help them to sense that sensation to help them to do the first method . 
<br />

<br />
for me i dont need to meditation to reach that state and i can reach it in 3 to 10 seconds because i get used to that and trainned on it and i can do it while talking or moving or doing anything so you will feel it is easy after some trainning .
<br />

<br />
btw i dont think there is any bad thing will happen if you use the second method and being in the first hern or the third eye then you are at the most positive area in the mental plane and nothing wrong will happen .

This indicates that you have not been to the main site. How do people come here and completely miss the <a href="http://www.psipog.net" target="_blank" class="postlink">main site for Psipog</a>? Anyways, to learn how to do the abilities, <a href="../articles.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">read the articles</a>. Read all of the articles. It won't take that long. Then pick something and practice it. No third eye involved.

			You shouldn't worry about opening your third eye, you should &quot;just do it&quot;.  Though, I don't think it's that hard to open it, you just have to have patience and let it happen.  There aren't any quick fixes.

			Yes,I agree with psi fi.You don't have to open the 3rd eye for doing tk or any other ability.Just practise.Besides,opening the 3rd eye is not an ability.It just makes you more aware,aware of your inner self.That's all.
<br />

<br />
And about that 2nd method - I am not sure if it that method is good.Maybe some may find it helpful and may not find any problems with it,while some may not.Anyway,those who like it can use it.I just suggested.It's all up to those who practice.

did you use the third eye before? i dont think so because if you did you would know its powers that give you it. 
<br />

<br />
ok the word powers look like big things <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> i mean it make you do alot of things like i posted it up , and without it you cant do somethings , with feeling that sensation you know how much you are focused and how much you are connected to the energy too .
<br />

<br />
anyway i have great exp and information in the third eye and im not going to change what you want to believe . good bye
