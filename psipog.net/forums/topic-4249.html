			How do you move your psi wheel?

<br />
I connect with it and then use a combination of commanding my psi wheel to move (&quot;It will move because I tell it to!&quot;) and visualizing it moving as if it were a limb.
<br />

<br />
I'm just seeking perspective.

three to four hours is a lot of time spent on a psi wheel is a little extreme even if time is just an illusion

			i suggest a VARIETY of techniques. one can push a wheel using the 3rd eye, your 'second body', using energy, using pushes and pulls, using energetic encompassment... etc etc etc. 
<br />

<br />
there are WAY too many ways to do it for someone to tell you what might work.  you rather need mass input, and to test out what works and what dosnt for you. be creative! use a many approaches at once. whatever floats your moat.
<br />

<br />
however, 
<br />
if you feel frustrated, stuck, or incapable of some ok thoughts then just take a break.  try again when it feels right. 
<br />

<br />
if youd like an 'experienced hand' of sorts, i can help you through the process.  just PM me.

			and responding to the above- above comment-
<br />

<br />
its regular for me to practice psionics of all sorts for 2 to 8 hours at a time. i started when i was in grade 6 (appx 9-10 yrs old) and ive been practicing ever since my first ability (memory recall... of other people.. ).   
<br />

<br />
i can spin the wheel nonstop with a friend for about an hour at a time or so, consistently enough.  patience, concentration, tolerance, and most of all, peace of mind.
<br />

<br />
i spend the (extremely) greater amount of my living life ( 80% of my day, if im awake ) consumed with developing myself, and the world surrounding me.  i love it.
<br />

<br />
some might argue this is a bad thing- and yeah, there are bad points.
<br />
but the way i see it-
<br />
gotta do SOMETHING with this DAMN insomnia!
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
maybe for you 4 hours is an eternity,
<br />
but i can trance away averagely 40 minutes to approx 10 hours at a time.
<br />

<br />
some would consider all of this- and more- insane.
<br />
yes i am.

			I often find it easiest for me to communicate with my subconscious first, so that he (it?) can believe that I am really doing it, and it helps. As for moving the wheel itself, I use either the connection or the &quot;just do it&quot; method.

i discovered from the psi-wheel that it is the heat from your hands that causes it to spin (without being covered up with a glass) ... if it doesnt spin without anything over it, then youre not flowing enough blood to your hands to create more heat... now once the heat from your hands start turning it, then you can make it spin  with your hands 2 ft away if you  have to lolol, i think its makes your subconcious connect firmly with the wheel when it moves from the heat lolol... so, id say not to focus on the wheel with it on covered but work on pushing your blood to the palms of your hands (which you can do just like you push energy to the palms of your hands (as if you were to ionize the air between your hands.)) and on that note, id say, visualize a tube going from the core of your body, to each one of your palms... im being shown to use a blue transparent tube... and visualize the energy as water... or gas, or foam or whatever you wish to use lolol... and visualize it going through the tube from the core of your body all the way to the palms. and just keep visualizing it flowing... that should create some good heat lolol... i just tried it and it took half a second... so if it doesnt work, im sorry that it didnt, as not all things work for everyone... so good luck  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

			Smirnoff - i respect your attitude to your insomnia, good stuff.
<br />

<br />
i havent had any success yet but as I see everyone here has Ill pose a quick question - I cant really get my head around the idea of connecting with the wheel? i mean I do understand it on some level, butnot how to further it, when I try to then the psiwheel starts giving off cold - i have a knack for giving off cold when moving psi around so I guess thats progress? any tips?
