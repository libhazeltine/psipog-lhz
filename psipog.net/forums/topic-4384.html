			In order to aid everyone who practices Psi, including myself, I have undertaken an effort to focus on the minute details of Psi manipulation, both which can cause success and failure, even in trained Psions.
<br />

<br />
Beginners Mistakes #1
<br />
Feeling The Limbs:
<br />

<br />
When we first begin our endeavors to manipulate Psi we often have to start by focusing on our Physical Bodies. This is simply logical, seeing as how you can't obtain control of your energy without practice. At first, our physical bodies are our only anchor to Psi. When we attempt to manipulate Psi we focus on moving it through our stomachs, chests, arms, hands, feet, or head... Or other parts, depending on how &quot;interesting&quot; you make it.
<br />

<br />
While this can be beneficial, it can also be detrimental. For example:
<br />
Assuming that the feeling you get from focusing on a portion of your body is Psi. If I where to look at my hand right now, I would instantly become more aware of it. Granting me some sensations I normally wouldn't have in it. Perhaps even the bloodflow will increase to it. It may become slightly warmer, perhaps there is a feeling of pressure in it aswell.
<br />

<br />
This feeling IS NOT PSI. That is, I put forth 0 effort, no intention, and no visualization and I arroused a feeling in my hand. 
<br />

<br />
Most people who succeed at practicing and manipulating psi, who do not take this into note, will often find that sometimes they make a psiball and those present (In location) who attempt to feel it have no success. Why is this? In my opinion, this comes from the manipulator simply feeling their hand (or whatever they are using) instead feeling the energy. It can get very annoying, especially if you go long times practicing and switching between feeling your hand and feeling the energy.
<br />

<br />
Strangley enough, the solution lies within learning the difference between the feeling of psi, and the feeling of feeling your body. Obviously even moving Psi will create a PHYSICAL sensation on your body, but there is also a more detached feeling. Something that makes it a VERY unique sensation. It is a feeling of being aware mentally, almost seemingly physically, of a feeling on or around your body. 
<br />

<br />
So, next time you practice learn to make the distinction.
<br />

<br />
How?
<br />

<br />
Steps to Success!
<br />
Step 1:
<br />

<br />
Choose different sides of your body, preferably your hands and arms.
<br />

<br />
Step 2:
<br />

<br />
First begin by manipulation (or attempting to manipulate) psi on a given side of your body. 
<br />

<br />
Step 3:
<br />

<br />
Now on the other side simply become aware of the side in question, look at it, and feel it.
<br />

<br />
Step 4:
<br />

<br />
Question whether or not the feeling are the same, similar, or completely different. Be warned, Though the feeling of Psi is very unique, it carries similar feelings as does merely focusing on the body.
<br />

<br />
---
<br />

<br />
Through practice you will learn to distinquish between the feelings, and hopefully succeed furthere in manipulating Psi.
<br />

<br />
I hope this helps you.

			o.0 This topic makes me think if I ever made a psiball before  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> Many people make hot psiballs without programming, and I guess it's a good psi sign, but I manage to get only &quot;touching&quot; feelings, so I always wonder if I made one, or if my muscles are twitching (I spelled that right? hmm).
<br />

That is, I put forth 0 effort, no intention, and no visualization and I arroused a feeling in my hand. 
<br />
</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
But I have a question... to make a psiball you visualize it forming, energy, put into hand, more energy, bla bla bla etc etc yada yada yada, and then after programming and shelling you simply stop to concentrate? You... forget about your construct and it will work on its own?
<br />
And... if you want to reprogram it, do you start all over (visualize, energy, yada yada yada) or just &quot;edit&quot; a &quot;piece of code&quot; (if you know what i mean) ?

That's pretty much how it should work.

<br />
You can start over, if you want. You can just &quot;edit it&quot;... It's pretty easy to do, just think about stopping it's current function, and giving it a new one.

			Yeah, I was making that mistake for a while. Then I noticed my psiballs weren't being sensed by other people, so I noticed the difference eventually. It still would have been nice to have this to read though...but it wasn't around. Nothing like fixing a potential mistake before making it. I second the sticky idea.

			Manipulating psy in your body, you say, that's what I do as well
<br />
But isn't it bad for your body?  I mean, hands and arms, I guess psy won't do much wrong there, but what about other places?  Like heart, lungs, brain, ...
<br />
I wonder because, before trying to make a psyball, I usually try to manupulate psy in my body, to get used to the moving it, and I find it difficult breathing when I channeled the psy to my lungs

			omg, ur right,,, psi in lungs feels freaky, and makes it hard to breath,, anyways, ya, this thread does need to be stickied. i personally move psi into ever finger, toe, appendage, and whatnot before i start something new.

			there seems to also be a link between the use of psi and nervous system disorders. i dont have any evidence to really back this theory, but it seems plausible.

			When you are moving Psi through out your body it is going to interact with various nerve clusters. Thus, you MAY have some trouble learning how to breath normally while focusing and moving Psi through your body. It can easily be overcome by simply focusing on breathing more <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
I have experienced no Nervous system disorders while moving or practice Psi... And I have been practicing 6+ years <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
No permanent damage yet in my body. My psychology is in question though :-p.
