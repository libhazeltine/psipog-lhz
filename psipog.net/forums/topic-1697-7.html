I guess I should've written that Wikipedia entry under my Psipog name, but I couldn't be bothered.
<br />

<br />
I saw it in a dictionary or newspaper or something. Rainsong constantly preaches that biokinesis is a political theory too. Just do an internet search and exclude &quot;fluff&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I did a Google search and found plenty of hits describing biokinesis as a political term. <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=biokinesis+political&amp;meta=" target="_blank">http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=biokinesis+political&amp;meta=</a>
<br />

<br />
Some of those hits are even from Psipog.

You need to narrow down the search, because the list will be cluttered with idiotic RPG definitions. There are more RPGers than politicians, I'm willing to bet.
