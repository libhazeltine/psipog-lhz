			I noticed this for the first time in school the other day, that when I read something I wasn't hearing my own voice reading in my head but someone elses. I was reading this pasage and for some reason I was hearing a female voice, which was unussual because they are usually male. Then I looked at the author and it was a woman! I've done this multiple times. What do you think this is some sort of empathy?

sounds awesome. do you think you could touch the book and sit back and let the author read to you?

			ohh. seems oddly similar to that new ill farrel movie.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />
edit: so i looked it up and found a trailer <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/strangerthanfiction/" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/strangerthanfiction/</a> for the movie. and yeah i'm sorry but due to the timing and everything i'm gonna have to say i personaly believe this is bs. also the fact that the trailer started to be shown on tv like 2 or 3 days ago. i feel bad for saying this but im just convinced your making stuff up and its anoying to see people spam this place with crap like this. if your gonna make something up atleast be a little more creative

			Too bad I did this before I had even seen that preview. I haven't even seen but a bit of it anyway, and I hadn't even thought about that movie until you said something. I'm not making stuff up, we are all here to learn, and how can we learn if people start BSing.

			I just think its you...Reading it in your own head, but then you imagine that its the Author's voice reading it because nobody has a 'defined' voice inside of their heads.. Come to think of it, i wonder what the voice inside my head sounds like? Interesting..

			well i notice i do that when im on aim and im talking to my buddies from back home. these are all voices i've heard before so i figure my mind just associates the voice with the person and when it knows im reading something from that person it just adds in the audio.

			Blade Runner in MULTIPLE psionic books <span style="font-weight: bold">INCLUDING</span> Keith Miller's (who was at one point and time a member of psipog) &quot;Psychoenergetic Principles and practices: an introduction to psychic energy&quot;  speaks of the concepts that govern the idea of links, psychic imprints, and thought forms. Basically, anytime an author spends so much time on such a body a text their psychic imprint is left on their and a link to their mind is left. 
<br />

<br />
So it's kind of a combination of psychometry and such.

			in fact, heres the direct quote from the book which is the last paragraph of hte book:
<br />

<br />
&quot;As a last point, one's writing also carries a psychoenergetic charge,
<br />
in some vague sense. As the individual thinks and writes, they project a
<br />
portion of their energy onto the words on a page. While it is much more
<br />
direct and simple in handwriting, this phenomena also occurs over typed
<br />
word. The intent of the author is often conveyed into some abstract,
<br />
perhaps Platonic conceptualization of their “written word.” As such,
<br />
copies may still betray the actual thoughts and intentions of the writer. It is
<br />
important to guard one's mind, therefore, when writing for topics that will
<br />
be broadcast over the Internet, or published in a book, lest more meaning
<br />
than one intends be betrayed.&quot;
