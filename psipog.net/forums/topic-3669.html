			I wasn't skeptical at first, but I think my mind might be changing <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />  Started PK practice a few days ago after reading all the related articles on this site. As to emilinate the possibility of the psiwheel being affected by small air currents etc, I started practice with it under a glass. 3 Days later and not so much as a twitch (although I understand it can take a while!). 
<br />

<br />
Just for an experiment, I took the glass off. As soon as I put my hands remotely near the wheel it started to slowly spin. As soon as I moved them away, it stopped at first, but then then began to intermittently spin. Hmm... was it me making it move, or minute 'thermals' etc in the air? 
<br />

<br />
I set my phone recording a video of the psiweel as I left the room for half an hour and did something else. When I came back to inspect the video, the psiwheel was doing exactly the same as when I was there - randomly going into cycles of slow spinning pretty much constantly for the whole video. Unfortunately for me this has given me a bit of a blow, as I have now convinced myself that most of the instances of a moving uncovered psiwheel on this site are probably the same - just natural currents in the air / heat from body etc.
<br />

<br />
I am continuing to practice under the glass to try and prive myself wrong!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			Have you tried psi balls yet? They're relatively simple and they usually help people have more confidence in their abilities when they first start out and that's really cool how you recorded the psi wheel to see if you were doing it or not, I've never heard that before <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

3 days is an extremely short time to start with the glass..but that's your take. It's just harder to start there.

When you took your hands away, you created air currents. They pushed the wheel, and caused it to spin intermittently.

			Yeah. That's happening to me. I know it's real though. Sometimes I do it, but other times it's affected by the wind. Try cupping your hands over it. 
<br />
It took me five days to get it spinning decently. 
<br />

<br />
Example:: I spun it, but the AC was on in the next room. Turned it off, came back. It didn't spin as much, but it did spin.

			A half cover would be just as leaving it uncovered, only now you allow air currents to be trapped and circulate under the glass.
<br />

<br />
And cupping your hands around it is what is providing the heat that circulates air currents and makes them rise, causing the wheel to spin. 
<br />

<br />
I bet it took you 5 days because you had to find the sweet spot. I know I did because it took me awhile for the same reason.

			Putting the wheel under a glass is a major mental-block alone, combined with what you're saying you've seen, that is one HUGE mental-block to get over.
<br />

<br />
I would suggest you study the movement of the psi-wheel while you're there, and then practice control.  It's much easier for your mind(at least, mine) to accept that the wheel can turn around while it's moving, instead of just moving all of a sudden.
<br />

<br />
I know that I still can't make a psi-wheel move under a glass, however, when I do practice PK(my specialty's energy manip, so PK isn't exactly my cup of tea), I practice control.   Why?  Because: 
<br />

<br />
1. I'm OK at it, not &quot;good&quot;, but OK.  
<br />

<br />
2. It's easier to convince yourself that it is, in fact, YOU making it change.
<br />
The first time that it changes direction, it's a weird coincidence.   Second time, it's a freakish coincidence.   Third time, REALLY freakish coincidence.  On the fourth time, when you try to make it to stop altogether(when it has been moving consistantly for the past 5 or 6 minutes), and it stops, that's when you know it's you, not coincidence.
<br />
It is reinforced when, after a half minute of it standing still, you stop concentrating, relax, and, even though you didn't move a muscle, it all of a sudden begins to move again.   And continues moving until you get too tired of watching it spin.
<br />

<br />

<br />
So try working on control, especially making it stop, that should help you regain confidence.

Can you move it under a glass as well as without it? The glass just kind of messes with you(stop mocking me!!)somehow...I can spin the wheel, grab a glass barrier(bowl)and not even budge it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" />

It's a mental block because, when your brain looks at a psiwheel outside of a glass, you tend to think of it being able to be affected easily by winds, breath, etc.   Your brain BELIEVES that it will move, because you know that any small breeze will make it spin, it seems UNSTABLE.   When it's under a glass, your brain gets this idea that it can't move, the winds or breezes in the room don't affect it, because it's inside it's own personal case, it seems STATIC.  Not only can it eliminate that belief that it will move, but it can also bring up the idea that &quot;there's something between me and the psi-wheel&quot;, I can't do anything to affect it because it's behind something.   Both of these ideas can be extended to include PK by your sub-c, and hence, it makes it tougher to do.

I think you should begin with psiballs... I've been training a few days and can barely make psi tingle in my abdomen... And I'm not sure if it's me or my senses. It's like if you had gone to the gym and had gone straight with the 200 pounds weighs. You should begin with the smaller ones. 
<br />

<br />
If you tried to move a 200 pound weight without enough muscle, the weight wouldn't even shake. You'd pull and pull and it would remain quiet. What would you think: &quot;It is impossible to move this weight&quot;. Begin with the small exercises, or you'll be boycotting your own skills. PK is simply too hard to begin with. Methinks.
