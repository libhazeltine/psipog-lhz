			I was intrigued when SFG told me about this. Like most of you have said, even if it's a load of bull it still can't hurt. A million positive thoughts without amplification would be nice let alone when they're amplified by a million fold. The other point that no one has considered is this:
<br />

<br />
If you almost or completely (or convince yourself to believe) believe in this and actually participate, if it turned out to be a false prophecy the fact that you believe it would act as a kind of self-hypnosis that may actually may make your thoughts more powerful. Just not a million fold!
<br />

<br />
I will try this sometime today and here is what my goals are (could give someone else an idea for a goal too):
<br />

<br />
1. attain enlightenment
<br />

<br />
2. meet love of life
<br />

<br />
3. win lottery <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
4. gain faster matabolism to lose weight
<br />

<br />
5. get better vision
<br />

<br />
6. unlock/amplify some psionic abilities
<br />

<br />
7. fix ozone layer
<br />

<br />
8. clear out pollution
<br />

<br />
9. make a government representitive come who changes America/world in a very positive way
<br />

<br />
10. loving thoughts and hope for change in general

			I would like to note that ironically, I have yoga at 4:30 today, so I'm going to be meditating anyways. So in spite of me thinking this is New Age-hippie-junk, I'll be meditating anyhow before I do yoga class.

			This has been a very sacred and special day for me. I feel blessed. I went to visit a Swami from India who is staying in Amsterdam for a few days before returning to India. I had the honour of meeting him once (twice after today) For those who do not know what a Swami is, it is a person that is well respected in his teachings about life and yoga-science. One who is acknowledged in that field, and who is considered to posses at least some serious for of Self-Realization (read: enlightenment), may get the title of Swami.
<br />

<br />
So I went to him today, October the 17th. We meditated some in the morning, walked some in the afternoon, and as we did not really had a schedule, but just went where we felt we should go, there was a nice surprise, and a blessing coincidence for me. As you know, the peaktime was around 5:10 PM. It just so happened that I had the honour of getting an authentic Initiation from this master. An Initiation into TM (Trancedental Meditation) for life, and I recieved my personal Mantra. When we were finished, I noticed that I not only had the honour of being initiated by this Holy man from India, but also during the peaktime of this UV Beam. We didn't plan any of the things we did today...
<br />

<br />
I am not saying that this message about a beam is true or not, however, I do know that plenty of people have recieved that email and meditated on this day for the good of mankind. I also know that I often feel a change in the Atmosphere, and I did so today as well. So whether or not this message is true, its purpose is divine to me. Uniting the minds and intention of mankind on one theme for the better of the world. Selflessness unites, and I love it.
<br />

<br />
I wish the same happiness and blessings today and forever more for everyone reading.
<br />

<br />
