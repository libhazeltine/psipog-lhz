			I am a future psionic and I have been at traning for about 3 days and I made my first, of many more, psiball. I was actually just playing with my psi, i pictured water collecting above my belly button, then i felt a pull in between my hands, then i started telling myself to make a ball, not just a pool of water, then i asked it to get cold and spin , At first, i was scared, i mean, i didn't know what was happening, then i doubted myself, i said i had my arms to close to my body and that caused them to pull! 
<br />

<br />
Then I felt it, the cold. I was so frightened and then to make matters worst, i felt wind! COld wind! Right now, i can still fell the tingling of what i think is a psi ball, a very good one!
<br />

<br />
I pulled my arms away and i still felt my hands pull together then apart, together then apart, like my psiball was pulsing or something...anyway What do you guys( and girls) think? Is it the real thing or what?

			Well some psiballs do have an attraction-like pull to them, others can have a repulsing push, then others in temperature and those likes. At any rate if it wasn't you pushing it together I can say it sounds like a real psiball, though more information would help clarify.
<br />

<br />
Did you feel anything in your pooling area?
<br />
Did you feel any sensation in your hands?
<br />
Did you feel any sensation as the energy went from your pooling area to your ball's area?
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Also a side note, words like &quot;Geokinesis&quot;, &quot;Aerokinesis&quot;, and those likes are not allowed here on the forum, taboo terms, here is the link to the accepted kinetic terms.

			I felt tingling in my pool area and i felt cold wind rushing through the middle of my fingers, it was totally wild. Also, i heard about those terms on another website about psi and stuff like that, Those words dealing controling earth fire water and air, so i thought it would ok to talk about them here.

			All the elements can be controlled with pk.
<br />
 for example if you can move a ring or a pencil why you can't move a liquid or a gas?

			Psiballs can pretty much, be programmed to manipulate all 7 sense (I believe in 7) if you experienced them mentally, although, that is just my theory, you can think about it all you want, but that is how it seems so far.

somebody is bound to argue with me.....I know it.

			I have a theory, don't know if anyone as said this before and you all rejected it or what, but here i go...
<br />

<br />
I listen to songs and i here the beat, not the words, but the soul of the music. When i do i feel as if though something is trying to come out and express itself through me, like a tunnel or something. So, my theory is, if you feel music as a part of you, shouldn't your PK become powerful during these times? I think yes. Let me hear your inputs. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

I don't think so. I also &quot;become&quot; the music, and it almost impossible for me to concentrate on anything else. Or maybe my mind's weak.

Actually, that was a hypothesis.
