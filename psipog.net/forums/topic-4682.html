<br />
In this article I will explore many of the different ways the aura can be perceived and used. It is extremely important to remember that when reading and seeing auras there are no certainties in what they mean. You must interpret your findings yourself
<br />

<br />
Definition
<br />
 
<br />
Auras
<br />
A subtle, luminous energy field radiating within and around the human body as far as 3-7 feet. That part of the aura which surrounds the head is often represented by artists as a nimbus or halo to depict saints and enlightened beings. Usually people who practice energy or people who are more spiritually advanced have more spectacular auras. These are usually seen as a lot larger or brighter. However every living being has an aura. Seen psychically, the aura is filled with many colours which are reflections of the thoughts and emotions active in the nervous system and change according to the person's state of mind.
<br />
 While reading an aura it is common to pick up various surface thoughts and sometimes pick up traces of peoples character. Auras are not actually physical in any way. They are simply a representation of
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
Sensing
<br />
 Sensing an aura is quite simple but some people are uncertain if what they see is what is really happening, This is called analytical overlay and is caused when the conscious mind try?s to reason with your findings ?Is that just what I think they should feel? etc. To sense an aura I usually concentrate on something I associate with the individual I am reading. I build up their physical form round this so I can see their body in my mind. Then I would perform empathy, some people like to visualize a chord linking the people involved heart to heart (as this is where emotional is felt usually)  then they would clear there mind and feel the other persons emotions, When I start to pick up feelings I get flashes of colours taste and even sounds that I associate with certain emotions.  I would then mentally record this colour and envision it surrounding the person and build the aura up in layers. Before even starting to sense auras it is best to build up a ?library? of feelings sounds tastes and smells you associate with certain emotions. 20 minutes should be enough to get a good foundation. Bare in mind that people feel many emotions at once. Someone might be feeling love deep down but annoyance at the fact that they are not dating who they want.
<br />
Reading
<br />
When sensing an aura I actually feel them and get flashes of colour, tastes or smells in my head
<br />
 Contrary to what most people think. The auric field has many colours in it the predominant colour is usually how the person is feeling however it is not as simple as looking at colours that just appear.  To me auras ?look? like coloured mist and the way the mist moves is as important as its colour. For example if there were sudden violent bursts of red then it would be obvious the person you were reading was angry. I find that if someone is radiating pink then it is a sign of love because it is gentle and soothing. It is possible to hide your aura or change the colours seen in it (Certain summoners make themselves void of all emotion and feel what the deity they are summoning feels) Orthas describes the method as making oneself empty of all emotion using a technique similar to a void meditation. The reason that there is no concrete foundation on what certain colours mean is that people associate different things or experiences with different colours. 
<br />
Manipulation
<br />
In auric manipulation visualization is an essential tool. The aura can be used for offensive purposes but I find it is more effective when used with empathy. For example if my friend was stressed or sad I might visualize a radiating pink aura 
<br />
but to make this visualization effective I would have to will  the aura to have the desired effect by concentrating on this effect, for example I might focus on what it is like to lie beside my dog and feel his unconditional love. At this point I would use my aura to give her aura (which I would imagine as blue seeing as she was sad)  a hug .
<br />
   On the other hand if I wanted to make an impression, maybe by making myself slightly more impressive or even intimidating I might visualize my aura towering high above me while focusing on how I felt when I was surrounded by a gang of people about to mug me or how I felt while getting into trouble from my head teacher. What is important as the colours only mean what you interpret them to.
<br />

<br />
Practice
<br />

<br />
This is a simple game that is good for increasing awareness in the auric field 
<br />

<br />

<br />
1. Notice whether you can sense how far your auric field extends. Imagine 
<br />
that your auric membrane is a big bubble that sends you messages, and notice what you feel at its outer perimeter. Look around 
<br />
your environment, and see what is located at that boundary edge, Pay 
<br />
attention to how you feel as your gaze falls on each and every thing around 
<br />
you. 
<br />

<br />
2. As soon as you sense someone might be staring at you who is out of 
<br />
your visual range, stay calm and relaxed and turn around to check to see if 
<br />
you're right. You need only maintain eye contact for a brief moment. Notice if 
<br />
they were within the auric membrane range you established. 
<br />

<br />
3. Keep a mental or written record of how many times you felt that someone 
<br />
was staring at you, and how many times that actually turned out to be true... 
<br />
and how often you also correctly knew where they were physically located. 
<br />

<br />
4. When you try this more than once, notice how you can enhance your 
<br />
accuracy by consciously extending your aura (or sense of personal space) out 
<br />
to where other people are. If you find people aren't staring at you enough for 
<br />
this game to be rewarding, you can make yourself more tempting to stare at by 
<br />
wearing brighter colours or a hat, or changing your hairstyle.
<br />

<br />
 Another way to practice aura manipulation is to feel your own aura around you. Try to see and sense it. Once you have a good grasp of what it is like you can try to shape it. Maybe you could even attempt a psi ball type exercise
<br />

<br />
Health
<br />
Your auric health can be affected by a number of things. The main cause is energy blockages inside the body. Am energy blockage is basically when the flow of energy has stopped and the energy has become stagnant. This can be dangerous if left unchecked. Acupuncture and other such Eastern practices can get rid of blockages. I find it is easier to  do Zhan Zhuang  (standing meditation) or other such exercises which increase the flow of energy and can in fact ?break through? blockages. Direct attacks on the aura can effect ones mental and emotional well being and is a common method of psionic attack.
<br />
 A depleted aura can be a sign and a cause of mental or emotional imbalances.
<br />

<br />
1. Feeling like someone is watching you. 
<br />
2. Acting suddenly out of character; big changes in behaviour. 
<br />
3. Lapses in memory. 
<br />
4. Inexplicable, sudden, profound fatigue and feeling drained. 
<br />
5. Frequent nightmares. 
<br />
6. Recurring or bizarre accidents; string of bad luck. 
<br />
7. Inexplicable negative or obsessive thoughts. 
<br />
8. Sudden illnesses, aches, and pains. 
<br />
9. Dramatic loss in self confidence. 
<br />
10. Irrational and sudden emotional swings.
<br />

<br />
Lack of magnesium can result in irritability, anxiety and muscle spasms. This also has an effect on the aura.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Auric Bath
<br />
Take a bath with two cups of baking soda and one cup of salt to help your aura. If you don't have a bathtub, you can achieve the same restorative effects by putting a mixture of baking soda and salt in a plastic bowl or glass, and showering with it. Take care to rub the powdery mix over every part of your body. These types of salt baths are usually used for detoxification and provide magnesium supplements. Lack of magnesium can result in irritability, anxiety and muscle spasms.
<br />

<br />

<br />
3. When you emerge from the bath or shower, get a fresh glass of drinking water, Intend it to help cleanse your system. You may want to say a quick chant
<br />
4. Visualize a grounding cord to the centre of the earth, which will now carry away all extraneous energy.
<br />
5. Try to envision your aura and wherever you sense a flaw direct healing energy to that spot. 
<br />

<br />
1.	Ground - Imagine a cord of light energy energy running from the base of your spine down into the centre of the earth. Through this energetic cord, release all extraneous thought-forms from your field down to the earth. Whatever you are worried or upset about can safely be forgotten now. Be assured that everything you need to remember in the future, you will be reminded of. You can safely let it all go right now. 
<br />

<br />
2. Visualize Yourself Bathed in White Light - Allow yourself to be surrounded and bathed in divine white light of love, temporarily washing out your auric colours so you may look through a clear lens into the world. This white aura offers you a much more accurate perspective on what is actually going on right now. 
<br />

<br />
3. Swirl a Clearing Tornado - If you can see or feel otherwise sense remaining energies that don't belong in your space, imagine a great swirling tornado of cleansing energy. This storm removes remaining doubts, fears, insecurities, grudges, and angst. As it swirls around you, it leaves your energy and the white light energy intact and collects all extraneous energy, taking it away from you as it leaves. 
<br />

<br />
4. Vacuum Up any Crumbs - If you still sense some remaining dark spots of unwanted negativity, imagine a giant vacuum cleaner plugged into the centre of the earth, sucking up every last remaining crumb of unwanted &quot;stuff.&quot; You are now completely clear, and ready to accurately assess the situation you as in as what it is--not what you perceive it to be through false colouring.
<br />

<br />
 These are of course just suggested visualizations/associations that work for me.
