			Hi, I wanted to stop by to share a program with you guys that I have recently written. It is a simple test using a set of cards designed by Karl Zener for testing extra sensory perception.
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://skepdic.com/zener.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://skepdic.com/zener.html</a>
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://www.eiksoft.com/gaz/esp1.png" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.eiksoft.com/eik/ccount/click.php?id=28" target="_blank" class="postlink">Download</a> 151kb
<br />

<br />
Most everyone who has tested the program tells me that they do better than the probable average. One person even thought that the program was a trick, that I had coded it so it would switch the cards to be the one they had chosen. Personally I have chosen the correct card as many as eight times in a row, and I believe there is definitely more at work than just random coincidence. Please give the program a try and let me know what you think.
<br />

			Works fine for me, not sure what the problem is. Here's a direct one:

Oh yea, I'd also like to add that if anyone has any ideas for experiments that they would like to see, I would be happy to code them for you. Just let me know <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I have no psychic power according to this,
<br />
it should depend on the program works, does it pick out
<br />
what the cards are <span style="text-decoration: underline">when I click</span>, or does it pick
<br />
it out immediately after my last draw? It can confuse
<br />
the mind if you do not know which one it's doing.
<br />
Also, maybe you could have it play a sharp sound
<br />
when it gets an answer right,  so the nerves would be
<br />
more involved.

@conaner: The next card is randomly selected using the Mersenne Twister number generator as soon as the cards are drawn, not when you click.
<br />

I have updated the program to produce a 2000hz tone for 100 milliseconds from the PC speaker when the correct card is chosen.

			Isn't this more a test of your PK abilities than your telepathy?  Computers can't generate thoughts.  Since the cards are chosen by a random number generator, you are more likely to get an answer correct by:
<br />

<br />
1) choosing a card, and then attempting to force the RNG to pick the card you were thinking of.
<br />
2) chance.
<br />

<br />
It would be interesting to see if PK affects the program at all.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			@conaner: Yes, it's the same link. Note that it uses the PC speaker, not your stereo speakers. Some computers don't have one or they have been disabled. To test if you have PC speaker functionality:
<br />

<br />
1) Go to the start menu
<br />
2) Go to 'Run'
<br />
3) Type 'cmd', then hit enter
<br />
4) Hold control and hit G
<br />
5) Press enter. You should hear a beep.
<br />

<br />
@Woodpecker: It's an extra sensory perception test. ESP should have an affect on all things in existence, electronic or otherwise.

This wouldn't be a test of telepathy at all, since telepathy requires two people, or rather, two brains/minds.  PK would definitely have an effect since this program utilizes a random number generator.  I suppose though that this program is a test for general clairvoyance.

			@conaner: It's written in a little known language called BlitzMax, and uses DirectX7 as a renderer, though you can use OpenGL too. The source code to the program is included (esp.bmx) if you're interested in seeing how it works. I'll find a high pitch sound in WAV format and implement it later, as the PC speaker is pretty outdated.

			if I might make a suggestion. Occasionally I can get extremily bad results for a long time. Try and program the gage to realize when the person is still performing psi, but thinking it is all fake. so if a person say got 1 right and 100 wrong the program would go. Impossible and start adding to the psychic meter or somthing. Just a thought could be interesting.

first attempt at program while trying. I got the line that far before I started failing. Although my abilty of concentration is getting better. Normally I can only make the first guess with these kind of things.
