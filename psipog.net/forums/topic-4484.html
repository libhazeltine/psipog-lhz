			I know that when you workout muscles that they can take from 5-10 days to fully recover. And to get the most out of each workout you need the muscles to 100% recover or risk overtraining.
<br />

<br />
Is that the same for Psi? And if so how many days does your body need to recover from a serious psi-workout session? Is it just a matter of a good nights sleep, or is more time needed?
<br />

<br />
Thanx-

			A good night sleep, a little choclate and a few strawberries and a cup of coffee should do the trick. Choclate is basically brain food, helps you focus, strawberries are just plain good and effect your amount of energy and coffee is just to get you going in the morning. There have been some cases where coffee hightens your telepathic ability.

			Full nights rest does it for me.  I rip up my psionic muscles everyday, and the next day they are stronger, everytime.  It doesn't take much <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			While others are giving a hard, fast answer, I would rather recommend &quot;whatever feels right.&quot; Depending on the magnitude of the working, it can take several days to recover. I've burned myself out such that it's taken weeks to recover!
<br />

<br />
Damage to the energy system needs to be addressed, and strain damage takes time to heal. Pushing the system while it is damaged from strain can reinforce the damage, which can result in it permanentizing and then having negative effects on health.
<br />

<br />
It is important to be careful and moderate in psionic work - pushing to the point of collapse is less fun in retrospect. To help prevent burnout and negative side effects, keep some orange juice handy, and the &quot;brain food&quot; mentioned above. Anything with potassium and proteins is normally good for energetic practice, but the more conventionally 'healthy' the better. Don't practice while you're sick, and quit when you start feeling the physiological indicators that you're pushing too hard (lightheadedness, confusion, dizziness, stomach illness, and so further).

Ahhh, one more excuse to eat chocolate...........I have found that a good meal, a lie-down on the couch, and a good 2 hours rest is all that is needed.  If you hurt yourself during a session (i.e. headache), wait at least a day (or longer) before trying again.  And as for the coffee thing, I have never tried coffee (any further than Coffee Crisp, mmmmmmmm.....) so I wouldn't know.  Just make sure you are sound of mind and body before each session.

			I love coffee crisp.  Everytime I go to canada I get them.  Anyways, it is different for everyone.  I agree with what feels right, and I would suggest a full nights sleep.
