Wow you say that with so much assurance. Do/did you work there? Were you made to promise you couldn't shared confidential information? Until you can answer those questions with a yes I'll take what you and other people are saying to be totally and absolutely true.

			Interesting question: Does the government know?  Well, I cannot speak of certainties, however I can share what I have learned, thus far.
<br />

<br />
The government, largely, does not know about psionics; the only people who know about psionics, in government, are those who need to know.  everyone else is outside the &quot;circle of trust&quot; (...including the president[s]/premier[s]), so to speak...and for good reason.
<br />

<br />
Now, it is a fact that people &quot;know&quot; about psionics in the government; there have been enough declassified portfolios on the topic in the past few years to show this, along with continous (monetary) support being given to those institutions which, even today, are still studying it (psionics)...even though these same government groups also compose the public's &quot;professional debunkers&quot;.  
<br />

<br />
The question now is: What, exactly, is psionics being used for, if being used at all?  
<br />

<br />
...Silence.
<br />

<br />
So, in conclusion to the above thought(s), not everyone in government &quot;knows&quot;.
<br />

<br />
As for possible &quot;secret technology&quot;...well, this shouldn't really come as a surpise to anyone; let us remember the &quot;manhattan project&quot;.  However, once again, what exactly &quot;it&quot; is being used for is in question (if there even is any new technology, as we are lead to believe).
<br />

<br />
...Another useless cellphone, anyone? (comes with a built in microwave!)
<br />

<br />
Lastly, I will touch on the &quot;famous&quot; Area 51.  Being as &quot;famous&quot; as it is, do you really think they would hide anything there?  After all, Area 51 isn't exactly a &quot;secret&quot; anymore.  It is, most likely these days, a decoy.
<br />

<br />
As for ET's....that is a whole other ballgame and I'll leave that alone for now.
<br />

<br />
The one thing about conspiracy theory(ies) is that it is a game, largely, of manipulation, &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot;, illusion, et al; I learned this long ago when I had become interested in it for a time (I am not anymore; alot of it is, truthfully, BS).  There are some legit people/theories, but there are also &quot;professional&quot; liars at work.
<br />

<br />
Anways, that is about all I have to say about that.  Oh, and before I end this post...as per locating Osama; I feel they are not really trying too hard.  A few years back I attempted my own psionic search for the guy.  Turns out, a few years back anyways, he was in some city in Pakistan (according to my efforts).  Of course...I could have been wrong, I recognize that fact.
<br />

<br />
That is about it...enjoy the post.
<br />

<br />
With much respect...
<br />

<br />
Peace

			I figured asking if the government knows about psionics would be a relatively straightforward &quot;yes&quot; since there are declassified documents about Stargate, Grill Flame, and the 20 some-odd other names the project was under.
<br />

<br />
There's always going to be secret technology for security purposes.  If we're developing a new spy plane or other misc. weapon that will help us in a potential war or other conflict, then secrecy is a must so the weapon retains it's superiority.  Once a secret weapon is no longer secret, the enemy or whoever can engineer defense to counteract the specific weapon.  This is national security 101.
<br />

<br />
I think a fairly logical explanation for UFO sightings near area 51 would be that these UFO's are the next generation in flight, and our government has been working on them and test flying them for many years now.  Surely you'd want to build a classified aircraft in a secure air force base.
<br />

<br />
The problem with conspiracy theories is not the &quot;games of manipulation&quot; that are being played, but instead the massive jumps in logic and inappropriate associating or linking of facts to produce what seems like a coherent theory with verifiable evidence.  Therein lies the real smoke and mirrors.  I'm sure that some conspiracy theories have a basis in truth, but they get wildly distorted, and any conspiracy theory that has enough truth to it is eventually exposed as real (because of the verifiable evidence), in which case it is no longer a conspiracy theory, but instead a fact.

			All in all, I agree with everything you have said, however, I would like to &quot;open&quot; things up a little more.
<br />

<br />
First, on &quot;secret&quot; technology: I feel, as I am sure you do and many others as well, that &quot;newer&quot; technology is inevitable in our particular societal complex, and it is especially likely that the first of those new technologies will be manufactured/employed by the military (and thus not necessarily known to other levels of government...need to know basis).  However, one thought I would like to pose is this:  There are, inevitably, newer technologies...however, the question now is: how advanced is it, exactly?
<br />

<br />
Do we really believe that the government (or, more specifically, those in &quot;the know&quot;) actually are capable of creating things such as &quot;sight invisible&quot; craft, and whatnot?  I'm honestly not sure either way; I'm not in &quot;the know&quot;, I'll admit.  However, I feel we tend to, as a peoples, extend our government(s) a little too much credit in these regards.
<br />

<br />
Regardless of whether the government(s) can/cannot do what we think they can/cannot do, there is also the issue of &quot;origins&quot;; where did these idea(s) [for &quot;advanced&quot; technologies] come from, exactly?  Maybe it isn't &quot;our own&quot; technology after all.  Of course, I will stress this particular thought is a matter of speculation (and only speculation) in an attempt to recognize possibilities, however &quot;unsavoury&quot; they may be to others.       
<br />

<br />
...Of course, I could be completely wrong...
<br />

<br />
Who knows?
<br />

<br />
This then answers (without my &quot;actual&quot; answering) the thought about Area 51 and the UFO's located nearby; are we really sure &quot;all&quot; that phenomena is attributable to our government(s) &quot;awesomely advanced&quot; technological prowess?
<br />

<br />
Lastly then is the discussion on conspiracy theories, in general.  I feel I may have to elaborate on what I ment by:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">The one thing about conspiracy theory(ies) is that it is a game, largely, of manipulation, &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot;, illusion, et al</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
First of all, I must say I do agree with what you have said concerning conpiracy theory(ies); people do tend to make, as you said:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">massive jumps in logic and inappropriate associating or linking of facts to produce what seems like a coherent theory with verifiable evidence</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
However, there is the &quot;something&quot; that you seem to have missed in my posting concerning &quot;professional&quot; liars.  In this, I mean that not everything that is &quot;wrong&quot; about a conspiracy theory is attributable to &quot;some dumb fuck&quot;, so to speak (no offence ment to anyone out there who might consider themselves &quot;dumb fucks&quot;).  Consider the study of psionics as an example (again):
<br />

<br />
There are an number of institutions who are, and have been, studying the nature of psionics...and for quite some time.  It is verifiable that psionics actually works to some degree, anyways.  Now, of course, the government(s), or more specifically, those in &quot;the know&quot;, fund special research programs at/with these various institutions related to psionics; verifiable, again.  However, the thing is, even though the results that the programs yeild are positive, the groups involved (one such being the CIA [verifiable through released documents]) have this tendency to say the program(s) were a &quot;flop&quot;, so to speak.  So, what does this mean?  If we know, from experience, that psionics works...then what is it?
<br />

<br />
There are people paid to BS.
<br />

<br />
In essence then, what I am saying is: not all the problems in a conspiracy theory are related to &quot;honest&quot; accidents, mental disorders, et al. but also to paid, &quot;professional liars&quot;.
<br />

<br />
As well, before I end this reply, I would like to pose a question regarding the following statement:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">any conspiracy theory that has enough truth to it is eventually exposed as real (because of the verifiable evidence)</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Don't you feel this &quot;answer&quot; is just a tad too simple?
<br />

<br />
Anyways, that about wraps up this posting.
<br />

<br />
With much respect,
<br />

<br />
Peace
<br />

			Answering how advanced secret technology is, as I've mentioned before, isn't possible without making the technology un-secret.  
<br />

<br />
I think that it would be a safe assumption that our government could be and is capable of the technology you listed.  I think many people would agree that if you throw enough money and intelligent minds at a problem (two things which the government has much of) a solution will be found.
<br />

<br />
Certainly there is the hypothesis that, given the Roswell crash incident as a real and verifiable event, our government was able to obtain alien technology and reverse engineer it.  Some would argue that this is one of the major reasons for the technology boom in the 40's and 50's.  However, I don't think that we have to jump to that conclusion to explain seemingly sudden jumps in technology.  I believe that a lot of people have a pessimistic attitude toward our species' intelligence.  Even though we are the smartest creatures on this earth, we still can't convince ourselves that we're capable of engineering zero-gravity or invisibility technology.
<br />

<br />
In reference to the CIA acting as some sort of &quot;professional liar&quot; about their ESP programs, I think that a lot of people misunderstand the spirit with which they denounce their own research findings.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I've come to understand they considered their experimentation weak or worthless not because they didn't witness any anomalous effects, but because in the grand scheme of the program's intended focus, it didn't reach its goals.  These goals were essentially to train people to become psychic spies, and quite frankly the work done by the multitude of the remote viewers was hit or miss.  Sure there were some amazing remote viewers in the program who defied traditonal thinking about clairvoyance, but think of it this way: would you want our government using a psychic, who has good days and bad days, or advanced satellite imaging, which never has a bad day?
<br />

<br />
I think it's more about practicality rather than whether or not ESP is a reality, at least in the scenario I'm describing.  So when you say the program's yields were positive, I think you're using the term &quot;positive&quot; to mean they found some verifiable proof of ESP.  That's all fine and well, but this is the US military, and if it doesn't work the way we want it to or at the capacity we want it to (barring recent snafus, of course), it'll get tossed out the window.
<br />

<br />
I don't think these people are paid to BS, I think they're paid to tell it how it is, and the way that it stands now, ESP research is under-funded and under-publicized.  The perceived benefits of breakthrough research in psionics aren't nearly as high as in other fields (such as physics or medicine), so the motivation for serious researchers or institutions to spend money on it just isn't there.  That's why you have a lot of independent groups who do research, and then they get ridiculed for poor research design or ignored because they're not well established.  Is this reaction to ESP researchers fair?  No, not at all.  Is it justifiable?  Yes.

Not really.  I think it's pretty self-evident and self-explanatory.  A theory is a theory, regardless of whether or not it carries the prefix &quot;conspiracy&quot;.

I think that certainly is true, as in the past we put a whole lot of rocket scientists in a room and invent NASA and tell them to shoot for the moon. Who knew we would get there? Sure it was a riskly (and slightly dangerous knowing Russia was ahead of us) but we got there didn't we?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

Some good points I also agree with, as I read in some of my books that we are in the golden age of astnromny. The oldest science to mankind and now it is reaching out. I can't really blame people for thinking that way, we have done bad things in the past and doing wrost things today with what we have.

			Everyone knows about the government involvement. It's no big deal. Psi is a lot more prominent than you think in people. Most people think they should hide real abilities or even interest because it is &quot;weird.&quot; The government defiently has atleast looked into it. That's all the concrete evidence I can find. After that some people say that they used it and some people say they didn't find proof. I do also believe that the russians used it more because our comrades are smarter than americans.

I talk about a few of my dreams, but I think it was my nightmares that scared my teammates. Also I think my team leader who was catholic wanted me gone or something. Just after I told him I was going to a Wicken religionish thing just to see whats there he got sort of nerves and tried to talk me out of it.
<br />

<br />
I tend to anaglize my dreams to better understand my subconiouse so I already know how this dream was created and how the shadows were also. I don't remmeber my dreams but I do remember one. I fingure out that the shadows that haunted me were from stress and confusement, but what puzzled me is that I had these dreams far before boot camp, infact I sleep in boot rather well (well except one but I already put it up in the dream forum a while ago). I have more interesting dreams but this one scared them.
<br />

<br />
I was dreaming I was in a theater, not one of them stupid movie theaters but a big beatiful oprea theater. I was a fully grown man with formal cloths while I walked down the walkway having people talking to me. I only remember them saying my name, they were calling me &quot;Professor Fletcher (last name)&quot;. I tend to have a high IQ and a interest in Phyics and I always seem to picture myself with slightly more understanding then others. I don't like this feeling so I'm a little surpise my subcoiunse did this. Next to me was my wife, who during the whole dream I couldnt once look at her face no manner how much it pained me. I fingure that the reason why I couldnt look at her face because I have no love in my life yet so there is no spot to fill. While I was walking down to my set there was a small shadow behind me, that of a child. This shadow had the full 3D dimensional form of any other shadow I saw in my other dreams, it had no face but it has glowing white eyes. The shadow was annoying it was copying my foot steps, I yelled at it and it ran away. I have some good thoughts of this shadow but none feel like the right answer. I sat down in my set next to my wife. I look up at this seems to be a crappy made machine. I picture that the reason why it was crappy because I picture it crappy. There was a man in a white coat up there saying &quot;I give you immortality!&quot;. I was discgusted at the hearing of that word. There was a flash of lighting from the machine he stand under and his body fell and hit onto the ground....dead....But there was a new body from where he stand, a shadow like body but adult size. The shadow look at me with his anrgy white eyes...behind me I heard a voice of a man from the backset. He told me &quot;Your friend is anrgy at you...he..wants to hurt you.
<br />

Then I woke up, I know most of this dream some of which I didn't say but its clear (for some).

That was my fault I was sort of talking about non psi ways. and about trieing to reveal the turth to the outside. Then again there are other ways.
<br />

<br />
And about that website I shown up. I was trying to point out the story of nubria (or spelled like something else) the 10th planet or 13th planet if you read some of the story....of the ancient sumerians or somethng like that. I wanted you to react to that not the government thing.
