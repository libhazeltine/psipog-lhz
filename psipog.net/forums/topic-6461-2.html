This would be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man" target="_blank" class="postlink">straw man fallacy.</a> That said, &quot;chemicals... bouncing around your [central nervous] system and your spine&quot; are responsible for quite a lot of how and what you think and feel.

Did I say that it couldn't? I said that creating a &quot;loving energy&quot; wasn't possible. A &quot;loving energy&quot; means a whole new kind or type of energy. I simply believe that energy is energy is energy, and it certainly doesn't embody emotions.

Whoa there buddy, I didn't say that. I know that it's possible to create or enhance others' thoughts or emotions; being a natural empath gives me a little bit of insight into that. Now, I don't practice any &quot;sending&quot; of emotions, because I feel that it is ethically wrong. Emotions are serious and personal business; it's not right of anyone to psionically interfere with others' emotions without their explicit permission.
<br />

<br />
What I <span style="font-style: italic">did</span> say - and I've repeated it above as well - is that you can't create &quot;love energy&quot; or somehow embue energy with love and change it from &quot;normal&quot; energy. <a href="http://www.care2.com/channels/solutions/bms/1580" target="_blank" class="postlink">See this article</a> and many of the thousands of others like it available online to see what I'm 'calling bullshit' on.

1) I'm about as sure of this as of anything.
<br />

<br />
2) I hate putting an &quot;in my opinion&quot; in front of every sentence I say or write. It should be obvious that everything I say is my opinion, unless I state otherwise.

<br />

<br />
You need to figure out what you're talking about. You've bounced from &quot;love energy&quot; to empathic suggestion to meaningful emotions. Just because they all share the word &quot;love&quot; doesn't make them the same. For your information, love has a lot of meaning to me too.

Again, I suppose it would be possible with practice to empathically/telepathically suggest love (the emotion) to someone. I've never called psionics useless (though some branches of it seem to have no practical use); I don't think that psionics can &quot;give&quot; emotions, whatever that means.
<br />

<br />
Also, psionics isn't selfish; people are selfish.

Don't worry, I realized that it's not worth it to get angry at people over the Internet. Do your worst. You might want to review your posts before you click &quot;submit&quot; in order to make sure that they make sense; &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; writing may be wonderful for your personal diary, but it's not really the appropriate format for posting on a forum.

And I see people who insist that we be open and accepting of whatever hare-brained ideas someone has as having less sense than the purveyor of the ideas himself. <span style="font-style: italic">Especially</span> when they should know better.

<br />

<br />
A deep &quot;no no&quot; to the word &quot;love&quot;? Hardly. However, the word &quot;love&quot; has so many meanings that it's ambiguous when used pretty much anywhere. (In fact, it's a theory of mine that the word &quot;love&quot; having so many meanings - from &quot;I love my peas&quot; to &quot;I love my husband&quot; and everything in between - is one of the reasons that we see so many failed relationships. But that's neither here nor there.) To make it worse, &quot;love&quot; has been hijacked by the white-lights-and-fluffy-bunnies crowd and made into an entire new concept; thus, when I see someone writing things like &quot;loving energy&quot; and &quot;create a powerful loving feeling&quot;, it sends up big red flags.

Look, you best of all should know how I work. I call it like I see it, and in this case, I see fluff. I don't mince words to avoid offending some sheltered tween who hasn't learned to separate reasonable propositions from silly ones, and hasn't grown a thick skin yet either.
<br />

<br />
Personally, my estimate is that Tankdown is a male between the ages of 13 and 15, when raging hormones play hell with one's emotions.

He's also making a fool of himself in a place that, in its prime, would have shut this thread down long ago. The fact is, if you want to talk about love energy and universal consciousness and the like, there are places for that. This... is not one of them. Sorry.

Again, it seems that your point of view is that we must accept and consider all ideas, however - well, fluffy - they are. I reject that point of view wholeheartedly. If someone has made some uber-&quot;New Age&quot; post about love energy, I'm going to call him out on it. I'm certainly not trying to censor anyone here - but I am defending my right to criticize and post contrary to fluff-shit like this.

Are you the guy who once said that he can give women orgasms with his mind? Oh wait, no, that was someone else. That guy really intrigued me with his special abilities...

EDIT: I tried looking for his post, but no luck. Sorry guys...

eh I've nothing against telepathic suggestion and I think it's very possible to make someone like you.  I don't really like doing that very much because it doesn't seem right.  But I still get girls to notice me with psi, just not force it too much.   
<br />

<br />
All other Telepathic suggestions don't bother me, i think I have the right to do what I want with psi seeing as how I've worked for it.

			I think you didn't actually use empathy on that girl bladey. I think since you thought you were doing that you had more confidence or were more at ease and it worked better.

No, it was actually a guy who posted in the &quot;Hello and Goodbye&quot; section. It was just one of the things he could do, and he told us about it. I asked many questions too.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
