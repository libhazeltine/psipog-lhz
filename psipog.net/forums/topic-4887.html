			I was wondering if I actually making psi balls or is just my mind playing tricks. Im new too this. Ok so I close my eyes and I visulaze a single drop of water falling into a body of water and making ripples. From their I visualze water entering my body, going through my arms, and into the ball. After 2 minutes of this I start to feel something in my hand that feels like a ball. I can rub it a little but to much and it falls apart. I cant change heat. I also feel a magnetic pull at the beginning. Am I doing it?

			It does sound like you are indeed making a psi ball, from the feelings you have described.  Regardless of the visualizations you use, as long as you feel it, it should be there.  Whatever visualization works for you is best.

			It depends. You can make more, and chuck them at people, or you could work on something constructive. I'd suggest learning to program, and program one to do something simple, like follow someone around and make their ears cold, or something that would verify that they are doing what you want them to do.

			Well right now I set one down and picked it up. I threw it like a boomerang and caught it. I let it go. But I felt like it was still in my hands. Same as where I set it I felt like when I went there I picked something up. Could it just be my mind making me thinking Im creating one? (I totally believe but I not 100% Im doing it, my mind is very manuplitive)

			If you didnt make it go anywhere when you let go, then it probably just stayed in your hand. They don't really do anything unless you tell them to.

			There is. Use Baka's psi ball test. Program it to be magnetic, and put it to your monitor. If it turns the screen colors, then it worked.
<br />

You can degause to reset your monitor.

			Then maybe you need to work on your programing, or the strength of you psi ball, or both.
<br />

<br />
Granted, it is hard to affect the physical with psi, this test is the best one I can see that shows physical results.

			Yeah, it turned a circular area on my computer purple. And as you practice, you will be able to transmit more energy into the psi ball, yes.
<br />

<br />
I've only been practicing for 5 days, and I can make an okay psi ball. It won't win any prizes, but it's good enough for me at this stage in my training.
