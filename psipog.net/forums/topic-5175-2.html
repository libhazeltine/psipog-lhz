			If you truly do not believe that PK will make a psiwheel move, then why are you here?  I can see from your post in the Hello/Goodbye Forum that you did some kind of clairvoyance, so what is to stop you from believing in other psionic abilities.  Also, I might add that that site has been widely criticized around these forums.

You obviously don't understand &quot;clairvoyance&quot;. A psi wheel is a piece of paper, How can it NOT exist?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

Are you typing blindfolded without thinking, or what?

You're a Dick. I have no younger siblings, or a working fan. If you try Psionics for yourself, and dont succeed, you're obviously not trying hard enough. The best proof for a skeptic is still for them to try it themselves.
