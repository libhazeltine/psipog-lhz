			Before I start this post, I am aware of the rules reguarding drugs and medical advice. I don't intend to advocate the usage of the things I intend to discuss, nor do I intend to suggest anything as being medically true or advisable. I only intend to discuss some things. That is as far as this thread will go.
<br />

<br />
OK. Psychopharmaceuticals. What are they? They're drugs that affect your brain, which technically includes everything. But the things I intend to discuss are made specifically for the brain and nothing else.
<br />

<br />
In March of this year, I began taking SSRI medication for a psychiatric condition. SSRI stands for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor. As you probably know, serotonin is an important neurotransmitter. Anyway, the SSRI's purpose is to increase the absorption of serotonin in the brain by blocking it's passage through neural synapses (or something backwards-sounding like that). Sounds confusing, I know, but it definitely does it's job. (By now, you've probably discovered that SSRIs are antidepressants. Yes, I take antidepressants. It's not a big deal. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />) In the past couple of weeks, I've begun to notice an increase in my mental sensory. If I try hard enough, I can <span style="font-style: italic">feel</span> an object mentally. I think it's a result of the increase of serotonin absorption in my brain. I could be wrong, of course, but I really do think that by taking SSRI medication for an extended period of time and consequently having a higher concentration of serotonin in my brain, I've developed a slightly higher affinity for &quot;psionic&quot; energy.
<br />

<br />
As a quick sidenote, I honestly consider psionic energy to be manipulation of the electric field around and within the body. That's just my personal take on it. I'm not suggesting that it's the one final Truth, but it works for me. A quick trip through Wikipedia topics like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics" target="_blank" class="postlink">biophysics</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology" target="_blank" class="postlink">electrophysiology</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential" target="_blank" class="postlink">action potential</a> should give a decent understanding of how electricity works within the body on the cellular level...
<br />

<br />
Anyway, as anticlimactic as it seems, I was just wondering if anyone else has ever noticed a difference in their mental perception as I've described in this post as a result of taking psychopharmaceuticals (specifically SSRIs)? It seems like common sense that more neurotransmitters equals more psionic potential, but I just wanted to put the idea out here and see where it goes. Thanks!

			When we get the feeling of 'Love', that is a physical dump of seratonin in the brain. That is the chemical that actually gives us the sensation.
<br />

<br />
Love is the unifying and infinite force in the universe. There truely is, only Love (I'm smart, and snagged it as my nickname =D )
<br />

<br />
I would imagine, since the SSRI's are allowing/increasing your intake of seratonin, you are staying in a more relaxed, loving state; though it may not be a lovey-dovey state.
<br />

<br />
Emotions are conceptual idea's tied with a chemical release. If you are experiencing heighted sensual awareness by taking these SSRI's, I wouldn't disclaim that at all. When we are in a state of Love, of giving, of kindness, our energy (psi) awareness is much greater. To do energy healing work on others, we try and maintain this state, along with a state of groundedness.
<br />

<br />
I would highly recomend discontinuing the use of all SSRI's and anti-depressants you are taking. Unless you were born with fetal-alcohol syndrome, or some other documented dis-ease, how you feel is truely all in your head. It will be difficult at first, but the longer you change your perception of reality by 'dumbing it down' with anti-depressants, the worse it will become. You will need more/different pills to maintain the same (or altered) state of reality. The human body was not designed to be infected with chemicals to make us 'feel better'. I have seen the degeneration of many people who have taken these 'magic pills'.
<br />

<br />
If you wish to increase the production of seratonin in your brain, try natural methods; bannanas and turkey both have higher levels of 5-HTP (5-HydroxyTryptophan) which is the precursor to seratonin production.
<br />
You can also get 5-HTP from your local vitamin store (usually behind the counter) in a concentrated pill form - this is completely homeopathic, extracted from plants, and there are no chemicals involved. You may notice that these can be far more powerful, and in no way physcially addicting, that any perscribed pills.
<br />

<br />
You are correct, the energy that can be used for healing, psi balls, whatever other psi-stuff you wanna do, not only resides in the space around you, but everywhere. You have your own 'energy bubble' that surrounds you. The Earth has her own energy field, so do animals, rocks, and so on. 
<br />

<br />
When you create a psi-ball, or do an energy healing, you are pulling the energy from wherever you know it to be. If you are using your own energy, it can become very draining. The easiest thing to do is to draw on the &quot;universal energy&quot;. This is the energy that ties the Universe together. It is infinite in its capcaity, and is there for the tapping.

			Thank you for your input, only_love. I have considered homeopathic remedies for my psychiatric condition, but I prefer things proven to work (by standardization). However, I do not want this thread to become a discussion of my condition. I know it seems hard to dodge it, but it is possible being as the topic is the medication and its potential psionic effects rather than the condition it treats.
<br />

<br />
And as far as whether or not the human body was meant for &quot;those chemicals&quot;, I would respond saying that it was not meant for the stress that it is exposed to everyday in life in today`s world. Plus, all sorts of chemicals go into our bodies everyday that degrade it even more so than taking a pill. I appreciate the love theory, but I don`t particularly base my life on it.
<br />

<br />
Also, I think dopamine is the chemical released when one experiences love, not serotonin...Not majorly, at least. I could be wrong, though. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			Sweet. My topic.
<br />

<br />
I'm a certified pharmacy technician and I study psychopharmacology as a hobby. My specialization of knowledge is primarily in psychomotor stimulants and SSRIs, but I'm generally familiar with the full gamut of prescription psychiatric medications.
<br />

<br />
To be accurate, SSRIs by blocking the reuptake of serotonin at the synaptic level, thereby maintaining higher levels in the synapse and allowing for effectively greater amounts of serotonin to be used by the brain without the brain actually generating more. There aren't &quot;more neurotransmitters&quot; <span style="font-style: italic">per se</span>, rather, you've simply increased the amount of time that the 5-HT remains in the synapse, and thus increased the likelihood and frequency of bonding with the receptor sites.
<br />

<br />
As far as your understanding of bioenergetics, this is discussed at some length in my book, which is in my sig. The chapter in question is actually posted on the Psion Guild forums, <a href="http://www.psionguild.org/psionguildforum/viewtopic.php?t=382" target="_blank" class="postlink">here.</a>
<br />

<br />
This theory was adapted from my learning from Rainsong as well as my studies of psychology, with an emphasis on psychophysiology and neuropsychology.
<br />

<br />
One of the common &quot;lay people&quot; mistakes I'm seeing here is the direct association of any neurotransmitter with any emotion. Neither dopamine nor serotonin directly cause emotion - it's where they are released, in what quantities, that brings about a result. Dopamine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in most of the prefrontal cortex as well as in muscles, used to refine motor control and inhibit superfluous neuronal action in the higher brain. However, it also tends to induce subjective feelings of euphoria. It is responsible for euphoric &quot;high&quot; of psychomotor stimulants, as well as the &quot;numb&quot; that the same drugs induce in people with attentional deficit-hyperactivity disorder (itself believed to be the result of dopaminergic downregulation in the prefrontal cortex).
<br />

<br />
Serotonin is largely responsible for feelings of &quot;satiation.&quot; It somewhat affects sleep, though not nearly to the degree of melatonin. It regulates hunger to a certain degree, and can cause drowsiness. It can also cause mood stability, though in and of itself I don't believe it's responsible for &quot;happiness&quot; so much as &quot;satiation&quot; or a feeling of being &quot;satisfied&quot; or &quot;content.&quot;
<br />

<br />
5-HTP is in fact an over the counter serotonin supplement, though it's not &quot;all that.&quot; Rather than acting directly on the neuronal 5-HT levels, 5-HTP is, as the prior poster noted, the chemical precursor to serotonin. However, serotonin tends to have a wide number of effects throughout the entire body - SSRIs rose to where they are because they have far fewer side effects and interactions than other drugs with serotonergic effects.
<br />

<br />
As far as whether or not the body is meant for them...no, not necessarily, but these drugs are manufactured for their effect on the body, and this effect is typically rigorously tested to ensure safety and proper results. The myth that our bodies are, in their natural states, most healthy, is quite pervasive - in fact, the largely unnatural lifestyles we lead, along with many other factors, do cause psychophysiologically generated diseases which most commonly must be treated pharmaceutically in order to achieve complete remission of symptoms.
<br />

<br />
To add my own to the post, I have found psychomotor stimulants tend to have a mildly inhibitory effect on psi production, likely because of the increase of dopamine. They also make it easier for me to ignore telepathy, with the inverse effect of having thoughts <span style="font-style: italic">thud</span> into my brain when I try to focus on incoming signals.
<br />

<br />
As a rule, it is important to discuss with your doctor before beginning to take any psychoactive chemical, as they can have a wide variety of effects, and can interact in a large variety of ways with many other seemingly innocent drugs. <span style="font-style: italic">Always consult your doctor before taking a new medication. <span style="font-weight: bold">Never</span> take a prescription medication without a prescription.</span>

			Thank you, Elliptic, for that very elaborate response. I understood most of it because I, too, have an interest in psychopharmacology, though, not quite as deep as yours. (Just last week, I was looking up the application to be a pharmacy technician in my state. Neat coincidence.) I mainly only research the medications I take or might take, which is why my understanding is quite a bit limited.
<br />

<br />
I have never had a condition that would require a psychomotor stimulant, so I wouldn't be able to compare any results with you, psionic or otherwise. Thank you for the information, though. I appreciate it.
<br />

<br />
And now I shall read the chapter posted on your forum...

			If you're looking into becoming a pharmacy technician, I recommend getting certified by the <a href="http://www.ptcb.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Pharmacy Technician Certification Board</a>. Most states recognize certification such that they will allow you to become licensed without the &quot;trainee&quot; step or taking a licensing test.

			Elliptical: Your chapter on bioenergetics (The Nature of Psi) seems to be a more understandable version of the information within the links I provided in my original post, plus some useful history info. It was a very good read.
<br />

<br />
As for the topic of this thread, I have another potential theory explaining how the usage of SSRIs could possibly increase a person's psionic abilities and perceptions. (I remembered it while considering your chapter, Elliptical.) It's all summed up into one word: neurogenesis. Neurogensis is simply the production of neurons. <a href="http://www.psycheducation.org/mechanism/7Aneurogenesis.htm" target="_blank" class="postlink">Here</a> is a link to a webpage with information relating to how certain psychiatric stresses (anxiety, depression, etc.) can dampen neurogensis, resulting in the production of fewer neurons. (The information on that webpage was gathered and put together by a medical doctor, so it seems credible.) It also contains information about how Prozac/fluoxetine, the first SSRI medication, seems to increase the levels of neurogenesis within the test subjects (rats) because it decreases the psychiatric stresses. Though, it states within the reading that the theory hasn't been fully confirmed nor tested on humans, it still provides slightly more insight into the possibilities of psychopharmaceuticals and their effects on psionics.
<br />

<br />
The neurogenesis it describes would be a perfect explanation for what I've been experiencing as I described it in my original post. Perhaps the SSRIs that I've been taking have increased the production of neurons in my brain, which would follow along with Elliptical's chapter on biogenergetics smoothly. This is getting interesting...
<br />

<br />
Oh, and thank you for the link, Elliptical. I read through the guidebook to certification and found that I'm not quite ready to devote quite so much time and preparation into becoming a certified pharmacy technician <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" /> I could probably memorize lists of medications and their equivalents, plus most of the math used is basic chemistry (which I happen to enjoy), and I have decent people skills, I think, so I probably could pass the exam if I wanted to, but I don't have the time nor money to spend pursueing it at this point in my life. I'm about to start college in the fall for a completely different course of study (chemical engineering), so the pharmacy technician cert wouldn't really help me that much. I had, at one time, intended on going into pharmacology, but I've changed my mind since then. I still sometimes question whether I made the right decision, but I think I'll be content with the decision I've made nonetheless. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

<br />
How serotonine and dopamine works in high amounts:
<br />

<br />
Serotonine = Affection, openness. You feel great, loving and completely forgiving.
<br />
Extacy(MDMA) gives these effects(I haven't tried it and I warn people against it. Just an example as I know a lot about it)
<br />

<br />
Dopamine = Excitement - Gives a feeling of awe, makes you not give a shit, and feel great
<br />
Cocaine gives these effects.(Haven't tried that either!)
<br />

<br />

<br />
PS: Serotonergic and dopaminergic psychedelics works different too. People who uses serotonergic psy. (inhebits the sero.-receptors and puts the user in a &quot;related&quot; state) often reports &quot;discovering&quot; that the universe is made of love and so forth, while dopaminergic psy. makes the user experience such things as &quot;the void&quot;... Makes me think.
<br />

<br />
PS: I do NOT advocate the use of ANY drugs! (I even advocate people to stay away from such things as alcohol, caffeine and nicotine. I do. Yep, I'm boring..)
