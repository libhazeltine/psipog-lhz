			Me and my friend The_Dajs, are also interested in nunjitsu, you know ninja philosophy and methods. Well, we found out ancient meditation positions and so-called fingernittings. It is a pattern in which you put your palms and fingers. For me it really helps to calm down, and channel my energy. It also heped to channel if i meditated first. 
<br />
First day i started to ry to ake psyballs i meditated, with water nittm, calmed myselff down and managed to produce a psiball in 40 cm in diameter, and i colud feel the pressure on my entire palms.
<br />

<br />
please share your prep methods. i'm eager to explore, and to find some new aproaches

			Dude, you really need to work with your spelling and grammar.
<br />

<br />
anyways...
<br />

<br />
I don't do anything but lift my hand(sometimes I don't even do that)....then psiball. I don't do anything fancy. Plain and simple.

			As my dear friend stated, me and him have been reading on to and practicing on Ninjutsu for some time, there are Buddhistic meditation methods (Full Lotus position and the like) but there are also the &quot;FingerKnitting Kanji&quot; Moreover a patterneous hand positions used for meditiation (like ninja seals in Naruto anime), I reccomended him to use the Water Fingerknit because it helps concentrate and calm the mind. There are PDF formats of books on Ninjutsu and these patterns, Sljez should post them anytime soon.

			I apologise about my grammar, but English is not my mother tongue.
<br />

<br />
By the way, I think that meditation isn't something fancy. I mean those methonds were developed in ancient times, when most of european civilizations were still hunting for food, and started to learn how to grow crops.
<br />

<br />
I have to admitt there's something to it. 
<br />
For me as a beginner, I mean I started praticing yeasterday, meditation is crucional. I find that really help if you calm your thoughts, and put a focus on your task, in this case a psyball.
<br />

<br />
Try it once. It can't do you no harm if you try.

			There is the total of 9 hand positions, each having a different effect on the user, and when used properly it can boost your mental and physical readiness.
<br />

<br />
The first one is Rin, increases physical and mental power. To form this mundra place the palms facing, thumbs together, fingers upward. Interlock the fingers above, but extend the middle fingers of both hands and hold them together in front of the chest. Also you have to breathe 1 second inhale 1 second exhale. 
<br />

<br />
The book is called NINJITSU - Ninja Power Of The Mind by Toshitora Yamashiro and you can get a pdf version from the net.

16. I can read shorthand, but I think short handmakes people look fucking stupid.  Oh, I have a rather large vocabulary when it comes to identifying words, but I hardly use &quot;big&quot; words because I enjoy simplisity. I use swear to enforce feeling in my posts, or possibly, to show how pissed I am. Of course to insult someone too.
