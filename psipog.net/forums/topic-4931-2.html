			Hi this is VeRsUaL 
<br />
Hows it going?
<br />

<br />
Well the way my program works is it use's random number's you must influnce the number's. Now your brain somehow already knows how to do it so don't worry about what number it has to be on worry about which way you want it to go . I hope this answer's some questions in this post recently. Also the people who can't download this when you click the click the link ,just enter the 3 code numbers in and click download at the top of the page its that simple . Thanks for all your support.

What i ask myself is that i try to understand how it works.

Does it works like the other tests on internet?

you should create other controls as for the user to be able to start and stop/pause the program when they wish instead of it for randomly starting...

			A thx from the psi-n00b!  But one Q, are you supposed to get a lower percent in the middle?  I was doin' good I think.  My head started to hurt after 5 min. though.  Like a sort of a tensed muscle feel to it.  VeRsUaL, do you have any other programs?  They help me alot. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> So far I have your meditation and this psi-wheel.  Thank you again.

			I just used your program for the first time and it pretty cool, i can see why it would help because its training your mind to do something virtually thats much hard to do in real life, its kinda tricking your brain in thinking it can do something which is very clever and i like it. obviously it will be helpful and im looking forward to other programs, perhaps with some better instructions or features. 
<br />
You could use it as a propper tool, a virtual Psionic training ground, you could be able to put glass bowls over the Psi wheel, change the implement to penci or the weight and difficulty.
<br />
Hope you bring out a new version at some point, good job. Immhotep

			im still confused on how your mind effects the computer
<br />

<br />
its not like flipping a coin and making it come out heads a bunch
<br />
youd have to be influencing electrical current and messages in the computer to influence a random number generator inside a coded program
<br />
and if we dont understand how the computer sends messages or the coding of a program, how are we supposed to effect the on screen numbers?
<br />

<br />
=/
<br />
unless its purely a mental exercise for you to focus with a visual aid of a twitching psi wheel, then i guess it could help
<br />
but i really dont think someone can effect the computer's random number generator

			Your mind doesnt affect the computer that would be dillusional to think that it does, what the program seem to do is trick your mind in to believing that <span style="font-style: italic">it</span> is moving the virtual Psi wheel. 
<br />
What is actually happening is that the computer is creating a simulation which you respond to by thinking you are doing. its all a mind game, you are tricking your mind in to thinking that its doing something, which it is not. by  the mind in to doing something like this virtually and training virtually your prepare the mind to do PK, when you train in the real world the mind will react better to the PK exercises because you will already have done it virtually and therefore have &quot;practice&quot; at it.

 <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> you can affect computers though, most tk tests use random generators and people can affect them. (who told you you cant?)
<br />

<br />
i know some one that could move the arow without touching the mouse.
<br />

<br />
And im sure theres a mod or admin hear that fried there comp i think it was peebrain actualy, but it was ages ago i cant remember. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
so if your logic is that people are dillusional if they think they can affect computers theres alot of dillusional people around hear <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			i meant in relation to this program, the program is random and actually bears no relation to what  your trying to do with the Psi wheel. 
<br />
Sure you can influence computers with tk, im not doubting that but this program doesnt really show that you can, what it shows is a Phi wheel moving clock wise and anti clockwise. The program is about fighting the AI, now without massive computer wizardry knowledge you could not use the mind to do that, its a program that predicts what your doing and responds. its a tool, it is not you influencing the computer, its all you thinking your influencing the computer...niether are any less effective as a tk tool.

			Versual, can you clear something up for me?
<br />
This confuses me somewhat. There are 3 different scores. Left, Center, Right.
<br />
All 3 are different. They don't change in the same way either. When it says 'fight for clockwise', etc, i do and the percentage in the middle goes down.
<br />

<br />
Some feedback: maybe you could put a menu system, and make the scoring a little easier to understand. Also, that PK meter is just a little too colorful/flashy.
<br />

<br />
Nice program though :)
