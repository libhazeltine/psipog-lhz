			for those of you who dont wanna open any new windows i have found this paragraph to explain the above post///
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Hypnagogic State:  What is Consciousness?
<br />

<br />
What raises us above other known sentient beings is our ability to be conscious of our own consciousness. But what does this mean, scientifically?
<br />

<br />
&#65533;It is now widely accepted that all knowledge, from the beginning of time, is available to each of us, an intelligence that is carried at the cellular, subatomic level. Highly evolved individuals who have touched the hem of the eternal and communed with the infinite through their higher consciousness, made that quantum leap but have been unable to transfer their understanding due to limitations imposed by language. Because language is incomplete and fragmentary, merely registering a stage in the average advance beyond the ape mentality. But all of us do have flashes of insight beyond meanings already stabilized in etymology and grammar.&#65533;

Are we sure that we aren't just reading it backwards? maybe the calender was MADE on dec 21 2012 B.C.
<br />

<br />
I wouldnm't put it past us. we HAVE been wrong before, and there are still things about the world and our existence in general that we just haven't figured out yet, like what electrons and protons and neutrons must be made of. maybe the mayans didn't even have B.C. or A.D. they could very well have been working on the calender while they were still around, they could have been around for only 2012 years 12 months and 21 days. although it could also BE the end of the world, I don't know if you've noticed but the earth does seem to be growing unstable. I think thats humanity's fault tho.

			yea exactly, I guess what i was trying to say is not to worry about that. what happens will happen, and there's nothing we can do about it. Unless, you know, we got every psion on earth to admit they're a psion and make an attempt try and stop it but... not only is that a little crazy but damn near impossible and most probably dangerous to the earth and everything else, especially the psions who tried....

<br />
Yes, the end of the &quot;great cycle&quot; as modern day mayan descendants are referring to it as. An end, in my opinion, is also a beginning. Therefore, I agree completely with these statements.
<br />

<br />
My intuition tells me as well that something big is happening, and that it will soon become apparent to all, even those currently blind to it. A new beginning.
<br />

<br />
As to what exactly it will be, I do not know, and can only speculate, as is the case with just about everyone else on the planet.
<br />

<br />
Now, back to the post's original topic and in regards to certain replies, I must say this:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Demons&quot; as far as I am concerned, DO exist. I have experiences that have provided proof, if only to myself, topic experiences included, and I have no doubt that they are around. Whether or not they are demons in the classically accepted sense, I don't know. They could just be beings that tend toward malevolence, and that is something I would refer to as a demon anyway, for lack of a better term.
<br />

<br />
Another quote:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">It is now widely accepted that all knowledge, from the beginning of time, is available to each of us, an intelligence that is carried at the cellular, subatomic level.

<br />
I rather like this statement. I agree with it completely. I have known it intuitively for a very long time, and I keep reading things like this that basically verify my own intuition.
<br />

<br />
In fact, intuition itself is a prime example of this statement. Have any of you ever stopped to consider how you knew this or that, knowing that you've never had any physical encounter with said knowledge?
<br />

<br />
And indeed, language is a very thick barrier. Why else would I refer to what I cannot explain as demons? Simply because the word &quot;demons&quot; carries with it an impression of some kind of dark sentience that is alien to us, which is exactly what I spoke of in the topic. Some of you really must learn to delve deeper into the meaning of others' words, rather than simply seeing the words themselves.
<br />

<br />
There's nothing wrong with thinking to yourself &quot;well, maybe,&quot; or &quot;who knows, anything is possible&quot; or &quot;I wasn't there so i really have no right to make any further assumptions.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I was especially tickled pink at some people saying that I shouldn't assume that it was a demon and rather that it was sleep paralysis, because it's better not to assume too much. ... Wouldn't thinking it was just &quot;sleep paralysis&quot; simply be another assumption? A trade off, not a more reasonable deduction, as a purely scientific mind might put it.
<br />

<br />
I feel that I can decipher my own personal experiences better than anyone else, and THAT is a reasonable assumption, folks.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, out for now.

			I've seen a TV show about dreaming and whatever. Sometimes people wake up, and the hormone that gives you sleep paralasys is still running. You see/hear things that aren't normally there. Some people see demons at the end of their bed with red menacing eyes, but can't run because of the paralasys. I don't think this is the answer, but it seems like a nice addition to the many different factors there are.

			Perhaps those chemical reactions allow you to see things that are there, but normally cannot perceive.
<br />

<br />
Truly, if you want to find a physical explanation for something, chances are you can. Our brains and bodies do exist here on a physical plane of being, after all.
<br />

<br />
However, that doesn't mean that's all there is to it. Many minds will close themselves off to further possibility, refusing to acknowledge all-possibility.

			I think it's your subconscious. The voice seems to cliched to be anything real. There's probably a subtle reason for it but I don't know what it is. The thing about being held down is, like people said, sleep paralysis. You are half awake and still in a state where your subconscious is tricking your conscious mind so since it's not a dream state where it can do whatever it wants it has to make you see things instead. If you hear voices any other time like this then it may be something to be looked into.

			well, first of all, thank you for robbing me of a good 8 hours of sleep.
<br />
second of all, I believe this was a combination of both sleep paralysis and a negative entity.  I would NOT call this a demon, for such an interest in you from a demon would probably prevent you from making a topic about it.
<br />

<br />
I would call this a &quot;Neg&quot; or negative entity.  They are as malevolent as demons, but lack the prowess to do as much damage as said demon might.
<br />

<br />
Negs have the ability to harass, disrupt the flow of energy, cause chronic nightmares, etc.  Demons have the ability to do all previous things and, cause serious disease, multiple personality disorder, hear voices (all the time) internal bleeding, mania, pathological fear of something common or mundane, such as a knife, or electric pencil sharpener. Eventually leading to posession.
<br />

<br />
whatever hit you in the water when you were 10 is a mystery to me. I'll let you decide whatever the hell that was. You also seem to be a hard nut to crack.  If I were you, I would be afraid to swim or eat for very long times.

I looked up the 2012 thing and i read something that said &quot;Scholars have known for decades that the 13-baktun cycle of the Mayan &quot;Long Count&quot; system of timekeeping was set to end precisely on a winter solstice, and that this system was put in place some 2300 years ago.&quot; I have no earthly idea how much of what they say on avatar is true or not but according to it the solstice is supposed to be a time where the line between the physical world and the spiritual world gets thinner until it's only a blur. everything seems sort of connected if you ask me. plus remember that the voice only said it's almost up it didn't say when it started. I was jsut pretty much going off topic.
