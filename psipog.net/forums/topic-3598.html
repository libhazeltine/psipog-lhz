			If it were as simple as blocking out light, we would have advanced stealth camouflage by now.  The fact is, blocking out light will only make you pitch black, not invisible.  In order to be relatively invisible, you would need to divert all light completely around you in order to make it so the light continues as if you were not there.
<br />

<br />
In any case, it might be possible, but I don't think anyone has managed to pull off either of these things, and I am pretty sure the idea was discussed some time before.  Not very likely, considering how very 'easy' it is to move light.

 Would require one hell of a skill..  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />  
<br />
 
<br />
  Now, of course, if you wanted invisiblility, the closest and easiest is to use a cloaking shield. (See Articles section on main page)

			Well.....we're here to discover our abilities. Im sure it's possible. I think i'll try it out. What you guys mean is that i bend light around me, is that right? I think i'll try to do that.

			Yeah you'd have to bend the light rays around you then straighten them back up as they left you..
<br />
There's already a thread the exact same as this me thinks..made not that long ago aswell.

I would suggest much smaller that trying to make yourself invisible...like putting a small construct around a small object.  This way you won't exhaust yourself quickly when practicing.

			That sounds like a good way to start.............i'll try to shield another object and bend light around it.............i'll see what i come up with. If anything comes up, i'll post it here. i hope im not the only one trying this though.

			If you blocked out light, depending on how you do it, you'd either be a blob of pictch-black or you'd be a walking mirror. Neither are that stealthy <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Fatal flaws in both of those options are that if you block out light, it can't get into your eyes so you can't see. If you bend the light, same case. If you wanted to be truly invisible, you'd need to be comfortable with being blind for the same length of time. The only other option is to make yourself partially invisible so you could see. Like you bend 75% of the light around you, the other 25% you let do whatever so you can see. But then you'd be 25% visible, and you could only see 25% as it were.

			now we're just talking about the physical kind of invisibility. 
<br />

<br />
what about the telepathy kind of invisibility.
<br />

<br />
you see the world through your eyes and your brain interprets image and that's how you come to see the world around you. what if you were able to target the part of the brain that interprets images and distrort the image so the person can't see you, thusly making you invisible. 
<br />

<br />
this may be a little tougher depending.......if you're up against a psion.....they might have shields up so that means you must be able to penetrate those shields some way. with normal people, you just have to be strong enough to distort all of their images.
<br />

<br />
then again that is mind manipulation and i dont like to do that very much.

In plain words: NO.  I highly doubt it is possible, if you want to become &quot;invisible&quot; program yourself a cloak shield, which is a combination of energy programming and telepathic suggestion skills. Look it up in the articles.

			Hah, if you can already bend light, it shouldn't be much of a problem to sense your surroundings. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Then again, bending light is a hell of a challenge. Considering the fact that we even don't truly understand what light is.

Dude it's easier than that
<br />
Combine aura vision, talking to your sub-c, and some rv... Still complicated,,,
<br />
Make a construct letting you see through the dark.. thing, if you can bend light you can do this

			I'd have to say, that it's still much more simple to just sense your surroundings. You should really train this skill, comes in handy when it's really dark and you can't find the light switch.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
