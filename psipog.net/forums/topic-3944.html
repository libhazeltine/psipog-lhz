I look at the syringe and thrust it into my arm(it hurt in the dream) and drew it full of blood look at it and slammed back down on the plunger(I got dizzy in the dream)and watch the blood flow through my body as I black out.

Im in a castle. the old rustic kind. with suits of armor against the walls. on the floor lies a long scarlet rug w/ gold trimming. behind me is a solid wall. ahead a long hallway. i walk down the hallway examinig pictures and armor when i reach a dead end. the only thing on the wall is a tall mirror. i begin to panic. i finally relax and place my hands on the mirror as if beaten and wish i were out of the hallway. almost immediately the mirror fades away to a liquid(matrix style).i fall through this liquid mirror and come out in another long hallway.nothing adorns these walls. i walk down to another mirror and &quot;hop&quot; through it. i come out in what appears to be a great hall. something is different about this hall there are people in it. some i recognize as if from some distant relationship some i know closely. some i dont know at all but it appears as if they have been there a long time. they stare at me shocked at seeing me come through what is now a solid wall. i expalin what happened and most believe but the older ones who appear to have been there a while dont. they attempt to rally those others against me but are quickly silenced. they all beg me to help them. i agree. i look around for another mirror but find a hallway instead. and at the end of the hallway is of course a mirror. i take this oppurunity to teach tem to &quot;hop&quot; one by one they try and succeed. i follow. we come out in a hallway. a hallway lined w/mirrors. we unanimously decide to go down the hallway to the end and go through that mirror. but to our surprise there was none just the mirrors on the walls. we counted and there were a mirror per person so we all decide to go partially in and come back out and tell the others what we saw and then decide which mirror to go through. we all get beside our corresponding mirror and count off. we all partially hop through. im halfway in and i get pushed back by my closest friends. when i return back to the hallway i find that the others have as well. we all panic. what do we do. what could we do.

			I've personally never been a big fan of books and things that are on interperating dreams. Some concepts are probably more universal than others however there will always be some differences. You're best bet is to see what they mean to you. For example, I saw a book once that said that swimming in deep water meant you must be feeling &quot;out of your depth&quot; and things in your life are out of control. Thats fine for some people, however for others being in deep water dosen't worry them in the least and may mean something completely different, it's all a matter of perpective. *shrugs* if you really think these dreams of yours are trying to tell you something, I'd recommend sitting down and thinking over them. I can't speak for anyone else but I often find if it's something particularly important and I don't get it the first time round, it'll recur so I wouldn't stress.

			There is a very clear way to interpret dreams, and that is to derive not the optical but emotional meaning from it. For example:
<br />

<br />
I climb down a hatch and end up in a chamber that?s filled with corpses, I want to get out but can?t as it?s too difficult to climb up again. Meaning abstractely:
<br />

<br />
I got myself for (interpret reasons) into a situation that I found to strongly dislke and am afraid of, and I am struckling and having serious difficulties to get out of again.
<br />

<br />
- Take that abstract and look arround what in your life most closely resembles this particular emotion. - There you have your dream interpreted.
<br />

<br />
The visual scenario in a dream is usually (when it comes to subconscious dream-interpretation) not interesting, the very roughly abstracted emotional circumstances are. This will lead you to immensly accurate interpretations of your personal dreams.
<br />

<br />
Things like close friends accurately point into a particular direction though. So if these friends played a role in your life recently, there is a very good chance these characters resemble what this dream is about. In this particular case there is a certain problem with the closely related social environment, which?s particular meaning no-one can dig up but yourself.

			Dream 1 may relate to peer pressure, and the fact that you feel like you must put your life in harm's way to hang around your friends, in a sense.
<br />

<br />
Dream 2 is a little more complex. Maybe you feel like you and your friends aren't going anywhere, and you realize the need for a dominant personality/leader to emerge from the group?
<br />

<br />
But really, what everyone has said is true. Only you can ultimately decide what these dreams mean. Before I go to bed, for instance, I sit in a chair and reflect over everything that has occured that day. I know my mind well enough that I can list out the conflicts my subconscious may have me dream about that night. That way, I can usually interpret my dreams the next day without much difficulty. Try it. =)

Sounds like peer pressure, are they pressuring you into anything at all, just have a think on that one.
<br />

<br />
As for dream 2, it sounds like some kind of hardship, maybe still peer pressure, this one is a little harder, the fact you go from a long hallway with things on the walls, to a long hallway with nothing on the walls suggests some kind of let down/hardship youre going through/have gone through, has anything difficult to cope with been involved in your life recently, maybe?

			the loss of blood in a dream usually signifies the loss of energy
<br />

<br />
this is true, after using my PKTKETCK i had a dream where i was bleeding
<br />
so i can see how it ties into that sort of emotion of being tired, de-energized.
