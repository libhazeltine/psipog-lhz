			I was using the program where you get to move a little pencil and on the very first day of practicing psi I was able to move it left or right with rarely any mistakes. I didn't even try to practice psi balls before.
<br />

<br />
 The only thing that I can think of other than being a natural psion is that a believe 2 years ago I found this site and would make a psi ball everyday for about a week but then I went on vacation and forgot about the site. So has something like this ever happened to someone else.

			How many times have you run the program, and how much did the results vary? To truly know if you did it or not, you're going to have to try it quite a number of times. You can get high scores just from chance, because they work through random number generation.
<br />

<br />
Of course, do not let this discourage you. You most likely did influence it, so keep at it, and cultivate your apparent skill.

			I tried it maybe about 30 times between now and yesterday (the day I started) and each time I got around a total score of 5 since my family would think I was going crazy from staring at a virtual pencil and I seem to never be home alone. Anyways but out of all them I had maybe 5 mistakes. My best friend still thinks the computer program is doing it all and that I am just super lucky so any help with that would be helpfull.
