<br />

<br />
I've started practicing PK for about 2 months. Initially, micro-PK and I'm reasonably good at doing the roulette wheel (making about 100$ a day) and influencing die rolls (for my RPG sessions).
<br />

<br />
I've also recently started practicing the psi-wheel with some minor results.
<br />

<br />
But this has made me thinking. This stuff is great but none of it is really useful beyond the point of proving the reality of Psionics to people. I was thinking there must be a way to make this *really* useful for humanity. I've been reading books and articles on the Internet and many say that you can basically manifest anything you like and that the power of the mind is unlimited.
<br />

<br />
So I was thinking. What if we used our powers of PK and manifestation to stop or prevent the wars (e.g. the Iraq war) going on today? We could do this by simply jamming the guns and turning the bombs into duds. If a lot of people did this, I think this could actually have an effect and we could save a lot of lives.
<br />

<br />
Would anybody be interested in joining me with this?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />
Wow.  Shut up.
<br />

<br />
Edit:  You mean OUR guns and bombs?  Again, shut up.  The AK-47 is too reliable to jam.  You could store it in a septic tank for a week, then fire it as if nothing happened.

			Hey,Channing,you and I must be mentally related.I have been thinking such things.But,they are hard to achieve.I don't know if wars are good or not.But,thinking that&quot;Oh mummy!I can't do this ,I can't do that&quot;won't help you a lot if you really want to do something like that.Also,pk can also be used for bad purposes.So,if someone has to come with tk powers,then let it be from the good side first.I agree to join you,Channing.Count me in.

			ofcours if i can help to stop war i will start to do so and everything have its 2 sides the good side and the bad side even the war have good side if you are protecting yourself not attacking . and about killing people to rid the weak people or to finish them of from the world , look around you countries cant be strong or turn from weak to be strong in short time and you did not choose where to be born in weak country or strong country and you cant change the others people or turn them from bad to good . 
<br />

<br />
what about the humans right the second people that the americans were talking about and calling for it? . 
<br />

<br />
if you give someone too much money or give him too much power then it is time to watch him because you will see his or her true natural. because he will be free to do his will , no one will ask him what are you doing or tell him that is wrong .
<br />

<br />
about stopping war it is good idea that almost everybody want it to be stopped but about using pk to stop it and get some help from people here to use pk , it cant be because alot of us here cant slide things or even cant roll it and some are stuck with papers only like me and some still cant move the psi wheel but maybe trying will help to achive strong accidant. 
<br />

<br />
good luck all .

I do believe that with a sufficient number of people we could achieve some results and it wouldn't be necessary to actually know the mechanics of how the weapons are blocked. All that is needed is focusing the intent or visualization of the end result and belief that it will work.

Weapons or not, there will still be war. It's in human nature, ever since man decided to own land, they've been pushed too war for survivle. From Clans to nations. It's inevitable, it's unstopable, nothing we can do will cease wars. 
<br />

<br />
Sure, war may not be pretty or relaxing, but it's a must to survive in the age we live in. 
<br />

<br />
Have you thought that maybe, the weapons you'd defect with psionics would be replaced? It's almost impossible to clear out weapons, there are factories everywhere. 
<br />

<br />
Belief isn't everything.

The only way to rid war is through genocide of human race.

You certainly are very negative. I, on the other hand, believe that humanity can overcome war. In fact, I am certain we will eventually, it is only a matter of time.

			I'll have to agree with the majority of your responders on this, although I'll try to be more civil than some of them.
<br />

<br />
To attempt to stop a war through psychokinetic disabling of all weaponry would be nearly, if not completely impossible. Here's why:
<br />

<br />
1) The physical process of jamming guns would take quite a bit of psi, and there are few people out there that could disable a weapon psionically to the point that it would not be repairable by a simple field strip. The same goes for bombs, but with the added risk that a psion could easily mess up and, say, destroy the aircraft that was carrying said bomb, thus resulting in a loss of life which, as I understand, is what you wish to avoid.
<br />

<br />
2) Every psion that was going to help you would have to know the inner workings of the weapons you want to dismantle. Bearing in mind the wide array of weapons in use in modern warfare, this is quite unreasonable.
<br />

<br />
3) If I understand psionic manipulation from long distances correctly, the psion would have to be aware of said weapons before he could manipulate them. It is impossible to be aware of that large of a number of arms, even for a large group of people. I doubt there are enough skilled psions in the world to accomplish even tracking half of the weapons, much less disabling them.
<br />

<br />
4) As one of your repliers said, the weapons do not fight the war. The people fight the war. Therefore, if you take away their weapons, they will ultimately be reduced to wringing their opponent's necks with their bare hands. Or just making more weapons.
<br />

<br />
5) I am afraid that it is impossible for us to stop war at all. It's in our blood, so to speak. Anyone who looks upon the human race with a clear mind sees a depraved, bloodthirsty, self-destructive species who would sooner gut his neighbor than smile at him, at the basest level. The only distinction between us and the barbaric animals, from the behavioral point of view (I have my own set of religious beliefs that support most of my statements, and would be happy to discuss them with anyone who wants to PM me, but I cannot discuss them here), is that we have placed arbitrary rules in place such as &quot;Use silverware&quot; and &quot;Share your stuff.&quot; People who do not follow our moral standards, which are essential to peaceful living, will not be pacified by diplomacy or talk. They simply wish to kill, and will do so until someone stops them.
<br />

<br />
To put it simply, I wish to say this, although I must preface it with this principle: Human life is the most precious thing on this earth, and any means necessary must be used in order to preserve even the smallest of human life. That said, the only way to resolve most wars is to kill all of the people who would continue it, or the causes thereof; for example, removing Saddam Hussein from power: He was the cause of the war because he was murdering countless numbers of his own people. Don't blame things on our current political leader; he did the right thing, even if it wasn't technically our business. It goes like this: He may have killed so very many terrorists, but those terrorists in turn would have killed many more innocent people. As a result of the war in Iraq, many insane madmen have been killed, instead of allowing those same madmen to run the streets, blowing themselves up beside school busses and murdering innocent children.
<br />

<br />
War is not a pretty thing, and should be avoided where it is possible, the fact stands that it is unavoidable as a whole, and will always be with us as long as the human race remains the corrupt entity that we are.

			As much as having loved ones dying sucks, you gotta admit, humanity would severely overpopulate earth if we didn't have constant wars.  Which brings us to another one, poverty.  So if its not war, it's poverty.  I'll take my chances with war.

			No wars in the last two decades have caused enough deaths to even put a dent in the population growth of the planet. Many, many more people have died to famine and diseases. So, if you really want to be consistent and effective at reducing population growth you would have to advocate to stop sending food and medical supplies to countries that need them. Do you do you that?
