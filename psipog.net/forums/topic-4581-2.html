			Regardless of all the bashing you've received i think that you just might have something here and i'm eager to test it. when i try it i'll let you know what i think. and keep up the good work <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

So basically what you're doing here is reading someone like a fuel guage. Oh that makes everything perfect now, I see.

<br />
I personally think my original post still stands. Adding a labeless number to a skill or ammount that can't be measured with numbers is redudant. But if you think you've got something by all means keep at it.  Just dont expect people to take you very seriously when you go &quot;what are you talking about, you're only 40x and I'm 100x!!!&quot;

			We all have the ability to rate ourselves on some sort of scale.  I've seen this specifically used in self-hypnosis - ask your subconscious for a number of how &quot;deep&quot; you are in a trance... and your subconscious can spit out a number that gives you a pretty good estimate.  This is a good way to see how good you're progressing, to compare old results with current results.
<br />

<br />
The problem comes when you want to compare that &quot;level&quot; with someone else's &quot;level&quot;.  The subconscious returns a number that really only applies to you, and is very subjective.  My subconscious might give me a range from 0 to 100... and yours might give you a range from 0 to 10.  Maybe my level 50 is the same as your level 2... there is no way to find out.
<br />

<br />
You are requesting the information from your subconscious.  So the only way to get consistent readings is to use the same subconscious.  And the only way to use the same subconscious is to use the same mind/body.  Therefore, comparing numbers is impossible using a technique like this.
<br />

<br />
Also, your method is highly dependant on a good scan.  A cloaking shield can disrupt that pretty quickly.  Or the opposite... or a combination.  Knowing your technique, someone could make a shield that gives different scanners different &quot;levels&quot;.  One person reports 2x, another person reports 20x, and another person reports 50x.  Now what?
<br />

<br />
Your idea is nice for small/fun applications, for just messing around with friends, and joking around.  But when you introduce a &quot;level&quot; system for everyone to use, it needs to be more percise and consistent.  Something that is dependant on the subjective subconscious and the person's ability to scan isn't really anything concrete.

			It's okay..I guess.
<br />
I only starting disliking it when I seen it being used in IRC, and when some randomer told me my &quot;power level&quot;. Seriously, this shit's turning into DBZ, and it isn't good.

			You wanted power levels but not the DBZ to go with it eh? That is a very hard thing to sperate most of the time. As far as fields, it is rather artificial, so I can expand mine around the room and beyond, so what? That can be learned specifically. What happens if somebody learns that and only that. Then you get your reading, and everybody bows in reverance to the person who just went off the chart, and then you notice they don't know anything else. (Note the above is unlikely, but it shows that this tests a very narrow range of skill(s))
<br />

<br />
Sure a way to tell you've progressed is nice, but I don't think a ranking system is practical right now, although this idea of scanning is probably the best attempt somebod's made that I've seen so far. If you want to see your progress, keep a log. It won't be as concrete as numbers, but it will show you progress, and help you notice trends. 
<br />

<br />
Keep trying for ideas on ranking though, it would be useful, well, at least helpful for the whole tracking of &quot;progress.&quot;

			hey everyone. you guys seem to be getting the wrong end of the stick...
<br />

<br />

<br />
BASICALLY...
<br />

<br />

<br />
this was just a fun idea. i never intended it for anybody to use seriously. its just like a little friendly competition, see who can charge the most.
<br />

<br />
when we scan someone, we take an average of 30 nons, see there production at the current time, and take an average.
<br />

<br />
we then compare that to the amount being produced to within the body of the person who is charging.
<br />

<br />
we usualy try to get as many scanners as possible to get readings from, i do this seperately as it increases the chance that someone wont follow another scanning (i.e. someone gets like 50x, then the next scanner assumes it will rise)
<br />

<br />
this was all just a bit of fun. nothing to get all het up about.

Skill and energy levelage is completely unrelated. iv seen people with far more skill than me, but with tiny amounts of output.
<br />

people can say what they want, i just fancied a little fun, thats it. nothing more, nothing else.
