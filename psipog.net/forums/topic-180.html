			I was thinking (it took me a lot of work, though!):
<br />
Maybe it'd be interesting to have a forum about Psionic Defenses, including shields, tips on some precautions, how to ask for help (can be a telepatic &quot;HELP!&quot;) and so...
<br />
I would find that helpfull, as i could use a couple of def. techniques in my environment (i don't want to go off topic here, so i'll talk about that later)
<br />
Anyway if someone (Peebrain?) is listening, what you think about that??
<br />
Thanks, this site (both PsiPog and the BB) are providing me with a lot of help on this field...

			In fact, this could be into a general &quot;Basic Basics&quot; i mean, the first things a n00b like me should know when he starts, maybe with energy awareness, basic manipulation (moving energy from here to there, etc) and some tips from the more experienced buddies (that is often more helpfull than a 10 pages book, because you can target the main frustration points in the development) and so...
<br />
Well, that'd be all  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I think, for the most part, shielding and help with constructs are covered in the articles section. That being said, I think a section/forum for &quot;defense&quot; is a bad idea.
<br />

<br />
Why? Simple.
<br />

<br />
Very few times has a &quot;help! I are being teh attacked!&quot; cry been an actual attack. For the most part, it's some paranoid twit going &quot;OMG! I have a headache! SOMEONE MUST BE ATTACKING ME!&quot; If you're being attacked, generally, you'll know it. People have better things to do than mentally attack a 14 year old living in the suburbs of wherever. If you feel like someone could be malicious enough to attack you, then learn to shield. Read a few articles, follow some links....practice. We are not your babysitters. We're not going to stop what we're doing and leap to the defense of someone who comes and posts twice about &quot;astral demons&quot; or &quot;government super-psychics&quot; giving them a slight aversion to loud sounds. Quite honestly, that's not my job, and I really wouldn't give two shakes about it.
<br />

<br />
Sorry for sounding like a dick, but I really don't think this idea is something that many will pay attention to.

			I would sometimes too, but I've seen on some other forums a little less plagued by fluff than ours where theres legitament things that need to be worked out, like you try to shield against something but the shield gets destroyed and you want tips for a more effective one to use against it. Also if nothing else it would also filter the fake stuff out of the general discussions forum so it wouldn't annoy everyone <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			ok.  i got the idea...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
(and i don't have 14 years nor i live on suburbs)
<br />
The help thing was just and idea, and if you don't feel like helping or teaching (as you speak like an advanced psion and i assume you are not playing roles, that'd be pathetic, no?), that's ok.
<br />
All i'm saying is that i think that correctly implemented it could help someone.... but, if you people disagree, well, you know more than me about this, i guess...
<br />
Sorry if i said something stupid, i don't think so, as i prefer to think before talking, not like others...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  hehe... 
<br />

<br />
Happy birthday...

			I wasn't specifically targetting you as the &quot;14 year old twit,&quot; just to make that clear. I was merely speaking from experiences I've encountered in the chatroom. Nor was I trying to attack your idea. It's yours, you're entitled to it. All I was doing was disagreeing with you on why -I- think it'd be a bad idea. If I came off as sarcastic and mean, then I apologize. 
<br />

<br />
I simply don't like the idea of people practicing psionics and running to someone to help them when they find themselves in a bit of trouble, which may or may not be completely imagined. It's irresponsible. If you're going to practice something that could be dangerous, learn the dangers of it. If there are solutions to those dangers, learn what those solutions are.

Agree. But i'm not saying to set a crying place, just a localized place where totally newbies can find usefull tips to avoid getting in trouble, including psionic ethics, it is also true that a nwbe doesn't have skills or power enough to get in *real* trouble, but there are some basic tips that could help...

LOL! Who'd want to do a psyionic war with other's anyway? It doesn't happen in <span style="font-weight: bold">normal </span>life if you keep your abilities to <span style="font-weight: bold">yourself</span>.
