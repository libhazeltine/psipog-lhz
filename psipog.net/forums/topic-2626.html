			I actually missed 2 days of practice and it took me awhile to get back to moving a pencil, etc. Which begs me to ask a question that's been on my mind as of late....Is pk worth it? It took 5 years for me to budge a pen. Why? I can simply do it with my hands.

			'Cause with PK, you can do things such as start an engine and manipulate odds, along with extra help for turning off lights when your lazy. You should make a thread for the uses of PK <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .

			Perhaps you are seeing it for the wrong reasons. This isnt so much as seeing it in the practical but understanding our true potential, what humans can really do. Maybe right now we have seldom prowess, others have more but in time if we keep practicing and have our children practice, then our children's children...Generation passes and to my knowledge the prowess, to some degree, will pass as well, maybe we wont reap true benefits, but we can work for the future, not just what is now.
<br />

<br />
We must always look at the big picture whilst keeping our eyes on whats now.

			Though PK may seem useless, I play with it not because it might be useful, but because of the fact that we can do it at all.  Its just pretty neat to be able to influence  physical object in that way.

			When I started out I was really into it. Then it got to the point where I'd roll pencils and pens....that was cool for like an hour or two. It just seems like another want and not a need. I feel myself yearning for something more.

			Thats natural, we as humans usually arent satasfied with what we have. Usually we only appretiate it when its gone, i've learned to appretiate my powers due to some odd periods I get of complete power down times, some powers chunt off and others spark up, then it levels out, odd no? Well with that and some lowerings in my prowess in the fields at times I appretiate what I can do.
<br />

<br />
Dont use that yearning as a deterant, use it as a motivation, redouble your efforts, meditate more, yearn for understanding, for wisdom, for that next step. Its not impossible, it is doable, but you have to want it and apply yourself and not let the progress or abilities of others put you down. So what others can do more? Its not about them its about you and your powers when it comes to practice, so just focus on that.

			are you kidding?! being able to do telekenesis, read minds, have lucid dreams, obe's ect, is the single most coolest thing i have found that life has to offer other than happy marrages and kids and what not. I will always do some form of ESP. (for lack of a better word)

All of which I have done. I find them to be just powers, wants, a never-ending cycle. I am looking for a higher Truth.

			Ah yes, the physical preference over metaphysical. I know this one well.
<br />

<br />
Pretty much all my life I've been looking for something more than I can touch, or more than I can physically experience. I'm not talking about religeon or spirituality (though it does come into play in a sense) - but rather a greater understanding of the universe that very few have found. 
<br />

<br />
For me, my TK is still very much in its infancy. I cna spin a Psi wheel, but that's all. My next challenge will be rolling a marble. From there perhaps moving large objects and even levitating them.
<br />

<br />
But, why? What practical purpose could this have when my physical body is so much stronger and more adept at manipulating objects?
<br />

<br />
Because my physical body can't see into the future, or move an object from across the room.
<br />

<br />
Think of it this way, you're wrongfully put into a small town jail and the keys are on the table across the room and out of reach. A corney clicke situation, yes, but if you're about to be executed you'd be glad you could get those keys with PK rather than getting executed.
<br />

<br />
The world is a larger place with Psi in it for me. It's not just a physical manifestation of random possibilities, it's something more. A sea of energy interacting, with itself and with me.
<br />

<br />
So in the end, why PK?
<br />
Because it's out there, and because we can.
<br />

			Short answer: PK can be useful, but it's very unlikely. The people who get PK to a useful level are people born being able to blow up people's hearts by blinking.

although that would be undeniabally awesome, its not true &gt;_&lt;
<br />

<br />
my personal view is that we are taking the baby steps to the next form of evolution. if anything, our children will be able to do this, i have a feeling certain psionic abilities are hereditary. or rather i know.
<br />

<br />
the key is to strive. by aiming for a higher goal, you aim to achieve more, thus increasing motivation and dedication. give it time...
<br />

<br />
i also have a feeling that there is alot more to PK than we think. its just one of those things we haven't stumbled across yet.
<br />
