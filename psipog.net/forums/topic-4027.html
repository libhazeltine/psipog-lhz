			Warning these are my Opinions not yours:
<br />

<br />
Well i've been reading techniques and it turns out there aren't alot of Telepathy. Yes I admit I don't do it that much because I'm to interested in Telekenises and other things, just like you! Haha, well it doesn't mean I'm bad at it.
<br />

<br />
I've found it really effective if you meditate for 5-10 minutes before hand. Clear your mind, and keep it quiet, because telepathy could fill all your senses including hearing. Try not to think about anything at all.
<br />

<br />
Now get the persons name, and get them to tell you something about themselves, I've got white walls, or I have black hair, or I have blue jeans on.
<br />

<br />
Tell them the same thing, he must do the same preperations as you.
<br />
Now mentally picture your object, the person. Find him and imagine grabbing him, telling him, &quot;I got you!&quot; He should do the same thing. This is linking him to you. Now imagine you having a huge clear pipe in your hands. Literally screw it to his skull, and screw it to your skull. He should be doing the same thing in his head. This way you will make a strong link.
<br />

<br />
Now when it's your turn you must imagine things in your head, and literally send them down the tube. Words, shapes, objects, feelings, etc.
<br />

<br />
If your receiving you must clear your head, and look at the black nothing of your closed eye sight. Get ready to feel things, get ready to see things, to hear things. If you do write them down. Keep doing this, and when your done, or if he's done look at the paper. Circle the most things that relate and base your answer on that...happy Telepathic adventures!!! Tell me any feedback if you get any. Pm me for further help or practice.

			I've tried to talk to people by entering their minds during school.

I'm not sure if they're replying or it's my subcon just playing with me.
