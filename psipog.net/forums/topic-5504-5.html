If chris is for real, why isn't the government researching him?
<br />
If chris is for real, why does he have to have his back to us in <span style="font-style: italic">most</span> of his levitation tricks, and when his back isn't turned, why is it next to a wall?
<br />
If chris is for real, why does he have paid actors?  (trust me, I have acted for many years, I KNOW when someone is acting.)
<br />
Why did I see the same audience member picked for his tricks in two different cities if chris is for real?
<br />
If chris is for real, wouldn't levitating be enough?  Why does he have to do card tricks and other illusions as well?  I mean, if the paid actors standing around him didn't see the secret behind his levitation, wouldn't they already be amazed?
<br />
If chris is for real, would certain religions see him as a returned messiah of some sort?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Still didn't answer the first question, but I will for you.  Because they know he is fake.  They aren't going to waste their time on him, because he is fake.  Also, I didn't force you to reply.  
<br />

<br />
Hey, it's cool that you believe he is real.  I have no problem with that.  What I do have a problem with is you insulting Apollo.  I'm kind of ashamed that I'm replying to your reply, seeing as how it was a week, two weeks after I posted, and no longer relevant.  I won't reply to your next post, simply because I have better things to do.  Like, go to med school, be with my girlfriend...and, oh yeah, knowing what is reality, and what isn't.

			LOL I'd just like to add if they are paid actors then, NO, they wouldn't be telling everyone on the net about it. They'd be getting paid to act as if it's real and not tell anyone otherwise...There would be signed agreements.

And if you want me to name more criss angel tricks: the one where he walks through glass (people say hinges on the glass, look at the f-ing glass there are no invisible hinges, it would be very visible) The one where he makes the person levitate, the one where he pulls a girl in half and the legs stand up afterwards, all his disappearing and reappearing on top of buildings within seconds, the one where he jumps on a dirtbike and disappears in the air and ends up in the audience

Are you a freaking mongoloid?  Read what these people are saying, and do some of your own research.  The guy has ADMITTED that everything he does is an illusion.  Get over yourself.

Criss Angel, a new master of illusion
<br />

<br />
By Ann Oldenburg, USA TODAY
<br />

<br />
Poof! Criss Angel has turned into the magician of the moment. With Marilyn Manson looks and Harry Houdini abilities, Angel has caught buzz with his new A&amp;E show, Mindfreak (Wednesday, 10 ET/PT).
<br />

<br />
It's part of his artistry, says the musician and magician, who also calls himself a mentalist, a hypnotist and an illusionist.
<br />

<br />
&quot;My Aunt Stella did a card trick,&quot; says Angel, who grew up on Long Island in a Greek-American family. &quot;It boggled my mind. Once she shared it with me, I felt this incredible sense of power, that an adult didn't understand how it worked. It was very enticing.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I did something that is a famous effect that 12 magicians have tried to do and died — to catch a bullet in your teeth. I wanted to devise a way to really try to do it. I had a ballistics expert fabricate a metal cup for my mouth designed to absorb the .223 bullet. And I had a sharpshooter, a guy who is an incredible shot — Jon Davis from the band Korn. And we were successful in doing it. We did it and I didn't kill myself! I want to show people.&quot;</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
