Do you use psi to make the link u guys are talking about? or is telepathy a different thing altogether?

			I think that psi is used to create the link.  It is basically a link of energy, and psi is energy, so there you go!
<br />

<br />
woodpecker, I also have heard that you do not need to make a link to perform TP.  My view on that is that you don't consiouslly make a link, but esssentially, you would have to link to actually perorm TP, right?

			Well you communicate, so in that sense yes you do link.  But I don't actively create a link out of Psi.  If I suddenly break my leg in the middle of a dark forest and nobody is around to hear me scream, I'm not going to sit down and create a link before trying to get help.  Also, I've heard that links can sometimes be hard to break, so not using them seems sensible to me, and it makes tp practises last longer because I don't have to waste time creating a link and then destroying it again.  Telepathy still works for me. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I think he means energy field, or signature, in which case yes you do, unless the person is right in front of you.  Links can be created sub-c (normally if you are &quot;natural&quot;), but you do need to make one to communicate.  They aren't too hard to break, you can just visualizethe link snapping, but that might cause a head ache.  Normally, if you just ignore, or stop concentrating on telepathy and do something else (say, twiddle your thumbs, or hum your favorite song) the link will break anyways.
<br />

<br />
When you are concentrating on your target, that normally is all you need to create a link, which automatically enters their energy field.  If you are doing this over the net, you need their signature to concentrate on, and &quot;push&quot; your thoughts to them (which creates a link).
<br />

<br />
This is a good article covering the basics of telepathy with some emphasis on links and signatures (note:  don't look for the word &quot;signature&quot; because I don't think it is in there.  When sheepking says the &quot;feel&quot; of the person, that is their signature.)

			Woodpecker, thats awesome.  I wish my sub-c would create the darn links lol. I have been trying to be better at communicating with it, but I don't think that I am receptive enought.  O well, practice makes better!

			Me and a friend practice TP. We got ok at it sending messages. We never visualized a link though. We just imagined different ways of sending the message. But we both had to be trying it at the same time. One sending and one recieving. I don't know how you would be able to read someone's mind or whatever without them &quot;bringing you in&quot; or letting yo in atleast.

If someone can clarify please post but PM would be much better.

U ARE linked......i assume that u both are on MSN or some IM program practicing TP........1st of all, both computers are linked......am i right? for them to communicate and transfer data, the comps have to be linked over the internet........
<br />

<br />
2nd, u both are in extremely close proximity of the respective comps that ur aura is almost merging with it..........once u are linked with your comp, u would have no problem linking with the internet friend.....<img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Maybe you are a &quot;natural.&quot;  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />   Links aren't too hard to create, usually thinking of the screenname is enough to create one.  The feeling you get from the person is (from what I understand) pretty much their sig.  If you are used to the person, you know their sig sub-c 'ly I assume.  If not, it only takes a few moments to get a feeling from someone, that might be enough to get a sig...I don't have much experience with TP (I hope to change that), but I have studied it for a while...That is what I have gathered from my reading.
<br />

<br />
Basically, whether you know it or not you already found their sig, and already created a link.  (From what I studied).

			Perhaps if I described what I did, we might be able to clear this case up.  Afterall it might be me not understanding you.
<br />

<br />
Supposing I wanted to send a square to Nightshade, I would just imagine Nightshade standing in front of me (whatever (s)he may look like doesn't matter) and then I would imagine lots and lots of squares flying out towards Nightshade.
<br />

<br />
So you can see, I haven't created a link out of psi or felt around for a psi-signature.  All I do is imagine the person there and send.  There is no feeling of being attatched to the other person in any way.
<br />

<br />
I doubt I'm a &quot;natural&quot; (as far as I know I've never accidentally picked up people's thoughts) although my receiving seems to be better than sending, but even so I'm not that good.  I had to practise to get it to work at all.  Does this help? <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
