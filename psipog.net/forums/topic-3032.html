			Last night, was moving by a spa cover that was leaning up against the spa roughly at a 45 degree angle, no wind and after I walked just past it, wasn't trying to move it or anything that nature, it just plain fell over. I looked around checking for all possible normal explanation and there was none to be found.
<br />
If this is my sub-c doing this, how can I integrate with it enough to utilize the more expansive capabilites voluntarily instead of it being strictly sub-c domain.

when we walk, we displace th air infront of us, and any air fills the space left behind. this sorta vaccuum could of caused it?

			Well, to clarify walking past it. I was approximately 3.5-4ft off to the side of it, and then just walked in a straight line past it and when I was aproximately 4 feet there abouts past it when it fell over. 
<br />

<br />
Eidolon,
<br />
    For your information, i'm probebly a natural with mental blocks. Going back a quite a few years in memory, I was aprox 4-5 years old, outside, my brother was running in and out of the house frantically because there was a tornado on the outskirts of town. I don't remember what this felt like but I was off the ground for proximately 10-15 seconds about 6 inches off the ground. 
<br />
    My brother did a lot to set up mental blocks, least he's gone now but it will take a long time before i can get back to the 4-5 year old stage of trust and belief in my own abilities.

			eh another incident just happened, i would love to be able to control this but probebly won't any time soon. Cat was up on my lap and I was concentrating on the cat's purring and glaring at the psi wheel that was aprox 2.5 feet away from me. It's slightly windy outside, no lighting in the area, my cat yowled jumping off my lap and all the power went out for about 10 seconds. I called up nipsco or however you spell their dam name, and asked if there was a short power outage in the general area which there was not. 
<br />
Seems to me sub-c is up to it's tricks again :S
<br />

<br />
again i was practicing my psiwheel was moving it fairly decent when the lights started flickering, there was a storm awhile ago but it disapeared so what is up with all this electrical surges ect?

			An interesting story but maybe it's just coincidence?
<br />
I don't think any psionic has the power to create electrical surges.
<br />
As much as I know about pk (which isn't much) you have to have the will to do something, pk isn't just a chaotic power that breaks out at any random time or situation.
<br />
You have to control it in order to release it.

			eh let me put it this way, electrical surges would just be a different form of tapping energy, electricity is energy and what do psions do? They tap into the energy and use it so yea electrical surges are quite possible.

Also another factor, I don't believe in coincidences, to many times odd ball things get labeled as coincidence

			Erm... poltergiesting? I'd say Eidolon (from ff9? am I right?) that you should do a little more research. Not to be disrespectful but you can flicker lights using psi... or for that matter pk. Giesting is when people who have or have not done pk get random bursts of pk power. Most of the times it is uncontrollable and objects can fly across the room, a book could fall of a shelf, a pen can move. None the less, you may be able to <span style="font-style: italic">control</span>the psi wheel, but when you giest a book could fly across the room.  Sorry for my bad explanation, I'm tired and a little perplexed as why no one has said this yet.

Ok, well ill comment ^^^^^ before answering what probly happened. 
<br />
Actually, there are many Psions who can create electrical surges. I am one, but only under certian conditions dealing with high emotions. But I know a girl who can do it at will. Your conscious doesn't HAVE to want to do something, because 9 out of 10 times your sub-c has a stronger will than your concisiousness does. And last but not least it really depends how you look at it because Psi is just another rawform of energy until you harness it so technically it is a chaotic force. (I apologize soooooo much for that commen but I just feel like commenting that ^.^ Hope you don't hate me.)
<br />

<br />
As for the sub-c question: There is truly a 50-50 chance with that. Most of the time there is a outside force that you just so happen to be looking over, whether it be for one reason or another. But there is also an even chance that is actually was your sub-c still stuck in &quot;Moving Mode&quot; and it did flip it. I would believe the latter, so as to say to have experience under your belt. Just, take a deep breath and have another look at it if you really wanna know what happened. I have had  many experiences with my sub-c acting up and doing things without my concent. But those are stories for another day. Just look over it again and if you can't find an answer, then it most likely is your sub-c.

			I'd advise researching and making a shield programmed to prevent your psi from causing electrical interference or acting in any way undesired.

Yes, from what I've read, electrokinesis is possible. It's one of the many things I hope to start practicing after I get better at TK.

It's &quot;Geist&quot; not Giest - well that may be correct, I never saw anything like that happen but as much as I know those Phenomena are very rare and if he does train in psi he should be able to handle his power.

			Well, ought to believe i'm doing my damnedest to gain control. It is so frustrating to feel energy outflow and not knowing what it's gonna do and then get startled by the results. What I may end up having to do is attempt to construct a shield that would prevent psi from exiting without concious control.

			Heh well I guess I'm advancing slowly, yesterday was cleaning out pop cans from my mom's car and one rolled out behind the door and I tried squeezing under. No luck  and was only 4 inches away and was like &quot;damn now I gotta get up and walk around&quot; when it shook for a second and rolled right to my hand. There was wind, however if the wind was affecting it, would have rolled away, and the surface of the drive is that rough gravel :O now let see if I can't roll em with concious attempt :O
