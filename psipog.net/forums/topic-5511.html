<br />

<br />
i have made some attempts at creating psiballs. the best result i have recived so far; is me washing my hands with cold water, and attemping to create a psiball. after about a 1min my hands began to warm past room temprature. i never got any further that that.
<br />

<br />

			It's called practice. There isn't a shortcut into it, it's all practice. Practice for a month and if you get nothing, rethink and come up with a new plan.

I don't really understand why you wash your hand in cold water.

			alright ill try it. I have the time lol.
<br />

<br />
and the reason why i washed my hands in cold water was, 1 because they were dirty and i thought at the time that my hands would beable to feel the heat of energy better if they were cold.

			Always think, that your not going to get it right on that second.  Think that you'll get it in 5 or 10 years, but that's not long compared to a life time or just giving up.  The great thing about thinking you'll get it in a longer time is the fact that it might happen shorter then 10 years, that'll boost your confidence up more.  Just remember, your not all of a sudden going to lift objects up with your mind in a snap.  You need to learn how to crawl before you can walk, then comes the running, then comes the jumping, then the flying(I'm getting off topic...O_o)...you get the picture. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  Make the psi-ball till it flares, roughly 8 months or a month longer.  Then when you want to start moving objects, use the popular Psi-Wheel and try to spin it till it can at least twitch.  Then try to spin it.  One thing you should do though is to keep your hand about 5 inches away from the paper to not make it spin through your body heat.  That or cover it with another container that wont disrupt its route of spinning but it will be harder to do it though an object.

If you didn't know about it, this is the link to a guide that will help you on how to practice how to do PK.  It's mainly techniques on what to do.  Good luck on your practicing, and may the shwartz be with you! <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
