			Trying to learn psionics but not having too much help from articles I would like to propose an alternative way of spreading psionic information.
<br />

<br />
Now, as far as I know humans can think and process non-verbal information and anything related to subconsious is not purely verbal.
<br />
Currently the best bet to learn psionics is to have a psion tech you or read articles. The articles by their wordy nature can only express situations and methods in whitch &quot;stumbling&quot; into psi is more likely. This can make finding psi a little bit hard when you don't know excatly where to look for.
<br />

<br />
When one plays around with psi they learn to handle it but the resulting &quot;talent&quot; resides much in how subconsiuos can link the intention of doing something with psi to the actual manipulation of psi. As far as I understand the consiuos mind changes little to none. That makes it so that every psion must &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; as there are not so many efficent methods of exhancing subconsiuos information.
<br />

<br />
From what I have read about psionic stuff it seams that empathy and telepathy operate precisely on this subconsiuos level.
<br />

<br />

<br />
So, to change the situation hopefully for the better there could be an arrangement so that every psion who knows telepathy could &quot;read&quot; the (non-verbal subconsious level) idea of the skill they are intressed learning of from a psiball maintained by psipog.
<br />

<br />
There could be a broken link on psipog and that link would be the mental anchor and aid for creating, browsing and organizing these &quot;books. Then telepathy would be like reading is in school, a critical learning tool.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Pros:
<br />
  + telepaths can advance other skills faster
<br />
  + A well defined specifically made target to telepathy gives you a better &quot;grip&quot; on how well you are doing (you would definately know when you hit)
<br />
  + a very versatile and quick media
<br />

<br />
Cons:
<br />
  - &quot;hackering&quot; of the books. A negative suggestion virus could be very nasty, but propably prevented with good shield programming
<br />
  - not knowing telepathy would be iritating
<br />
  - would have to be always &quot;online&quot; and who would provide the energy (24/7/365 on one person doesn't feel like a good idea)
<br />
  - misinterrepting the content of books
<br />
  - learning &quot;beyond your power&quot; or only one side of a talent would increase accidents
<br />
  - new creations would have to be put throuh a sensor for viruses, a bad sensor could misuse his/her power
<br />

<br />
points of intress:
<br />
+- anoying skeptics wouldn't hinder information gathering
<br />
-+ a constant &quot;psi consentration&quot; could get passively picked up by other psions

			I really really like that idea! I think it is a great idea, only that it is dreadfully hard to read this information if you don't know how, and that is one main skill most people have problems learning- sensitivity. I personally do not think that I could make any use of these &quot;books&quot; even after being active in psionics for 7 months. However, the idea still intrigues me.

			I'm thinking that more than one person can host the books, if I understand what you mean. This way, they wouldn't have to be 'online' 24/7/365. People could take, like shifts, and such.

			I was afraid that upkeep would easily become a think that everybody thinks that somebody other will do it. So clear policy on who does what would be in place.

<br />
the psiball would only hold information, the &quot;reaching&quot; would be done by the reader but I don't know if telepathy is distant irrelevant. I thougt that was with psi particulary when transmitting information/form instead of substance/energy. (You could also do a radio version for those who find actively &quot;getting&quot; to their target hard, but would be able to &quot;listen&quot;)
<br />

<br />
Pricemac, I would quess that subcounsious information transfers pretty easily but interperetting, &quot;decoding&quot; the information sensibly is the hardest part (A problem basically between the thought formats) and that weird nature of information would prevent many to gain any consious thought as result (making many go halfway the process but never realising that)
<br />

<br />
But gaining benefit from &quot;the books&quot; may not need that the receiver holds any consious thought about it, making much less of the hard interperetting parts where one format is changed to an other. The psiballs information would already be instantly relevant and understandable to your subcounsious althought it would be near or impossible to hold as an counsious thought.
<br />

<br />
This would also get around consious overlay but would let information to be thought without sensur (adverts already abuse these security holes, a psiball could very well abuse one many times more effectively) so I would make sure with my counsious mind that the source doesn't send viruses and let the subcounsious do the interperetting of the message all-by-itself.

			Shalkka I think you may be on to something, however, a library of these would be very easily corruptable, no matter how well guarded... Perhaps certain &quot;teachers&quot; could manually make the ball when its needed... Also Getting something from the unconscious mind to the conscious is rather difficult, isn't it?

			The corruption would really be the main reason not to do it, nobody would like a library of psiballs spreading harmful and wrong information unsuperviced - like an automatic device to corrupt everybodys mind.
<br />

<br />
Creating on demand would pretty much eliminate the whole point (you would be better of just telepathing the thought if you are going to let the medium psiball dissolve be it for security reasons or otherwise)
<br />

<br />
Another way of keeping them &quot;virusfree&quot; is to have the upkeeper have a little thought monitoring a psiballs state (like having admins in a irc channel, not really actively participating to the conversation)
<br />

<br />
Also making it wikilike would repair all damage relatively fast but would require having a bigger inside to the content (or ability to know you don't know engouh about the subject (the reflecsive fluffbunny sense))

<br />
Yes, it is, but is it neccecary? Consider this:
<br />

<br />
Usually people are told to think in a way that makes uncounsious do psi
<br />

<br />
counsious -&gt; uncounsious
<br />

<br />

<br />
When reading an telepathic source people usually want to understand or actually realise what they are reading
<br />

<br />
uncounsious -&gt; counsious
<br />

<br />

<br />
Now if you combine these skills (receive/realise the thought instructions via telepathy and then execute them) the data goes under these tranformations
<br />

<br />
uncounsious -&gt; counsious -&gt; uncounsious
<br />

<br />
now does the counsious part do anything else than redirect? It could be used to apply reasoning to the data. But transforming to and from consious mind is really difficult. So one could find a way (assuming they believe the data is safe and don't want to counsiously critizise it) to redirect in a more resource friendly way, resulting in.
<br />

<br />
(sender) uncounsious -&gt; uncounsious (receiver)
<br />

<br />
Now currently nearly all &quot;controlling&quot; elements are not independent from focus, but expanding programming to making &quot;psionic routers&quot; that keep basic and simple predetermined control would not be that far away. Having a psionic router it would be trivial to route a uncounsious thought to an other mind were it can do it's magic.

			Your suggesting constructs being routers, constructs being data centers, and creating a whole telepathic internet that runs on energy. Sounds cool. Problem is, you would have to have very good TP skills and would have to constantly put in energy and shell it to prevent disintegration.

			Well, the constructs could be powered by a sort of &quot;power plant&quot; construct system.
<br />

<br />
A construct generates constructs that go and collect psionic &quot;pollution&quot; which are then absorbed into another construct that &quot;cleans&quot; and depatternizes the energy, and it is then stored in another construct, which you could link constructs to to keep them alive.

			Sounds good. It would be good to test it first though, maybe like a &quot;Closed Alpha&quot; test? It goes without saying that when you are blindly absorbing info from a public source (and info that you are not consciously scrutinizing) that you need to be damn sure it works. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  I'd love to help test this, as I am still new to many abilities such as empathy and telepathy, I am good at making constructs though... This is a great idea, whether it is part of PsiPog or not.
