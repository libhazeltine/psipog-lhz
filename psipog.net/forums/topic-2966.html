			I dont know what it is, but now i cannot move the psi-wheel at all. I try hard to move it but now I don't even feel the slightest connection. I used to be able to move it when I please. Now I cant move it at all. I'm really angry, mostly hopeless, I have been trying for 5 days to get the damn thing going, and nothing happens, I really don't know why all of a sudden it just decides to stop on me. I mean, I know there are bad 'days'. But 5 days in a row with nothing? That's scary to me and I don't know what to do, i'm afraid I wont be able to do it again.

			I skipped one day, only because I lost my psi-wheel.

And I started right up again, but now i can't do it. It doesn't make any sense, when I first did the wheel I moved it, but when I try after one day of not trying it just stays... D:

			Skipping one day shouldn't have any effect on your ability, I think you're trying too hard consciously and not hard enough subconsciously.
<br />

<br />
But then again I really haven't had this happen to me, just guessing.
<br />

<br />
Good luck with your practice sessions.

			could be you've been practicing to much, i had a two day hiatus not that long back where i couldn't budge period. If you let the fear take over you won't be able to budge again, but just consider it as a day off to recuperate, won't be a prob at all.

			I dont beleive its practice that matters rather than mindstate, i have been always able to move the psiwheel if i conenctrate for more than 5 minutes on it. Even if i dont move it for a week, i can usually move it if i really want to and try. It also helps if you dont have other things to worry about, like studies or running out of money?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			My best advice is to stop expecting it to work (unless you use the Gnomish method as I do). If you expect results you're not open enough to possibility of another outcome - something less that total and complete success. I find when I simply 'try' instead of expect, I do much better. 
<br />

<br />
I would also recommend moving to another object as stated before, it may help you get over the bump.
<br />

<br />
You may also be drifting from your initial breakthrough technique - this can happen because you focus too much on the elated feeling you get when the wheel moves. I recommend going back to basics - reread the articles, be confident that the wheel will move, and stop beating yourself up when it doesn't.
<br />

<br />
Relax and have fun!

			I've read a variety of articles on telekinesis, and if there's one thing I've learned from it, if you get all emotional, whether it be excited, happy, or angry, it's just not gonna work. Although I don't totally understand how to yet, they've all said that the more conscious focus you have, the worse off you are. It's far more subconscious than anything.
<br />

<br />
However, I can't even control random bursts of movement on my psi wheel, so I'm not exactly a leading authority.

			It could be that maybe you have been practicing so long that your &quot;psi tank&quot; is empty(sounds cheezy),try waiting a few days and if that doesnt work try Grounding and drawing in some energy....Just dont be afraid and bring back those long lost doubts...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

I finally got it moving, I noticed while it was moving I was more... relaxed.

I felt like I wasn't really thinking about it, just doing it.
