this seems to me that all the articles go through you and <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> put them up.  Now, im lookin as close as i possibly can and i see lies, plagerism, and a break of Copyright laws.

			Take the God Damn articles off that pathetic website. If you want material, write your own. Several authors have already stated that you did not ask permission. You broke the law. Now, I’m currently studying criminal justice and I can certainly tell you that your best bet is to take the articles down immediately.

Take all articles down that do not belong to you.

			Hello,
<br />

<br />
After noticing the “polite” sarcastic remark, I suddenly realized, you’re right! How dare I show the  disrespect and hostility towards a person who is just looking forward to making his own psionic community after having three FULL weeks of experience with psionics himself! Not to mention that he stole the majority of the articles he so happily published on his website without asking nor crediting the authors who wrote the material. 
<br />

<br />
The bottom line is this, this kid is being disrespecting and breaking several laws. He neglected to ask the authors permission to post their material on his website then continued to argue with them stating &quot;But...I credited you, open your eyes!&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
Pardon the discrete amount of respect I show to those who give none themselves.
<br />

<br />
- JoeT

Oh, yes. that makes it better....
<br />

<br />
The Psi symbol under &quot;We need YOU&quot; looks a lot like the psipog symbol but editted........
<br />

<br />
In your guestbook, you trash the other site that posted when it is better than yours.  <a href="http://www.psionix.co.nr/" target="_blank">http://www.psionix.co.nr/</a> seems to have a lot more good info than your site.
<br />

<br />
I am still not able to read half the site due to background colors and the typing colors....
<br />

<br />
What the fuck is up with the pure black forum?
