			I would imagine shortening someone's lifespan by sucking out their energy to lengthen your own is very impossible. One, energy is lost and replenished every day, it would take a very long and constant &quot;sucking&quot; of energy to actually harm someone, namely days, and even then the harm caused would be something extremely trivial like the person being hungry or tired. Two, the term sounds like it was made up by a socially deprived teenager with too much time on his hands, being too gullible can be a dangerous thing, just as can being too skeptical. Don't believe something without giving it a few moments of decent thought, if there were any truth whatsoever these &quot;vampires&quot; don't you think someone with a bit of intelligence would have fashioned them a name that isn't quite so...stupid?

			Because you have more than enough energy already and it's a valuable resource.  That's like saying &quot;why not steal from anyone I please?&quot;  Why not just take blood while you're at it.  Nut.
<br />

<br />
It's theirs to use, not yours to take.  We don't have a system to regulate the energy in our bodies (chakras, nadis, etc) simply so it can be taken by others or used senselessly.  Not to mention taking energy also screws up the flow of the energy you left in the person you vamped.  Sickness would not at all be a far fetched result.  How sick being proportionate to the amount of energy you took, the blockages you caused and the other person's ability to deal with such trauma.  Yeah, I'm sure that cancerous growth in some random person's body would qualify as a &quot;extremely trivial&quot; result of your idiocy.

wow that's ignorant.  a lot of people *ask* to be fed from.  they enjoy it, and it helps them feel better.  along with that is the increased ability to heal people, and many other benefits.  but you don't believe in psychic vampires needing to take energy or why they would want to, so it's irrelevant to you.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Yes, heroin addicts also LOVE when they get a hit and beg for money so they can get that hit.  That doesn't make it anything but detrimental to the body and a distraction for the emotions and mind.
<br />

<br />
I question you even understand what you're doing.  Purposefully so, because if you did, you'd be convinced to stop feeding upon others.  For example, where is the logic in saying that you can give energy to others and heal them, but that taking energy from others doesn't do the opposite?  To make that claim you would have to believe that we are all infinite sources of energy and yet you later refer to how energy is in fact a resource, implying that it is not infinite in supply.

You're placing meaning on functional things -- there's no &quot;reason&quot; anything was put where it was.  we're here to live life and use our resources.  you're getting into a religious/moral debate where morality does not objectively exist and religion is irrelevant.  You're speaking from a biased point of view about something you don't understand and can only see it from one side.  nobody I've fed from ever complained.  We're more likely to get rid of a cancerous tumor than cause one - that's just ignorance.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
First, I am far from religious.  Stop assuming things simply because I have a developed viewpoint that happens to share some qualities with religion X or organization Y.  Second, referring to my previous analogy again, heroin addicts also don't complain when they get a hit.  And what's with these claims of healing?  It's like a drug dealer who claims his products contain vitamin C and can substitute a balanced breakfast!  Anyone who does energy manipulation will tell you you don't know what you're talking about.  The body needs energy to heal itself and many occult groups even tell their members to not do anything energy-wise while sick specifically because it detracts from their body's natural healing abilities.

and I do take blood, as I have a blood fetish - not because I need it.  It's also part of my job.  I'm a dominatrix.  I'm also a satanist but that would be getting into religious judgment.  I'm not insulting yours or interefering in your life - so please - don't insult mine.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
Your ignorance is not my fault, nor my responsibility to avoid mentioning.  Just the opposite in fact.  When you tell impressionable members that they can take energy of others at will, I see that there is a serious correction that needs to be made.  I don't insult, but if you take offense to  noting of the qualities you've made a part of your self, you have some work to do on your relationship with your self.

			You're arguing about a phenomenon that has no real body of evidence to support that it actually exists.  Of what little research I've read about &quot;psychic vampirism&quot; that was performed by someone with a &quot;d&quot; and an &quot;r&quot; before their name, the researcher gave the impression that _real_ psychic vampires are born with a defect in their &quot;energy system.&quot;  What energy system that is, what it's composed of, and how it works is not entirely clear.  Simply put, though, the questionable evidence points to &quot;sucking&quot; energy as a vital process to a _genuine_ psychic vampire.  They are accumulating the energy that they should be generating themselves, but are unable to for one reason or another.
<br />

<br />
The good doctor also tried to tie psychic vampirism in with personality disorders.  Individuals with some personality disorders put a lot of stress on their peers through one way or another, which causes them to leak their energy, thus making it readily available for the psychic vampire.  Evidence for this phenomenon seems to be the oft-quoted example of feeling tired after you talk to a certain person.  If you ask me, however, the person who tires you is not a psychic vampire, but really just a boring individual or an asshole.
<br />

<br />
All of this is highly questionable, and I'm sure whatever good or honest research that is done is quickly tainted or misinterpreted by the masses to tailor psychic vampirism to their belief system or personal conceptions of what a psychic vampire should be.

Thank you, Roy.  First off, the human body does create it's own psionic energy, and the process is said to only take a couple days.  Certain activities do increase the production though, and most people do those activities everyday.  
<br />

<br />
Secondly, a psi-vamp is deficient of energy.  Much like the REAL vampiric condition, which is a shortage of blood (athough those vamps don't go around biting people, they are fed through an IV, Hollywood has a way to corrupt certain things) and the vamp needs to draw energy from other people, or else they suffer certain side effects (which I believe includes nausea, &quot;weakness&quot;, even blackouts....I'll have to look it up).  
<br />

<br />
What they are doing isn't harmful, since we produce psionic energy constantly (though it <span style="font-style: italic">CAN</span> take a day or two to produce the amount a person had before they were drained.)  But, like I said, certain activities (listening to music, dancing, active and exciting things) speed up the production time, maybe even to a day, or hours.  The vamp <span style="font-style: italic">ISN'T</span> trying to kill you, or hurt you in most cases (unlike what Skyz said above.  It would take a ridicously long time to drain out enough psionic energy to kill someone).  
<br />

<br />
Psi-Vamps (again, for the mostpart) don't suck energy for a &quot;high&quot;, they do it because they need it.  We have all the energy we need, they barely have any.  I think it is selfish to say &quot;no, go on and pass out and get sick.  I have an abundance of energy, and even though you just have enough to keep you from passing out, I still will hate you for trying to keep from passing out by taking my leftover energy.&quot;  Kind of like how in a way, people have a nutrient deficincy, and in order to obtain it, we eat food.  I'm sure if one of you was a psi-vamp, you would do the same thing (or just sit around sick all the time, with frequent blackouts.)
<br />

<br />
Now, I will admit that there are some psi-vamps, or even &quot;psi-vamp posers&quot; out there just doing it for fun, or overexcessivly.  But for the most part, it is a condition where they need the energy to keep themselves healthy, and can't generate enough on their own.  They need to tap into an outside force to do this, and the easiest, most energetic (and most self-producing) resource is humans.  Believe me, if there is a better source out there, psi-vamps would draw from that.  But there isn't, or one hasn't been discovered yet, so they have to settle for humans.  Instead of bitching about it, why don't you think up some ways to help?
<br />

<br />
Also, a main reason a lot of people dislike psi-vamps is because of the name (and because of ignorance, and not liking their abundance of energy to be drained to just enough for them to work with).  Instead of the negative &quot;vamp&quot; connotation, why don't we call them something more suiting?  Like, P.W.D.G.E.E.T.R.H? (People who don't generate enough energy to remain healthy).

Believe me, if there is a better source out there, psi-vamps would draw from that.  But there isn't, or one hasn't been discovered yet, so they have to settle for humans.  Instead of bitching about it, why don't you think up some ways to help?
<br />

<br />
Also, a main reason a lot of people dislike psi-vamps is because of the name (and because of ignorance, and not liking their abundance of energy to be drained to just enough for them to work with).  Instead of the negative &quot;vamp&quot; connotation, why don't we call them something more suiting?  Like, P.W.D.G.E.E.T.R.H? (People who don't generate enough energy to remain healthy).</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

			I'm curious where this whole idea of &quot;need&quot; for energy by psychic vampires comes from.  Because as Roy has said, this is not a scientifically proven energy system we're talking about just as the mechanism involved in feeding and energy deficency is not &quot;proven&quot;.  It makes no logical sense to have assumed they have any real need from birth.  Maybe vampirism is simply due to poor choices of personal beliefs which influence one's own lifestyle and thus their energy.  Such choices (potentially imposed at earlier ages) could happen at any time and could be so very deeply ingrained in the individual that they may identify with that &quot;deficency&quot; as being something they've always had.  But that doesn't mean it truly is a born malfunction and I've never seen anything to indicate that it is.  I've only noticed and extremely obvious trend in the personalities and lifestyles of those who are psychic vampires versus more balanced individuals.
<br />

<br />
However the feeding impulse may be a dysfunction that is nurtured and fed until it does become a real need.  Oddly enough tying back into my analogy of a heroin addict whose body requires the drug or it goes into withdrawl.  So what makes it so concrete for those who are vampires that they are and alwasy have been in real need?

The basis of which I am going by is that these energy-deficient people, or &quot;psi-vamps&quot; seem to feel nausea, lightheadedness, sick, have headaches, feel weak, ect...and don't seem to have a &quot;medical condition.&quot;  But, after they drain energy, they start to feel a lot better.  There has been research on numerous sites that support this claim, and the claim that these people are in fact energy-deficient.  Now, like you said, there isn't any scientific proof...then again, there are a lot of definitions for scientific proof, or even science (I'm not talking about the dictionary definition, I'm talking about what things fall under science.  Many people believe that the paranormal or supernatural do not fall under science, but there are many people that believe it does.)  But, just as there isn't any &quot;scientific proof&quot; for psi-vampirism, there isn't any &quot;scientific proof&quot; for psionics (or at least accepted scientific proof) or energy systems, and we seem to live with that just fine.
<br />

<br />
I see your point through the psychological standpoint, and it does make sense.  Noticing a trend is very important in &quot;diagnosing&quot; something as widespread as this...but these are things that you noticed, or are through your experience...and how old are you? 19? I don't think that is enough years to notice a steady trend.  Some of the people studying psi-vampirism are in their 40's...I think I will pay more attention to their experience, simply because they have been studying it longer, and notice a more steady trend.  I'm not trying to insult you in any way, I'm just saying that all you have are theories...And that's all anyone has (including me).  I just think it is ridiculous to fear these theories if they aren't proven.  Or to call them evil.  
<br />

<br />
All I'm doing is citing research.  I do have my personal opinion, but I think I want these theories to evolve a bit more before I develope it any more.  These theories make a lot of sense to me, and have been said by a lot of respected people in the psionic community.  In fact, I don't recall ANY theories contradicting the ones I have stated being said by any respected members of the psionic community.  So, if all of the older, more experienced, very respected psions who have done research for more than twice of my lifetime (I'm 18 ) in the community are supporting my claims, doesn't that seem a bit...coincidental?...or maybe we should be noticing something about this?

Heroin addicts get some pretty nasty withdrawl too.  Doesn't mean heroin was always required by their bodies and minds to function.

I'm not making the &quot;It's not scientifically proven so it's wrong!&quot; argument.  We're talking about a branch of &quot;science&quot; that's been relegated to the classification of occult by society as a whole.  I'm simply saying to keep in mind that we're not talking about something that can be easily proven and that we must look at trends (and interpret them logically) rather than senselessly badger each other for &quot;evidence&quot;.

Just because I haven't personally witnessed everything I use to back up my theory doesn't make it relatively unsupported.  I have checked with many others who all have come to the same conclusion independently.  Which leads to the question of &quot;How much support is enough?&quot;  However I believe this is ultimately a question with an inherent flaw because it requires a human opinion on a subject which many are deliberately ignorant to (psi vamp or not).  You might as well ask a room of blind men what colour your clothes are....

And when did I call any theory evil?  I said convincing other that the act of stealing something from another for no reason other than selfish desires is fine is an issue when being expressed in this forum.  Many people here are not very well versed in the behaviour of energies and it could lead them down a very rough path should they take certain advice.

Why do you assume I am the only one who can and does support this theory?  It's not just based on the experience of one 19 year old.  I'm merely expressing it here.  Plus, isn't this whole forum based on the idea that personal experiences have significant merit?
<br />

<br />
As for your claim that your theories are uncontradicted, how is that an indicator of it's correctness?  People are like sheep and enjoy going with the herd.  Not being contradicted is hardly surprising if you come off as knowing more on the subject than others.  Which isn't terribly hard to do in a forum designed to get people started with psionics.

That's true.  But the FIRST time that they actually feel better is by draining energy from someone.  And the only time after that is when they drain energy.  Another interesting point is in order to do this, one must learn how to do it.  They seem to know how to do it instictivly.  Now, if for the first time they ever drain energy and they feel better, that tells us something.  They also didn't practice this until it happened, it just happenend.  Put two and two together, and it just makes sense...or at least points us in that direction.

I know, I'm talking about the psionic society as a whole...or at least most people on this site.  This isn't easily proven, exactly.  That's why we shouldn't fear it or label it until it is proven.  It's like the &quot;The sky is falling!&quot; story.

I never said you haven't personally witnessed everything.  I was referring to when you were talking about the trend you noticed.  
<br />

<br />
I believe on this topic &quot;How much support is enough?&quot;  I don't think there will ever be enough support.  There will always be that one guy in the back of the room saying &quot;I don't believe you.&quot;  Also, you're misunderstanding.  I never called your theory evil.  But there are a lot of people that believe that psi-vamps are evil, even though not everyone is convinced of their existance, and in the psionic society's eyes, they are still just a theory.

Again, I don't assume you are the only one that supports this theory.  There are a lot of people on both sides of this theory.  But since you are the only one who is putting up an intelligent conversation with me (and is still debating this with me), I tend to aim some of my questions at you.  My apologies.  And yes, this forum is based on personal experience, but (as you well know) this forum tends to take the &quot;white lab coat&quot; approach to psionics, and you have to treat it as such.  With that certain approach, personal experiences don't hold much water.  (unless of course they are experienced by a &quot;respected&quot; member...which is unfair)
<br />

<br />
Now, I wasn't claiming that my theory (the one I am representing, it isn't my theory) is uncontradicted.  I was saying that a lot of more experienced people, and people who have studied this topic for quite a while agree with this theory.  And, I know your analogy of people, it is very true (except I use cows in my analogy  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> )
<br />

<br />
Also, I'm not &quot;coming off&quot; as someone that knows more about this subject than others.  I'm just stating the theory that I am representing and believe in.  If you believe that I am coming off as someone that knows more about this subject, then does that mean you believe I do?  Also (not to be offensive) take a look at the phasing thread you posted in.  You seemed to &quot;come off&quot; as an expert on the subject, even though very little is known about it.  I'm not taking advantage of the &quot;n00bs&quot; here.  I have helped a lot of them out, and will continue to until the site is archived.  I know what it was like to be a &quot;n00b&quot;, and I know what it was like to not have someone help you out.  Don't accuse me of taking advantage of people here.  I have to &quot;come off&quot; like this in a debate with you because you aren't a &quot;n00b,&quot; you know a more than they do, so in order to be efficient in conversing with you, I need to use my knowledge of the topic and talk about it just as much as you.  That's what keeps this thread growing, and let's both of us learn just a bit more.
