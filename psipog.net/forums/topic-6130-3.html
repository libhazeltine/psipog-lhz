			did anyone think of this.  Maybe peter is sylar.  He can copy powers and maybe in the future he learns that taking the brain lets him keep the power permanently.  Hiro may have given him the scar before peter used his power to go to the past and got stuck there.  The cheerleader might have been the only power he didn't get, thus they have to save her.

okay peter is the copier guy... hmm okay im not good with names
<br />

<br />

<br />
if that is how it turns out then im gonna go kick you because you gave it away.
<br />

<br />
i thought DL was sylar but then it turned out he was just a phaser. was it DL that was in the bar witht he telepathic cop? Because the black guy there was sheilding so that the cop couldnt hear his thoughts. did anyone notice that?
<br />

<br />
also whats with that kid.... DL and the hot mom's son. If both his parents have those powers then he should have one too that he'll develop later in life most likley. thats hot though having both your parents with awsome powers.
<br />

<br />
lemme ask this
<br />
the hot mom.... her bad half seems extremly strong. she thre DL across the room ffs. Is that a power or just evilness?

			I hope tonight is a good episode. And no, the black guy in the bar with Matt (telepath) is not DL. Its the guy that hangs out with the cheerleader's dad. He seems to be able to stop people from using their powers, and ... take someone's mind from their <span style="font-style: italic">body</span>? &quot;Clean him out.&quot; and the guy in the hospital had no memory of the cheerleader, and he was asking why she was calling him whatever his name was. And I don't think she's dead, what would someone who can pass through stuff do if they put their hand inside you? I don't see the fatal harm unless he solidified while his hand was there. Maybe its a shock to her body and she's passing out, but that's about it imo. Maybe I'm wrong. Also I can see how Sylar is psychokinetic, other then having multiple powers. But what could he want with brains...
<br />

<br />
I guess I have to agree with the rest of you, aren't we all just hoping that the blond woman's evil personality takes over and does one last strip tease  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
One thing I liked and noticed is the woman who is working for the cheerleader's dad said &quot;Should I bring in the <span style="font-weight: bold">precog</span>&quot; <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
It's stupid I'm posting this now because the show is like just about to start... but... oh wells. I guess I'll edit later XD

That would be Isaac, right?  Just curious....
<br />

<br />
I don't think Peter is Sylar.  If he was, Hiro would have said something about it, possibly warning him NOT to become like that, in some way.  All he did was give him a message of hope, to save the world.
<br />

<br />
Not something he'd do for a serial killer.  Especially given Hiro's obsession with he Superhero Code.  He may have only gone to Peter because he'd be able to move when he stopped time, but I'm sure he would have tried to sway him from corruption, with something.
<br />

<br />
But overall, I don't think Peter's the kind of guy to do that kind of thing.  And wasn't Sylar noted as &quot;Patient Zero&quot;?  And I'm pretty sure Mohinder's father KNEW him, so I don't think it was just some random time warp deal.
<br />

<br />
I mean, he could've lied, but I don't see why.

			well HEROES just keeps getting better and better...Great episode last night i thought.. The one thing that i want to know is...What kind of power does the little boy have..the blonde moms son?  I thought that was freaking excellent how he made the phone work and talk to his mom, and when his dad came over it sounded dead....that is just awesome...As for the cheerleader, she got caught by her brother...which im starting to wonder maybe somehwere down the line that her brother has a power? Or maybe he will become a bad guy and try to get rid of the HEROE's..but only time will tell....

did u all like it?
