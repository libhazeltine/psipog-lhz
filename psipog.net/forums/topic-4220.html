			Hello, this maybe have been an already topic'd question, I checked, but not that hard. Anyways...
<br />

<br />
How much does distance effect the strength, because:
<br />

<br />
I'm a newbie at this, and I haven't done it yet, and am looking for a way for something to practice with will kind of 'be there all the time' so i thought something like a key on a string would be nice, but it's quite far(about 3 or 4 feet) and i don't think it'd work so well for someone  who hasn't had success yet.

			Pinwheel is easiest, as pendulum will just freely spin and move in the very very slightest of winds, try a tinfoil pinwheel, with windows, doors, cats, and small bears mouths closed, so theres no chance of a draft.
<br />
As for the distance, no there really isnt a distance limit to Pk, some people on here, can do it from 8 inches or so, others can do it from 50ft or so. Distance is not an object though, control is in my opinion, better, read NI's article on power vs control is you need help with the topic: <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=113" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=113</a>
<br />
As for being a newb to this, make sure you have some success and actually completely believe in Pk, otherwise if you move onto distance before you can properly move it, you wont get anywhere, remember kids (metaforical term) start small, and work your way up, also, dont do drugs and stay in school.

			The distance does not matter, your mind may think it is harder from a longer distance but it isn't called Tele(far,distant) Kinesis(movement) for nothing.
<br />
It does not matter how far away the object is, as long as you are connected with it you can move it, even if it is on the other side of the earth.

</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Apollo wrote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">There is no limit of distance.</span>  What i mean is that you can create a psiball on the other side of the earth.  You can do telepathy on a person on the other side of the earth.  You can move a psiwheel on the otherside of the earth.  It is a big problem when someone has the sense that they cant do PK from more than a foot away; or they cant do telepathy to someone they are not looking at.  That is a huge mental block and can restrict your success.  People use their hands when making a psiball or doing PK to delete some of the mind's automatic sense of distance.  When your hand is in front of the object you are trying to move, your mind knows it can move it by touching it.  That is a good place to start rather than having your brain thing there is no way of moving it.  Hope this helps people</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I have done that yay. Distance doesn't matter whatsoever. I live in england and I've span wheels in america. There is no difference. The annoying thing is that I can do that but not spin one under a container.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			Furthest I've gone is about 4 inches....but I guess that distance will increase as I practice.

			Pendulum is not affected by wind. It's affected when you are really blowing air on it. Before moving the key on a string, try just shaking the string. After, you can attach a small object to a string and, after, the key. You can also move a toothpick floating on water. These exercise are very simple.

Hmmm... mental block? Try breaking it via the standard method.
<br />

<br />
Have someone in America randomly make you move their wheel on their webcam, and continue to do so for awhile, then tell them to (without telling you) put the cam up so that you don't get a distortion, but the wheel is still under a container. Then, you'll have broken the block once they back the camera up and show you that you were looking through one glass side of a mixing bowl, or something. 
<br />

<br />
Seems reasonable, and it should work.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
