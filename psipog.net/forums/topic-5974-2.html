The burden of proof is on those who claim they exist, such as stunning intellects like yourself.  Sure, skeptics can deny they exist.  That's very easy.  Look, I'll do it right now.
<br />

<br />
I deny the existence of spiritual organs and chakras.
<br />

<br />
Very simple, indeed.  However, it is fallacious to conclude, just because their existence hasn't been proven, that they do not exist, and surely no scientist/researcher will say that they're 100% sure that they don't.  This is not because they believe chakras may exist, but because they're smart enough to understand that absolute certainties are far and few between.
<br />

<br />
The proof required here is that which shows that they do, in fact, exist, and without such proof, it's safe to assume that they don't.

I am saying exactly what I just said.  I'll paraphrase for clarity.
<br />

<br />
1) The burden of proof is on those who believe spiritual organs exist.  It is their task to prove they exist.  Skeptics do not have the task of proving that they don't.
<br />

<br />
2) Virtually no scientist will say that they're 100% certain spiritual organs don't exist because it would be fallacious to do so.  If something has not yet been proven to exist, it is an error to conclude, with absolute certainty, that it doesn't.  However, these scientists will still assume with 99.9% certainty that spiritual organs do not exist because there is no evidence to prove otherwise.
<br />

<br />
Trying to frame this as a black/white/gray thing is oversimplifying it.

Once again, it's not that simple.  You cannot frame this in a black/white/gray thing simply because there is no proof.  I'm sure to you this would be all white because you believe in them, without objective proof.  To a scientist, this would be all black because they don't believe in them without objective proof.  Anyone else who really doesn't care would probably be in the gray area.
<br />

<br />
Does this get us closer to figuring out whether spiritual organs exist or not?  Nope.  Does this framework do anything useful besides spin my conclusion as weak justification for your belief?  Nope.

Everyone, <span style="font-weight: bold">relax</span>. As has been said before, the concept of Chakras is belief. Nothing more, nothing less.
<br />

<br />
However, there is pretty much universal consensus regarding the location of the so-called &quot;energy centres&quot;. This makes it easier to describe certain visualizations. Which is easier to say (and type): 
<br />

<br />
&quot;move that psi-ball up to your third eye&quot; or
<br />
&quot;move that psi-ball up to your forehead, approximately an inch above the point between the eyebrows&quot;?
<br />

<br />
I'd say the former. Just about everyone knows the location of the &quot;chakras&quot;. So, IMO, the only semi-scientific use of the chakras is as location terms. Kind of like a psionic shorthand.
<br />

<br />

			First, what's this function you're talking about? Just for curiosity's sake.
<br />

<br />
Second, you seem to be assuming that the so-called &quot;spiritual organs&quot; are physical parts of the corporeal body. Chances are, if you believe in chakras, energy centres, spiritual organs, call them what you will, then you also believe in bodies other than the physical flesh-and-blood one. These bodies would, in theory, have very different organs than our physical ones have. Some of these spiritual organs might overlap some physical ones, and that's what we're trying to determine.
<br />

<br />
Don't dismiss the possibility of some things too soon. 
<br />

<br />
Scientifically speaking, we probably haven't found spiritual organs and other such things because no big-name, well-accredited scientists are willing to place their lucrative careers on the line for this research. And out of those who have, they're probably keeping their research secret until they have utterly irrefutable evidence that convinces the world beyond a shadow of a doubt that these things exist. If there's any doubt left after all the evidence is put forward, it's very likely that these scientists would lose their credibility, just by the controversiality of the topic at hand.
<br />

<br />
I like your skepticism, Niushirra. You bring up some very good points. But we all need to keep both sides in mind. If someone intensely argues that they exist, I try to argue that they don't. If someone intensely argues that they don't, I'll try to argue that they do.
