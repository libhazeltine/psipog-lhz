			Hi everybody!!
<br />
Well, i was just reading an article from Gnome about sensitivity, awareness expanding and stuff (Sensitivity Manual; How to Spark it and Keep it Growing) and he (or she.. ?) said something about feeling others intents in the chat messages (msn, mirc and stuff). he could say if the people was talking in a angry way, or calm, and stuff. and this made me think: wew, i am always (or almost always) able to feel, or to know what kind of &quot;mood&quot;, or &quot;intention&quot; (something like that, i can't find a better word) the guy passes through the message. and think too that i'm not the only one, if i ask any of you who are reading this, at least some (if not the big majority) will say you can do that same!
<br />

<br />
now an observation: all of us, who were born, or live in this internet times, we, the guys from the internet generation, who use pc's and eletronic devices to comunicate a lot, some of us using it more often than the regular &quot;face to face&quot; talking (using myself as an example, i talk much more via internet (msn, foruns and stuff) than with my mouth), sometimes complain (i do at least) about this eletronical relationships being very cold, and feeling-less (sorry if i made a word up). we just see leters, and don't see facial expressions, body language, neither voice tones. so it's really cold and simple, objective, you know. for that reason, there are zillions of what we call &quot;emoticons&quot;, which are responsible for showing emotions like happiness, sadness, expressions and all this kind of stuff. they are acually a plague that makes reading messages a very hard job, with all those jumping and twinkling letters and so on. man, i hate those stuff.
<br />
well, back to the topic: i think human beings have the need for showing/seeing/feeling signs of emotions. we aren't machines you know. we like to see people laugh, to tease'em and make them angry, calling you bad names +D and so on.
<br />
later ^^
<br />
now, could we be passing through an evolutional process, that is making us more sensitive to emotions/intents and so on, as we are using more and more eletronic devices to comunicate? so we can write stuff on the screen, and send it with our emotions, or the people who is reading is able to &quot;catch&quot; what you mean and were feeling at that time by mental means, as the leters can't show this signs?
<br />
most of us (as i stated ealier) have already experienced feeling what the other person is trying to tell. it could be an adaptative change due to this new kind of far away comunication plus the need of the human being to to feel emotions.
<br />
what you all think about it?
<br />
sorry if i didn't make myself clear enough, it took a long time to write this.. to find good words to express myself and to make the text a good read, but i not always able to do it.

			Personally, I don't think this has its roots in psionics, rather in psychology. As we get used to communicating online, we learn to read between the lines better, picking up the subtle differences in the language used to better understand the meaning behind it. Where, of course, those of us who use empathy in everday life are no doubt connecting as we do so naturally, I don't think the rest of the world is magically becoming more sensitive - just learning to better understand people with minimal input.
<br />

<br />
Just my opinion, though.
