			Scary? I love sleep paralysis... it's freaking awesome. There's just something entertaining to me about trying to move around when my muscles aren't responding. Now, I must admit, I've never 'seen' anything while stuck in sleep paralysis, and the only time I heard something, it just sounded like electrical noise, and I knew what was going on anyways. So, maybe that's why it doesn't scare me, or maybe it's just that I don't fear pain or death.

			I've never experienced sleep paralysis, but I kind of want to. Though I think if i did I would freak out completely. If you panic during sleep paralysis can anything bad happen?

			Well, I do know that sometimes I realise that I'm dreaming and part of my normal, thinking mind returns as it would be when I'm awake. I then try to move or wake up but i can't. So I'll assume this is sleep paralysis. This usually happens when I dont want to go to sleep but I do.
<br />

<br />
I've only experienced eye-open sleep paralysis once, and I had lights on at the time so it was cool. 
<br />

<br />
I could feel that I had a body but i couldnt feel anything specific. I could feel my breathing though but I dont think that I had any control over it. I tried to move with all the will that I could summon but I failed. I remember sort of slipping into sleep several times. Eventually, I woke up; quite nervous. 
<br />

<br />
And I was lying on my side. And i thought that such sleep-paralysis and the Old Hag phenomenon only occured when one lay on one's back.

			Hmm, but shouldn't it be possible to go OBE from sleep paralysis? Cause if you're aware of it shouldn't it be the same as slipping out from a LD?

I wouldn't dismiss the possibility.
<br />

<br />
However, in sleep paralysis, your conscious mind is in a very high state of activity. To go OBE, you need to be in a very low state of activity.
<br />

<br />
Therefore, I'd say that practically it wouldn't be possible, with the caveat that, if you experience sleep paralysis very regularly then you may be able to use it.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I had sleep paralysis precisely once, and I am not eager to repeat the experience... at the time it was EXTREMELY frightening.

			Ah! Sleep paralysis! Also known as hypnogogia (although, technically, I think that term refers to going from awake to asleep, not asleep to awake) and &quot;The Old Hag.&quot; It can often be coupled with visual or auditory halucinations. I have heard plenty of times that it can be very scary, and very realistic. People have often reported hearing footsteps or seeing a shadowy figure approaching them or feeling like they are being choked or crushed. I've never experienced it, but as scary as it sounds, I want to really bad. It just sounds like it'd be cool. Anyway, I've heard the key to getting rid of it is to relax, close your eyes if you can, and remind yourself that none of what you are seeing/hearing is real and that it will pass.
