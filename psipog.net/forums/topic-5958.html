			I wish that telepathy was accepted as legitimate and that people could talk to a Dr. to a psychologist about problems they are having with their abilities and not have those people  just automatically assume you're crazy.

I would be afraid to ever ven bring up the fact that I am telepathic to a Dr. or a psychologist. Are there professionals that accept that some people are telepathic or Psi and not  assume they're insane for thinking they have these abilities?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			It really depends on the person. I've had psychologists who believe that the mind is capable of much more than it is thought to be able to do, and I've had some (most) that would slap a straight jacket on me if I ever mentioned something as far out as TP or TK.

			Why not do a little demonstration?

<br />
I don't meen say &quot;Hey, let me show you something&quot;. I meen just do it infront of him/her. This is the telepathy forum, but I don't know how well that'd work. I'd say its easyest to do with macro telekinesis if you are able to preform in that area.
<br />

<br />
Pick something light in the room, and move it. Such as a straw, or something that won't put up much resistance. No pressure, if you can't do it it does not prove you can't do it since she won't know you were trying it in the first place.

			I'm not skilled in telekinesis, macro or micro, but that is an interesting idea. To be honest, I kind of don't care anymore if people believe I am telepathic or not. I believe I am, and I know what I can do. I am secure in that.

			I feel you there in a way. I don't care what people think of my own abilities, but I do care about people believing in Psi. As you said, it'd be nice if people didnt think you were crazy just because you say your Telepathic.
<br />

<br />
To me denying the existence of Psi is like denying the existence of life. Life is about as hard as Psi to prove or define, but no body denys its existence.
