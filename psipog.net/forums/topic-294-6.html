			If I told my Mum she'd ridicule me. I'm basing this on when I asked if we had any books on Wicca and she laughed. She would think it's just a phase. I don't know how my Dad woudl react.

My besties, on the other hand, all know that I do this. I've even gotten two of them to TRY. I think one of their psi balls actually worked. So, yeah, I don't know If i'll tell my parents.

			My mom would believe me if I cna prove it, but I know my father wouldn't.  He is way too close minded.  My mom and I are par tof a ghost hunting group here in Indiana, adn as such we meet psychics fairly regularly.  However, the one I see more than any other I personally think is full of crap.  My mom thinks hes real though, so maybe she would believe me a little easier than i thought.  She has had OBE's before.  I suck at energy work, and I have no telepathy or empathy experience, so teh only thing I could use is PK to prove it.

ya know, it's people like my parents who give christians a bad name. they just won't except that they could be wrong

btw: i am a christian, but i try to be more open minded than the rest of my family. and i definatley believe that the bible is open for interpretation and not necessarily to be taken literaly

			hrm...i've been a &quot;closet-psion&quot; for about 3-4 years now. i think that once I could honest to god prove to them that i can do things with the particular knowledge I have, then i'd tell them. I think my mom would be cool with it, my grandmother on her side was a faith healer and my mother &quot;sees&quot; things from time to time (apparantly my dead aunt told her she had cancer, and sure enough she was right). my dad would laugh and get me to do a sport. i would expect full support from my pets however, cus thats just the way my dogs are   <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

Well, I tried telling my mom (I don't have a dad) and, i didn't get much from it, she pretty much thought i was crazy.  This was a few years ago when I started.  I haven't brought it up yet.  Same goes for my brother (He is 9 years older than me).  I recently tried talking to him about it again and he claims it to accomplish anything within a small time span due to monks doing working their chi all their life (Thats not how he said it, but its pretty much what he said).  So, I have limited time to when I can practice so people don't find me crazy <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.

			I've already been labeled as &quot;Crazy&quot; by everyone else so I'm pretty open about it and practice whenever it's convienient. It helps to keep up that air of &quot;craziness&quot; so people won't bother you.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Wow, thers alot of horror storys here (Like Apollos). I admire ya'll that have your parents knowing. Nothing to hide. Seems fairly logical even if they punish you. Worst comes to worst you could learn TK, RV, or something obvious to prove like that later on. Still a hard thing to do, having the people you love most looking at your like your stupid, insane, or otherwise damaged.
<br />

<br />
I've been thinking about telling my parents. That is why I have started learning TK. Seems like the most logical step is not to say anything about it, leave a website up on the PC, or anything like that. But simply to wad up a small piece of paper (such as trash), or a BB and toss it on the table. Watch a movie with 'em, and no pressure. If you can get it to move, and they notice, you've got your proof. If you can't get it to move, such as choaking, theres no more reason for them to believe its fake because they don't know you were attempting it.

			*shakes head* I haven't told my parents about this... I don't think there's a point to do that, although I might do it when I start getting results... Or maybe I'll just keep it a secret, and turn off the TV when they're watching it, and pull people's legs... But point is, no, my parents don't know.

			i chose 4:probably wont tell them until i have solid evidence. i tried PK recentely without much results and im now onto psi balls with success...and although my mum can be very understanding and supportive (she once told me she wouldnt care which religion i chose to undertake(im catholic now) and she told me she wouldnt mind if i became a budhist too). however, a few nights ago we went to a live derren brown show he asked us whether we believed in phychic abilities and she said she didnt. what could i say except no. nevertheless, im still going to continue practicing. as for my stepdad, HA! hes the most physics obsessed person ive ever known. not all in a bad way tho. i once made the mistake of introducing him to OBE'S and he thought it was plain bull. he thought that  every website on the web is just fake and is winding everyone up! i beg to differ...
<br />
even if i do tell my mum, i probably wont tell my stepdad since he wont take in a word of it and say its all unlogocal and breaks the laws of physics and sh*t. *sigh* some people...

			I'll tell them when I'm able to make visible psiballs at will, or be able to affect electronics from a distance. I don't understand this thing with 'programming' really. I know all kinda small things I don't need yet, but I don't know the basics of programming! My question is, HOW do you program psiballs to do dfferent tasks? Do I really need to shield them to be able to throw them? How do I shield other things than myself? I don't get it... O_o

Serneholt, there are many various ways to program Psi. From Visuilization to simply 'willing' it. The Art of Programming is something you should read, if you have not already. <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html155" target="_blank">art-outline-to-shielding.html155</a>
