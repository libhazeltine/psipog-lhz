			Ok, one day I was sitting in band.(this happened awhile ago)  We had nothing to do and I just let my mind wonder.  There was this guy I didn't like and I imagined I was talking bad about him to his face.  I did that for about five minutes.  The the guy walks by and says &quot;Stop talking about me Greg!&quot;  I was like, WTF!!!  I said I wasn't and he said &quot;oh, you didn't?&quot;  Then he walked back to his seat.  I asked the girl sitting next to me if I had said anything, because I thought I might have said what I was thinking without realizing it.  She said I hadn't said anything the entire time.  
<br />
My point is that could I have told my sub-con to telepathically suggest to him that I was talking about him?  I visualized it and everything, I just didn't include psi in my visualization.

			Yeah, it's strange, it's been proven that cat's can &quot;sense&quot; something that normal ppl can't. That's why they usually start to run from place to place [and stop usually grabbing on a wall.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />]. <a href="http://www.davidicke.com/index.php/" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.davidicke.com/index.php/</a> is one of those researchers who has been searching for the real universe. If interested of his work I suggest that you go to youtube and search for David Icke, especially that Illuminati is worth of watching [lasts something like 2 hours..] and it's cutted in pieces there, but you may always buy a dvd <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Let's see what everyone thinks about this guy <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
