			I think this is due to the fact your breathing shallows when you're asleep. And since an obe requires (as far as I know) that you put your body to sleep. 
<br />

<br />
I had the same problem for about week last month (or very similar at least), and my advice is that you just divert your mind from your breathing. You'll breath whether you will it or not. And if you are deprived of oxygen, your body will eventually knock ya out and take over. So I simply worry about your lungs and focus on the blackness in front of you (not too much though ;D)

			When you try and AP/OOBE your mind is wandering away from relizing that your breathing.  I have this feeling all the time, you suddenly think AHH im not breathing ,and it ruins your whole experience.  To minimize this effect, when you relize that your &quot;not&quot; breathing, just dont care.  In reality you are breating, but your too relaxed to notice.  Your body wouldnt just up and let you stop breathing would it? <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Your body will take care of itself while trying to oobe, so dont worry about it.  Hope this helps~

			You just have to go into the &quot;meh&quot; state of mind where you ignore the thought of &quot;Ahhh I'm not breathing!!&quot;. It takes practice but you get the hand of it....

			You know what? The first time I AP/OBEed, it felt like I was suffocating &gt;.&lt; I haven't been able to AP/OBE since. So you have my sympathies. If you figure out a way around that, let me know.

			The same thing happens to me. It almost feels like your chest is crushing your lungs.  
<br />

<br />
I believe it probably can be relieved through learning some breathing techniques, or maybe that's how it's supposed to be.

			sorry to ruin everyone's fun, but that's actually a sleeping disorder.  People wake up in the middle of the night to find that they can't breath and their throat feels like it's closing up.  The disorder is called &quot;Sleep induced swallowing syndrome.&quot;  Really, look it up.  Even if you're not entirely asleep, it can happen.  It used to happen to me, and it's really terrifying.  Maybe it is part of OBE's too, lots of people say it is, but I really don't know.
