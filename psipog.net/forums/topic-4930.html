Sparkz/Pantsparty/JOHHNYBEGOOD: Bashing other people philosopies, religion and lifestyle is a sign that you are sub-conciously comfortable with your own practices. It is also a sign of ignorance, intolerance and bigotry, I do not appreciate the Vampire quip either for that simply means that you do not understand the concept of such. I do not come onto this sight and begin telling everyone that Psionics is a rank, useless pile of rubbish, but I do not because it is called being mature...

I'm inclined to agree with Corbin here, fellas.  Please be a bit more respectful.  I think Corbin has given due respect to psionics, we should return the favor.
