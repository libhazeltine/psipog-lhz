			Hmm I don't know if this has any relation, but this is why this happens to me. I usually get heavily into practice and get objects moving fast, and good. Then after a while I'll just notice a decline. It will take longer to get it to move and it wont move nearly as much. From what I've observed with me its my expectancy of the object moving. Usually when you're new and extremly motivated you're really interested and expect the object to spin, roll or slide. After prolonged practice it seems, that diminishes. 
<br />

<br />
I guess what I'm saying is that you are no longer willing the object to move nearly as much as when you first started. Sorry if it was confusing, but thats how it works for me.

			haha yes got one t go. or maybye you changed of free will. anyways samethings happend to me when i first started the uyta books. it because all the new information is overwhelming.  because your like noe im about to enter focus and you try not to think about the object but when you try not to think about it you think about it even more. ive been in focs a couple times and its like the wierdest feeling ever. i can move the psiwheel withouth my hands only whn im in deep focus. but anyways th  reason is is becasue your still proxessing new information itll pass in a couple days

			That sounds foolish, who WOULDN'T want to keep going? And have the motivation and the drive and the determination to keep themselves getting better and better. It's simple. Think of all the people who are out there tking at the same moment you are, and think of how much better they're doing than you, you will connect closer to whatever the source of psi and the ability to pk/tk is. You WILL do better if you practice, but you also have to stay motivated. This is one of the next phases of human evolution, and you're one of the lucky ones with a mind open enough to walk that road.
<br />

<br />
Cleanse yourself of fear, ahmed. Fears are the keys to all of the doors, and a different shape for each one. Conquer the fears, and control their ability to unlock the doors of potential.
<br />

<br />
This goes for everyone.
<br />

<br />
(on a side note, i've recently started being able to macro pk, and im doing quite well, so i'm not talking out of my ass).
<br />

<br />
And ahmed, I believe the result of the damage to you via doing PK is a direct result of a subconscious fear that pk might be wrong or hurt you. Fear manifests. Transmute the fear into it's polar opposite; courage.
<br />
If you are from egyst, then perhaps you are muslim. I respect the muslim religion greatly, for it's book is poetic (from what i have had read to me) and open to much philosophical interpretation. One of the stories in the Quran describe dark mysticism and a human's ability to do &quot;unnatural&quot; things such as move objects without any apparent physical means. The story pins the explanation for these acts of &quot;magic&quot; of a race of creature called the Djinn. The Djinn were, and according to the book, are, a race bred of fire. They appear as shadows to humans, when they choose to show themselves at all. they are not an evil race, for the book explains that God first made them, and earth was their home while we were still monkies, or even salamanders for that matter. When God (allah) created the Humans, He made them to be a more creative, curious and mischievious race of beings. new as they were, they were weak. The Djinn had powers beyond even current human comprehension. God took care of the humans and kept a close eye on them, giving them all of his divine attention. The Djinn grew jealous and began to hate humans.
<br />

<br />
To make a long story short, the Djinn supposedly, according to the book, manipulated certain humans who craved power and went to them seeking help.They (the djinn) would scan the minds of people and report the thoughts to the man they made a pact with. This made them seem to have vast knowhow of the minds of other men (tp etc) The djinn would also lift the man of pact, other people, or objects, making the individual tied to the djinn seem to have the ability to move things mentally.
<br />

<br />
I won't dismiss the possible existence of a race of beings similar to the djinn. I do know, however, that i've done successfully, remote viewing (sort of) telepathy, empathy, micro pk, made many many many psiballs (didn't flare i don't think) and now, latest on my list, macro pk.
<br />

<br />
i didn't make a pact with any shadow people (that im aware of lol). I can still do these things. 
<br />

<br />
Have more than confidence. Have courage.

Actually, I really agree with this. You lose that motivation you once had because after you start moving psiwheels, moving objects becomes less exciting than it was initially. I've really never thought of it that way! Nice work!

			thank you all , you all are good people ^^.
<br />

<br />
but i think you misunderstand me when i said i will stop tk and start from 0 that mean i will not stop tk but i will wait for while to get more information then start to use it again .
<br />

<br />
something is realy confusing psipog is make tk is something easy talking about it as easy skill but in the other hand of uyta talking about tk as it is higher level of understanding the mind work and it talk in complexed way , and now we all are not completly sure from the information we get .
<br />
in the sametime im now confused because uyta have somethings that i was wondering about and somethings are right so that is confusing me which one is right so i need more information and maybe i can mix the information for better tk but i hope i can understand uyta lol. 
<br />

<br />
ofcourse i go through exciting things like tk and my mind was going to blow up lol it was strange feeling and strange experience .
<br />

<br />
tk is one of my dreams so i will never stop learning it even it will cost my life <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /><img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> .
