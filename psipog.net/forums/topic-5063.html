			Hi, I'm experiencing difficulties like REALLY slow and pathetic movement of the psiwheel. So, i did a &quot;virus-scan&quot; on what is wrong with me, i closed my tried to think of the reasons. After around 15 minutes, i came to the conclusion that the problem was that i thought that perfect control over the subc was required to perform PK. If i had perfect control over my subc, wouldnt it then be my conscious mind?
<br />

<br />
I figured that i just needed to let my conscious mind down to perform PK and not to control my subc.
<br />

<br />
Any tips how? Other than the sublimal blaster...

			I think that the sub-c controls PK, so if you try to ask your sub-c to use PK it should work. Do what feels right. I don't think it's ever possible to be completely control over the sub-c, as it feels like sub-c = 90% and concious = 10% of the whole concious mind. I wouldn't think it's scientifically proven to be that way, it just really feels that way ya know? Don't try to control it, trust it, befriend it, but try not to think it is apart of you.

Your sentences seems strange, it was really hard to read. I would appreciate it if you edited your post to patch it up a bit.
