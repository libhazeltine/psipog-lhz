			This is a new one guys.  I havn't felt this one ever before, so I thought I'd share.  Less than 20 mins ago i was meditating, only for aobut a half hour.  And it was all normal.  I was breathing into my naval kinda of area, mainly for a place to focus.  I was doing this for maybe fifteen mins and the the area became cold as i breathed, which was kinda different, usually it just throbs strangly.  I didn't care, so i kept going.  And then i took a break from that and just sat back and breathed.  And then outa no where I started spinning, like rediculously fast and I tried to stop for a second then decided to just follow where ever this thing was taking me.  And I just kinda felt like my conciouis exploded all over the house.  I could hear my dad's tv upstairs like it was right in front of me, my depth preception was way off, I instantly became utterly peaceful, I couldn't get angry tight now if i tried, and things are seeming to grow and shrink, it's pretty damn trippy in my opinion.  Overall it's one of the better states i've felt that has emerged from meditation.

			You should look up onb the experience Eckhart Tolle had right before he became enlightened. It is somewhat similar, but his was perhaps even more intense, as he lost consciousness and canot remember what happened to him from before he wake up.

Congrats on the experience, nice to hear good things happen to you.

You think so? That was at the beginning of the book, maybe I'll check into that. (Probably not though  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />)

Seems like a cool guy, Oprah says his book is essential to your spirituality and who am I to ague with Oprah!  lol  But I didn't find anything about what you said, can you explain what his experience was?

			This was his experience as he explains in his book:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">&quot;I have little use for the past and rarely think about it; however, I would briefly like to tell you how I came to be a spiritual teacher and how ‘The Power of Now’ came into existence. 
<br />

<br />
Until my thirtieth year, I lived in a state of almost continuous anxiety interspersed with periods of suicidal depression. It feels now as if I am talking about some past lifetime or somebody else’s life. 
<br />

<br />
Awakening 
<br />
One night not long after my twenty-ninth birthday, I woke up in the early hours with a feeling of absolute dread. I had woken up with such a feeling many times before, but this time it was more intense than it had ever been. The silence of the night, the vague outlines of the furniture in the dark room, the distant noise of a passing train – everything felt so alien, so hostile, and so utterly meaningless that it created in me a deep loathing of the world. The most loathsome thing of all, however, was my own existence. What was the point in continuing to live with this burden of misery? Why carry on with this continuous struggle? I could feel that a deep longing for annihilation, for non-existence, was now becoming much stronger than the instinctive desire to continue to live. 
<br />

<br />
‘I cannot live with myself any longer.’ This was the thought that kept repeating itself in my mind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a peculiar thought it was. ‘Am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two of me: the ‘I’ and the ‘self’ that ‘I’ cannot live with.’ ‘Maybe,’ I thought, ‘only one of them is real.’ 
<br />

<br />
I was so stunned by this strange realization that my mind stopped. I was fully conscious, but there were no more thoughts. Then I felt drawn into what seemed like a vortex of energy. It was a slow movement at first and then accelerated. I was gripped by an intense fear, and my body started to shake. I heard the words ‘resist nothing,’ as if spoken inside my chest. I could feel myself being sucked into a void. It felt as if the void was inside myself rather than outside. Suddenly, there was no more fear, and I let myself fall into that void. I have no recollection of what happened after that. 
<br />

<br />
I was awakened by the chirping of a bird outside the window. I had never heard such a sound before. My eyes were still closed, and I saw the image of a precious diamond. Yes, if a diamond could make a sound, this is what it would be like. I opened my eyes. The first light of dawn was filtering through the curtains. Without any thought, I felt, I knew, that there is infinitely more to light than we realize. That soft luminosity filtering through the curtains was love itself. Tears came into my eyes. I got up and walked around the room. I recognized the room, and yet I knew that I had never truly seen it before. Everything was fresh and pristine, as if it had just come into existence. I picked up things, a pencil, an empty bottle, marvelling at the beauty and aliveness of it all. That day I walked around the city in utter amazement at the miracle of life on earth, as if I had just been born into this world. 
<br />

<br />
Bliss
<br />
For the next five months, I lived in a state of uninterrupted deep peace and bliss. After that, it diminished somewhat in intensity, or perhaps it just seemed to because it became my natural state. I could still function in the world, although I realized that nothing I ever did could possibly add anything to what I already had.&quot;</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

			Very cool.  Thanks for typing it out for me.  Sorry it took a while for me to respond.  Psipog decided to hate me for some reason, lol.
<br />

<br />
I've had exeriences like that.  Like one time I just kinda suddenly felt like I sunk into the floor.  Then I started feeling just super pissed and angry and sad at everything wrong that was being done to the Earth.  So I got all angry hippy and was plannin on doing somthing, but nothing eventually happened, but that experience definetly changed me permenetly.

I'm pretty sure that what pepsiboy said is his sorta his &quot;line&quot; or &quot;catch phrase.&quot; Because I have seen him use it before.
