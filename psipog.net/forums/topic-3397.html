			Okay so just a while ago (about 10 minutes) I decided today might be the day I move the psi-wheel. I had tried and tried for about 4 days. In those days any small movement to me I thought, you know it could just be the wind. So today I had the air conditioning on. It was kinda blowin on the psiwheel. It was shaking up and down and stuff. So i stared at it and it suddenly started spinning, then stopped, then spun a little more. But this is the thing that kinda proves it wasn't the AC doing this. I made my hand into a way that (if psi energy or whatever came out hands) the wheel would push the other way and it worked..... once or twice.
<br />
 And here's the strange part. Once the air conditioning stopped, I could no longer spin it. could the wobbling be loosening up the psi wheel so it's eaier to spin or what?
<br />

<br />
EDIT: now that I've noticed...... I see some visible movements of the wheel when no wind is blowing on it.

			It helps me to see it move beforehand a little, that's why sometimes I budge it a little with my fingers to get a little movement going, then I can get it going. And yeah, it helps for it to be loose. Sometimes I find that it just &quot;hits a brick wall&quot;, or it seems to, and then it becomes stuck. This, of course completely kills my confidence and then the only way I can get it to move again is to budge it.

			Most likely it was you moving it because it was the same way for me when I started. I always passed it off as the AC when I practiced and nothing else. Until one day when I was having a good practice session with the psi wheel (though I still thought some other source was causing it to move) I finished and went to turn down the AC because I was a bit cold. To my surprise it wasn't even on and hadn't been for the last week! That was when I realized that I could finally conclude that I was the catalyst behind the movement, and it seems to be the same situation your in. Also if you suspect something that may be causing the psi wheel to move, you could always put a glass container over it. Though it may be harder to do if that surfaces a mental block in your mind that it's hard to do behind glass. Anyways good luck with it and sorry if my post was a bit confusing!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

BTW Psi Manipulators technique that he discussed is also what I do every now and then

			It couldn't have been the air conditioning because the first time I tried spinning it today, it was doing 360's while the air conditioning was on. And now it doesn't do that anymore. I don't think my air conditioning would push out random waves of air so that the psi wheel always comes out with different results.
<br />

<br />
 The dang thing spins when I'm not watching... I look at it and it stops moving around. So I sit there with my hand next to it and it will do like a 45 degree turn one way and then the other. But first time I tried today... everytime I just glance at it, the psi wheel went crazy.... couldn't have been the AC. OMG there it goes now lol.... moving around in the corner of my eye while I'm typing this. I think I'm just having a really hard time controlling the wheel. The AC isn't blowing anywhere near as hard as it would need to be to move the psiwheel. I seem to be moving it with a force coming out my hand rather than the thought of just staring at it. It will move better if I'm staring away than with the &quot;force coming out the hands&quot;. Like some people here say, &quot;your hands are just aids to help visualize a little better.&quot; So I need to practice doing it without my hands. I think my subc gets so into the idea of my hands that everywhere my hand faces on the wheel, only that part of the wheel will move. So if my hands were above the wheel, the wheel would start pushing downwards. I have one conclusion and that is that this subject's case is closed. I am 100% sure I am moving it, not the AC. This is so long becuase I edititeded (uuuuhgg I can't spell it) this reply so much.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />
Whoah...... sorry if my sentences seem out of order... I just slapped a bunch of edits in there.

P.S. and thanks for the tips

			........ getting kinda wierd..... the wheel just keeps on moving and spinning and whatnot when I really don't want it to move. I'm thinking if I ever get to move pencils I don't want my pencil randomly rolling off my desk. Atleast I can move stuff tho unlike some people who haven't got any luck yet.
<br />
 When the wheel moves it looks kind of unsteady... it will push up and down, go clockwise, go counter clockwise, and wobble everywhere. Now my hands don't really matter too much... it just goes with me looking at it or not even paying attention.

			Oh hehe, i tried to say you were doing it, I probably wrote something wrong somewhere and confused you but yeah my last post was trying to say you most likely were doing it... Oh and if you need help with the moving when you dont want it to you could check out this post...

Hehe if you get better and can move pencils (I know I'm not that good <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />) then you'll probably have enough control to not have any geisting (I think thats what it is called when things move when you dont want it to)
<br />

<br />
Oh and I don't even use my hand I try to picture Jean Grey (sry for the fluffy analogy) moving objects with her PK and that helps me. Also it puts to rest any interferences with your hand         ally touching it. And all the wobbling and random movements you were talking about were the same to me when I started, it all clears up in time and with practice.

			The thing doesn't spin by itself..... I have to use my hands to actually make a 360 degree turn. The thing only kinda wobbles around like I said before without my hands. Srry not really making a big point here... <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />  just stating my progress as I go.

			When you use your hands do you acually move them or do you just set them there? Because if you are acually moving your hands along with the wheel the air moved could acually cause the wheel to move and it would not be PK. (Sorry to be mean but just giving possible reasons) If its really hard to do under glass then try not using your hands (tis how I learned <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />) then it will be a much more reliable outcome.
<br />

PS. I take everything with a grain of salt so I try to have the most controlled conditions possible.

the only movements of my hand were the movements of me trying to find a comfortable spot, which was just up and down movements of the hand. I was DEFINITLYYLYLYYYE NOT pushing the wheel with air.

			Oh Ok just wondering, sry if I sounded kinda harsh  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />  I was just wondring because I once watched a video of a guy who said he could move it but in the video he was basicly guiding his hand around the wheel to move it (creating wind) So ya if your hands are helping then keep using them and if you want to ever just use your mind with no visualzation you could start by just using one hand then one finger etc. Other than that it sounds like you found something that works! Good Luck and keep practicing  <img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" />

			Yea... read all about taking breaks in the forum... I did do a perfect 360 spin with no wobbles or wind just a minute ago. I think it was becuase I was so excited to tell my friend about this. I just went back to my computer all excited and it did a perfect spin and it wouldn't spin anymore after that <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" /> . Just a little frustrating that I need to feel the AC on for some reason to make it spin. The AC is not strong enough to spin it, but strong enough to wobble it around. While it is wobbling I can sort of control the direction it spins in. Clockwise spins are easy. When I try to make it spin counterclockwise, the least the wheel will do is stop and twitch a little in a counterclockwise direction <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />
<br />
Seems a little like its really the wind and just my imagination but I am positive its not the air. The wheel spins in a way that looks nothing like a person is blowing on it. I haven't tried spinning the wheel under a container yet... maybe later.

			Honestly, if you are worried about the wind moving the psiwheel, just put a clear glass jar over it.  It absolutely, 100%, not harder to move.  Your mind might think it is, but it isn't.  Just get the connection with the wheel, pretending the jar doesn't exist and you'll know when you move that psiwheel.  But, like any practice, it does take time, so don't get frustrated if you don't get the results you would were looking for.
