			Disclaimer: This is a brain dump of my thoughts on my experiences last night. As such I won't be editing anything in line but will revise thoughts after stating them. I think will help in understanding how my mind works on the subject and I personally find it both helpful and entertaining. This probably won't be the easiest to follow, but those interested, well - welcome to my brain. *evil laughter*
<br />

<br />
Back again. I've kept up with my practice, ranging from 15 minutes to nearly an hour and a half last night (with breaks where appropriate, mostly to watch the awesome videos).
<br />
Again I was working at the dining room table to avoid computer drafts, though I did find my breath seemed to have more of an effect that I had previously noticed.
<br />
Anyway, I was having some trouble getting it moving - it's always hardest for me to get it going from a dead stop. Eventually I got a little movement and wa able to get it going, though I find my Psi wheel is always a good deal slower than the videos, not sure why but it may just come with time, or perhaps I need to visualise it moving faster and faster than I do now - at any rate, I'm rambling.
<br />
After fighting with wind currents for a while I got a little frustrated because my subconcious, and even parts of my concious mind, keeps trying to reject the idea that I'm in control, even though when the wind moves the wheel and I can stop it or turn it back as I please (stong wind currents are a real problem though, my brain has a problem overcoming them).
<br />
Tired of fighting with my own flawed conceptions of reality and th eevents taking place, I got a clear plastic cup that I could see through fairly well (sight is a big trigger for me) and put it over the Psi wheel.
<br />
Now before I go on I feel it's important to note that in my previous attempts at a covered psi wheel (with a glass that distotred my view of the wheel) I had no results at all, and this was hard on my sub c because it can easily rationalize that the wheel was moving because of wind currents - even when I'm certain I made it stop and turn a different way, there's still that outside chance that the wind made it move that way, coincidentially.
<br />
So I sat down and put the plastic cup overtop of my wheel. I could still see the wheel fairly well, only a slight distortion. I pushed the other thoughts from my mind several times and tried my best to focus. It was hard because my sleeping hours have changed and I'm fairly tired this week, plus the fact that it was near midnight already (and only 6 hours left until I had to get up for work). Eventually though a lot of focus I DID see it turn very slowly. It took both my hands around the outside of the cup - similar to the way I first made the wheel turn last friday, though I have since moved to a one handed focus to reduce dependancy - but it did move, which is good. Now, of course, my skeptical and analytical mind wants to rationalize it was the air within the cup heating and turning the wheel, which it may well have been since I didn't have the degree of control I believe I've had previously. After removing the cup however, I found the wheel slightly easier to control.
<br />
I guess in the end I can't truely decide one way or another off of this one event. It's a positive turn of events for sure, but I'm going to seed to replicate the experience a few more times for my brain to decide whther it was me in control, or just the heat form my hands.
<br />

<br />
In truth I'm not really sure why the cup makes any difference to me, though I do have my theories.
<br />
For one, it's a barrier to my mind, something to say to my sub c 'Nope, can't be done. There's something in the way'.
<br />
Secondly, since I don't truely understand how it's done it's possible that I'm causing the air between myself and the wheel to move, instead of the wheel - and if the cup is blocking the air, the wheel can't move (and I did try visualizing a little tornado air current within the cup which had no effect).
<br />
Thirdly I *know* that energy saturates and penetrates everything, but in my head that energy requires effort to move and another opposing force, physical or otherwise, CAN stop it. This is my biggest obsticle which has been brought on by air currents moving the wheel. I can command it to stop and it will, but turning it against the air currents takes a percieved amount of effort that I find to be almost strenuous. I know I need to let the wheel move, but the air currents are seriously messing with my head and making me FORCE the wheel to move. Now it moves, and about as wheel as when I let it move, but again, I'm fighting thr air currents and find that I tire quickly.
<br />
Let me go back and not say FORCE, but rather apply more force than is normal. Apply more focus I suppose, since my technique to get it to move remains the same, but requires more 'focus effort', I guess would be the term. For me it seems that stopping the wheel is the best thing I can do - which may be a result of the Psi wheel on my desk here at work where I have to fight the air currents to get control, which usually starts with me stopping the wheel. I am currently considering taking the wheel off mydeks to avoid building any bad habits based on it's movement, but I'm unsure yet - I'd miss the damn thing, for sure. Opinions?
<br />

<br />
At any rate, after I moved the wheel under the cup and then removed the cup, I headed back to my PC and watched a few more videos - partly for something to do because I hadn't seen them all, and I guess partly for inspiration. At that point I had no intention of doing anything more Psi related that evening.
<br />
Intention or not I grabbed the cup and my Psi wheel to 'settle this once and for all' and 'make the damn thing spin under the stupid cup'. I'm sure you can see where this is heading - nowhere. My mindset - looking back now - was WAY off. Let this be a warning to anyone else new here, you will achieve NOTHING with this mindset. Being result oriented isn't bad, but driving for a hard goal in the way I did can be detrimental. In the end the Psi wheel didn't budge, I was frustrated, and worse - I began to doubt myself again.
<br />
Thankfully I didn't waste much time in my frustrated state and put it away to go to bed, where I played around with a psi ball for a little while (no tingling this time but a definate physical pressure and I could 'feel' my way around it with my hands) and then eventually to sleep.
<br />

<br />
Overall I have mixed feelings about my results last night. Some good, some bad, but overall I'm still driven to keep going. Not to achieve any specific hard results (though Psi wheel under cup is a goal for me) but rather to settle my mind on the subject before I can advance further. Now this may be folly as well, and I understand that, however I have attempted to roll pens and straws but with no luck. I think my sub c needs to be shocked into believing, and I think one of the best ways to do that will be to have it witness the psi wheel moving when it couldn't be an air current.
<br />

<br />
Doubt is a powerful enemy - even in the face of evidence.
<br />

<br />
I've rambled on for long enough. Just wanted to share more of my experiences and thoughts on them. THey may be helpful, they may not, or at the very least they may have proven entertaining or even just something to read. But this is just another part of my journy in a bigger world.

			Hey V!  Just to let you know where I'm coming from - I have been doing telekenesis for about 2-3 days now.  I have come to the conclusion that anything is possible.  If YOU believe it can happen and convince your sub c to believe it (by constantly repeating it in your concious mind that it will move), then you are limitless my friend.<img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  Anyway, I just wanted to give you my support and that I know where you are coming from.  I just barley got the psi wheel to move and it's exiting stuff.<img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
