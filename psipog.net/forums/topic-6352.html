			I've been doing PK for, hmm, a few months (I'm guessing 6), I got the wheel moving within a week, since than I've been trying to gain better control but to no success.
<br />

<br />
Is having to search for a pin and accidentally stabbing yourself with it and than looking at a piece of paper for 20min or so everyday really worth being able to roll pens?
<br />

<br />
And I'm not really interested in the other areas of psionics as most of them require someone else to verify results, and I intend to keep the same amount of friends as I do now.
<br />

<br />
I'm considering stopping practising of PK, has anyone else encountered this decision, what was the outcome?
<br />

<br />
On a final note: I don't wish to discourage other people browsing the forums. A lot of what I said was referring to me, ie. &quot;Should I care about PK&quot; not &quot;Should you&quot;.

			If you're looking for something practical, then no, psychokinesis of moving objects isn't worth it. Really, you shouldn't stop psychokinesis, I mean, you can learn other psionic type skills while learning psychokinesis, nothing is stopping you.

			This is such a stupid post. Do you guys think before you post something? You said it yourself, &quot;Should I care about PK&quot; not &quot;Should you&quot;. What does it matter to anybody else whether you care about PK or not. It's your decision, noone else's. Some people aren't trying to learn PK in order to achieve something else by using it, some of us (me) practice PK as a hobby. I find it fun and it helps develope concentration and &quot;oneness&quot; with the universe(In my opinion). It most likely bores you because the only thing you do is spin the psiwheel. Try new things without always resorting to the wheel when you fail, your mind is becoming accustomed to <span style="font-style: italic">only</span> the psi wheel when trying to perform PK. It's like only dribbling a ball up and down with one hand and asking if basketball is &quot;worth it&quot;. Or learning to write only your name and asking if learning to write is actually worth it. It's your <span style="font-style: italic">own</span> decision! It's as important as <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> want it to be. Please people, stop with these useless threads.

			Nightfox, that is a very good point. I doubt most people, like me, will ever get anything out of it. If it isn't at least entertaing to you, you probably should do something else with your free time. But thats just my opinion.

			i cant really find any use for PK other that getting objects to move when you cant reach or something, so i was thinking about stopping too..but i didnt care, because i thought it was way too cool <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> if you want to learn a useful skill thoguh, meditate and communicate with you subconcious..also try telepathy and empathy..you dont need to loose friends, practice online with psions..

			Hmm maybe you you guys should actually try looking at the practical side of psionics, rather than disregarding most psionics acts as useless (other than for entertainment purposes).  
<br />

<br />
With that in mind... Let me ask you... what purpose do our hands serve us, to turn switches on to unlock things, to pick things up, to move pieces across a game board, to climb a shelf just to get a book.  Personally pk can be very functional. You just need to use it like your hands. Now there is the question, will I ever get that good? Well chances are, only if you want to. Every psionic skill has is uses just like every part of our body. 
<br />

<br />
Nuff said.

			The thing Jynx said about the hands is basically what I was going to say.
<br />

<br />
Personally though, I just think its a fun thing to learn. A good thing too, and if you practiced enough you'd eventually be able to do more then a piece of paper. Now, not like, a desk or something... but even just maybe a small cup of soda or even just a pen. I think it would be a fun conversation starter XD Even if they don't believe you, they still want to know the &quot;trick&quot; behind it. (I wouldn't know, though, unfortunately)

			Personally, I was really interested in PK for quite a while. I learned to stand pens up on end just so I could try to knock them over with PK (and I was starting to get close). But I started to not have the time to practice PK, that and after having read the last part of <a href="art-fire-and-ice.html0" target="_blank" class="postlink">this article</a>, I decided that maybe me learning PK wouldn't be a good thing. But, unfortunately, that means force bubbles are out of the question for me. It's a shame, because it would be loads of fun messing with people with them, that and I like doing energy manipulation and working with constructs (though I don't practice anywhere near enough), since it can be done anywhere that you can concentrate on it.

			Yes indeed practice is the key, but most say they are serious about pk and don't practice enough so it's their own fault.

*shrugs* why not.  Keep positive, and do not deter others from thinking they can, because it has and can be done.  May be opinion, but we're not interested  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> .

I mean, one of the things I am looking forward to (if I can get past the first step) would be to turn off the light before going to bed without having to get up.

I get REALLY tired at night.

I also wonder about using it around a very religious person and measuring their reaction.  I don't know, I tend to like to study people....

			Most things are practical, anyone thats decent in macro-PK should be good at micro-PK (Vegas anyone?). But but for something to get to the point where it is practical usualy includes either lots of practice or just being naturaly good at it.
<br />

<br />
Personaly I've found functionality between telepathy, RV and precognitive dreams. I almost always fill the words someone just cant fix into a sentence and usualy only need to know what someones talking about to know what their position on it is... the tough part is getting used to other people's thoughts going through your' head, its hard to accept thats its not your' own.
<br />

<br />
Psionics can also be a problem... since I've started I get very nervous at times but usualy dont know the reason... maybe the people, maybe I just need medication.... either way this topic would be enough to fill a book, I wouldnt be surprised if this thread gets pretty long.
