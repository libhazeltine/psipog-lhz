			Wow, where do you guys live that driving with cell phones is illegal? I live in the Chicagoland area and people over 18 can talk on their cell phones while driving.
<br />

<br />
I personally condone it. I think it's absolutely ridiculous. 
<br />

<br />
You know what kind of drivers I like the most though? When you've got soccer moms in their huge ass minivans or SUVs, they're talking on the cell phone and you're just driving along and they don't adhere to traffic laws and you both almost collide and the mom is pissed at you because she thinks you almost caused the accident when it was really her because she's being a dumbass and is not even paying attention to what she's doing. (Wow what a long horribly written sentence.)
<br />

<br />
Ya the thing I hate about most when I'm driving are the other drivers. Especially the stupid ones.

			I think our subconsciousness knows how to navigate a vehicle MUCH much better than our consciousness does, so I voted yes.
<br />

<br />
Everyone that I've ever seen driving while talking on a cell phone (considered that he is a good driver), drove better than he did when he was thinking about the road. Including me. And it's funny because you talk to someone and you completely switch off your brain but you're driving automaticly, you're not thinking about it, and you do what you're supposed to. Otherwise there's always questioning.
<br />

<br />
Another example: a friend of mine was driving this NFS (need for speed, for those of you that dont know <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />) track, and he restarted it for like 15 times because he couldn't win at any cost. He was really nervious about it in the end, but he still wanted to win, and someone called him. He answered the phone and talked for like 5 minutes, he didn't even know he was driving, then when he ended the call he passed the finish line, being almost a minute better than all his previous attempts. We looked at each other and had a good laugh about it, but I think it proves an interesting point.
<br />

<br />
Now don't get me wrong I'm not promoting the cell phone use while driving (in the end, it is still illegal in most countries and also I don't want someone to get in an accident because of me), but for most of my friends and for me also driving with cell phone is no more dangerous than without it, quite the opposite, we're even better <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
peace and don't drive with cell phone unless you're certain in your abilities!

			You know that's a good point infected. I didn't think of that.
<br />

<br />
I think if someone connected well with their sub-c then of course they would be better drivers.
<br />
I guess the question now is, do most people who drive while talking on their cell phones, do they actually have a good connection with their sub-c. 
<br />
In my own experiences what I've seen is that most don't or at least with the ones I've encountered with.

Dude, you read my mind. Its the same here over in Britain, its amazing because 1 out of every 3 people has a fucking SUV, and about 99% of them never ever get to go off-road, like they were build to do. Its just become a competition to see which car company can make the car that are the biggest, ugliest, and most fuel consuming. We've been nearly rammed off the road by people with SUV's, like a thousand times. THEY DON'T EVEN GO OFF-ROAD WITH THEM !1!!11111!1!!!!!1!1!!!!!1!!!

although your statement is not proven (and could be true) it is called your subconscious for a reason.  it isn't the dominant conscious when dealing with motor activity.  now i'm not attacking your skill as a driver, i'm just saying as a summer job highway worker, the only people that have almost crashed or hit me were talking on a cell phone...coincidence??? i think not.

<br />
again, not with me.  also, when on a cellphone you are either mad, sad, or joking around...mostly.  when you are mad, it tends to show with speeding and complete disregard of people around you.  when you are sad or even crying, you just aren't paying attention since you are too concerned with yourself.  joking around you are paying more attention to the person you are talking to (as with the other cases) and usually aren't paying attention.  this is dangerous, especially when on a road you aren't fammiliar with.

all i have to say:  it's a video game.  you get multiple tries, which gives you an edge (and helps your sub-c theory), but in real life you can't restart 15 times.  if you fuck up, that's it.  plus, 15 consecutive times on the same road?  come on, of course he will be used to it.
<br />

<br />
i'm not trying to be an ass, i just don't think it's safe.  i know you all are getting annoyed with me saying this, but:  i am a summer job highway/roadway worker.  i see you drivers, i see your mistakes.  85% of the 15 or so cars that almost hit me (and countless cars that almost crashed) were on cellphones.  that's proof enough for me.

			Well I'm not promoting that sort of behavior I'm just saying that most of people I know drive almost better during a cell phone call for some reason <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. And they will probably continue in this manner.

			Every person has a set amount of attention.  Think of it as the RAM in a computer.  Driving, since it has become an automatic process over years of practice, requires a decent amount of attention, but certainly not all of it.
<br />

<br />
Communicating via language requires A LOT of attention since semantic processing occurs at a much deeper level.
<br />

<br />
Therefore, talking on the cell phone while driving will, in theory, dominate your attention span thus making it more likely you'll get into a car accident.

It's not fair to the person you collide with.
<br />
It's not fair to the person(s) you accidently kill. It's not fair to their family and friends.
<br />
It's not fair to your family and friends if you die. 
<br />

<br />
You're just being inconsiderate. I don't think you realize the implications of your actions. If you get into an accident and survive, you do not know how that will affect you mentally. It can actually scar you. I know because I'm speaking from experience. It was so hard for me and for a while I was suffering from post traumatic disorder (I'm not sure of the exact name I can't think of it right now.).

If you want to put in your life in jeopardy, then so be it. You have the right to make that decision, but you have <span style="font-weight: bold">NO RIGHT </span>to jeopardize the lives of others and you are a bastard for thinking that way. 
<br />

<br />
I don't know how old you are, but when you're a new driver, you usually don't have to pay for the car and the insurance. (depending) Don't put your parents through that kind of shit. It's not right. You are disrespecting them and taking what they give you for granted.

You shouldn't be driving.

It's not fair to the person you collide with.

It's not fair to the person(s) you accidently kill. It's not fair to their family and friends.

It's not fair to your family and friends if you die.

You're just being inconsiderate. I don't think you realize the implications of your actions. If you get into an accident and survive, you do not know how that will affect you mentally. It can actually scar you. I know because I'm speaking from experience. It was so hard for me and for a while I was suffering from post traumatic disorder (I'm not sure of the exact name I can't think of it right now.).

You don't know until you've been in one.

If you want to put in your life in jeopardy, then so be it. You have the right to make that decision, but you have <span style="font-weight: bold">NO RIGHT </span>to jeopardize the lives of others and you are a bastard for thinking that way. 
<br />

<br />
I don't know how old you are, but when you're a new driver, you usually don't have to pay for the car and the insurance. (depending) Don't put your parents through that kind of shit. It's not right. You are disrespecting them and taking what they give you for granted.

You shouldn't be driving.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I bought my car for 3700 at dealers price. 2001 ford taurus. 
<br />
I pay for my insurance. 1047 a year with 9 extra dollars a month just for making it monthly.
<br />
I'm 19 and have been driving since I was 15. 
<br />

<br />
I understand full well the implications of my actions, I just don't care. Like I said, their's a price for convience. I weigh the risks with the convience and I come to a decision. Although I have no right to jeaperdize the lifes of others, I do anyway. If I get into an accident while talking on a cell phone then so be it. I won't regret it for I understood full well what I was doing and what it ment to do it. That &quot;you don't know until you experience &quot; shit is for the weak minded kn3wbz who don't stop and think things 360.
<br />

<br />
Your right, I shouldn't be driving, but I am. Never been in accident though.

Did you read I said depending.

Since you are a driving you have responsibilities. You are willing to take the heat for whatever you do I think that's a good thing, but like I said I don't think it's right to jeopardize others. Don't take this personally but I think you need to GROW UP.

That's weak? I think that shows complete arrogance on your part. You have a brain, it doesn't hurt to use it 360 sometimes.
