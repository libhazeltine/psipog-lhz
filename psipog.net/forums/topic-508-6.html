 Hey listen here. Firstly, it's practically impossible. Second: Messing with the weather patterns can be REALLY dangerous. It can seriously f*** up the entire planet climate if you do it right( ..or more correctly, wrong).

			When I was little and my family and I were on a road trip (I didnt know anything about psionics) It was raining and I sang the &quot;Rain Rain go away&quot; song. After about a minute the rain stopped. And then it started raining 30 minutes later and I waited about 5 minutes and did it again.
<br />
I'm not saying I moved the clouds somewhere else I am just saying I am pretty sure I made it stop raining. I have never done this again nor tried <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			This weather manipulation stuff is easy, and it has been proven to work, especially en masse. I can do it very well (not bragging, adding validity to the technique), and if people actually tried and didn't think so hard, I believe they could be good at it too.

			It's easy, and I've done it, back when I dabbled in other crafts. It's too easy, and you can easily shift the balance of nature. A warning to all: Don't control the weather. Nature knows best when it comes to these things.

			Now, talking to the original poster, when you say you can control the weather, im sure you just mean that its not you changing it. Incoming scenario...
<br />
The original poster will be referred to as O.P.
<br />

<br />
O.P: Ok, i want the sky to turn into a thunderstorm.
<br />
Sky: Turns slightly darker, but then becomes sunny.
<br />
O.P: Ok, that didnt work, lets make it turn sunny.
<br />
Sky: Starts to rain.
<br />
O.P: Yes, its starting to rain, i wanted to make it do that.
<br />

<br />
I can just imagine you taking credit for the natural shift of the weather. End of, dont you just love my scenarios.

			i dont know. im a hardxcore, scientificy-facts kinda guy. If its tottaly sunny ouside and you make it rain were does the percipitation come from? If its cloudy and on the brink of rain whats keeping the water particles from acumulating? If your doing it yourselfe then you must be extremly powerfull. OR maybe your just a good weatherman.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			I kinda see what the OP means....although I would call a mile quite a big area. I've tried something like this before, except only on me immediately, like within a metre or two of me, like getting a little breeze or less breeze and trying to make it stop raining on me so much by some sort of alteration idea, using random chance to move the raindrops slightly further from me as they fall from up high. I wouldnt dream of doing anything larger than that, or of it being easy.
<br />

<br />
I'll add to everyone saying that the large scale weather changing is a BAD idea.

			i hate for this to be my first post, for i feel i may recieve either no recognition, or future ignorance. but i hope some of you guys actually did some research on this subject. while yes i feel creating a hurricane/storm out of clear skies would take an abnormal amount of psi or an incredible amount of of energy to create, i feel effecting a physical state of solid matter(psi wheel/ourselves.. keep in mind how complex our mind is relative to the weather.) would take a great amount more energy compared to effecting such a dissipated/gaseous matter such as a cloud. i hope you guys dont judge based on first post, for i feel i have at least a miniscule amount of experience/research in the subject.
<br />

<br />
while i feel it is possible to effect the existence of a cloud, i do not feel i can, A. make it rain/B. create a storm.
<br />

<br />
please check out these links which not only relate the amygdala to the prefrontal cortex, but the ability to control this area, to the ability to dissipate clouds.
<br />

<br />
&quot;PSYCHIC CLOUDBUSTING
<br />

<br />
Excerpt from the Frontal Lobes Supercharge Book
<br />

<br />
You have pre-existing circuits in your brain for psychic and telekinetic powers. They are in a dormant (currently unused) area of your brain. By learning how to click your amygdala forward, you can activate these areas easily and quickly. You can change clouds, maybe even the weather, with your mind.
<br />

<br />
This is something I learned to do myself twenty years ago, and was able to teach friends almost instantly. I know at least six people who can do this without any problem, and actually are rather nonchalant about it. You will be able to do this yourself and when you do, a part of your frontal lobes will be activated, and reality will never seem quite the same any more.
<br />

<br />
Here is how you do it:
<br />

<br />
1. Sit or stand in an open area where you can see good amount of open sky. Too many trees around you can interfere. Make sure you follow the previous requirements.
<br />

<br />
2. Click your amygdala forward, and make sure you are in a positive and open state of mind. This is important. If your amygdala is clicked backwards and in a negative and/or closed state of awareness, forget it, this won't work. Breath slowly and deeply, but totally relaxed and naturally.
<br />

<br />
3. Pick out a specific separate cloud. Ideally, pick one than has other clouds next to it or surrounding it, so you can compare your efforts. Pick a small cloud to start with, something about the size of your outstretched hand or smaller. Pick a cloud directly above you or nearly to start, so you know it is nearby. As you practice, you can move on to bigger clouds, and ones that are farther away.
<br />

<br />
4. Visualize energy flowing from your frontal lobes out towards the cloud, and visualize it vaporizing and disappearing from the sky. You can visualize that you are increasing the heat in the vicinity of this cloud, causing the water vapor to evaporate- no cloud.
<br />

<br />
5. Remain unattached to your results and efforts, as if you really don't care whether or not this works. Relax, let the energy flow, and wait. If you strain, grit your teach, tense your muscles, or mentally make effort it just interferes with this process. Remember, you click your amygdala forward with a feather, not a hammer. This is really easy to do, easier than walking up a flight of steps.
<br />

<br />
6. A cloud about the size of your outstretched closed hand will take from four to eight minutes to completely disappear. Your chosen cloud will vaporize, and surrounding clouds, no matter how close they are, will remain completely unaffected.
<br />

<br />
The first time you do this, and it is likely to work the very first time, you won't believe your eyes. Then after you do it again, a few more times, or on different days, you'll understand how amazing your brain really is. Of course, clouds will randomly vaporize on thir own- but this is not what this is about&#058; You are choosing a specific cloud, perhaps in a group, and only the one you pick and direct your energy towards vaporizes. And you can do this repeatedly. Sorry skeptics, this is not a coincidence.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
yes some of you may be close minded to the endless limit of info you can find and deny on the internet, however, i feel this may be plausible considering how simple clouds are related to controlling your own mind, or energ/psi, on another dimenson.

			well I wish I had more posts so my reply had alittle more weight, but I think people that are regular to the chat will agree that I am a decent person.
<br />

<br />
anyway. as for the massive amounts of energy neede, I have done some playing with the weather. and there was one time when it had been over 100f for about 4 days. I was getting tired of the heat and remembered that cold wind comes from the north, and I had messed with wind before. so I made several constructs to draw energy and make a huge construct to bring  a steady wind from the north. then the wind came and the tempature dropped to the lower 80s in a couple of days. that was nearly a month ago the the wind is still coming steady from the north. and I can see 5 model windmills from my house that show the same result. if it's a coincedence it is a rather long lived one.
