			and as for terrancoleman, well maybe you werent trying hard enough, go bend a spoon. I cant... i said i put a mixing bowl over the pinwheel, the mixing bowl moved, but only a few centimeters, and as for the pencil, it didnt slide in any particular direction, just right across my 5 foot long desk. So why do you stand so skeptical, maybe its &quot;oh he didnt do Tk in a day cos it took me years&quot;, different for everyone, duh! I just wanted a fast approach to moving things, instead of practice practice practice, i cant stand practice, i just tried Tk for the first time yesterday, and i was already progressing onto bigger things. But i didnt need to practice at it first before it moved.

Dear Maxus' Camera,
<br />

<br />
          May you please show us Maxus spinning the psiwheel with a mixing bowl,  moving the mixing bowl, and perhaps moving a pencil across a desk.  If you could it would be greatly appreciated.
<br />

<br />
                                            Thank you!
<br />
                                                      Joe
<br />

I wouldn't doubt it if he was telling the truth though.  Some people just seem to pick things up easier than others.  That doesn't mean he has to practice ever and will just get better without trying.  He definitely does'nt have all the practice and understanding that people practicing for months have gathered.

			nah ive got this thing called I.B.S (irritable bowel syndrome), and its very unpleasant, sometimes it tricks the stomach into making it think its eaten something it shouldnt have, i.e i could have eaten a ham sandwich, and it could have thought id eaten plutonium, so the stomach squeezes and brings the food up. yummy. and as for the headaches, i dunno........

			first i tried the psi ball, but it didnt feel as it described, infact, i hardly felt anything, then i played the first card excersise on the articles page written by (cant remember), and i got consistent results, i got the cards down to 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, then 7 cards before i found my card, i gave up on that though, because my mum got it down to the last card, and that was her card, that annoyed me very much for some reason, so i tried it again, and was very terrible at it. Then i tried some energy meditation off another site, and it felt like streams of warm water were flowing down my arms and into my hands, then my palms felt really hot, but i checked them and they werent, so i made a psi wheel to see if i could move it and it spun very fast several times, i thought it might have been a draft, so i put a mixing bowl over it, and the wheel still spun, but then i noticed the bowl starting to move aswell, but my head started hurting, so i stopped for a while, then i thought ' oh look, a pencil' so i tried to move it, but it was very erratic in its movement, but still it slid across my desk. Im not sure why, but i always have to make very strong psi balls before i move something, i have to put my hands either side of the object i wish to move, as if the psi ball is touching the object, then im not quite sure what happens, but its like i ask it to move and it does......but i dont move my hands as if to signal which way for it to go.

			Sounds like you're very adept at manipulating energy, and you also have a lot of it!  Can you still move the mixing bowl and pencil, or was it just first time?

You could also check the msn thread which should be stickied. And there is a button to press about msn and aim etc under that person's post.
