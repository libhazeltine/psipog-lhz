			You probably all know about James Randi and that his foundation is offering a million dollars to anyone that provides objective proof that paranormal exists.

Well, it seems I don't know anything about this &quot;challenge&quot; but I thought you could win a million dollars or something? And another positive is if you do accomplish it more people would start to believe in phsychic related stuff and be inspired. Well, that's I can think of but once again please don't yell at me because I don't really know all of the facts.

For the record, 20 x 50,000 = 1,000,000, and there are more than 20 casinos in Vegas.

Good respectable Tkers (even ones that I know) took on this challenge and they got made fun of because this Randi guy kept thinking of BS ways to prove it is not possible.  It is rigged so dont get your hopes up

			Have any of you taken the challenge? I dont think so, the challenge has nothing to do with randi until you pass the preliminary, and the preliminary is held at your local research center. It has NOTHING TO DO with randi. If they give randi the paper that you pass then he tests you and you get your cash. But no one has past the preliminary.

Ryan hasnt submitted people that have witnessed him and has not sent an intelligent &quot;proposal&quot;, and is not listening to what kramer is saying. Kramer doesnt want to hear him brag about what he can do, he wants a test protocol, ryan isnt so keen on reading rules.

			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
Very cool videos. I enjoyed watching them. However, trying to win this &quot;challenge&quot; is pointless. Randi is going to say one of two things; 
<br />

<br />
1) In the first video, why did you have to touch the tennis balls in order to make it move in the first place? I mean, since you can easily move the tennis balls, why didn?t you just make them swing?
<br />

<br />
2) Can we meet? I'm interested in throwing you in my rented lavatory and proving you wrong.
<br />

<br />
I tried to sound like Randi as much as I can. He's not going to be impressed at all. If anything, it's going to piss him off. Randi is the kind of guy that if he doesn?t understand what?s going on, he'll attack it. That is what is going to happen to Ryan.
<br />

<br />
This challenge is pointless. He's what I call a bad skeptic. Prejudging and ignorant to what is going on right in front of him. I've been asked by people online, school and my own family to enter this contest. I repeatedly  said no. Do you know why? Because I don?t want to be another &quot;faker&quot; in Randi's and his fans eyes. Even If I moved a book right in front of him, he'll blame it on things such as &quot;The wind!&quot; &quot;Electrical static!&quot; etc. 
<br />

<br />
Don't get involved with Randi. He'll only bring you down and harm your interested with psionics. He's a bad skeptic, enough said.
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />

			JoeT you didn't even read my post, the challenge has nothing to do with randi, it is held in a local research center of the person submiting it. Randi is in the hospital, and had bypass surgery, he wont be doing anything for a while. Only on the final phase is randi present.

			Hello Thanatos,
<br />

<br />
It doesn?t matter. Randi will see the video and attack it. When Randi watches the videos on the &quot;final stage&quot; Randi will NOT let it go any further. Again, the competition is as pointless as your post. You totally missed what I was trying to state. Please reread my post. 
<br />

<br />
He is a bad skeptic, end of story.
