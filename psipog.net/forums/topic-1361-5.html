			Yeah, I've heard voices while practicing to get an OBE.  When they started, I was pretty relaxed, didn't even think anything of them.  It just sounded like a group of people having an indistinguishable conversation.  After a little while, I realized that hearing voices wasn't very normal, which jarred me out of my trance-like state.  Being more conscious, I was able to catch the last three words of one of their sentences:  &quot;Perfect.  Here came...&quot; By the time the voice said &quot;came&quot; I was so conscious that it sounded as if the voice was practically yelling in my ear.  Then the voices stopped.

			I concider myself a high level sleep parapysis sufferer, and it's been happening to me for 5 - 6 years now. This is <span style="font-weight: bold">exactly</span> what it feels like, read here: <a href="http://theshadowlands.net/ghost/sleep.htm" target="_blank">http://theshadowlands.net/ghost/sleep.htm</a> . I wasn't aware of the term ''sleep paralysis&quot; either of it's existance as a worldwide fact, till recently the folks over at psionline.com helped me find a place to start investigating.

			During those particular experiences, i could move my limbs, but not see them... Like, I moved my arms up toward my face to look at my hands (through my eyelids) and i could not see any arms or hands, even though my senses were telling me they were right in front of my face. That's when i really panicked and concentrated on bursting out of the state.

And besides, we shouldn't speak of souls because that's considered &quot;religious&quot; talk and breaches the rules of conduct.

			Remember that when you do an OBE, you leave your body into the Astral Plane, if any of you know that, but in the astral planes there are spirits and that is what could be the cause of the voices.

			When there was evil voices talking to me, it was freaky. they kept on saying my name and then a familiar voice would cut in and say something like, &quot;where are you <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> &quot; and &quot;are you sleeping <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> &quot;. They started saying they were in my room and they had a hold of me and that there was no way that i could get out of their reach.

			Yeah it happens to me too though I wouldn't consider the voices to be evil in any way ... they just come and go, usually I don't even get them completely, or I just hear an echo. But it's true they leave you with quite a cold feeling <img src="images/smiles/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" border="0" />.

			I'm tired and didn't have the patience to read all of the posts, so I'll tell you what I think happened. Hopefully Im not repeating someone, sorry if I am. =x
<br />

<br />
I believe you had Sleep Paralysis. I've had it many times, and usually I see an entity, but don't hear anything. Basically your subconscious displays the last mental picture it had of your room, and tricks you into thinking you're awake, but in reality, you're still sleeping. I forget if there's a chemical involved, but there's a reason for your paralysis.
<br />

<br />
Some people report having a pleasurable experience during SP, but the majority are horrifying experiences. I've only heard voices during it once, and it was a maniacal, high-pitched laughter. The others have been visions of  an alien, a shadow figure, etc. One time my whole vision shook and I felt just a presence of something malicious. A girl I know has only heard voices in her SP, so it's perfectly normal.
<br />

<br />
So, in conclusion, they're just constructs of your subconscious. Many people claim it has links to alien abduction; however, regardless of what I think, it's most likely nonsense. There is no boogie man out to get you, it's all in your head. So no worries. =P
<br />

<br />
My advice? Try not to sleep on your back, it happens most in that position. Also, try to relieve any stress you've built up through the day, or it will transfer out to when you're sleeping. If you're caught in an SP experience, focus on one part of your body (the solar plexus, in your case) and try to move only that. It should wake you up pretty quick. Hope I helped!

			hmm this may be against the rules or borderline on breaking them but i study paranormal activity (intelligent hauntings, poltergeists and such) if i had to take a crack at this i would say you have a demon. which is very frightening considering that they do exist although very rare they try to scare the human into submission by doing things like physical interaction such as pushing, restraining, scratching or biting. they also like to mentally disturb humans by yelling at them from all directions or whispering to them just to creep them out. they do all this in hopes of possessing a human figure. (i am somewhat skeptical about this but u never know). and to explain the non-human sound to its voice is that demons were never human. some ppl think that they were spawned from hell but that is religion so i wont get into that. if they appear to you they will appear in the form of a shadow figure sometimes they will appear as a human but most of the time they will appear as a half human half animal creature. i have in fact had an experience or 2 with demons. i remember in my bedroom one would appear to me very rarely but it was very creepy when it did it would just stand by my dresser. sometimes when i went to sleep it would make a strange buzzing noise and it would get continuosly loud. and one way to get rid of demons (from my experience) is to just say no and stand up to them and threaten them because they want to break your will to live so they can proceed with inhabiting your body. it seemed to stop after i stood up to it. plz dont flame me for this this is just what i have learned from paranormal research and experience.

			I know, I know, I'm digging up an old, secondary topic from earlier in the thread, but...
<br />

<br />
Remember the conversation about 2011/2012/The End of the World?
<br />

<br />
I found this little tidbit while checking out an article on an asteroid that's passing really close to Earth on Monday. The date surprised me slightly... I find it just a little creepy:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">As far as we now know, the next very close approach of a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid will come on November 8, 2011, when 2005 YU55 skims Earth at a distance of 98,000 miles (158,000 km.)
<br />
--www.space.com/spacewatch/060629_night_sky.html</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />
The quoted sentence is at the end of the article.
<br />

<br />
Yeah. PHA, 11.8.11, three days before 11.11.11... Probably just coincidence, but still creepy.
<br />

<br />
As for the ACTUAL topic at hand...
<br />
I'm not too sure about the most recent theory of the presence of a demon. Not that I'm saying they don't exist, but encounters I've had with anything that could possibly -be- a demon haven't really worked that way. Yeah, they're creepy, but it takes quite a bit for them to work that kind of effect, if that is even a valid explanation. 
<br />
I'm more for the sleep paralysis explanation. After all, the explanation with the fewest amount of assumptions is more likely to be correct. 
<br />

<br />
For something such as the 'demon' explanation, there are quite a few assumptions you would have to make, nearly if not entirely on faith, for it to work out. First, you'd have to assume that demons exist. Then, you'd have to assume that they would be capable of possession and/or causing the phenomenon of evil voices and frozen body to occur. Then, on that assumption, you'd have to assume they'd -want- to screw with Xiou's mind. I mean, no offense, but wouldn't screwing with World Leaders be more fun and have a greater effect when it comes to fucking with humanity? For that matter, that would require the assumption that they want to screw with any human minds. Do you see where I'm going here? Saying it's demons, or any other type of 'psychic entity' just takes too many assumptions.
<br />

<br />
The response of sleep paralysis or any other more... normal... explanation takes a lot fewer steps. The only assumption necessary was that... Well, there aren't really any assumptions that I can see. We already know that our minds can be mistaken. If nothing else, it could've been Xiou waking up in the middle of a dream or something.
<br />
That's my opinion, though. Feel free to disagree.

			well see i dont like to assume a lot, too messy. i am basing this on experiences i have had and i am basing the fact that i was in contact with a demon on the work of many paranormal investigators. so i am just speaking what i know from experience or otherwise. and yeah im gonna shut my big mouth now because this is bordering the rules pretty closely and i dont want to get this thread locked.
