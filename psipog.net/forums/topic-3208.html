			Ok, we will use this thread to have a friendly arguement.  Here are some rules:
<br />

<br />
1. Act serious
<br />

<br />
2. No personal attacks
<br />

<br />
3. In every post, at the top of the post type either &quot;Skeptic:&quot; or &quot;Psion:&quot; to show which side you are on on that one post.  You are allowed to switch sides but only one side per post (no double posting).
<br />

<br />
4. Learn some good arguements.  Gain some practice argueing here.  Yay fun!
<br />

<br />

<br />
I will start off this arguementative thread:
<br />

<br />
Skeptic:
<br />

<br />
PK does not exist.

Psion:

PK does exist but are minds are usually afraid of what they don't understand. The ones who leave an open mind is likely to find themselves doing PK. Not everyone will, some might stay in the middle of psion and skeptic to make sure that it exists.

Good idea Apollo, I just hope the others can keep their end of the bargain. and I hope I didn't sound like an idiot XD

As Bladeslinger said, it is just a waste of time.  Why try it when science already killed the idea.  I have an open mind but i dont see doors flinging open for me.  If telepathy exists, why arent there news reports about it, why do we never see &quot;Telepath kicked out of casino for cheating in Poker&quot; in the headlines?

			Sometimes others are so fine tuned into their beliefs that without proper and solid proof they will simply not accept it. Sure they can learn of the astral planes existance simply by meditating for a month and going their, learn of the truth behing psionics simply by doing it, but this is outside their belief set. To them this is absolute bullshit and all that do this are foolish lyers or stupic crazed lunes.
<br />

<br />
Sure we could convince them otherwise but WHY? Why waste time that we can be using taking our own skills to the next level and increasing our own powers on such people? Why do we care so much about others opinions that we must argue with them.
<br />

<br />
Sure I agree that the whole world needs to know of psionics so that it can improve their lives, but one must ask themselves how much do they care about spreading such? If it is their passion then let them argue.  Although, most people on this forum dont go one way or another and argue because the thread is there. 
<br />

<br />
To stop this pointless waste of time and energy of repeating the same conversaiton over and over again with the same damn points I have a simple solution
<br />

<br />
 <span style="font-weight: bold">an official thread speaking to skeptics who don't belive in things should exist.With research, videos and examples. If after reading that they still don't believe then let them go on their marry little way. The constant addressing of disbelief is counterproductive to our goals, and should be put to a minimum.</span>
<br />

<br />
In the end we all say the same arguement and present the smae research and people either accept it or they don't. The thread could be a sticky and present common misconceptions and question they have and give answers.  When kn3wbz post skepticism one could simply post a link to it and lock the thread so that we can move on to more productive things. 
<br />

<br />
Furthermore, if it is somebody we can actually know instead of spending long hours arguing with them spend those hours trianing so that one day your powers will become so great that you can show them by example the truth behind psionics.

<br />
I agree. Passing on the knowledge is very important. But their is difference between teaching and attacking skepticism just like their are similarities between the two.
<br />

<br />
In both instances you are relaying information not known to another party. But in teaching you are teaching somebody who wants to be taught, who wants to learn. When dealing with skepticism you are dealing with convincing someone to believe something. Regardless of how much you try and whta arguement you say sometimes they choose to believe you, sometimes they won't.
<br />

<br />
You are correct when you say it is our obligation to teach. Thus this skepticism forum.
<br />

<br />
But would you agree that over time skeptics make the same point over and over again?
<br />

<br />
Would you agree that we tend to prove the same points and attack them with the same arguement over and over again? 
<br />

<br />
By making a sort of F.A.Q. type thread posting both what skeptics would say and the answers for them we serve in:
<br />

<br />
1.) Concentrating on answering these questoin to the  fullest extent to get more clarity than just a random preson posting.
<br />

<br />
2.) Save time and energy of replying to and having inexistance random posts about skepticism.
<br />

<br />
3.) Leaves us to focus more time on actually gaining psi skills than defending it.
<br />

<br />
Thus by doing this you not only increase a skeptics chance of learning and the information he has, but also gain more time for yourself so you wn't have to waste the time.
<br />

<br />
It's win win.
<br />

<br />

It's one where you debate for the opinion...that you don't believe in ^_^

I've seen it on some other forums before, it worked pretty well in opening people's minds to possibilities.
