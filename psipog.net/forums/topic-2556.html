			I have been practicing for 9 months withnthe piwheel and I still can't do anything, I sit thyere and focus on it becoming one, sometimes I get that feeling of power and then I try to make it move. I have trie asking it, expecting it, and even visualization but it won't move. Can someone pleas egive me some andvice like maybe an insight on the just do it method or what you think I might be doing wrong?
<br />

<br />
PS. I have been finding some hardened little ball thins i my room smalll and yellow does this have anything to do with psionics?

			The yellow things you described, I doubt very much; have anything to do with Psionics. The description you gave sounds like BB's (Ball Bearings) - used in toy guns. *Shrugs*
<br />

<br />
As for telekinesis, maybe try different approaches. 
<br />

<br />
Try throwing 'psi energy' at it, forcefully and if that doesn't work, 'gently' with the intention of moving the object.
<br />

<br />
Watch some video's of TK for inspiration. And try to replicate that movement on your object.
<br />

<br />
Try to gain a better rapport with your subconscious *Articles for that can be found on the main psipog website*. Try working out your own method.
<br />

<br />
Expect it to happen, really strongly; maybe involving emotions too - and then let it happen.
<br />

<br />
But mainly you'll just have to keep trying until it works. Some get it in a day, others apparently never. And everything in between. 
<br />

			to the small ball thingy: it most likely has nothing to do with it...but to your problem: if you've been trying that long with only one method, with no sucess then i suggest you find a different technique...try shooting a dense beam of psi energy at what your trying to move..that should work after some practice...its now what i use but it will work....and dont come back saying &quot;i tried it and it wont work&quot; because that is stupid....give that technique at least two weeks....now go practice it...

			Thanks for the tips, I did not think the ball things had anything to do with anything but I just had to make sure by the way, I know this will sound stupid but what is Ball Bearings?

			The BB's I was referring to are small ball shaped objects, either plastic or metal, commonly coloured that are fired from toy / artificial guns. I only made mention of them, because your description sounded similar.
