			I noticed something in the corner of my eye. It was a plant, and it seemed to be moving a little bit. When I looked at it, I got an intense pressure in the middle of my forehead. I felt connected to it instantly.
<br />

<br />
I made it turn left about an inch, right about an inch, and the most significant of all, I made it move up about an inch, and alot of the leaves seemed to go up as if they were under an air current. I could see the slack in the rope as I lifed it up. I turned it and lifted it a couple of times. This is after a session of trying to move a small crystal with no success and moving the psi-wheel with limited success.
<br />

<br />
It was.... weird.
<br />

<br />
I don't know if the pressure should be that strong, and even though I've stopped influencing the plant, or so I think, the pressure is still there. This is cool, but unsettling at the same time. I do, however, consider it a step forward in my development as a psion, and ultimately, a better person who is in control of their mind.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: About 5 minutes later and the pressure is mostly gone. Although, for a second there, I was focusing on using micro-pk to try and make a web page load faster, there was this fairly thick line, offset a little to the left of the center of the monitor, and it repeated from the bottom to the top. I can't seem to see it anymore.
<br />

<br />
EDIT 2: I've been making much progress on the psi-wheel today. I am pleased with my progress. You can't try too hard, and that's what I was doing. I was focusing so hard and trying to make it move. I kinda just let it move, if you know what I mean. If your sub-c is in control of it, then it is a very subtle mechanism. I'll learn how to control it yet. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Sounds to me like you've been focusing your third eye (if you believe in that sort of thing).  I'm afriad you'll have to look up the implications of that yourself as I don't know.
<br />

<br />
I wouldn't really worry about it unless it becomes paiful though.

			Sounds kinda like biokinesis too. I know this sounds weird but I can control moths and wasps to a limited extent. It's kinda fun when there's nothing to do at home (the moths are everywhere in my house).

			Yeah, before psipog, I had been trying to 'open' my third eye for a long time. I guess I'm just becoming more sensitive to it then...? Oh yeah, and the plant was a fake plant, so I'm not too sure about Biokinesis...
