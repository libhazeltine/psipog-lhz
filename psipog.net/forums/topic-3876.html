			i hope this is the correct forum.  I've been practicing with psi wheelsfor a little over a month now and i'd like to share some things that have helped me recently and i have some questions along the way.  recently i've found that if you encourage the psi wheel i know it sounds really stupid but it has helped me tremendously.  for example if i have hard time starting out i will say something like your amazing or this is so exciting.  it really gets it goin and i just keep coming up with posotive words to encourage it to spin or spin faster.  or another method i use is the just do it method.  i cant really explain that but i just sit there with my right hand next to it and it begins to turn.  I've also noticed that it spins better if my face is not right by it if i sit back and my face is a couple ft away then it spins better.  If i wanna change the direction of the psi wheel i either visualize it changing direction or i change from my right hand to my left hand.  the hand one works better for me.   using a psi ball to make the psi wheel spin doesn't work that great for me.  but i have a little trouble programming psi balls i cant even get one to flare so any tips are appreciated.
<br />

<br />
Well thankyou for listening to me.  i'd like to hear your oppinions on anything i said.  tell me how this stuff has helped you.

			Concerning the first method, it seems like you're actually convining your sub-c. But the same thing anways. Keep practicing and I found that when I put my right hand near the wheel it begins to spin one way, and then the other way with my left hand, too. Possibly body heat though.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

It could be because you feel more relaxed, it happens to me to, i feel more relaxed when i sit back in my seat, not crouched over the pinwheel like a vulture.

ahhhh maxus' spam is eating me alive, but on a serious note, have you tried to visualise your energy coming out as violet (violet is a really good colour, as it can be seen in all spectrums, so if you take a picture, mess around with gamma and contrast, youre likely to see it) and then forming a ball, this is a method i used to flare my first ball, im not sure if this is programming or not, but it certainly isnt hard.

			Referring back to the &quot;Chatting up the psiwheel&quot; idea....  It is works for computer-related psionic effects, such as the retro-micro-pk tests, and several of the effects that PEAR Inc studies.  I hadn't thought of using it for macro-pk, though.  Thanks for sharing.

<br />
mine too wil change directions if i change hands, but the nice stuff is changing direction with the same hand, and without moving it ^^
<br />

<br />
about telling the wheel is marvelous and stuff, really funny indeed ^^
<br />
maybe it works on yourself, making you more relaxed, or feeling a better conection with the wheel ^^
<br />
but who cares, it works !!!!!!
<br />

<br />
a question: does the wheel sometimes follows your hand? i mean, REALLY follows, like if it had a magnet or something on it?
<br />

<br />
ew, i think im getting better, im starting to put hand farther from the wheel (not round 1 cm anymore) and it spins!
<br />

<br />
ah, someone here said about hands heat: dear fellow, i think your hands heat can do nothing, for some logical reasons:
<br />

<br />
one: heat = energy, and it wont move anything alone just by hitting it, or you would turn anything you put into your microwave oven into soup (and it would spread all over the oven too =D)
<br />

<br />
the only possible way it would move the wheel would be by air currents generated by convexion currents (hot air is lighter then cold air, so it goes up, and so on), THEN the air would move wheel, as so, the wheel would need to be in vertical way, like a car's tire, so air could move it.
<br />

<br />
plus, it would just either go one side or another, and wouldn't change directions neither follow your hand (heat is getting OUT of your hand, so if it would move something, it would repel the object, not atract, OR both atract and repel without changing your hands position)
<br />

<br />
tell me if you disagree (or agree ^^) and feel free to flame my grammar, im not english anyway ^^

1) yes that happens to me, i cant remember who it was, but they told me to play follow the finger, and it worked, so ive been doing it ever since, with great control.

3 things::
<br />

<br />
1: when i read &quot;2 things&quot; i thought i was going to be flamed, lol, i think i was conditioned in a bad manner internet environment <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
2: does it? HOW NICE!!!!! it started following my finger and i didn't even heard about it! fun fun!
<br />
oh, let me tell you something i've noticed yesterday: well, when you start moving your wheel really well (read: a lot of times, almost all time it will follow your finger) you will almost always think that if you quit your pratice now, and then come back tommorow, you will move it almost instantly, as you were doing so well the past day. it's the logical way of thinking, right? i thought that when i had my first sucess, and got all excited. at the following day, i couldn't do it anymore in the way i was doing. how nice...
<br />

<br />
so, yesterday i was praticing. started at a quarter to midnight, and stopped at a quarter to one in the morning, one hour pratice.
<br />

<br />
things i've noticed: i was having so much fun on that, that even having no movments besides the air movment i sometimes did with hands or body, that the time was running very fast!. each time i concetrated and tried to move the wheel, it would have passed like 5 minutes!!! before then i thought 30 minutes was a lot of time. yesterday i felt it was like nothing!
<br />
second thing: when i looked at clock, and saw 30 minutes, i said: ew, alredy half an hour traning! (of course) and thought like: well, that is the &quot;recomended&quot; daily pratice time, yeah, some guys do it with 40 minutes too..
<br />
but i didn't want to stop. WHEN i reached 40 minutes, was all right, trying to move wheel, and stuff, THEN it happened: i was able to move it! it was now following my finger, like if it had just connected to me. i felt almost nothing i think (just very excited  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ). there was one time, that i put my hand back, and was looking to the wheel, and it was moving. ok, then i thought: i think it's wind. but let's check it out. then i started looking on one side of the wheel, it stopped moving to right, and started moving to left. &quot;lucky shot&quot; i thought. then i changed my look again. and again. at it would stop it's current movment direction and take the one i was looking to!!!!! it wasnt spining fastly mad, it was slow actually, but not so slow you couldnt see the movment. to be even more sure, i didnt let it go one way for more then 1 or 2 sec, cause sometimes this stuff go back and forth alone, so then less time you give it to change directions, it shows that it's really YOU moving it! (or the world's ultra biggest coincidence ever)
<br />

<br />
the question is: how much time it takes you dudes to move the wheel? it took me 40 minutes so i could do this smoothly!
<br />
oh, and what's the distance you make the follow finger thing? mine usually works in less then a cm.. sometimes more.... i put hand near it, then pull hand out (very slowly so it's not wind) not to let the wheel hit my hand.
<br />

<br />
oh, another nice stuff: i was concentrating on it, with my finger between two corners of the wheel. like 1,5 cm of the middle point between each other. i was there, concentrating, without moving finger (you will move without me moving my finger, yeah you will) and stayed there... then it sorta shaked a lill one way or another, visible shake, but didnt spin much. and i felt something, almost nothing, but a kind of sensation, but thought was nothing actually, just my imagination or so. i thought: &quot;it might be almost moving&quot; and stayed there. but then i got tired of it, and moved my finger. when i did it, the wheel spun violently towards me, i moved my finger towards myself too, but couldn't have made so strong wind to move that that way. i think it was the time i connected with it =D
<br />
really awsome!!
<br />

<br />
sorry if i'm making you all bored with this long posts...
<br />

<br />
3: thanks for that, much appreciate!!!!

			great job. lucky you it only took you 40 minutes it took me over a week but i only did like 10 minutes a day but now i go like over an hour a day to try and make my coke can move.  still no luck though.  i tested my strength on the psi wheel yesterday and got it to rotate 92 times without stopping and in the SAME direction.  the speed kept changing but who cares thats my best record ever.

lucky? well, not lucky i think ^^, in the beginning it was being hard... i htink i wasn't very concentrated.. anyway, don't know if you read one of my posts, which said about my sucess, but it took me almost a year to have results (well, a year of thinking and mind conditioning to accept all this). now with pratice im having better stuff. but wasnt like: got it in one week ^^
<br />
i got my first result on 16 of this month.
<br />

<br />
i think i read your post about your record, really nice indeed!!!!!

yesterday i made a handfull of complete spins too, without stopping, but didnt count.. with my hand kinda involving it, you know, like protecting the wheel from something. but didn't count as it doesn't matter much to me, if i can spin (and it started spining kinda fast, really nice), it's good for me ^^
