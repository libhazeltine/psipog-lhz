			Yea, ever since I have know about OBE's I have wondered about that. If you can leave your body to OBE I think death as a permenant OBE makes sense. I have read a document written by an experienced OBEr and he said that there are non physical people every where. Im guessing these are people who have died. But this is just what I think, im no expert.

Don't say that it's &quot;just what you think,&quot; because alot of other people have the same belief. I do. However, for some reason, despite the fact that a constant OBE would kick ass, I'm still afraid of death. Regardless, it does sort-of make sense.

			im really undecided. I have thought of going into an OBE right before you die, so your spirit would run off in the iar for ever. But, that would be weird, and probably lonely. On the other side, I believe there is a world type thing dead people go to, both evil and good, which would kind of be like an OBE. Bah. What do I care?

			Yeah, I can see what you're saying. The 'afterworld' idea is an interesting one, and that's what there is talk of astral planes and whatnot, each of them different. The arguement holds merit. Nobody really and truly knows, so until death, it's best to just prepare oneself (HAVE MANY MANY OBE'S!!!!). <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Here's an interesting thought:
<br />
If psi manipulation and suchlike is possible during an OBE...
<br />
And death causes a continuous state of OBE...
<br />
Then theoretically it could be possible, with a VERY high skill in telekinesis, to operate a computer after dying, and so communicate on forums and suchlike...

			I always believed in life after death, reincarnation and the like. That perhaps an OBE would ensue after death for a short while. all energy is reused, no form of energy is ever destroyed, just changed.  I think an OBE state would happen  and then you would be &quot;reused&quot;. In this world or another.. now thats a diffrent thought all together

			I think death would not be a constant OBE state, because I believe in the soul going directly to heaven, hell, or purgatory (limbo type place before heaven) after death. Although, a temporary OBE state between time of death and arival in the final place and/or state of being seems very probable to me.

			This question has crossed my mind before, too. The thing is, it seems that all of this psi phenomena is dependant upon our brains actually functioning. If we were dead, our brains wouldnt work. So...probably gonna guess death is just game over.

			Me and my friend were thinking about this but instead of having a constant OBE when you're dead we thought that when you're in a coma  (i think thats the right spelling) because sometimes people wake up. The people in the coma have a very hard time willing themselves into their body ( I think this because Peebrain said when he first had an OBE he couldn't move because he was scared/excited) but when you die that could be a posibility.
<br />

<br />
Haven't had an OBE yet  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> But I am close  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			No, I think OBE has nothing to do with Death. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> 
<br />
Why? Because in OBE, there is much brain activity (like in dream state). While, when someone dies the brain does not function anymore. In OBE, you have crisis, emotions like fear, happiness. Where do you think these feelings come from? Of course from the brain! So, when someone dies, no brain works, thus no crisis, no emotions....no OBE.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

I?ve had similar thoughts to this, but I think that it would be unlikely for everyone who died to go into a constant OBE state.  As this would mean that the world would be totally chocked full of dead people in an OBE state, and I?ve never herd of anyone saying that they saw a massive sea of people in an OBE state when they OBEd.  I also think it?s improbable (as others have pointed out) as you require a working brain for psionic?s.

			I can understand the brain not working part, however, I do believe that people have seen dead people while OOB, not to mention, the theory of there being many planes of existence and astral planes and whatnot... I think the arguement does show merit.
