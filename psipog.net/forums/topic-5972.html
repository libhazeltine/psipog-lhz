			OK, here I present the sum total of the rune system I have outlined, but in a compressed, streamlined, and elegant form.  Anyone can do this, so start making up your own stuff!
<br />

<br />
Point 1: Energy is Everything
<br />

<br />
Everything you make is composed of energy.  The basic building block of energy is G, or General psi.  This is psi with absolutely no properties save the fundamental laws of psi.  Other types of energy can be created from this by adding characteristics.  Simply describe each characteristic or law that is added.  These are critical components of any construct, and are easy to concoct and make (usually.  Very complicated energies can be very difficult to make).  
<br />

<br />
Point 2: Sigils
<br />

<br />
Now that you've created your energy, you can combine them together to make &quot;molecules.&quot;  These can range in complexity from just a few particles to a boggling combo of hundreds of energies in an intricate pattern.  They can connect together, interact, do work, transform, and do other interesting things.  It is important to realize that one of these mini-constructs or sigils is infinitely small, and when you draw a sigil representing it, you are in fact referring to a pool of a huge number of these.
<br />

<br />
Point 3: Construction
<br />

<br />
This is where you create the actual, functional construct.  Drawn on graph paper, each square can hold various entities.  A circle represents a pool of a type of energy or sigil can be drawn within it.  A square represents an action.  Energy is usually fed into it, and it can perform a task.  A triangle represents one element of a designation.  For all intents and purposes, think of it as a very simple visualization, or a rule for all nearby reactions.  If you want to get more complex, just add multiple of them.  Lines are connections between entities if drawn between midpoints on the graph paper (through the squares), or structural constraints when drawn along its lines.
<br />

<br />
If you can understand these 3 levels, you can create constructs using this system.  I am working on further expanding it, and then simplifying and incorporating the expansions.

			Hello!
<br />

<br />
I don't understand. How is one supposed to store energy in runes or sigils? And how could those runes fulfil tasks? What tasks could they fulfil? Can you make examples? And maybe say what you have tryed out and how it worked. 
<br />

			I dont think you store them in anything...the rune/sigil system is something he made for making advanced constructs.

			A rune or sigil or whatever is like a word in a book.  It doesn't &quot;hold&quot; anything.  However, it does tell your mind what to picture.  In a diagram made using this system, a symbol tells you what to put where and how to connect it up.  You aren't going to actually create something that looks like the diagram, with funky patterns on it like the shapes of runes.  You're going to make the construct that is defined by that as a description.
<br />

<br />
Think of this a diagram as a blueprint.  When the builder makes the house, it doesn't have those little floating numbers that say how long to make this board, or whatever.
<br />

<br />
And if you want examples, check out the Primitive Rune System (work in progress) post.  I posted like 5 of em in there.  And I'm about to make a new topic about another.

			<img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> sigh sigils and runes ehh well the thing most poeple need to understand here is there is diffrent styles of sigils and runes this stuff usally ties into magick&gt;majik or however you wish to say such a diffrent form of manipulation but it also ties into very advanced constructs. The method of sigils i use to use was channles to help focuss energy like intersecting lines and stuff but now i use more shall we say obscure stuff for the poeple who are strictly psionic would call me obscure <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. My methods are unique and most dont understand them because they dont get the concept of pentagrams being a good focusser. Once you understand one sigil out of a set or style of sigils then you can easly understand the rest of the system. <img src="images/smiles/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" border="0" />  or is such a idea to obscure for you people as well  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
