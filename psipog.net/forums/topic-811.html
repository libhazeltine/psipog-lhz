			Sceptics- an answer to why you haven't heard about psi, telekinesis, psi balls, and all our practices in the media and any creditable sources...
<br />

<br />
I apologize if this topic gets a bit religious, but i feel this is a nessicary topic to persue and perhaps clear a few things up. once i get this out, feel free to lock it, but i need to get the message across.
<br />

<br />
as you know, most of the civilized world is made up of different religious sects; predominantly christian, with muslim and jewish following close behind. as you also know, (or may not depending on what you have heard if you are not religious) is that anything touching the supernatural (ie- psi and most of it's workings) is taboo to these religious sects. history has shown that people who work in the fields of the supernatural are in a great deal of danger if their profession or hobby is made public. a good example is the british witch burnings in the early 9th century. people fear what they do not understand. many many women were burned at the stake in the 9th century, with a great deal or perhaps all innocent of their crimes.
<br />

<br />
a video of a woman going ballistic about a non-christian psychic. take a look.
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5464505634137914176" target="_blank">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5464505634137914176</a> 
<br />
(thanks to manwe who first put this on the forums)
<br />

<br />
with regards how the media falls into all of this, one simple sentence is required.
<br />

<br />
the media aim to please.
<br />

<br />
because most of the population is religious, the media will focus on that majority in most of its broadcastings and publications, and will attempt to avoid any content that casts that section of the populase in a bad light. perhaps once in a while a &quot;questionable&quot; article or ad will touch on certain aspects of religious &quot;taboo&quot; in an attempt to expose a truth or ideal. usually these are showered upon by the religious community with insults and banter. a good example is the evolution theory. the idea that humans evolved from the less intelligent monkey was never published for years after the theory was proposed. most newspapers turned it down almost immediately when it was brought to them. why?
<br />

<br />
the media aim to please.
<br />

<br />
if by a good stroke of luck the psi community was able to publish or broadcast their theories and ideals towards our abilities, i can almost guarentee that it will be recieved by most the general populace as ether bull, or sacreligious. perhaps in a different time we could publicly teach and be recieved as members of society with another gift to present humanity, but for now, we are unsung and will remain as such until people no longer fear that which they do not understand.
<br />

<br />
thank you for at least listening to me. i hope i covered the important points.
<br />

<br />
anyone who would like to elaborate on this topic, i would like to hear it.

			Don't think of yourself as so seperate from the &quot;public&quot;.  I used to think that I was an outcast for believing and practicing this stuff... then I finally got the balls to ask around.  It turns out that most people do believe in this stuff, although few actually practice.  And it's not that hard to get them to understand why we practice.
<br />

<br />
Usually my conversation goes something along the lines of:
<br />
&quot;well... you know how you have gut feelings about people right away?&quot;
<br />
&quot;yeah&quot;
<br />
&quot;I believe that the 'gut feeling' is a skill just like anything else, and you can learn to get better at it&quot;
<br />
&quot;oh that makes sense&quot;

			You have a point, parents have a big impact on these sorts of things.
<br />

<br />
Probably because they worry about their kids, parents aren't willing to allow their children to even attempt psionics, and so skepticism sort of grows from there.

			I disagree, Uri Geller had a great impact on every &quot;parent&quot; i know, only a few &quot;smart&quot; people were skeptic. Its not about what they dont understand, its how you sell it to them. People are skeptic about psyche due to all the fake mediums and wackos on tv.

Yes, uri is full of himself, but that does not change the fact that allot of parents i know beleived him, and that means that they are willing to beleive as long as its &quot;sold&quot; to them correctly.

			There are many reasons for psionics not being recognized in today's society. For one, the average person cannot sort the fluff (Late Night TV Psychics, Dragon Ball Z) from the real stuff so they adopt a belief that all psionic and psychic phenomena is fake or evil (mainly because of their religious teachings). Secondly, it is party the medias fault for portraying all psychics as old women who wear purple robes and tell the future in smokey rooms. 
<br />

<br />
I have seen shows like &quot;Are Psychics Real&quot; or &quot;Paranormal Investigations&quot; but they are hardly a credible source of information and at the end of all of them they just say something along the means of, &quot;Is it real? We will never know,&quot; or &quot;Can the eerie phenomenon ever be explained.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Presently psionics and psychic stuff is used in the media as either some unknown thing that is usually suggested as a parlour trick or some taboo or evil thing.
<br />

<br />
I believe that it will take a very long time for psionics to become accepted as an everyday thing. In order for this to happen, I think that many more scientists will have to aknowledge it's existence and there will have to be many more people who believe in and practice psionics.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Many parents may have heard of psionics but believe that it will harm their child in some way if they practice it. This again is a classic example of the fear of the unknown. It may be slightly easier for the next generation to be publicly accepting of psionics because more and more people will be practicing it.
<br />

<br />
P.S. Contrary to popular belief, there are more Muslims than Christians.

Absolutely. Channeling spirits is a real touchy-feely thing nowadays. Supposedly, random people can be taught to channel spirits within one week (there was a television show a month or so ago showing that). From what I've witnessed, all these channelers are just a bunch of drama school dropouts or hobos looking for some recognition (no offense meant if there are any drama school dropouts or hobos reading this).
<br />

<br />
So I just have one other thing to say: The media may believe psychics are total fraud (Who can blame them, with all they've seen?), but there's no use trying to tell them what to think. They'll learn about us eventually.

Also the pshionic (wrong spelling I know) is small. Technically, it's not needed for life obviously. Just for some fun therefore it's not recognised as important. And why should the media be interested in it anyway when it's not worth the time or effort?
