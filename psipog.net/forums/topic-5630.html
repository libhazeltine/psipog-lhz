			Hi everybody. I just decided to sign up and post and stuff because last night, as I stumbled upon this site, I opened peebrain's pdf The Psion's Handbook: Overview of Psionics. I began reading, and I admit I was a bit skeptical at first but, at the point where he asked me to do the whole blue and white blob thing inside me I tried it sitting on my couch near my computer. As I did it, I wasn't feeling anything at first, then I began to feel a warmth wherever I willed the sort of &quot;electricity&quot; or &quot;sparks&quot; as he said to let the blob shoot out. I was amazed at the sensation, and how I could will it anywhere in my body. I felt it go down my left arm, back up to my chest, then down my right arm, back up to my chest, then when I willed it to the legs it split down both. 
<br />

<br />
It was an amazing feeling, so I began trying more the next day. Or well, today since I &quot;stumbled upon&quot; the site at 2 AM. Anyways, I tried it again today, and I tried to create a psi ball. But instead of the just one that I could feel I decided to try the other next thing, about creating a cube of fire to feel the warmth. I tried it, and after a few minutes of focusing the cube took shape! I was even more amazed now, and I could hold it with my thumb on one side and one or two fingers on the other side of the cube. Whatever fingers were touching it had a tingly feeling, and I could push the cube against my other hand and feel the warmth. If I pushed the cube farther then should be possible if it was solid, I could feel a magnetitc force pushing me back, only slightly, not hugely powerful. It was as if they were magnets of the same polarity, it was crazy. 
<br />

<br />
Well, now that I look at other hellos I've gotten carried away and typed more then many of the other new people here...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" />  xD
