			I dream often and usually in my dreams I am in communication with others. Often I find myself giving off emotions to others in my dream to convey anything from a simple answer to a complex idea. The same goes for them &quot;saying&quot; something to me. I'm empathic and sometimes in real life I can catch roughly what someone is thinking or understand more clearly what someone is saying through my empathic ability. I think these two are somehow related and I wonder what you guys think of this. I have heard that some scientists speculate that many years ago humanity communicated through simple grunts and ever fewer speculated emotions.
<br />

<br />
So I have some questions for you:
<br />

<br />
Have you ever communicated in a dream using emotion?
<br />

<br />
Do you think this is related to some primitive instinct passed down from our ancestors? 
<br />

<br />
Do you think it is possible to take this beyond dreams and to real life creating a simple form and/or combination of telepathy and empathy? Or a midpoint of the two since many think the two are connected or one in the same.

I know where you're comming from, I'm also to an extent emapthic and often  can recieve what the other person is thinking or feeling when i'm with them. What I would like to do is try to have control over the thoughts and feelings that I recieve and be able to be more advanced in these techniques. I guess what I'm trying to get at is if you fully undrestand telepathy and empathy creating a simple form or combination of telepathy and empathy is very much possible in my opinion. Remember the mind has great powers and the only way to reach them is with hard work.

I agree with you I think it takes some dedication to fully develope and focus ability. I'd like to achieve full control over my abilities as well. Then as you've said trying a sort of medium between the two would be possible. I believe that would be a good goal for me.
