			Columbus arrived at the Americas because he chose to challenge the status quo. He didn't let societies' understanding of the world, and the universe itself prevent him from pushing onward; he believed in something, and so, he chose to seek out answers. How? By looking for them literally. In order to come to a conclusion, then you must seek out your own path and come upon your own answers. That's the choice: are you to listen to yourself, or to society? That's entirely your decision.
<br />

<br />
I understand what you're trying to say, but you're missing the point. Whether everyone elses' views are merely misconceptions is irrelevent. What is important is that you seek out your own answers. Only in yourself, deep down, can you truly find the answer. It's there.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

James Randi will give you 1m dollars if you pass his challenge. I won't listen to any psychic until they pass that test...

Do you see the illogic there?

Don't get me wrong, I practice psi, and have had much success with telepathy with a friend. However. You are being more closedminded than the skeptics.

			The absolute wrong approach has been taken to disprove NI. He does not need to be disproved, anyway, but there are physical tricks to levitate a swiss army knife, not just high-tech fakery. Magic is plentiful with devices to recreate psychic phenomena, usually in very convincing ways. Has anyone here heard of invisible string? It is absolutely undetectable on film in the proper lighting conditions, and could be set up to recreate the photo.
<br />
 Now, has anyone here heard of telekinesis? That's more likely. It too is absolutely undetectable on film (excepting the result), and could very well be what is happening in the photo.
<br />
 There is no need for exposes and articles to be written up on this; it's just a picture.

			Any person, especially illusionists and cold readers, can do most things people claim are &quot;psi&quot;, and photographs and poor quality web cam videos are not very good proof of magickal abilities. 
<br />

<br />
The photograph in question being discussed is of very good quality, but my impression of it is that it looks hoaxed in one form or another, whether through photoshop or simple illusionist tricks. 
<br />

<br />
I am with james randi in most instances, even though I have seen very good evidence for there being a large discrepancy between stage magic (illusion) and real magick. Unfortunately when real magick is put to the scientific method it often fails. 
<br />

<br />
There is good reason why Randi's challenge has not been won, and it is not because he is biased and simply unwilling to accept evidence and pay out the cash. 
<br />

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.

What you mean by extraordinary claim now, might not be later on. At Newton's time, it took some awesome proof to make people believe in gravity. At Galileo's time, it took some awesome proof that Earth actually orbited around the sun. But now, at this time, if you look back then, you won't find the &quot;awesome proof&quot; to be that awesome anymore. You might be expecting awesome proof of psionics too, but as of this time, it can't still be given out. The proof anyone could ask for is in them, after people try and decide for themselves if psionics exist or not.

			awsome examples of psionics have already been given but most people didnt know it or didnt want to know it because humans fear what they dont understand....have you ever heard of people just knowing how someone else felt, like parents and children?telepathy/broadcasting;psionics...ever had a dream that you actually remembered for a long period of time and then you had a case of deja vu with the same settings as the dream?remore veiwing;psionics...the proof is all around but people are just to stubborn or they're to afraid to change their way of thinking.......open minds are rare these days <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

<br />
If this is indeed true then he could be sued for the money and the psionist would win, though they would have to prove their claims in court by doing demonstrations. 
<br />

<br />
There is also a way to trick him into breach of contract I am sure. 
<br />

<br />
I should go to law school LoL...
<br />

<br />
As far as the proof of anything goes... Again, if someone can do something on command like that without any illusion involved, then reproducing the effect for courts, scientists, etc., would garner acceptance for such people and phenomena without any person having to question it. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
If you don't want to do that then you don't have to win a million dollars.

<br />

<br />
Well if one cannot pass a preliminary test then why should randi waste his time trying to test someone that independant scientists have already verified has no psionic ability? And if you do verify it and they refuse to accept it then there are legal means that one can rectify the situation with. No one either cares or has done it.

			whether or not NI actually levitated the swiss army knife or not, I personally have had a lot of success with TK.  I know that diehard skeptics won't believe me, but I really couldn't care less.  The only thing I can say to them is read the articles with an open mind and try it for yourselves, without any preconceived notions of what is going to happen.  You might end up hugely surprised like I was.
<br />

<br />
No one who takes this psi/experimental science stuff seriously is trying to prove anything for their own gain, and though healthy skepticism is good total ignorance is just totally irritating.
<br />
We are experimenting with real, unusual phenomena here in the most scientific, though amateur, way that we possibly can, and whether or not you believe a word that we type, if you can't at least take this seriously then go away.

			I've also had much success with tk...  One someone says to me--&quot;Body heat&quot; I really don't believe them either because I don't know how the body heat of my hand can affect something a meter away... Right?
<br />

<br />
I ran a little test on the image, and I'm pretty sure that it is fake myself.
<br />

<br />
When we open the original image with notepad, we can see at the top of the line:
<br />

<br />
&quot;???? JFIF   H H  ?? U-Lead Systems, Inc. ?? ? &quot;
<br />

<br />
This means that it has been saved by &quot;U-Lead Systems, Inc&quot; software.  (If you had saved it with Photoshop, it would have said Photoshop and the version)
<br />

<br />
I googled up &quot;U-Lead Systems, Inc&quot; and found a website...
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.ulead.com" target="_blank">http://www.ulead.com</a>
<br />

<br />
U-lead systems is a &quot;Multimedia Software Developer&quot;  They have programs that specialize in video and image editing.
<br />

<br />
So, If the image is being saved by high class image editing software there is reasonable evidence saying that the image has been editied by that image editor.
<br />

<br />
But maybe NI was just editing the image so he could add to &quot;NI doing TK for REAL!&quot; thing.  OR maybe he just edited the image all together?
<br />

<br />
But the fact remains, the image was saved by a high class image editor.

			I either used Photostyler, Photoshop, or Paint Shop Pro, to add that text to the image.  I have the original image (before &quot;NI doing TK for REAL&quot; was added)... I'll check what it says:
<br />

<br />
???? JFIF  H H  ??4Photoshop 3.0 8BIM?    
<br />

<br />
So there ya go.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, what does it all mean?  It could be fake... it could be real... no one really knows for 100% except for NI.  And it'll stay like that for eternity, because he was the only one who experienced it.
