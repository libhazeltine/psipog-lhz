			I was sitting in my bed thinking one day... thinking about lucid dreaming, how addictive it is, how vivid the dreams can become, how powerful you are in them once you fully grasp the proper technique, how it makes you feel in the real world when you wake up- i started thinking &quot;how could one put this to use in the real world?&quot; People say things like, ok it's a good ego boost b/c it seems real but it can't do much for you other than possibly encouraging you to be a bit more assertive.  Well it's a fact of the human brain that the more you put yourself in a particular state, the easier it is for your mind to return to that state.  That's why fun people are usually fun, sad people are usually sad and dumb people.. well, you get the idea.  Try this on for size-
<br />

<br />
If you can dream to perform and be successful in TK over and over again, you are using your subconscious, although you are asleep it's your subconscious that continues to return to this state of possesing the ability to perform Tk based on success with Tk in your dream.  So being awake or asleep has no bearing.
<br />

<br />
-So, by using Lucid dreaming it's my hypothisis that you can overcome the fact that you can't initially DO something and gain positive re-inforcement.  It's kind of like a game genie for you subconscious...  I'm going to try this, but please don't wait for me to give results, it could take a bit.  If it sounds interesting then do it!  Make your dreams come true... literally.

			Thats actually a really good thought about Lucid Dreaming, I never thought of it that way, and it makes sense to me.
<br />
It's hard for me to Lucid dream, but i'll try harder and try to get results like the examples you said XD

			That's like what I read in one of the sites articles; telling yourself you are telekinetic and that it's possible to reinforce it in your subconcious. I've never tried lucid dreaming, but it sounds like that would be more effective, since your subconcious speaks to you through dreams, and most likely vice versa.

			This has actually proven to work for me in the past. It wasn't with TK, but rather with Algebra <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> .  You are technically using the same part of your brain to dream as you are to think, as you said. I imagined myself a professor of Algebra, and to this day I feel more confident. I haven't specifically tried it with TK, but I think that I might start to try it, it is after all the same logic. Great idea, kyzyr!

			technically (and maybe this breaks some type of rule) i think it should be in both sections since we're dealing with lucid dreaming as a tool to ultimately improve TK.

			I don't have lucid dreams often, but recently I had one or two where I could perform telekinesis in a lab area. The feeling I have while I am awake and practicing TK is identical to the feeling I had in the dream. So, I agree with your method, it definitely helped me to focus and attain a certain state of mind (not to say I'm anywhere I want to be). If that's what your hypothesis is, I mean.

			Nice idea! If I ever get into lucid dreaming, I may try it. And this needs to go into the personal techniques section.

			I'm advocating that this be a normal practice and not really a one time- cure all form of persuading the sub-c.  Also, and again, this is MY <span style="font-style: italic">theory</span> but maybe if you dreamt of moving bigger things than what you were particularly focusing on, your sub-c may not make the connection- analogy-  I'm still struggling with the psy wheel, i wouldn't dream of sliding a chair, i would dream of spinning the psy wheel out of control.  allthough it makes sense according to the theory that if we dream of doing bigger things than our sub-c will operate in more fimiliarity and more easily perform the smaller things, i think the task at hand needs to be kept in context... otherwise in my -theory- the sub-c wouldn't make the connection.  Generally it's the same task.  performing TK.  Technically moving &quot;bigger&quot; things is a completely different feat.
