			ok ever since i have started the trend of scanning each other ive decided to do another. this time it could get harder.
<br />

<br />
Ok, first tell me the 3 albums i just downloaded and the song that is owned by a tv network and is played on a show involving something grim
<br />

<br />
then tell me what new instant messaging thing ive downloaded and possibly my account name/s
<br />

<br />
them try and figure out if my eyes have changed color.
<br />
lol pitiful attempts but i do believe theyre the color i want it to be
<br />

<br />
and finally tell me what i just joined in with my friends
<br />

<br />
lol welcome to my realm...
<br />

<br />
also can someone tell me why my accnt in the psipog site is Spikeydude not psikey and why the pw isnt what i normally get? thats just a general question i dont know if why. 
<br />

<br />
and soon i will learn this technique

			your password has been scrambled due to your lack of comprehending material on this website. i doubt anyone wants to scan you to figure out what the hell youre downloading. sure you dont want someone to just HACK your computer? it would be much easier than using RV *duh*

			What kind of scanning are you talking about? This sounds more like a deep telepathy probe rather than a simple scan.

			hehehe, hacking into my computer would be hard as i know about disconnecting the hacker. so i decided that i would try to disconnect someone trying to connect to me.
<br />

<br />
also ive been here for awhile and like messing with ppl, i just wanted to know if my pw was changed or not im not sure tho, but w/e i dont really care cuz it told me my pw thru my email. 
<br />

<br />
and ya i do think this would be a deep scan thingy so it would be good practice for this kinda stuff as i am a volunteer to being ppls &quot;dummy&quot; to this stuff.
<br />

<br />
also the songs would be easy as ive been listening to them constantly and cant get them outta my head! lol
