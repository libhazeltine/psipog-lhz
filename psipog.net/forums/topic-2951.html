			I never started with a psi wheel or anything like that.  I tried a psi wheel once and I didn't succeed.  I started with moving people's hands using my psionic power.  I did it to a few people at school and learned not to reveal the ability.  The wya I did it was I put my hand over their hand and lifted up and over time they would move.  Eventually I became able to do it without putting my hand above their hand.  About six months ago I practiced it alot and was able to do it from about ten feet away.  I was able to take my girlfriend's hand and make it open and close without using my hand but just having her hold it in mid air.  I could have her sit it on something and I could make her hand feel like it was asleep and then make it where it didn't feel like it was asleep.  I was finally able to stop her from striking me in any way.  I would concentrate all of my energy to a single point then expand it like a wall.  She would go to punch and I would feel my energy collect at the point it was coming and I could stop it.  It caused a little bit of harm to her wrist.  I was also able to do this to a few other people.  Suddenly I became very tired after days of doing this, I was not able to concentrate on anything.  I could barely even lift a hand or other body part anymore.  I took a week off to rest from doing it.  That was about five months ago and I have not been able to do it since.  Please... someone help me I can't even feel like I did when I used to do it anymore.
