			Don't expect jokes from me on this topic...this is serious to me.
<br />

<br />
You see, normaly I keep my reseach to myself untill I make some kind of real breakthrough. The reason for this shouldnt be hard to figure out..its so I don't fill you heads with pointless crap that was already figure out or already discover for it to be crap. This subject may seem silly to you, but to me it has gotten irrietated.
<br />

<br />
Over a small while now I practice with my own methods with the sub-c (that have proven effective in the past) to create a powerful love feeling. Personaly I never really felt true love seeing I never even had a girlfriend. Just a crush now and again. But I have expereince 2 powerful feelings of love before. But only in my dreams. Which I have posted before, but never really got a good reply.
<br />

<br />
<a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=5283" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=5283</a>
<br />

<br />
I used these 2 dreams as examples to try to create powerful love (with methods with the sub-c of cource) but all have turn out to be failures. I have gotten some results, but not a single spark of the same feeling from these 2 dreams. Infact because of the results I have started to think of the pisnoic energy itself being some form of human &quot;selfish&quot; powers. I know psionis healing and other methods jump in my head. But I have not yet seen powerful results from my own healing methods, so on a emotional stand point part, I feel healing is impossible by it. Over thoughts over it I keep seeing &quot;selfish&quot; desires being forfilled by it.
<br />

<br />
I do see a difference from bodily works and energy works such as chaning your eye color, or from creating a psi ball.
<br />

<br />
I can go on...but seeing myself in this state I can not exaclty see the answer I'm looking for. Each time I think about this, I come to this depressing state of thought. So by act of judgement, I found that its nesscery to give some of my information in order to collecte some of the missing pieces I am missing from my emotional stand point. Being open minded as I am, I know that the statement of psionic energy truely being a &quot;selfish&quot; device could be true. However also the 3rd opinion of that both answers are wrong.
<br />

<br />
I will like any information you have on &quot;love&quot;, from energy forming, mediation, telepathic, dreams, sciencefic articles, even relateship issues. Everything that comes to mind. 
<br />

<br />
I like to say about, that this may seem silly to some of you. But to me this is serious from my current psychological state. I don't want jokes on this topic..I won't attack you if you do. But don't expect a laugh.

All I can say is this. Energy is energy, you mold it into how it is. If you want to look at it as selfish, then it is. But only to you. 
<br />

<br />
You or I can never truly label how energy exsists. Because that is all it does, it exsists. Then, we can manipulate how it exsists. 
<br />

<br />
The only way energy can be selfish, is if the person wielding the energy is selfish.

			You are gonna get some fire for this since it DOES sound fluffy. In fact, love is a powerful feeling that can be recreated for psionic purposes. This is only a very vague hypothesis and I don't see a lot of reason to try to research it. I have these things I call metafeelings that totally overwhelm me and are unlike anything I ever experienced. There are 4 so far. 2 are when I'm about to fall asleep and are kinda like really chaotic feelings and visions that run together of just random images or distorted people either really really smooth and flowing or really rough and hard to follow. These 2 are easy to recreate and not that important. The third one is meta-dread which cam to me in a dream. The dream was about an italian marriage but was sort of just in the background. The main part of the dream was a backgammon game with billions of peices and peices would move when things happened in the story. I felt this dread feeling of suspense and dread when people in the story were flying to italy to go to the marriage but really they were gonna get killed. Lots of backgammon peices were piling up and I just felt this weird feeling in the back of my throat of dread and helplessness. I haven't been able to recreate this in a while. The 4th feeling is love. Each metaemotion is classified by it's vague barriers on whether it's idea or emotion and its overwhelming power of the mind. The commonplace or nirvana is in a class all it's own but metaemotions are closely related. That's why I think metaemotions may have some connection to psi since the commonplace is the direct link between your mind and psi.

Thats not how I'm seeing it. To try to control this power for any gain seems selfish to me, I see few things that arn't.
<br />

<br />
As for Niushirra, when I felt this energy the 2nd time and absorb it and I felt my chest start to float into the air. I know this was happening when I was awake because it felt the same way my arms were in the air the first time. But regardless I match this to your forth.
<br />

I enjoy your information on the metafeelings hypothesis you explain.
<br />

<br />
However I am disapointed that I got only a few information on this....

Oh, okay then. I see what you are saying. 
<br />

<br />
This makes things a little more complicated. But, I think that, since this energy is avaliable to us, then we have the right to use it. It would be selfish to ask for more energy though, more energy than you would naturally get. Such as stealing the energy from another, unless you actually had none, then I see it as an emergency. 
<br />

<br />
All of the psions I have met here and some other places are very mixed in their personalities. Some may very well be selfish, but most, are not. We are just curious beings that have gone farther than most. We keep on moving to see what this is all about. Not expecting something for ourselves. We all have our reasons for our actions. 
<br />

<br />
Maybe there is no answer for this though. We all view how this energy is. I have my views, you have yours. And just because one has a view, it doesn't mean that it is right either.

			Ah, yes, the pleasant giddy sensation just above the solar plexus.  I've been experiencing this lately, because I've been developing a relationship with a girl in my school whom I'm already friends with.  (Taking it slow; relationship is healthier that way, and besides that I don't really have any competition.  Not because she's ugly, but because she's a workaholic and outspoken...meh I'm rambling)
<br />

<br />
My advice to you, Mr. Tankdown, is to attempt to get yourself a girlfriend.  It may (or may not, lol) save you a lot of effort.

No.

Energy is energy. You might as well ask to create loving water, or hateful iron, or curious copper.
<br />

<br />
If you're really interested in this sort of stuff, though, there's plenty of white-lights-and-fluffy-bunnies sites out there that would be more than happy to discuss it with you. 
<br />

<br />
I believe that it's an indication of the decrepit state of PsiPog that this sort of discussion is going on; back in the good old days, this thread would have been laughed up and down at if it were not simply locked and the perpetrators sternly warned.

			energy is eneryg!? so are nerves through your brain is simply chemicals resulting from simple energy bouncing around your ceneter nerves system and your spine. But its able to make a sequence with your body to release certain chemicals from certain emotions to create a result back to your conscience.
<br />

<br />
Matter, electricly, heat are all simply energy resulting from something more basic. True these arts most of us have practice have come up with cold and heat. But how are you so sure that psionic energy can't come up with more then just that!?
<br />

<br />
The part of everything is connected to everything is that everything can effect everything from some form of actions it takes. 
<br />

<br />
How can you be so sure that its unable to create a love feeling!? How can you be so sure its unable to create hate or chaos!? How can you be so sure of what you JUST SAID!?
<br />

<br />
I guess talking about huffy duffy lovely things are not that much of interest to some people. The way you said that made me even more &quot;up tight&quot; about this whole thing. You talk as if your so sure this is a &quot;fact&quot;.
<br />

<br />
The reason why I am asking these questions is because &quot;love&quot; tends to create far more &quot;meaning&quot; to people lifes then any other emotion. I guess I must have misunderstand you because what you just said was richilous to me. From what you just said told me, is that tells me that psionic is infact not just selfish but also &quot;useless&quot; because it fails to give one of the most powerful emotions we need in our lifes.
<br />

<br />
I know some of my words themselfs are fluffy and just plain sad in some terms. But its how I talk, I try to talk straight from the sub-c in my messages. I also sorry if some of my words in this topic seem hateful.

			I don't really know why, but I see people who complain about fluffy-ness worse than I do for the ones who are labeled as &quot;fluffy.&quot;
<br />

<br />
It's like you accept nothing, it's like you haven't grown up. It's like there is a deep &quot;no no&quot; to the word &quot;love.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
I don't think Tankdown is being fluffy, I think he is being open, and he is being criticized for it. I haven't seen him talk about something fluffy before, and yet, there are the dogs waiting to strike. 
<br />

<br />
Tankdown is exploring life, checking things out, he is doing a better thing than you fluff guards. 
<br />

<br />
Now actually looking at it, I think the whole &quot;fluff&quot; term is actually just a defensive shield made up to defend what this site is not about. This site was not about love and such in the past but look, the site is dying, and that shield is gone. I think the least you can do is no longer accept the shield's existence.
