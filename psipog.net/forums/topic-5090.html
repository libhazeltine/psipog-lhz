			Well, you will probally just regret reading this, because I have been pondering this for about a month now.  Since, everyone who visits this webpage, has knowledge or atleast realizes altering your surroundings with the energy it contains is possible.   So, if the beginning of the age of man, those who walked the Earth, is it possible that they were able to create a &quot;psi creature&quot; who basically lived forever, following the law of matter/energy can neither be created nor destroyed.  
<br />

<br />
Would it be possible as they were &quot;worshiping&quot; a suprioer power, they instead were creating it.  That way, a God was born.  Having the ability to be &quot;seen&quot; by those who truely believe in it.  (Just like Psionics)  
<br />

<br />
Not really sure where I am going with this, is it just possible that we, humans, created a psi god, and turned that into one that was real?  
<br />

<br />
Would it be possible to create your own god?

			DUDE!! you need to read <span style="font-style: italic">American Gods</span> by Niel Giaman.  It's hilarious, well written, great plot and is centered around EXACTLY what you said.  But anyway this is REALLY interesting but going to be locked brcuase psi created or not, it's still god.

			Ah, nuts.  This is a neat topic, and would probably be fun to talk about, but I can't imagine that this discussion would stay the course and avoid meandering into very religious territory.  Sorry guys, locked.
