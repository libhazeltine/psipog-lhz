			This article is so good I have to share: <a href="http://www.spaceandmotion.com/Evolution-Biology-Wave-Genetics.htm" target="_blank">http://www.spaceandmotion.com/Evolution-Biology-Wave-Genetics.htm</a>
<br />

<br />
If the link doesn't work just click on evolution/utopia and go to the article evolution biology:wave genetics
<br />

<br />
Psionics is real and explainable
<br />

<br />
O.K. after you read the article consider this idea: 
<br />

<br />
The article says it is very hard to influence things individually but collectivly we can have a god-like ability to shape our world. I propose that we experiment with this. First we should telepathically link to combine consciousness so to speak and then try influencing the same object.

			Very interesting theories; However, the entire source of the article comes from a single book. So it makes me wary. We'll have to see if any other information comes out confirming what it stated in the article.

			As someone studying biochemistry right now... not very convinced.  I might be more convinced if he presented more data, but even then.  I'm not saying he's definitely wrong, I'm just saying he's probably wrong <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

So I tend to agree with pyroman.

			I think it could be true if only because it was Russian scientist and the Russians have been studying psychic techniques of a very long time.  It makes scene they would be the ones to figure out how it works.  I got a book on remote viewing and it is very informative one how governments got into psi stuff.  It also said that Russians were the first to do psi and have spent millions on it every year for I think 50 years.  So this could be I repeat &quot;could&quot; be real.

			Well, mind can directly influence matter, as it is hold by some scientist. But concerning this article I'd like to say that I surfed their site <a href="http://www.fosar-bludorf.com" target="_blank" class="postlink"> their site</a> and I found nothing outstanding. No information about the authors. And typical popular reading stuff aka &quot;All-in-one&quot;. I agree with Chimeric here. Not enough evidence presented by the authors of that article.

			I have always felt that DNA and genes could be altered without the use of science and genetic engineering, but rather with only the strength of mind. I concur with this writer's opinion.

			They dont appear to know the meaning of the words junk DNA (There entire article seems to use this as a corner stone and yet its more or less the same thing as people claiming we only use 5% of our brains...), they connect DNA to language in one of the most tenuous links ive ever seen (Essentially, they both have sets of rules...) they claim to explain effects such as hynosis which, in case they didnt know,  have already been explained in other fields of science that actually have evidence to back them up. Most of the remaining information is explaining effects that we have no evidence even exist in the first place. They claim perfectly capable and intelligent people didnt infact accomplish great things they got it through 'hypercommunication' which not only belittles there accomplishment it has no proof. (In fact the article seems to use the anecdote as its evidence...)
<br />

<br />
Most worryingly of all is how this refers to current genetic engineering. It not only wants to replace it, it wants it stopped. Thats where it goes from crackpot theory to a dangerous attack on recognised science.
<br />

<br />
Maybe this article is twisting the books contents and I imagine it can not go in to any great depth about this work. There are simple tests for all these things though. Peer reviewed papers. When someone can find one by these scientists, (and I have looked.) that has been through the review process then you have something. Until then im having a hard time seeing this as anything but a lot of unsubstantiated pseudo scientific babble.

But why would you want to cause malignant cancer with the strength of the mind? Except in combat, of course, which you shouldn't be discussing here.
