I dont know whether or not I believe the stuff on this site, but you guys certainly do know a lot on meditation, and I have a question. 
<br />

<br />
Can you, once you get good enough, meditate instead of sleep? I have heared that if you meditate long enough you go into REM, and that is the only part of sleep that really matters, so I am guessing it is possible.

			Well, think of it this way, When we sleep, we pretty much go into a form of meditation untill we hit REM. So, if you hit REM during meditation, you're still sleeping.

I suppose that the brain states during sleep can be achieved through meditation, but, why bother?  We sleep a certain way for a certain amount of hours at certain times for specific reasons.  Don't mess with a good thing.  Meditation is beneficial, but I wouldn't recommend using it to replace sleep.

			Sort of. This is a complicated subject. With enough practice (See: At least a few years) it is possible to replace some sleep with meditation, BUT who knows if you can replace all sleep with meditation. My suggestion is to not try by staying up a few nights meditating.
<br />

<br />
If this doesn't make enough sense or doesn't have enough information/sources just ask for me to fix it/add sources.

			I dont really see the point of doing it, but if your hitting the same state of consiousnes(or un, w.e) then i supose it would work, but never tried or plan on it.
<br />

<br />
Meditation makes for great naps though!   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

And the SA about Psipog was really bad.  They picked all the post fromt the random newbies that come through everyonce and a while and fluff up a storm, and then usually leave in a week.  So unfair.  lol

			It is possible to suppliment your sleeping needs with meditation.  It is also possible to replace your sleep needs with meditation, but that is reserved only for masters of meditation (and those masters usually meditate for 10-24 hours a day).  Theoretically, if you become a master of meditation, then you can meditate for 2 hours a night instead of sleeping but I haven't heard of anyone on that schedule ever because masters usually meditate for long periods of time.
<br />

<br />
One schedule I did hear about was The Vilna Gaon in the 18th century I think, who would meditate for 1 hour, 4 times a day, and never sleep.  Though he spent the rest of his time in a pseudo-trance studying and at times he'd stand in a bucket of cold water in the chill night air to keep himself awake and studying because even with his mastery he would feel really, really tired on his schedule.
<br />

<br />
For normal human level people with at least a year of experience (that is, doing it every day for a year), then you can meditate for 15-30 minutes in the middle of the day and can cut your sleep needs at night by 1-2 hours (depending on your level).
<br />

<br />
Keep in mind that it is a very specific type of meditation that's used for sleep-replacement, not every meditation will work.

			dudes, why meditate when you can just sleep? Sleeping is easier and less time consuming, why bother...
<br />

<br />
and also, meditation is not intended to replace sleep, in my oppinion.

			Actually a good reason for meditating rather than sleeping is so you'll be conscious during your REM periods (for lucid dreams)
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.dreamviews.com" target="_blank" class="postlink">&lt;&lt;lucid dreaming&gt;&gt;</a> 
<br />

<br />
If you could find a way to quickly induce a REM state through meditation then you could skip all the unneeded deep sleep periods and sleep for maybe 2-3 hrs a night (of total dreaming-REM sleep)

			I have found that meditating instead of sleep helps during times were you can only fit 1 hour of rest in and you are a deep sleeper. By meditating instead you can make yourself aware enough of your suroundings so as to not go into a deep sleep. In fact 2 nights from today, I had that case and went into a meditive sleep. I was listening to my TV for 1 hour and my alarm went off. I woke up nice and refreshed with the feeling that I hadn't been laying in bed for more than 10 minutes. As for replacing sleep premantantly, I couldn't tell you whether thats smart or not. Though <span style="text-decoration: underline">theoreticaly</span> If you meditate with the proper intentions in mind then it could be possable and benifitial.
