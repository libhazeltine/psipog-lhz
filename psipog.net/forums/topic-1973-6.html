			Well i started making a psi ball...i think i did make one..
<br />
I always feel as if there is a magnet between my hands and the force is pushing my hands away..is that normal??
<br />

<br />
And sometimes my psi ball just goes away, it just vanishes...is that also normal.
<br />

<br />
Plz tell me cause i cant do flares without these answers.

			Im new, hi...
<br />

<br />
I started this a little while ago, and I dont know if I'm making on or not.
<br />
I continuously think its there, but I dont know if it truly is or not.
<br />
For instance, I make a psi ball and I Imagine its there.. But I dont truely know if I've made it or its just my imagination.
<br />
I can sort of see little short wriggly white things, but I think its my eyes making me think that...
<br />
Yes. So am I making a Psi ball do you think?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			I think I began to make one. My hand felt like it was wearing a thin glove, and I saw a collection of phosphenes where I wanted the ball to be.
<br />

(For those who don't know, phosphenes are those little pricks of light you see when you close your eyes and rub them a little.)

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
When i did this, i felt like nothing was in my hands.  Did i make one??

			The main thing is that you feel something. If you feel something, you are in the right direction. Don't be afraid to try new visualization methods or make your own. There's no set rules. As for feeling the psiball, some people feel tingling, warmth, coldness, pressure, etc. But don't immedietly discard any feeling because that's not how you think energy/psiballs should feel like. Be receptive, be open.
<br />

<br />
Basalisk, if you feel warmth in your hand, it means you've directed energy there. It needs to go in the space between your hands. Once there, it must be condensed and packed tightly and densely into a ball. You're going to know when you have one. For me when I make them, it's as if there's a warm/semi-hot spherical outline, a shell if you will, almost static in touch. At any place on the ball I could dip my finger into it and feel it's warmth or coldness, depending on what I decided.

			Were these sensations between your hand? Next time, try pushing your hands together. You might feel a resistance or your hands pushing on something.

			Hi. I'm new here, and practising with psi at the first time. I tried to make psiballs a few times, but I didn't feel anything. The psion handbook says that only a functional brain and a lot of practise are needed. But I found a web page which has a kind of &quot;psi capability test&quot;. So what's the truth? <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> Is it possible that I cannot make psiballs just because I'm not talented enough? <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> Or I just have to practise more?

			hi guys, once again im a newbie. i have been playing around with psi balls and i believe i created one within my two hands. i asked my sister to put her hand between them and she felt an almost painful electric shock running up her thumb as well as a small amount of pressure being exerted on her hands.
<br />

<br />
how is the best way to shell / flare it in this form, i have tried my best to shell it, and i have spent nearly an hour condensing energy into it. then as soon as i move it outside of my to hands the energy seems to dissapate. 
<br />

<br />
thanx everyone
