She has bulimia, used to be anorexic, but she thinks it's okay because she only resorts to it once, twice a week to 'fix the bad food choices she makes'. She calls bulimia 'Mia' and she says that it is her best friend, always being there when she needs her. She thinks of it as a fucking person! She says she makes her feel in control.

I even got led on, but I forgave her realizing she has a problem. She was.... forced to do something sexual by her grandfather about 5 years back, and it has screwed her up. I'm wondering if there are any aspects of psionics that could possibly help her, but I fear not. I'm looking at any possibility available before she gets out of control.

			This is a serious problem and it is definitely possible it comes from the traumatic experience she had. It doesn't change the fact that it is blatantly self destructive behavior. Go through with the intervention, but not only that. Tell her parents. This is a serious problem that can kill her. Don't leave it just to yourself to try and fix- she can get you out of her life, not her parents.

			Then it's time for child services, hate to say it, but this can kill her. She needs to come out about the assault and get out of that environment. I've had a friend die of anorexia, it's not something less serious. While yes, you should be professional to deal with it on a theraputic level, right now you need to work on getting the therapy and getting her out of the environment.

			We need to get her to the point to where she acknowledges the problem first, and then yeah, I think this may be the best course of action. We're gonna try an intervention with about... 10 people, give or take a couple.

			I'd be a dick and force that chemical that makes people vomit harshly. I don't know if it'd cure her, but it'll teach her a lesson...some how.
<br />

<br />
Either way, just confront her and tell her that she's stupid and needs help. use either blunt disposition or force...doesn't matter much to me. Really, why here? Why not talk to someone closer?

			You can TRY the intervention, but I garentee that she'll blow it off or just break down SO far you wouldn't know what to do, heh.  
<br />

<br />
But get her some help, come on, you shouldn't be dragging it on more than it has to.
<br />

<br />
Call some one, tell your parents, or a friends parents, or her grandma, or a hospital or the police even!
<br />

<br />
also, try not to ask for medical advice on psipog, I'm pretty sure it's agains the rules, I dont feel like checking.

			You know, I don't think your friend is lying about what is happening to her, but it almost sounds to me as though she milks it for all of the attention its worth.  It's very difficult for me to say because I'm not there.  And wanting attention isn't a bad thing, either.
<br />

<br />
It's a common problem like with dysthymia (a mental condition I have had experience with).  Basically, a person is depressed or miserable for whatever reason, but makes no effort to get out of that mental state because they enjoy the attention too much that they recieve from it.
<br />

<br />
I'm not saying don't do the intervention though.  Just be prepared that it won't be the fix-all to her problems.  Professional counselling is a must.  Also be prepared to realise that she won't be able to use the help given to her until she's ready to help herself.

<br />
I'm only saying this after a year and a half of psychology class, but that above statement sounds like she wants attention.  Most people with bulimia don't acknowledge it.  They don't talk about it, they don't tell anyone about it, and they certainly don't joke about it.  Some bulimic (sp) people may not even know that they have a problem.  Again, I'm not a professional, but that's what it sounds like.
<br />

<br />
Rahmid is right, you shouldn't ask for medical advice on psipog.  I'm entering med school, and even when I graduate I won't give medical advice over the internet (liability and all).  If someone has a serious problem (psychologically, physically, ect) psionics isn't the answer.  I doubt anyone here has enough experience to use psionics beneficially to fix these problems.  Also, psionics is very sensitive, and thought to be used via the nervous system.  Projecting that into someone who is already messed up WILL NOT HELP.
<br />

<br />
My suggestion:  Confront her.  Tell her she has a problem.  Get her to a psychologist/psychiatrist.  Or a MD.  Tell her parents, tell anyone who cares about her.  You need her to know she has a problem, and people need to know she has a problem.  Don't worry if she gets mad at you, or if you feel like you did something wrong.  Bulimia CAN lead to malnutrition, excessive underweight problems, erosion of the esophogas, corrosion of the teeth, and other serious problems.  Maybe even death from loss of weight and nutrition.  What's worse:  Your friend being mad at you for a week or two, or your friend getting seriously ill or dying?  When she starts to get better, she will thank you.  
<br />

<br />
But first do both of you a favor, and determine she has a problem.  Start noticing rapid weight loss, and if you can, discoloration of the teeth.  Paleness of the skin and claminess can also be a &quot;warning sign.&quot;  If any of that starts to happen, definantly get her to a doctor of some sort.  But you should also talk to her about it and see if she is for real, or get her to talk to her parents/guardians.  Get her to talk to a psychologist and get their opinion or advice.
<br />

<br />
With instances such as these, psionics shouldn't even be a consideration.  We just don't know enough about it yet to know if it is beneficial, or how to use it medically.  There is a rule about that ya'know, and it's there for a good reason. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Alright, psionics not an option.
<br />

<br />
Already have about 10 of her friends in on it, we're organizing a rather large intervention. Face to face coming to terms with the issues.
<br />

<br />
She has only told her closest friends, which is about 4 people. She has lots and lots of friends, and they had absolutely no idea. We're thinking that there will be close to 25 people at the face to face intervention.
<br />

<br />
She has passed out on occasion, up to one minute in duration. She is very pale, and has clammy skin.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for the input.
