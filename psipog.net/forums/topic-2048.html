			I remember reading a while back in the FAQ's of psipog.net that these were valid tests, so I decided to go for them a gain. Now I have quite an interesting experience with it IMO.
<br />

<br />
I was working with the bell curve one as the topic title suggests
<br />
(http://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/experiments/bellcurve/)
<br />
I was using the strategy I had used a while back to try and influnence the bit stream, by focusing on &quot;1&quot; as that was my intended hit. At first I was seeing some good results that I thought I would take screens on to possibly show here.
<br />

<br />
Fig 1: <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v320/XenoHunter/Bellcurve1.jpg" target="_blank">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v320/XenoHunter/Bellcurve1.jpg</a>
<br />

<br />
Well in order to show the screen I had to save it first, so I had opened up paint and had minimized the RPK window. As I was pasting it and preparing to save, I noticed a weird consistent pressure in my head, that seemed to envelop my brain. Out of pure curiosity I opened the RPK window back up and low and behold, my 1 hit rate had shot off the chart.
<br />

<br />
Fig 2: <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v320/XenoHunter/Bellcurve2.jpg" target="_blank">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v320/XenoHunter/Bellcurve2.jpg</a>
<br />

<br />
Im wondering if anyone else here has had similar experiences. Im going to  try to run a recorded test and see if I can get similar results so I can see the graph they give. Oh and I am sorry if this was not the correct place to post this <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
EDIT: After doing a recorded experiment(with average results) I found something out. 1 isnt left, 0 is. My guess is that my brain had focused on 1=left so I must have somehow influenced the 0 but stream while assuming with my concious mind that it was the &quot;1&quot; bit stream I had been getting succses in.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			I dont even know wether to truly consider that &quot;good&quot;, as I have never had other peoples results to compare it to. And I dont really consider myself that good in Micro PK either.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Ive also noticed I cant seem to train my mind to the 1=right, 0=left. I guess I could stick with what works and interperet 1 as left, but id rather do it right <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Oh well, I guess I have to build myself up to it.

			I am about to do this expirement a few times, but let me first say O_O...  I started looking at the first paragraph, kinda of understanding what to do.  I decided to try and influence the bell curve at the left first, and I was amazed at how well I seemed to be able to control it.  (I now see where you got the screenshots by the way) At first I thought that that wasn't randomly generated and was just a looping image.  I when I was about to quit and read more of what it said, it even scrolled to even more of the graph <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I just ran the demo experiment and I was still doing extremely well, I didnt let it go past the right side and after a while I was able to get it to start progressing even more to the left.  I stopped doing it so I could finish typing this message <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  This is the first time I've done, or even heard, of this experiment.
<br />

<br />

<br />
UPDATE:  I was just trying to make the same bell curve mentioned in the first paragraph.  I decided I was going to make it go to the right this time.  I was having a little bit more trouble, but I was doing it.  I didn't have it very far past the middle when I finished, but when I switched tabs on my window I had the same page open and it was in the middle of the next screen <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.  I kinda just gawked at it for a second and then closed it <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

			yeah.  I came across this when i was still really skeptical about PK.  So I started and it steadily going to the left.  I was not really impressed.  I thought &quot;well, it's probably jsut fixed to make you think you can do it.&quot; INSTANTLY it droped to the right, all the way to the right.  I was in shock!!  thats when i became a full fledged psion. lol  I like those things cause when your in dout they help boost confidence that it is real.  What is the link?? I lost it, and would like to try agian

			Its ok, we all have moments like that <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
But I can see how you missed it, due to the parentheses, it doesnt hyperlink it.
<br />

<br />
I like working with the bell curve, it gives the most direct feedback IMO
<br />

<br />
Edit: I took some pics with my camera, I got pretty far on the graph with the &quot;1&quot; bit's.

<br />
On the third pic, I almost got it to an even narrower line. Out of curiosity, whats the farthest all have you gotten? At least an approximation anyway.

			very nice <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Ill take pictures of my results later tonight when im more relaxed, I can't seem to do it very well right now <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />.  When I concentrate on it it goes haywire, I can't control which way it goes <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />, but when I don't conecentrate on it It stays pretty close to the center.  When I decided that I just couldn't do it at all, It went back to an even struggle between left and right &gt;_&lt;... So then once I realized that I could kind of control it it started working a little bit again <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.

			I couldn't get it at all the other night, my mind was'nt very relaxed, no matter how hard I tried.  I am getting some results tonight though.  I might actually post some screenshots tonight even <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  Sometimes it seems that it is a lot easier to make the bar go one way than the other.  Like, I'll try pushing the bar to the right and I'm getting little results, but then I try the other way and it goes half way across the screen.  Other times it doesn't matter which way I go.

			hey, I was trying the pendulum thing on there, after reading this, and then reading the feeding your sub-c happiness thread. So I was listening to music, and getting sorta hyped and then I told the pendulum to do wide swings then looked at my psi wheel and started trying to make it move as a distraction...all of the sudden it spins which i lost quickly, but then I glance at the pendulum. It was flying left and right off the screen...it was cool. My conclusion... music helps if you like it. maybe relax and such.

			Oh man. I had some sweet scores on that thing.
<br />

<br />
I loved the clock one, though.
<br />

<br />
That one was fun to manipulate.
<br />

<br />
Edit: Uh, dude? I think the real test's farther down on the page. The one at the top edge of the page is just a random thingy.

			They are both real -_- If you read my first post in this thread the first one I manuipulating was the bell curve at the top of the page, I thought it wasn't the actually thing, just a looping image, but I tried it anyway and it worked <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
