			I just started Micro-Kinesis and decided to start with Peebrain's technique of picking a card in a deck and trying to pull it out last.
<br />

<br />
I picked the Ace of Spades and it came in the last 10-5 cards four to five times in a row.  Once it was the second last.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I was blown away.
<br />

<br />
But now, a couple days later, I can't do it anymore.  Maybe it's because my excitement screwed with my sub-conscience.
<br />

<br />
Can someone hook me up with some exercises/techniques/suggestions to help me?
<br />

<br />
Anything will be appreciated.

			Just practice, you're probably just hitting a little block that you can get past.....btw, try using micro-psychokinesis or micro-pk to reduce confusion since microkinesis wouldn't make much sense. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			im using simple method but there is only one step that might take you little time to achive but i achive it fast because i trained alot , it is about tengiling sesation in the third eye so here it is from the first step:
<br />

<br />
first you need to clear your mind completely or as much as you can and put your will or attantion on your frist hern or ( third eye ) while clearing your mind from thoughts when you feel some kind of tengiling or like more blood flow in that place then you are doing it correct then increase that sensation untill you feel it little strong and good enought but dont increase it too much or it will take all of your attantion and then you will fail in the card practice so after you achive that , then that mean you else dont produce any emotion because you are not thinking so i want you have confidence and believe in yourself after that go to the cards look at them move your eyes slowly and see them and in your mind i want you to say the card that you need and its descrabtion i mean explain how it look like but in your mind not with voice then give little images of the card that you need and dont go hard on making that image only little efforts then again look at the cards slowly and try to pick up any emotion sense like sensing that card is the one that you want , pick up the first card you sense it that is right but you get confused like this one or the other then you will not get the right one and dont try to tell yourself while doing that and say this card is the right no just let it to your emotion in that part .
<br />

<br />
good luck and try it , sorry for my bad english <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. and dont forget to tell me your results .
