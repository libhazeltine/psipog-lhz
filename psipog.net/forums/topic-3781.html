			Many topics have been posted about said subject. I believe we have not dug deep enough into it though. When we think of the words useful and constructs, we instantly think of psi; collecting psi, banishing psi, asorbing psi, delivering psi...etc. I think if psi can do so many things, why not just pratical things. I was with my baby cousin today, and seeing her laugh and giggle made me happy. I, then, thought about a construct of happiness and funny pictures and giving it to her as a &quot;gift&quot; would be about the nicest thing ever. But, i also noticed that not one of you have posted about said construct or any like it ever, or since i have been here.
<br />

<br />
Not really a topic that needs to be posted on, not saying for you not to, but just a cool way to get things off your chest.
<br />

<br />
Also, this is still on the topic of constructs, so, yeah.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			a useful construct would be a construct planted on a person you want to watch over itll slowly start to gather energyand itll tell you when its ready to explode using energy measurement now the explosion couldbe anything emothions force bubble TP pinging and it can be used to quickly cuase ping chain reactions to send messages like power lines

			I sent my friend a hug... that was the first one I sent ever. He sent me one to cool me down... except it worked a little too well and I was freezing in 90 degree weather. I also sent him one because he was in a bad mood, andit cheered him up. We're not too experienced yet... we just started two days ago... but we're getting pretty good at it. But, yeah... I send those &quot;useful&quot; constructs. I tend to use energy to warm me up or cool me down since I have problems with body temp.
