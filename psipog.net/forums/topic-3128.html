			What Apollo means to say is &quot;are you sure you are not just picking up on the thoughts of others and mistaking it as you being a controller.&quot;
<br />

<br />
 I have faced this scenario, and thought i've used suggestion on people to make them have favor a particular thought and therefore say or do certain thing (though not with foreknowledge of exact wording or such beforehand), i've concluded that perhaps my ego thinks i'm using suggestion, and i'm actually just picking up on what they're about to do. Maybe suggestion isn't even possible and all the people that think it is are mistaking it for a form of precognition or telepathy. One's will is one's own. Ultimately, every thought process of an idvidual is theirs and theirs to conclude as to what to do with it. No other human can decide that.... Other forces, possibly, but not humans... Humans can only impose upon one another. My opinion.
<br />

<br />
 My opinion is also that my opinion is right.

			This occurence happens to me sometimes at school too, but I have another way of looking at it. 
<br />
Okay, obviously you are at school and the teacher asks a question and everyone tries to answer it. They go over answers in their minds and people will usually come up with similar answers and most likely dead-on answers especially in math class. So lets say the teacher asks: &quot;Now class, what is 2+2?&quot; Then everyone thinks &quot;4.&quot; Then someone answers it out loud and you say &quot;Oh my God! That kid just said what I thought!&quot;  But that wasn't the case, was it? Of course situations won't be as lame and as simple as that but you should get the idea. It also goes with making mistakes, once again math is a good example. Like in &quot;2+2X4.&quot; You might think the answer is 16 (which is wrong) and someone else might think the same wrong answer which makes it look like that person was controlled by your mind. I hope you understand what I am saying now.

Xious I understand what you are saying but Telepathic Suggestion isnt complete mind control, it is what it says... a suggestion. Therefore it's like me telling you, &quot;Hey go get a glass of water.&quot; Sure you heard me but it is still your free will to do whatever you want, as in responding to the comand or completely ignoring it. Otherwise I agree with you that no one can control your choices, even in hypnosis you still have complete control. (Ex. If someone asks a personal question while you are under hypnosis, if you would not normally answer, then you would not answer even if hypnotized.)

			well if you think you have a pretty good handle on it, you could test it. watch a move or something, and pick out a line you want them to say. then see if you can get them to say something similar. if you do, then it isn't a precognition most likely. an even better way would be to take a random person, and ask them to give you a line. then try it with that one.

			Spoden27, i am trying to disciourage people from using telepathic suggestion. I lied in my last post, and said what i do not believe. I have used suggestion. it exists, but it's not cool. 
<br />

<br />
Telepathic suggestion is a crude and probably most common used form of getting people to &quot;see things your way&quot; or to say or do little things. I've concluded it a waste of time, and morally improper, and therefore i do not practice or do it anymore at all, nor do i encourage others to. 
<br />

<br />
i say this because i should not have lied in my last post. i am the farthest thing from a liar by nature.

Oh I'm sorry I will refrain from future posts from discussing it. I did not know it was against the rules as it teaches you how to do it in the Telepathy section in the Psipog articles.
