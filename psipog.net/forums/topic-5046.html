			I know it was brought up before, but I finally found that Popular Mechanics article debunking all those conspiracy theorists about 9/11. Maddox also has a pretty good article on it to.

There's a whole lot more where that came from.  Do a search.  I'm afraid there really isn't any simple solution to the issue.

			Loose Change is a really crappy video for detailing the 9/11 conspiracy.
<br />

<br />
They get most of their facts wrong. (for example, flight 93 was NOT reported landing in another airport, that was actually a typo that was made by a news reporter)
<br />

<br />

<br />
I just read through the popular mechanics article, and I have to say that they took cheap shots and acted like they crumbled all conspiracy theories, when in fact they only stated the obvious and disproved some of the more absurd theories.
<br />

<br />
However, there are legitimate reasons to suspect a conspiracy on 9/11.
<br />

<br />
Look at, for example
<br />

<br />
-bush's location during (and after) the attacks, and his response (I saw the first plane hit the tower on the tv in the classroom)
<br />
(Several things wrong with this. Why was the tv on when the children were reading books to him? And, there was no video of the first plane striking during that time)
<br />
-bush stayed for a long time AFTER he knew america was under attack. (thus putting himself and all the children in the school in danger) Almost as if he knew he wasn't a target... 
<br />
-Flight 77's path. If I was trying to hijack a plane, and I knew the typical procedure for intercepting hijacked planes, I'd want to get it done as soon as possible, right? I wouldn't, then, wait for the plane to fly out to ohio, then hijack it and turn it around, fly 300 miles BACK, and finally hit the ONLY side of the pentagon that was actually built to withstand that kind of impact.
<br />
(Not to mention that the hijacker was inexperienced, yet managed to pull off an almost impossible task.)
<br />
-The paper passport... come on now... it slipped out of the hijacker's pocket, THROUGH the explosion that discintegrated the plane, and survived the collapse to be found hours later, and in good condition?
<br />
-The FBI themselves admit that they have no evidence to link Osama Bin Laden with 9/11.
<br />
-The hijacker's activities the night before 9/11. Look into this one yourselves. I'm too tired to type anything more right now... needless to say that there is a legitimate reason to believe that 9/11 was a conspiracy.

			I haven't watched the movie but correct me if i'm wrong.
<br />
I've watched one documentary where they said the whole thing was a setup. I'll summarize it: The plane wasn't even commercial, it was a military jet; the the jet launched a missle that caused an explosion just before it hit the tower, there were explosives already setup in the tower, the one that hit the pentagon wasn't even a plane, it was a scud missle.

Were you on the plane?  If not, I don't think you have the right to say what should or shouldn't have happened.

			Most, if not all these wonderful conspiracy theories do not answer this crutial question:
<br />

<br />
What did the US government have to gain from killing 3000 people for no reason? Anyone? Hello?
<br />

<br />
Also, if it was a government scheme, how did they manage to keep hundreds of government employees from talking?
<br />

<br />
I hated to bring this up again, but it just kept annoying me.

Control. The fear instilled in their citizens enabled them to whittle away our freedoms, without very few giving it a thought, as it was all done in the name of 'security'. Why question some things, if they are done to ensure our safety, something that seems needed at the time? If something like this had not happened, and they put forth the USA PATRIOT Act, do you think it would have been accepted as much as it was?
<br />
The government is just trying to increase the control over Americans. 
<br />

<br />
At least, this is what I've heard. :)
<br />

<br />
Edit: I've also heard other reasons, but this is one of the first that comes to mind.

Right now? Yes, it is, and people are angry, but when it was passed it had an extremely high approval rate, if I remember correctly. Some people even thought it wasn't enough. If the 9/11 attacks hadn't happened, and people weren't as worried about terrorism, do you think it would have been passed? What about if we had waited four years before proposing it?

			guys, the US government is not a conspiresy, not evil, not satanistic.  We have been a power of the world for a long time.  We did not attack ourselves.  Osama Bin Laden claimed responsibility and so we went after him.  Saddam threatened us, we told him to stop.  He said he has nuclear weapons, we sent the UN in.  They didnt find anything but <span style="font-weight: bold">chemical weapons capable of destroying 100 US cities</span>.  Oh, but thats not enough.  No.  We should give them a hug for being forceful and let them follow through with their attacks.  Bush was smarter than 49% of the country.  He stopped Saddam before he attacked.  Also, in case no one noticed, its a war against <span style="font-weight: bold">terrorism</span>.  Saddam killed about 5,000 people per week.  We took him out of office with force to help the iraqi people.  We cant just leave them without any government system so we help them set up the best form of government that we know of: democracy.  More people voted in the iraqi elections than people voted in the US elections since 1992.  That is a pretty big display that the iraqi people wanted a democracy.  Again, <span style="font-weight: bold">I am a republican and damn proud of it</span>.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, i agree with stony.  It pisses me off when 5 of my family members were killed in the 9/11 attack.  Get it through your minds that our government is not attacking itself.

			Even with Maddox's masterful explainations about &quot;Why the conspiracy is false&quot; I still don't buy that we know the full story of what happened that day.
<br />

<br />
Somethings don't add up... Such as the claim that the air plane that hit the Pentagon LIQUIFIED on its way through the wall:

<br />

<br />
And you can't logically believe that a paper document found its way out of the exploding plane in good condition.
<br />

<br />

<br />
---
<br />

<br />
I'm not saying that President Bush is behind a conspiracy if there is one. If there is a conspiracy, it's not out of the question that he had no idea about it.
