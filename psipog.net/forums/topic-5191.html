			Ok I hear a lot, and I have even ask it myself. &quot;I can't get total control over my psi-wheel&quot;.  Well it's like NI also known as Not_Important said.  You cant finish the first level meaning psi-wheel without going to the next level first(what ever it may be).  This is not a direct quote.
<br />

<br />
Here is my analogy:  Ok I have played a game called &quot;Pikmin&quot; for the Gamecube.  You start the game and do everything you can do on the first level right?.  But there are areas you cant go to yet so you move on to the second level.  You do some stuff and find and new thing.  You then realize that what you just found out helps you finish the first level that you started on.  I know video games are not the best for analogies but bear with me.
<br />

<br />
Now a real life thing:  Ok so you have been practicing the psi-wheel and you have gotten it to move but you don't yet have full control over what it is doing.  A lot of people will sit there and try to master before moving on(This post is not to say you can't master it before moving on).  So they spend a year or something on the psi-wheel.  Well I believe that if you move on and let's say you try moving a pencil.  You finally do it the practice trying to move a pencil has paid off.  You have learned a new way and form of controlling movement after moving the pencil.  Now with your new understanding of how this works you go to move the psi-wheel and apply what you learned from the pencil.  It may not come first try but it will come.
<br />

<br />
I hope this makes sense.  I am also not saying to move on to a pencil premature.
<br />

<br />
So if for any reason this post seems misleading let me know and I may remove it.
<br />

<br />
If you don’t get it PM me and I will try to explain more and this idea.
<br />

<br />
If there are spelling errors Sorry!
<br />

<br />
Thank You Kikaida

			Hmmmm....I'm in that position at the moment so I think I'll try moving a toothpick today!  Anyway, a better analogy would be weight-lifting; after lifting heavier objects, what you used to think was heavy isn't anymore.

BTW, Pikmin is one of the greatest games ever.  Nintendo pwns all!
