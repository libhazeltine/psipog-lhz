			Last night, I attempted my first OBE.  I was lying still, controlling my breathing, and relaxed.  I wasn't tired yet, though.  I didn't think that I was nearly close to having and OBE yet.  While lying there, after a few minutes, I began to feel a presence in my room - like there was somebody there with me.  It was wierd, and I kinda (really) freaked out.  It went away after I took out a flashlight and shined it around the room.  So, from that, I have a few questions.  
<br />

<br />
1.  My eyes were closed.  If there was another person in the room who was currently in an OBE, would I be able to just feel their presence?
<br />

<br />
2.  I've read that with Astral Projection, there is sometimes (usually?) a guide there waiting for you to project.  Is this the same case with and OBE?
<br />

<br />
Your feedback is much appreciated!
<br />

<br />
Edit:
<br />

<br />
3.  I just thought of this.  OBEs aren't subconcious, nor sleep.  While having an OBE, you're body isn't regenerating its energy, nor any other sleep activities.  So, while having an OBE, does your body continue to become more exhausted as time goes on?
<br />

<br />
4.  Also, if you do not regenerate energy while sleeping, is it possible for your body to fall asleep while in an OBE?  If so, then what would happen to your OBE?  Would it just end?  Or would your body just sleep as normal without you in it?
<br />

<br />
5.  In addition, (sorry for so many questions), if some stimuli were to hit your body strongly enough (like somebody pushing you to &quot;wake you up&quot;), what would you do?  Return instantly?

			Could be any number of things, ranging from your own imagination to another obe'er, and possibly other entities. Nothing to fear though... but fear itself.

			I wondered that first question too because my mom knows everything about dreams and I think she knows about OBE and she always lays down early and rests her eyes for hours, I walk in certain areas of my house and I get this real strong feeling of lightheadedness like I just walked through somthing, (now im afraid to return back to topic for the reply) I highly doubt you can feel nor seen anyone in obe.

			Actually, I'm pretty sure you can sense other obe'ers if you've got any amount of empathy or aura vision. (which everybody does).
<br />

<br />
It's just whether you ignore this &quot;intuition&quot; or not.

<br />

<br />
2) no there is no guide waiting for you, however there is a guide for every oober, you just have to will to meet him.
<br />

<br />
5) You just return to your body. And you just react however you'd react normally if some one shook you during a deep sleep.
