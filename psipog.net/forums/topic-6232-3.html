wow no. does anyone else sense a bit of fluff? what the hell do you know about having tremendous amounts of energy? what do you know about having psi/energy at all? 
<br />

Don't theorize about things that you know nothing about unless you plan on trying it yourself or using the scientific method to prove it right or wrong.

			probably nothing
<br />

<br />
anyway you would just need your energy twice so youd have twice your own energy, only half of twice your own energy would be transferred into psi to create a so called shadow clone. now these shadow clones seem to not be completely physical, maybe even hollow or something because they seem to dissipate after a punch or something so it wouldnt take that much energy
<br />

<br />
also wouldnt it just be easier to make a cardboard cut out type thing of yourself with psi? honestly just try that and it would be just as cool cuz you can make lil images of yourself and confuse ppl
<br />
ouch carpal tunnel is setting in on my wrist...damn you mortal kombat armegeddon....
<br />

<br />
and back to the whole ninjutsu thing.i studied ninjas and stuff for a while and they have alot more than what ppl thing to them
<br />
for one they dont actually have superhuman powers. they trick you into thinking they do. how they climb those trees by running up em? special spikes on theref feet(no not cleets these are pretty thick spikes) how they paralyze someone in 3 hits, just pressure points.
<br />

<br />
the jutsus they do theres over i think 130 maybe 300 idk i 4get its been awhile and they hand signals to channel chakra(psi) which was used to perhaps pyro or cryokinesis and other physcokinesis to aid them in escape to complete there mission(they were spys remember) like psi to there feet to quiet their steps(i can run quietly without psi or so i think)
<br />

<br />
so anyway theres my rant for today.. good night my wrist is hurtingand its 410 in the morning

We need a place like PsiPog was two years ago - somewhere for <span style="font-style: italic">intelligent, rational, non-fluffy-preteen</span> people to discuss psionics. PsiPog has become just like every other psi site out there, which is why I died a little inside.

I second that. This stuff is rediculous. Not <span style="font-style: italic">one</span> person here knows what the hell they're talking about. It hasn't been achieved, so everything being discussed is all theory. Get real you bunch of cartoons.

P.S Psikey, having <span style="font-style: italic">any kind </span>of &quot;special spikes&quot; on your feet are not going to allow you to climb trees. You were misinformed and just by the fact that you would believe something so idiotic I bet your not over 13-14 years old?

			no there called ashiko i have a pair. the spikes are for hands and feet the hands are ashukos(or maybe its the other way around) with alot of practice you can run up a tree faster than just normally climbing it because the spikes in them set into the tree and your suspended there. i myself suck at it and will get my foot caught and i bust my head into the ground.

but anyway they had more than that use(and im 14 ty)

Exactly what kind of cartoon?

Well I mostly agree with you, but I never really been in that long to know the difference from eariler times. I think a few people know what there talking about.

			lolo btu naruto iz soooo kewl i wana do a jsdalskdjas jutsu
<br />

<br />
And to Psikey, who tried to explain how to actually do this, I'd like to see you get twice your energy and be able to control all of it, no less make it into a person.
<br />

<br />
Besides, sure you can flare your energy, but making  it look like a person, I think, is rediculous.
<br />

<br />
Plus Psikey, I bet you get all of your super secret ninja info from Ashida Kim.
<br />

<br />
edit: Also, running silently isn't hard when you practice. There's certainly no need for psi. How would you even do that, anyways? Channeling psi into your feet to make them silent sounds like something, again, from naruto. Ninjas, even if they DO believe in psi, have no need for that.
