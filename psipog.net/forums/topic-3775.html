			i practiced with the psi wheel today and did great i even controlled it very well.  so I decided to move on to a tooth pick but it didn't even budge and i've been trying to move it for several days now.  i thought if i was doing great with the wheel i might get good results with the toothpick but i still have none. any suggestions?  oh and btw i tried the wheel after the tooth pick and i couldn't get it to move again. so i dont know whats going on.

			Don't even expect to get results in a couple of days with a toothpick. These things can take months before you see results. Patience is a good thing to have.

			Yea it would be harder to move a toothpick. Just keep practicing, honestly your lucky, I can't move my psi wheel yet <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> it just wobbles a bit.

			Just keep trying and don't let what any body says about how hard it is, fuck them if they do. I never spinned my pin-wheel and I can slide varity of objects.

			Toothpicks have a smaller zone for pushing or pulling them. If an object is small, it can seem hard to move it because you have to focus all your concentration and energy into a very small spot. Whereas with bigger objects, there is a bigger spot to focus on, which may make it easier. Try sliding a small wrapper. They are very light and easy to slide, but be very careful of static; not recommended for use of hands.

			See i can roll a can, yet the toothpick is hard for me. I believe that the smaller area does affect it.
