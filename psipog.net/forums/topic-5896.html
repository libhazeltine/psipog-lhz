			Hi,
<br />

<br />
         When you go into a trance, what is supposed to happen to you? I mean, what do you feel? Why do u go in a trance? And, how can you be sure that you won't fall asleep? Sometimes When I meditate, I usually fall asleep. I don't know why, maybe I get bored or something. But won't I go to sleep if I try to go in a trance?

			That cannot be guaranteed.

Most minds are not used to meditation, therefore often they fall asleep when they lower their amount of brainwaves per second. What you need to do, is retain consicous focus when relaxing as in meditation. When you get into a trance, it is no different, you might fall asleep just as happened to you in meditation. Meditation needs practice also. It is not something that comes once you relax. Real meditation requires practice. But just some relaxing kind of meditation, does not require alot of practice, though you should learn to retain your consciousness while lowering the brains activity.

			Thanks for you reply.
<br />
It's hard for me to stop all the traffic in my mind and just focus on one thing. I know I need practice to clear that stage, but what do you think about when you are meditating?

			It is very very difficult to be able to hold just one single impression in the mind. First you start to practice concentration for a long time. Concentration mean that you are trying to keep the mind focussed at a certain object and its aspects. For example, you start to contemplate (focussed thinking) on a tree. You contemplate about its aspects: its branches, its roots, how it sucks water from its roots and transports it to its leafes etc. You keep the mind focuseed at the tree and its aspects. Then after awhile when you get good at it, you restrict the mind even more, by concentrating it not on one object or one idea, but on one single impression only. This is very hard to imagine if it is not yet experienced consciously. But it means that you dont think about the tree his branches, roots and leafs. You do not think about the tree as a whole. You do not think at all. Instead, you hold only one impression in the mind. Nothing else. Examples of just one impression: One image of the tree, one idea about the tree, one sound wave, one leaf. You do not think about the different aspects of this image of the tree, or the idea of the tree, or the leaf, but you hold just that one single impression right there. 
<br />

<br />
When this is well established, you have become fully one-pointed in focus. You can then transfer all the energy, all the attention, to one single thing alone. This generates alot of power.
<br />

<br />
The best way to start clearing the mind, is by taking on the role of observer. Sit back and relax as the side-show of your thoughts and mental impressions slide by. Dont get involved in them, dont let them drag you along with whatever they are doing or wherever they are going; Just observe them, accept them, and let them pass. try to retain this position of observing. In the beginning you will notice that the thought or mental impression dragged you along. At the time you notice that, return to the position of the observer and let them goo, let all thoughts just slide by as if they are pictures coming in and out of the mind.
<br />

<br />
Then eventually the amount of thoughts will lower and eventually, you might be able to just BE the observer without any mental impression whatsoever.
