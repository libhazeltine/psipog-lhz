			I just saw X-Men.
<br />
It was the most awesome movie. Lots of PK going on. mental blocks and such, I loved it.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, I was wondering. Do you think with the most extreme practice and inspiration; which I must say right now I have alot of. Do you think it is possible to reach a PK skill that of Jean Grey's?
<br />

<br />
I mean maybe not so much as this movie... Cause I've never heard of such power as she had in this movie.
<br />
Lets put it this way, not even magneto could imagine taking her on.
<br />

<br />
But does anyone think it's possible?

Yes it is possible. It all takes <span style="font-style: italic">time and practice</span>.

Start with the psi wheel and work up from there.

			It's funny, now that I think about it, pretty much all the &quot;mutants&quot; of X-men are really just psions. However, I don't really remember them all that well, as I never really watch it, so ignore name mistakes. Storm was an Aerokinetic, Wolverine a biokinetic, Cyclops... Sort of like psiballs, but more interesting. There was that one guy who made stuff out of ice, so a cryokinetic. Then there was a guy, I think named Gambit, who through cards that exploded, so that'd be a pyrokinetic.

So you saw the movie? I thought her display of powerwas amazing, anything near his disenigrated. Even though it was fake... I still found it amazing. and magneto still has his power... oh im drifting from teh topic.
<br />

<br />
I think with enough dedication, we can achieve the experience we see with jean grey.

			first i have to say that i just saw the movie (4 hours ago, to be precise) and i think it friggin rocked!   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
second, yeah, i'm sure her abillities could possibly be attainable, but there's one tiny problem...time.  that would take a lot of time to achieve.  even if you practiced 5 hours a day, i'm sure it would still take at least three times as long as a lifetime.  with enough time, practice, dedication, and discipline i'm sure anything is possible.  but we are limited in one of those aspects, guess which one  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Oh I saw that movie about 8 hours ago (Its 4 am now)
<br />

<br />
I was completely pleased and appaled at Jean's telekinesis.
<br />

<br />
And I'll tell you this, the movie was my ULTIMATE INSPIRATION!
<br />

<br />
After seeing people levitate things, move them, slide them...I'm defintly going to keep training and developing my Psychokinesis.
<br />

<br />
The most realistic part was at the end when Mageneto shook the Chess Peice, that's what most of us here can do.  But one day, mabe we'll be levitating guns and moving water as well.
<br />

<br />
Only time will tell, I can't WAIT for the future! *Goes to practice..well sleep comes first <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />*

			No I don't think so, you shouldn't take X-Men as a reference it's just (bad) science fiction.

I know with enough training you could and whatnot but let's state the obvious - nobody will ever reach that level.
