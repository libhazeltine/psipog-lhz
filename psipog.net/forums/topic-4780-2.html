			My friends and i have been working on this. Once, i was able to mentally &quot;shout&quot; my friend's name in a crowded area, and she heard me clearly. we tried a couple times after that, but we couldnt really hear anything. 
<br />

<br />
What did work was screaming really loudly in our heads, we were able to hear that pretty easily.
<br />

<br />
Another friend of mine sings songs in her head during class, and the people around her end up humming the tune aloud.

			Hey, I just had a wierd feeling just now.
<br />
I thought as I read the post, &quot;oh, best check whether anyone has wrote anything about the post I put.&quot; I just came on this forum and there's nothing here???  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, back on the subject... I've &quot;heard&quot; as in literally heard people's voices in their heads while they're not talking just thinking and it's happened 3 times. It's happened to me at a friend's party, in town and when my mum asked me to wash my hair with the shampoo that she never uses (even though she never said it, but thought about saying it before she was going to actually say it). I think we all hear or know things in different ways whilst using telepathy. The only reason I hear it is because it's probably when I first watched x men...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" /> That's how I thought telepathy would be like.. And telekinesis... and phasing...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
X men was probably the reason why I wanted to learn telepathy and telekinesis. Phasing just... happened.

I'm starting to get that ringing too! It's just that I want it, and get it sometimes, and you dont want it, and you get it all the time. Ahh, if only we could trade. it's more on the top part of my head above my ears and in my ears too. Only get spurts of it though.

No worries. Nothing that hours upon hours  of rediculously long meditatoin sessions in one day can't fix.

Another friend of mine sings songs in her head during class, and the people around her end up humming the tune aloud.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">  Heh. I went to orientation or whatever for my high school last night and we had to sit in the auditorium and listen to the principal and the councelors and people speak. It was really boring, just sitting there for an hour. But anyway, the junior/senior councelor stood there and talked for... like.... 35 minutes. And she was just talking about oppurtunities for juniors and seniors to get college credit. And there was only about 3 or 4 juniors and seniors there! So I just started singing that song that goes, &quot;I know a song that gets on everybody's nerves...&quot; in my head. And then my mom started tapping her chair in rythmn! And so I linked to the stupid counselor and started singing it REALLY loud and she started saying &quot;um&quot; and &quot;er&quot; and saying stuff over twice and stuff, like she was distracted.
<br />
         
<br />

<br />

<br />
         Plus, when that counselor got up to speak, I suddenly felt feelings of recognition, a little anger, and maybe something like dread. I also got the impression of the words, &quot;oh, no&quot; and I thought of my elementary school, liked she belonged there. And then, a second later, my mom said, &quot;Oh, no, don't you remember her from elementary school?&quot;. Later I asked her about the counselor and what she did in elementary school. She just said that one time she told the counseleor if she would talk with me and she never did. It just pissed my mom off.
<br />

<br />
Of course, I've been getting impressions of what people are thinking quite accurately and constantly for the last month or so. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			It happened to me once that i remember, was really like  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
i was in my bedroom, and my sister was in hers. our bedrooms are &quot;neighbours&quot;. anyway, i was in my bed, and my mom or dad said something to my sister, like scolding her for something wrong. not very bad, just usual stuff.
<br />
when i heard that, i tought of saying something like: take that! (as all brothers and sisters do to each other. one gets scolded, the other laughs  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> )
<br />
i was almost saying it then i thought: no, this time ill be silent, won't tease her.
<br />
BUT what happened: i was almost saying, the words were in my throat, THEN  i tought that, and i felt a weird stuff, and like the words had been stopped on the mouth, but the thought was still &quot;running&quot;. i felt a strong stuff while still thinking the frase (the time between thinking of not saying anything and actually doing it was very fast), as it would be &quot;natural&quot; to me to tease her, you know, that stuff that is within you alredy  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> . ok, i didn't say anything, and all. but then my sister talked to me about what i've just thought, in a somehow &quot;happy&quot; tone. then i said: what? did you say ___ ___ ___ (the words i tought). 
<br />
she said: yeah, ___ ___ ___
<br />
then me: but i said nothing!!
<br />
you really heard that?
<br />
yeah i did, i heard like you were shouting from you bedroom, normal voice.
<br />
but i didn't say anything!! i just thought!! ewww, you heard my thought, and i made it loud!! how nice
<br />
then i told her about deciding not to tease her that time, and stuff.
<br />
but was real nice!!

			ya with me i can hear their thoughts but i dont know what they're saying. its just them talking mumbo jumbo. kinda weird, but through how they're saying it I can sometimes tell how they're feeling or what they're doing. So if I don't hear them it's because they're either verbally talking or sometimes asleep.
<br />
This has been something i've been playing around with.
