			OK guys, I have a pretty simple technique for healling.  I can't really say how effective it will be for you, but I know it makes (and has made) any type of head related pain that I have ever had go away, and fast at that.  
<br />

<br />
Gather psi by whatever method you normally do, and pool it somewhere.  Direct it towards your head, and concentrate on it flowing throughout your head.  When I have done this it uses the energy I've gathered fast, so at this point gather some more psi and repeat the above steps until your headache (or etc. is gone).  
<br />

<br />
Keep in mind this is only my technique, but I know it works extremely well for me personally.  I've had plenty of headaches and a couple of minor concussions (high school football....) that I've gotten rid of using this technique.  Remember though, any kind of head injury should be dealt with by a professional doctor, not left to be handled by the injured person.

			That's a good technique! I sort of use the opposite of it. XP I get frequent headaches, and I find it works well. Wherever it is that the headache is worst (usually temples for me) I move my hands there, and put my fingers on the place. Then (without using pressure, just barely touching) I move my fingers in a circular motion, and imagine that the headache is pooling there, and winding itself in strings around my fingers. Then I gather up whatever strings I have, transfer it to a tissue (I think tissues are best because people won't accidentaly pick up on that bad energy. I guess you could try to make it good energy, or disperse it into the air, this is just my technique) then I throw the tissue away. I usually do that a couple times, and I find my headache is pretty much all gone, and whatever is left of it usually goes away rather fast. ^_~

			I tried a healing technique a couple of days ago when someone gave me a really really bad dead arm that got my actual bone (as i later realised). I imagined my shoulder (where he hit me) was on fire and glowing and pooling psi, then it was gone after bout 30 seconds. I only realised it painful again the next day. The only thing with this, and i'm not sure this is related to it or not but, it gave me the biggest migrane later on after i had done it. I had to lay down for hours to make it go away. I eventually went to sleep and woke up to find it fading away a bit.
<br />
question: Is it normal for that to happen when you try and heal like that?
<br />

<br />
Also i had pain in my head beforehand on that day a tiny bit and tried healing it with the fire technique and was wondering whether that could have done the opposite of numbing it.

			To psi_manipulator_3000, instead of fire try visualizing soothing rays of sunlight and heal yourself with the energy around you. Or, you prefer to use your own energy, just imagine a more soothing element or color, for me i like to use a deep blue like the ocean. Just don't use fire, well for one reason, fire is a destroyer, so it might have been why your headache got worse. Hope this helps!

			Well.. whatever works. I use a psi ball with a + sign on it, and send it into my head.

			Okkie doke. thnx. deep blue it is, or white or something. btw, i only visulised fire becuase thats the element thats the most effective at gathering psi around my body. I use it for making psi balls by makng my hand on fire and then i feel tingling like crazy. I figured that to numb pain you had to gather as much energy as possible. Thats why i used the fire. But I'll try the blue or something instead. Plus theres always the chance of it being a coincidence.
