			Ultimately my question is directly correlated to me; not only am I a pisces, which if you know anything about astrology it depicts pisces as partially lazy and uninhibited, but it also states that we are scattered and drawn out, mentally. Now, I'm not entirely sure about my diagnosis, but I AM on adderal for a.d.d. and all i want to know is how would adderal affect my ability to achieve altered states of mind via meditation, trance, obe, whatever? Also, how hard would it be for me to enter a state of deep meditation whilst taking adderal during weekdays <img src="images/smiles/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" border="0" />

I would think it depends on the individual.

My advice is to try it out yourself, experiment a little and find out what your limits are.

There is a possible chance that your adderal could have a positive influence on your practices. For example if you were meditating it may help you focus better and allow you to achieve potentially higher results than you would without it.

I don't know about drugs, but I think nutrients that are good for your brain would help (like those found in sea food). For example, when at home, I eat no sea food, and my skills suffer. When I get back to college, I eat shrimp every night for dinner, and I never seem to run out of psi.

			my apologies peebrain. i fixed it xD
<br />

<br />
at any rate, tonight while i was dreaming that i was smoking marijuana and continuing my self diagnosed methadone addiction treatment i had what i believe was a crazy subconscious connect. at any rate, i made a little journal entry, and to be honest its the first real one i've done ever. nothing's ever seemed worthy enough about myself to put into words about me. i mean, i don't research anything or do any real mental work. i just feel like you should know that lol. here it is judge it however you want:
<br />

<br />
I just had an electrifying connectino with my subconscious. It was amazing, I saw green visuals, i almost saw an oscillograph vibrating in a transvere wave pattern; it was eminating a green glow. It was a dark green, almost emarald inspiring at times. My mind was vibrating and I leaned my head back against the chair and an intense weight was placed upon my head, as if I was being pulled into the chair. I felt one with myself in a way I've never felt before.  Also to be noted though, I had a serious erection at times and I'm under the influence of some banger ganja. And yes I know weed can cause some serious visuals under the right extenuating circumstances... like being under the influence of methadone for the past 3 nights and having done a few hits today to stabilize my withdrawal effects. But, also to be noted, is that my friend kyle just instant messaged me at 12:27 and in light of this journal entry and expressing the fact that my connection with my subconscious was actually interacting with my concsiousness. This is some weird ass shit. Good night.
<br />

<br />
time: 1:34. good night.

			I use Concerta for ADHD, and I think it both helps and hurts my psionics. While I am better at focusing, when I don't take it my subconcious tends to be more active. However, that isn't necessarily a good thing. Last night, I had gone 3 days in a row with out taking it, and I gave a girl a nosebleed when I connected with her. I think I made it a little too strong (Feelings for her, using her planet (the Sun, even though it's technically a star), and thinking only about her, on both a concious and subconcious level.
<br />

<br />
As for meditation, it should help, as long as you have been diagnosed correctly. You see, most ADD/ADHD medicines act as stimulants if the person doesn't actually have ADHD or ADD. They will act as a depressant if you do have it, and that should help meditation.
<br />

<br />
I agree with what Stony said. Half the kids in my school have probably been told they have ADHD, when in reality they're just hyper (and the corruptive aspects of today's society probably plays a part too).

			word, i agree with you on the over-diagnosis of a.d.d. and as it wears off as i go through the day i do get more relaxed. and all i really want to do is meditate. the thing about it though is that i also enjoy marijuana *fictitiously.
<br />
That hypothetically causes problems in my head and all that. but umm... yea, i can't think of anything else atm, i just woke up. i'll be ack tomorrow night or something, WHO KNOWS IN THE WORLD OF PSIONICS!

			I do smoke the stuff that we're not supposed to mention. I've not actually tried doing psi whilst under the effects, but i would imagine it makes it harder.  I always find it lowers my ability to concentrate on something, so for something like this which requires a lot of concentration i don't think it would be a useful asset. 
<br />

<br />
To any people out there who are thinking of trying it for the first time i don't reccomend it. Although it is possible for it to bring friends together and be a fun experience it can also push friends apart, and cause people to waste all their money on it (too much of a gamble, friends are more important than anything).
<br />

<br />
 Another thing that i personally see as the biggest problem is the side effect of most people becoming addicted to tobbaco. I was a tobbaco smoker for about 6 months, but i recently gave up (havn't had a ciggy in about 12 days:D) Most of my closest friends have become smokers now though, and i fear by the time they decide to give up it'll be too late- they'll be too hooked.

			Man, I commend you for that post Twig. And yeah, as far as any type of drug goes, I've never partaken. Sometimes I think it might have been a good idea for me to be checked out as a kid though. I was REALLY hyper and had a huge lack of friends because of it. I chilled out once I hit Middle School (Junior now) but I still have trouble concentrating on most things. I think that the doctors diagnose all the wrong people and none of the right ones (in this instance anyway).

			you're exactly right kais. it took me fucking FOREVER to get a 'script to adderal. sometimes though, i really feel torn between the psyche and the psychoactives. i don't know if i want a life of drugs or a life of chi. gah, i'm so  fucking tired. i think i just might go to sleep... wouldn't be a good idea though, odds of me falling asleep tonight would decrease significantly because of it. gah, fuckin' a... at any rate, welp, fuck there it goes... i had a question, but nevermind. Heh, oh yeah. i remember now, would masturbation, well after having beat off, increase my ability to concentrate and ultimately improve any results i may get?

			Seeing as how I have been diagnosed with ADHD and I take Adderal XR (which is adderal extended release) I believe I have some word of authority in this. I have been taking this medication for 9 years. I would have to say that yes, it does have an accute affect on psionics. For example, you are entirely focused, and it trails off towards the end of the day. When you are most focused, you should tend to have problems using psi as it seems to hinder all creative parts of your brain and leaves you with enhanced literal senses making it the equivalent of trying to make a sculpture from observation when you are nearsighted (making it hard to see past a foot or so) and your entire upper body is so numb you can't feel anything. It would be good to try and do psionics at about... 30 minutes after taking the pill to... an hour, probably less than an hour, just as the pill takes effect. Also, this pill mixed with alcohol does something to you, so its best not to try it, but for me, <span style="font-weight: bold">AND ONLY ME</span>, it gives me the effect of being completely aware of everyhting around me, <span style="font-weight: bold">DO NOT TRY IT UNLESS A DOCTOR TELLS YOU OTHERWISE!!!!</span>[/b]

			pricemac, your word of authority should be completely disregarded. other than your own personal experiences, for which we cannot dispute against, you really don't know what you're talking about. no doctor would EVER tell you to mix alcohol and amphetamines. not only because alcohol is a depressant (which SLOWS your heart rate...) and adderal is an amphetamine (which increases your bpm) it can be adequately analogized with trying to drive a car forward in reverse, but because they don't EVER tell you to mix ANY drugs together (and yes, you ignorant twit; alcohol <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> a drug). Also, i think it'd be best for you to stop taking your adderal so religously, as you probably know nothing of the negative long-term side effects. and 9 years is an awfully long time, shit, you could probably be a good comparison to see what long-term daily adderal can do to the body AND the brain. At any rate, you know nothing about pharmaceuticals and you shouldn't ever give medical advice. 
<br />

<br />
And as a matter of fact, i've found adderal to increase my visual creativity. I've drawn some pretty intricate things on my folders at school, and on some index cards, random sheets of paper... etc. my creativity tends to go through the roof on adderal; not only visual, but literary creativity also spikes. I wrote a 10 page report on the &quot;dark side of man&quot;. i had a 3 page synopsis of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein.
<br />

<br />
Back on track though, i tried to meditate when i got home today. My room was pitch black and the only thing i could hear was the rotating of the washing machine. Also, my back was hurting, and it still hurts now. I think i'll try whilst laying down. don't know how it could effect anything adversely. Anyways, i've gotta get back to &quot;studying&quot;...
