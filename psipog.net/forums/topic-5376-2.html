			Theorist: Tai Chi has very little to do with breathing techniques of any kind.  No more than any other martial art certainly.  Now, if you were to say Yoga I'd give you some credibility - Mana (from the earth) and Prana (from the air) are two kinds of energy that are talked about in the system of Yoga.  But even still, if you know anything about it, you will see that it doesn't really apply.

			OK. People please do not hold me in contempt for my grammar.
<br />

<br />
What is wanted to say that it's not important how you call it. Chi, Youga or something else. Point is that it helped me to concentrate. The point is in breathing and calming your mind, which gives you focus, and clear mind to do what you intended. And as I said before:&quot; It can't hurt you if you try.&quot; Well although there's a legal disclaimer in the pdf-s, but if you stick with the guidelines it works fine.

			Firstly, yes, I do practice Tai Chi.  I have been for the past 3-ish years.  Secondly, no I don't speak chinese and I'm not chinese, and from what I've heard the proper translation for Chi is 'Power' making Tai Chi 'The Powerful Fist'.  Thirdly, if YOU have ever practiced Tai Chi then you will know that it has nothing to do with drawing energy from the air at all.  Nowhere in the basic to advanced practices is there even a hint of that kind of function.
<br />

<br />
Thirdly, I'm not saying there's no energy in the air.  Most certainly there is energy in the air.  The system of Yoga uses that fact as a foundation for many of its practices.  What I'm saying is that the method mentioned in the first post is not a way of harnessing that energy.
<br />
Fourthly, nobody mentioned Feng Shui.  But from what I heard it translates to 'Wind and Water', which are the two elemental energy types that Feng Shui deals with.  Also from what I read the Wind and Water dealt with are not necessarily physical wind and water, but spiritual wind and water that don't necessarily follow along the same paths as their physical mirrors, but very often do.
<br />

<br />
Fifthly and finally, don't take things so personally.  Everybody makes mistakes once in a while, it's a very human thing to do.  Remember that admitting you were mistaken takes a bigger man than proving you were right.

Who is the world was your master.....you'd better sue him....you are getting ALL the WRONG info........chi = &#27668; = gas/air.....punk.....
<br />

<br />
Feng in feng shui = wind = dragon's breath = chi
<br />

<br />
goddamn it.....u are saying that tai chi has got nothing to do with breathing techs??? Tai chi roughly means Enormous Gas........so go sue your retard of a master.......... seesh! you want personal lessons from me?

PS: direct the 5th part to your master......ask him to DIE

			In order to give you the benefit of the doubt I looked up the two words on Wikipedia:
<br />

<br />
from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui</a>
<br />

<br />
'Feng shui (pronounced &quot;fung shway&quot;) is the ancient Chinese practice of placement and arrangement of space to achieve harmony with the environment. The literal translation is &quot;wind and water&quot;'
<br />

<br />
from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi</a>
<br />

<br />
'Tai Chi Chuan, T'ai Chi Ch'üan or Taijiquan (Traditional Chinese: &#22826;&#26997;&#25331;; Simplified Chinese: &#22826;&#26497;&#25331;; pinyin: Tàijíquán; literally &quot;supreme ultimate fist&quot;)'  -- It seems I was mistaken here, I appologize.  'Tai Chi' means 'Supreme Ultimate'.  The full name, 'Tai Chi Chuan' means 'Supreme Ultimate Fist'.
<br />

<br />
If you don't think the source is accurate then please point me to a superior source where I can get the right information.
<br />

<br />
And for the record, I never said Tai Chi has 'nothing to do with breathing techniques'.  I said, in my first post, &quot;Tai Chi has very little to do with breathing techniques of any kind. No more than any other martial art certainly.&quot; and in my second &quot;[Tai Chi] has nothing to do with drawing energy from the air at all&quot;.  Tai Chi most certainly has breathing techniques within it - it is just not for the purpose of drawing in or expelling energy.  This isn't a lesson on Tai Chi so I won't elaborate here, but if anyone would like to know the purpose of breathing in Tai Chi (which is the same as in a few other martial arts I know of) then feel free to send me a private message.

			sorry I'm new here.
<br />
taichi does consist the drawing of energy, the yins and the yangs.. simply say positive or negative, heaven or earth. 
<br />
Read through certain threads here, saying drawing power from heaven or earth.. so basically it is the same.. I'm sorry if i am rude..
<br />

<br />
Ok, I might be in the wrong topic here. But I hope you don't mind.
<br />

<br />
I'm new here, and kinda curious about these.. psi stuffs. you guys are having here.
<br />
basically since young I've notice a slight difference in me from others. Though I hid it well, to prevent discrimination. I guess we all do don't we.
<br />

<br />
So I came upon this website, and this truly interests me. Something I've been avoiding and hiding for so many years, is infact being practice.
<br />

<br />
OK.. urm.. basically from where I come from, I don't really see much of a &quot;psi&quot; thing going on.. or basically none. So I'm glad to be actually here. and kind of sad too. 
<br />
Since I've read that this I dunno, isit the forum? or the website? which is going to be shut down?
<br />

<br />
Anyway nice meeting =) hope I learn abit more, in this final moments.

			urm... I never knew much about psiball...
<br />
Only learnt it when I came upon this.
<br />

<br />
Basically I always thought bringing energy beyond the body, is impossible.
<br />
I'm more to the psi (glove) kind of learning.
<br />

<br />
cause, I'm more to the healing, and punching. Where the concentration of energy is placed on the hands.

			Ah..here you have names for mostly everything..
<br />
but I've been hidden, or hidding.. 
<br />

<br />
So most of it.. are just nameless..
<br />

<br />
psion a psi user?
<br />

<br />
metaphysical arts?
<br />

<br />
psionics?
<br />

<br />
psychokinetics?
<br />

<br />
some do seem familiar, so basically you guys try to connect psi with science? seeing most of the words, or all of it.. has scientific link to it..
