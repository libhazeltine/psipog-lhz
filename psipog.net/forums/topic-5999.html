			Ebay it. It's apparently jewelery that has been charged with psi and can have certain effects on it's bearer. Good luck, wealth, love, health and even just energy. I would say it's bs at first, but I looked at the feedback and it was all positive. People saying things like &quot;I felt warm when I put it on&quot; and &quot;My mother is feeling better now&quot; and such. It is quite intriguing.

			actually, there are certain types of crystal that can be charged with reiki energy. and, most of the time, the vendors don't even know they have it. just passyour hand over a stall, and there may be one or two things that stand out. i got a ring for $2 and it's helped me a lot. for one thing, i have more energy when i wear it.

purely psychosomatic. i don't buy into that whole 'reiki' stuff. you have more 'energy' only because of the belief that the ring gives you more energy.
<br />
i think it's a load of bull.

			it's purely a personal standpoint. maybe the belief that it gives more energy is what makes it so. i think it does, cause it gives off an aura. (not the visible kind) but, believe what you want.

			Okay, now time for someone who can speak from honest experience!
<br />

<br />
I've been making and selling jewellery for a few years now. And every piece I make I imbue with general good-will energy, health, wealth, the whole nine yards.
<br />

<br />
Nobody's ever said anything, and I never tell people that I've done it, it's just my extra little... addition to the piece.
<br />

<br />
So, to answer the question, yeah. I know of such items. 
<br />
But I can also say that I personally would not trust those who advertise their jewelery as being psychically enhanced-- That just sets off the bullshit meter, if only as far as intent is concerned.
<br />

<br />
So... I guess my best suggestion is to go somewhere and select the piece that appeals to you. You'll know when you fall in love with a particular piece of jewelery, right? And I've always found that those particular pieces have been more helpful than anything else.
<br />

<br />
Don't go with stuff online. But beyond that, I'll shut up before I start waxing spiritual.

			my piece shone out to me at the canadian ex in toronto. i was passing a ring shop, and one particular one was giving off a lot of heat. upon closer inspection, it was cold to the touch, yet still giving this aura. i bought it (for 2 bucks no less) and have been using it for the longest time now. it still has the aura.
<br />

<br />
also, it's 3 diffrent types of crystal. that may have something to do with it.

			I'm:
<br />

<br />
a) Sure this kind of thing is entirely possible, I don't see any reason it wouldn't work, and I've heard of a lot of people doing it with positive results. There are also many magical systems (namely Ceremonial Magic and the like) which charge tools with energy, so I don't see why it would work any differently here.
<br />

<br />
b) Also sure that anything purchased on ebay is almost certainly someone just trying to make easy $$$, if you don't wanna do it yourself, at least get it off someone you know and trust.
