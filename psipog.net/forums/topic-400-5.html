			Yeah ok. PsiVamps are real, I've encountered a couple. They can be skilled with their psionic abilities too, as a result of draining people's energy. Hell, two of my good friends are psivamps, and they are even fully aware of it... That is to say, they ARE aware of it, and i've talked to them about it, but they are <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> fully aware of the <span style="font-style: italic">how</span> of it... Heck, neither am I. Someday, when i'm able (or rather, when they are), I'll teach them how to procure as much energy as they need from within themselves.
<br />

<br />
See, cause that's the thing about psychic vampires. They, normally, are weak. Pathetic. They NEED peoples energy. Not to live, really, but to be strong, and become positive in their moods and feelings, and physical abilities.
<br />

<br />
My thing is, there is basically no limit to my energy levels. I'm an &quot;all you can eat bouffet&quot; (spelling?). I don't need energy from other people, I GIVE energy to other people, of my own will. I make people feel better about themselves without any words of encouragement. I help sick people get better just by being around them. I even give negative people positive energy, in an effort to sustain them, just for the hell of it... well, as long as they're my friends.
<br />

<br />
See, when I meet a person who is a &quot;psychic vampire&quot;, they usually aren't aware that's what they are, and they aren't aware of the energy drain and exchange that goes on between people when they interact. They more or less unconciously drain people's energy by creating negative situations, or treating them in a negative fashion. All it takes is a small, even subtle, negative remark from a psivamp, to bring a person's gaurd down, and for the vamp to start &quot;feeling it&quot; or whatever.
<br />

<br />
When a stranger who is such a person enters the interraction zone of my friends and myself, they usually end up not liking me. They can never put their finger on it, exactly, but there's something about me they really are uncomfortable with, or dislike, or even hate. I'm keeping them from getting what they unconsciously want. Most of the time im only semi-conscious of this fact, not in complete control, and it's fine because after the initial bit, my friends jump into the defensive themselves.
<br />

<br />
Not to say im impervious to psychic vampirism. I'm not. I've been drained quite a bit in the past, even the recent past. But because I know how, I recover very quickly. I open myself to what I like to refer to as the universal, or Divine energy, and I &quot;fill up my tank&quot; so to speak. someday, I know, I will become impervious to all those unknowing energy seekers out there, and even to most of the ones who do what they do on a conscious level.
<br />

<br />
How can I not? I am, after all, friends with two such people, and friends with one such unknowing one, as well. It's a real friendship, and though I am the more compassionate of us, I know they would defend my status as their friend should the situation arise, as it has so often in the past.
<br />

<br />
So, to any knowing psychic vamps out there, reading this:
<br />

<br />
You don't have to do what you do. There is a source of &quot;energy&quot; out there that you can tap. That any human can tap. Its pools are infinite. Or at least so vast that they may as well be. Learn, or be drowned in a negative stew of your own making, at your end.
<br />

Why does it seem like this huge population of &quot;psi vamps&quot; exists?  Everyone seems to know a few, or is one themselvs.  Perhaps there is a more logical explaination for why this is.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Think about it.</span>

That's what Roy tried saying, but nooo, did people listen to him?

Anything, as improbable as it seems, can probably come into existence via genetic defects/mutations/radioactivity.
