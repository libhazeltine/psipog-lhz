			Hey everyone.. I have been getting alot better at TK's recieveing end of it..I have a job at TGI Friday's as a host..and I will go and seat people and as I'am walking over to seat them at a table, i can get a sense inside my mind and body that they are going to ask for a booth..and seconds later right as im about to seat them they will ask for one...its happened more times then i can count.....also 3 mins ago i was talking to this girl on IM about this guy who she has a crush on and she said was coming over this weekend...well u can read for urself...she is worried that he is gonna call it off, but u can see the TP in work...

SIbeatz (10:04:30 PM): i have a strong feeling inside me that he hasn't even given you any indication about calling it off, that your just having bad thoughts/feelings that he might call it off

			maybe because you've gotten so used to everyone wanting a booth that you can now predict that everyone wants a booth  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

			no, because we get so many people that come in there, and out of the whole place we only have 6 booths, and about 40 or so tables...so no its not predictable

			that doesn't change the fact that everyone wants a booth...
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Please don't tell your friend this but I think the guy will just simply not show up. I know it's mean. I had a friend one time who had a date with a guy who she thought was going to call it off too. He showed up, but this guy I'm getting highly negative energy. He'll either not show up or have bad intentions with your friend. Keep an eye out.

			your not understanding what i'am saying...not everyone wants a booth..infact 95 percent of the people that come in there dont want a booth..that leaves 5 percent...Not only that, but i actually walk them over to their table, then i can already feel inside that they are gonna ask for a booth..with them showing no signs or intentions of wanting one..Also it happens sometimes when they are already seated that they ask their waiter if they can move to a booth...and when that happens i have already had engery inside my body telling me that they are gonna ask for one--again with them showing not indication of wanting one...
<br />

<br />
Im taken credit for it...as TP...even if people think it nots..either or, it will help me get better.

			booths are pretty awesome because you can hide in them <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I recall playing hide and go seek in the booths at the Pizza Hut when I was young... which is funny that I'm recalling this because I never did that. All that aside, recall is such a cool word.
<br />

<br />
Oh yes, I used to lie down in the booths. I liked them because they were small and secluded and I could have my fun without the strange people around me going like &quot;wtf, put that kid on a leash&quot;.

			I just think booths are more comfortable.  Chairs you can fall out of.  Booths, you're kinda fastened there.  Feels secure, somehow.
<br />

<br />
And I generally have bad feelings about relationships my friends get into.  That might just be the knowledge that most relationships are doomed to fail, though....
