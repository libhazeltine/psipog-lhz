			Not everyone believes or acknowledges &quot;chakras&quot;, meaning you don't need them for psionics, which probably means it won't affect it.

			Well i heared about chackras but they are only like a hearth but with energy (i think), so they are used to transport energy, i think this is maded instintively. Well thats my opinion

yeah iv had partial success with TK doing this. erm i think of it as a psionic receptor rather than an energy port. it seems to help, but its much ore benefical (to me) to just use my hand as a tool.

			I've used it a few times to move some things. Here a little technique:
<br />
Focus on the object first for a little while. Then close your eyes and focus on bringing that object in your mind. Focus on that same object but now let it be in your mind. Now visualize it moving alot of ways. Let it move easily however you want it. Just visualize this. Then after a couple of minutes of doing so, open your eyes, stare somewhere near the object, but not at th eobject, not too close to it either. Lets say about 10 to 15 centimetres away from the object. Stare there, and now take that image you had in your mind of moving the object, feel that sensation again, as if it is in the cneter of your head. Now bring that image and intention and sensation up to the crown chakra, and visualize the crown chakra filling the space around you or your entire room with white, psychokinetic light. Thiss will give you a feeling of the room and the space. Now you are going to move the object not through focussing on the object itself, rather using the force that is everywhere between the two of you, to let it move. Just like in star wars. (George Lucas actually based star wars and the idea of the force on the Tao martial arts and believe system.) Now Just have the intention of letting the object move, and keep staring, not at th eobject itself, and just let it move focussing on the force which is filling your room and also surrounding your object everywhere. Just focus on that, and the intention of moving it.

That's how I used the crown chakra with tk.

			I don't even know if i should believe in chakra or not anymore ;-;
<br />
I wouldn't believe theres something literally there, i could call it something else.. a main point in the body that releases the most energy. A chakra, gah.
