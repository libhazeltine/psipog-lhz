			I like to use a variation of approaches in no handed attempts at TK. 
<br />

<br />
Let's use a psi wheel for example of what I'm about to say. 
<br />

<br />
When I practice moving a psi wheel without hands, I like to imagine a sphere construct that I've programmed to &quot;stay together&quot; and keep it at the tip of one of the edges. Then I like to visualize that construct rotating with the wheel, while pushing it by the edges.
<br />

<br />
Yet as a beginner, I've learned to try different methods that would benefit your preferences. So since I tend to very visual, I tried to imagine things like a construct shaped like a gear that turned, and the edges would push against the corners of the psi wheel to turn it.
<br />

<br />
The key is focus and imagination. Once you find a &quot;visual&quot; that <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> can clearly see, then that'll be part of what helps you to do TK with no hands. Hope that helps.

			Ok i was just reading JoeT's telekinesis thread, he talks about the glass container being a mental barrier your brain assumes that the wheel will be harder to move becasue there is a container covering the psi wheel.
<br />

<br />
Could distance and hands just be another one of these barriers? Mabye your brain assumes that you can only channel energy through your hands therefore your hands need to by the psi wheel to move it. And when you are futher away your brain tells you that it will be harder.
<br />

<br />
So if this theory is correct then all we really need to do is truly believe that we can move the psi wheel from a distance and that we can channel the energy through any part of our body, kind of KNOW you can do, KNOW its possible. Dont take no shit form that brain, your right hes wrong!!!!

			I think the best thing to do is not get hung up on the whole hands/ no hands issue and just do it. don't focus on where your hands are, just focus on moving the wheel. The reason you don't have much success without hands is probably due to the fact that it doesn't feel comfortable for you. If the way you do it isn't comfortable, then chances are that that's going to take some of your attention away from the psi wheel, resulting in bad resluts, and possibly strengthening your mental barrier against it.
<br />

<br />
If you really want to pk sans hands (that ryhmes, kind of <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />) then I would suggest following my earlier advise and just not get hung up on the fact that your hands aren't where they normally are. Only concentrate on the object and nothing else.

Sorry to sound harsh but... hands dont have jack     .  <img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" />  They have as much &quot;aura&quot; as your eyes, foot, ears, ass, etc. The only reason they could make pk easier is becuase of the way you visualize it. I may be awesome using my hands but I may be equally awesome with nothing at all. In fact there is no aura surrounding your hands that make them &quot;special.&quot; Its only like that if you visualize there is. So basicly the only thing that prevents you from doing something is a mental barrier (which you can overcome) and using your hands wont have a better effect unless its how you visualize the wheel moving. So basicly in conclusion, theres no aura around your hands at all that make them better at moving the psi wheel, its just how you think.

ps. Sorry for being kinda rude

			Hands are very objective when it comes to doing psychokinesis. The funny thing is we don't even need them.  We use our hands everyday of our lives so it is only natural we will try to use them when it comes to doing PK.  Do you need them? No.  Do they help?  Yeah.  I find it much easier to focus on an object when I wave my hand or have my hand in front of the object.  But just keep in mind, the hand is optional.  It definately is not required.  Next time you are doing PK, try not using the hands.  See what kind of results you get.

			I do not use the hands to make TK. nowadays to move the psiwheel  is easier . Sometimes I think that is just the wind. that thinking let me down. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />

			I think in the end it just comes down to personal preference. The main idea behind a personal technique is to be comfortable enough to concentrate on what you're doing. That's why some people's techniques do not work well on others, just like using hands may not be comfortable for some.
