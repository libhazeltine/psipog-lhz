			Out of curiousity's sake, what was everyone's first experiences in psionics like? My first attempt at psionics was with the one tutorial on Psipog, where you shuffle a card into a deck and try to find it again (mirco-tk?). I felt a strong tingling throughout my body at a certain card, and lo and behold, it was my card. I moved on to the psiwheel after that, and I didn't dab into much else at that time. For some reason, I just stopped for a year or two. Now, having gotten back into it a few months ago, I'm focusing moreso on energy manipulation and OBE's.
<br />

<br />
Due to being 13 or 14 when I first started, being rather naive, I picked up a lot of, to put it simply, crap. For example, auras could only be blue or yellow (blue for living things, yellow for non-living), daylight hampered your ability to move the psiwheel, random fluff like that. I look back on that and slap myself.

			Good question.  My first psionic experience?  I sat in front of a psiwheel for a few hours and it moved a tiny bit.

My first experience is certainly not my favourite <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Well, I suppose, when I was 9 or 10, I first made my psiball.
<br />

<br />
It was weird, I didn't understand what was really in my hand, sort of freaked me out. Then I tried again the next day and I felt as if I fell down or almost blacked out, I'm not really sure. After that, I just stopped, I didn't think I was ready. But, DMILS happened a year or two after the psiball, but I didn't directly know it was DMILS, I just thought &quot;Mind over matter&quot; type deal.

			That would be about 7 years ago I believe...It was a dream. If there was anything that change my way of thinking it was this dream. My first luid dream. It started out as a normal dream of a small 13 year old boy who liked video games (still do but not as much).
<br />

<br />
I was flying a gaint robot I made from armor core 2 above this snowly mountain. I couldnt see the ground but only the peak below me. A missile hit me out of no where which cause me to great into the mountain side. My black cool mech (Which I name solar knight) was face down in the ground. I got up from the crash and notice the person who shot me down. A white mech landed a little off from me, and looking at me was this girl. I don't remember her face or hair its all a blurr. She look at me and grin. Before I knew it she jump on me, hitting me onto the ground. She laid on top of me and gave me a kiss. She jump off and looked at me. I remember standing up. These thoughts enter my mind.
<br />

I FELT IT. Could I control feeling itself? Is the mind that powerful? </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
It was this dream that shocked my way of thinking. Of cource there were many other things that help it grew. Of cource at the time I believe for it be brainwashing skills.
<br />

<br />
After a short time after this dream I and my brothers started playing a game. It was pretty much like dbz...but what my brothers and I like to do is act like the training. Of cource I act like out the mediation..it was then I made my first psiball. I don't remember why I made in my stomach. But it all started from this dream. Over the years I improve this power. I contuine to believe it to be mind bending thoughts. A few of my childish thoughts wanted me to believe it to be psychic skills. And once or twice I tried to do some things but seeing I couldnt do it on the first try I gave up. I had other dreams of moving things with my mind, dreams so real I felt like &quot;being&quot; the object and moving it.
<br />

<br />
It was not untill I found psipog and look through the articles. I was shocked once more, because the psi ball and some of the others things I done, I learn by myself. Of cource I didnt see everything you all did, I found that I done things some of you mite not have.
<br />

<br />
I may not been here really long, and I'm sad its going to be shut down. But I'm glade the articles are going to be stored. This was the place that made me take up my &quot;old&quot; habits once again.

YOU ROCK PISPOG!
