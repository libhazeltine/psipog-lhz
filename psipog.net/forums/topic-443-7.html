			Yeah, we pretty much just owned Zarin, which is good. Also, I messaged The Zack on <a href="http://ducain.org/hihforum" target="_blank" class="postlink">the HIH forum</a> the link to my video, and apparently, HE believes psionics is real now.

			You do realize Zarin, that your existence here is beyond pointless if you have such a closed-minded personality.  Honestly, why ARE you here?  Here's some scientific psychology facts for you:
<br />

<br />
Your expansive limited attitude on the subject of psychokinesis and other psionic phenomenon is the stimulus that prevents your subconscious from being successful as a psion.  As a side, WHO THE HELL CARES IF THE DAMN PHOTO WAS FAKED????  I LAUGH at you.  Why do you care...unless you have certain...subconscious insecurities that don't allow you to &quot;let&quot; anyone live their own life.  LOL LOL LOL LMAO LMAO  Your situation is so sad, and i see it everyday...you don't even know what physics is...and as a final note, read my signature.  You may OR may not find my philosophical discoveries about the illusion of truth enlightening to your view of the &quot;invincible&quot; science.  You are what I like to call an anti-risk-taker.  Haha, if you lived during the late 1800s, you would have been one of those conservative people who said we would never reach the moon, and, ultamitely laughed at when we finally did.  So, in conclusion, don't bring your ignorant, idealistic, materialistic, pessimistic, superficial and conservative views to psipog.net or the forums to discourage aspiring psions if you're obviously completely unwilling to open up to the fact that your view of the universe MAY be wrong and/or incomplete.
<br />

<br />
P.S.  I'm willing to bet my account most people don't care for your views...Zarin.

That's really your opinion, I don't think &quot;owning&quot; poor defenseless &quot;KN3WBZ&quot; or &quot;Noobs&quot; is a proper thing to do. I just give them advice and proper direction. Harming others in any way is something I try to keep away from, unless....they...make-me-ANGRY!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

Anything is possible, and I have learned that.
