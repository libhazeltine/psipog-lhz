			Probably been asked and people are sick of hearing it, move this thread, link me or whatever, if needed.
<br />
I'll start with IRC first, I understand why most of psipog is blocked off, just by googling psipog can see why, but what about those of us who have actual genuine interest in learning, how can we chat up on IRC? 
<br />

<br />
Second, is yes, psi-balls refering to them since it is what seems to be the first thing anyone says to try out. I have only read one fiction book I remember and I only remember the text. So when I try to picture a ball, its usually in 3rd person and I guess best way to describe it is faint, distant and sort of only a outline aka doesn't come up and hit me in face. 
<br />
Thought I'd throw in a few pictures for a better example, #1 is what I think it should look like. #2, is what it actually looks like sort of, minus the whole light dark difference, eyes shut looking at the back of your eyelids.

<br />

Thanks for any input,

			Psipog does have a IRC chat, but I don't know if the two weeks sign up of psipog.net is still around since the site is being archived soon.
<br />

I don't know what you're exactly asking.

			Archived? Ouch, well guess alot of sites I goto are going down or just stopped being maintained. Might as well offline archive them incase they disappear completely.

Second, was my troubles with visualization, sorry for not stating that. Not limited to psi balls, picture a square, triangle, circle. Is always 3rd person, distant, faint, etc...The pictures are basically A what I think it should look like, I'm guessing and B what I sort of see when my eyes close, more often than not there isn't a single thing there.

			Don't worry so much on the visualization. Worry more on getting it to work.
