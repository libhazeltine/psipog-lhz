			Ok, just before writing this post I tried practicing telekinesis with a pencil. Here's how I did it. I layed the pencil in my palm. my palm was slightly angled so that it bent forward but not enough for the pencil to move on it's own. even with my hands shaking it still didnt move. I closed my eyes and visualized it moving forward down the slope. It moved a litlle and I felt it moving on my palm. Then when I opened my eyes, I tried to pull it back and it did. I actually saw it rolling towards me up the slope of my palm. I was like Whoa! but upon my excitement I lost control of my concentration and it stopped dead in it' tracks. What do you guys think? Basic Telekinetic success?

			Well, probably. Try moving the pencil from out of hands reach <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> try bringing the pencil to you from across a table XD

			I think... Well ok, here's what I think. I think that the subconscious can move our muscles as a basic reaction to thought patterns, so when you felt it move with your eyes closed, that <span style="font-style: italic">could</span> have been your hand moving, but as for the rolling up your palm, that sounds like a PK success <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> congratulations. To be sure, of course, you'd have to have it on a different surface. You could try a sloped piece of card if you wanted to keep the slope though. And it <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> be easier now you know you can.
<br />

<br />
Thus, in summary, big congratulations!

			For a few days i was convinced i was moving a pen all over my palm, i was just usuing slight muscle movements that i only saw when i stared as my hand did it.  But the going up the slope sounds right.  But i wouldn't trust you hand, move it to a table.  It probably wont be much of a difference in feeling.  Start with a rollable object.  Like a bic pen.  Sliding involves too much friction for ppl just making the step from the psi wheel or somthing.  I just moved a pen for the first time yesterday!  Dont give up!!

			Yeah, I tried it on a different surface but it was barely moving. Like Rahmid said, sliding is too damn hard with all the friction. I decided to use a ciggarette, I wasnt focusing much so I only got it to wiggle a little bit. *sigh* I need more focus, lol

			you said that you used a pencil but next time, try using a round pen.  Pencils are hexagonal and are slightly harder to move.
