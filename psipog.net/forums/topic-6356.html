			So i have recently read a bunch of information about life on other planets/galaxies (perhaps its bullshit) For instance i hear there is a buncha aliens on Sirius (not the satellite radio). 
<br />

<br />
My question is, why hasn't anyone that is unsuccessful at OBEs try and fly out there n see whats poppin? i hear people admit that once in OBE they can fly to the beach or to the moon. Whats stopping them from going to a different galaxy?

You must mean <span style="font-style: italic">successful </span>at OBE'ing. I've read Monroes books which refer to other life and other planets and such that he visited and I'd suggest you read it. Very interesting. Second, I'd say because of (1) fear or (2) Inexperience. You're completely conscious throughout, so think of how exciting/freightening it would be to actually be looking down at the earth as you &quot;float&quot; up and away. You get scared because your body is so &quot;far away&quot;, and from my understanding, when you get scared or exiceted when OBE, you snap back into your body. Or people do not know how. You must not forget about how far away these planets are. However, I do understand that distance does not always matter, if you're experienced. Thats my opinion. I know when I learn how I'm going strait to space ASAP lol.

			I dunno if this is completely safe, there are black holes in space, and they can suck up EVERYTHING known to humanity, what if they suck you up while you're OBEing and crush you, what if you can die that way?

Anyone OBE'd into a black hole?

Black holes cannot &quot;suck up&quot;, as you put it, objects without mass. &quot;Humanity&quot; (or at least the theoretical physicist component thereof) knows of lots of things that are objects without mass (at least theoretically).
<br />

<br />
The question, of course, is whether whatever you are when you OBE is an object with mass actually located at the location where you are OBEing. From my experience, I am inclined to say &quot;no&quot;.
<br />

<br />
As for your probability of actually venturing within the event horizon (point of no return) of a black hole, rest assured that it is infintesimal.

Yeah, the objects without mass are only theoretical, we haven't actually launched one past a black hole to see if it'll get pulled in or not.
<br />

<br />
We don't know much about what you are when you OBE, or how it works, or whether you can die while OBEing, so we can't be sure that it's 100% safe.
