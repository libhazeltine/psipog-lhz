			Well I was getting ready to sleep but I decided to see if I could Astral project... So I just put myself there... I started see myself leaving.. but only in my head... I don't think i left the body... But at certain points it felt like i was.. I tried traveling out into space to a planet with a mountain... I heard this was a good starting technique... Then I started to descend blow the fog of the mountain... when i descended into the fog... I felt like I was back in myself... but my head began to rise... like my spirit was pulling myself up... it was like i wasn't moving myself.. but I was moving... and then I came to... I then made a psi ball... my reaction was to .... then I went to sleep. Share any thoughts on this.. all comments appreciated. ~peace to all~

			Atleast you had a start. I kinda had one too just a bit ago, cept I wasn't totally sure it was an OBE XD Was just really relaxed, sitting there, I couldn't feel my body or anything, I was talking to my sub-c when suddenly my mind fealt as if it was the size of the universe, I tried to hold my overwhelming surprise but I broke out of it shortly. The feeling of that was truly weird, but I could &quot;fly&quot; about for a second or two.

If it is necessary to get my point across. I figured as long as you can read. What does it matter, how many dots are involved. Are you so easily offended? ~Peace to all~ Bill Beck

1) I'm not offended.
<br />

<br />
2) Why does it matter? Because a post in standard written English is much easier to read than a post in whatever stream-of-consciousness variation you feel like using at the time. As written, your original post is difficult to read. A post that is easier to read is much more likely to be read in its entirety, and is much more likely to attract whatever comments you are looking for.
<br />

<br />
It's really common courtesy to at least make an effort to write your posts in the English everyone else is used to reading. Writing your posts... like this... is very annoying... don't you think so?....I think so... because... it's annoying... like really annoying.... and stuff... all of these ...s are... difficult to read... you have to go through... and read again... and they can... even come in the middle... of thoughts... like that did you catch that?... anyways... i'm done with... this example, it's hard for me... to type like this, I don't know how you doit? anyways... write better... thanks!

Hey soulofstrings, I heard that to get an OBE your mind has to be more awake, but meh. Whatever works. You should try astral projecting in a comfy chair, in the middle of the day.

			When I was doing one of my hemi-sync exercises, I felt a strong vibration/tingling feeling that started in my head, then the back of my neck, then my spine, and it kept slowly spreading throughout my body and then it progressed to a rising feeling. I was scared as hell, so I tried my hardest to stop it. 
<br />

<br />
Later on, I found out that the exact feeling that I described is what several people experience just moments before an OBE <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Anyways, don't doubt yourself. If you have a feeling and you believe that it's a sign of an OBE, then don't dismiss it as the &quot;wrong&quot; feeling, because often it's the right feeling, but you don't think it is <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

that would be sleep paralysis. your body does that on its own, that way you don't act out your dreams. sometimes you wake up before it wears off. it's actually a pretty good state to OBE in, though.

This is the first time I've heard this. Sounds like a good mechanism of the body in order to prevent sleep walking and other bad crap that can happen if you physically move while dremaing. Maybe there's a connection between sleepwalking and dreamers whose sleep paralysis does not take place while dreaming.
