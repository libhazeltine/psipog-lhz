			I was told that I could see things in dreams, as in actually be there. But fantasy these dreams were. I was told this by a professional, name I musn't say. I was wondering, is there a way to improve this? To promote it in my mind, so that I can see more? Possibly see actual places, not fantasy places? The person who told me this was a very professional pyschic, and I believe her, because sometimes, I just wake up knowing things I've never known before. Any comments/questions?

			It's impossible to learn things in dreams that you dont already know...conciously, or subconciously, you already know the information from somewhere...You can recover distant memorys or &quot;forgotten&quot; information.
<br />

<br />
Are you saying you can predict the future in your dreams or something like that?  I didnt really understand your post.
<br />
Can you give an example of one of your dreams?

			I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;see things in dreams&quot;, but about your question on improving the quality of you dreams I can answer. I suggest keeping a dream journal and every time you wake up write down as much as you can remember about your dreams that you had that night. This well tell your subconscious that your dreams are important to remember and you will gradually start remembering more dreams as well as remember more things in your dreams.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: If you are saying that you can see things before they happen in your dreams, those are know as pre-cognitions.

			Are you sure? She specifically told me I <span style="font-style: italic">wake up</span> knowing things.

Examples: I can't really describe them. Like I said they're fantasy. Always. I've never had old memories in my dreams. Usually my dreams are seeing something. They're usually without people or speech, and an event happens. Some I can link to things that happen to me in real life. I'm not sure.

she probably means precognating (predicting futuristic events) in your dreams this is very possible i have reason to believe i predicted my mother's death in one of my recent dreams.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

well arnt you nice ? <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />
<br />
i dont think you should be telling Meant to ignore other peoples advice considering you go on to say you know nothing.
<br />

<br />
It could be precog, then agen it could me a wierd obe, both sets of advice are good. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> but i would go with a type of precog, because you discribes them as fantasy dreams and iv never heard of an obe being like a dream.
<br />
There are ways of controling it but first you will have to find out what it is, go to the main site and have a look at some articles, see if anything seems like a similare skill to your dreams. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
