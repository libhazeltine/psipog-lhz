Uhhh...who cares?  Some of the most beloved characters of ancient stories, literature and film are anti-heroes or downright villians.

			Yes, I am going to have to step in to all of this James Bond stuff. I am fully British blooded so I might as well. 
<br />

<br />
Here is the major point that you must understand: The whole James Bond deal was written in books, a long time ago, in Britain! Now look, Britain, right? Okay, over there, things are different. Sexuality is higher up on the level as compared to the tight-assed Americans shielding everything. Back then, and even now to some, the whole idea of James Bond getting all the babes was humourous and enjoyable. 
<br />

<br />
No respect. Okay, I can see that. First off, the actors show James Bond's personality different each time, so more or less respect is given. But the whole idea here is, people who show no resepect are viewed as &quot;bad asses&quot; you know, the cool guys. That is the image created for that. 
<br />

<br />
Ethan Hunt is designed for Americans. James Bond is designed for British people or people with those tastes. When I first watched Mission Impossible I found Ethan Hunt to be kinda like a wimp. 
<br />

<br />
Chauvanistic? He is a secret agent who works directly with the government of Britain! What do you expect him to be like? If you work that high up, you will have a lot of patriotism for your country. 
<br />

<br />
The main point I am trying to get at is, it's from a different culture. Your American way of thinking doesn't compute in this math equation. Change your CPU.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Life is like a math equation, some things add up to equal negative, some things add up to equal positive.&quot;
<br />
~One of my many versions of the math equation epic proverb.

			It doesn't matter what culture it's from. I am, yes, a feminist, but I don't find it extreme or culturally exculsive to be offended by women being treated as sex objects. I know that the movies aren't designed by children, but there are plenty of fathers who show Bond to their children at a young age. That kind of socialization process is completely out of line. Sex being more open in Britain? Sure! Women being portrayed as people like Pussy Calore? Not good. Men treating women as sex objects the way all Bond characters have? Not good. I have nothing wrong with openess of sexuality. I have a problem with the portrayal of appropriate recognition of women as equal, which they never are in Bond movies.
<br />

<br />
In conclusion, Bond can go spend a night with Mr. Righty and Mr. Lefty and they can even invite their friend beatrag, but I'm going to go bang Ethan Hunt. Or Indiana Jones.

			sawyerhickory, sorry if you're offended by Bond(the movies do portray women badly though)but alot of guys who are Bond freaks don't look at women that way.....my friends, family and myself have all been Bond freaks at one point and actually....we're the more respectful guys compared to others. =/ maybe it's just us but I think Bond is fun to watch because of booms, the kickass gadgets, the crazy cars and all the fights and chases.....

I don't think murder should be perpetuated either, but does that mean all murder mystery stories are bad?  Does that mean Clue is therefore an evil game that should be banned?  The reality is every good story has it's elements of positivity and negativity that balance out to make the story realistic and intruiging.  And James Bond's character is actually a believeable, well-developed one because of this very reason.  Yes, he's jaded and won't let women close to him because of emotional damage.  So he's part anti-hero (by the way, way to completely ignore that very comment the last time I made it).  So what?
<br />

<br />
In summary, if you have a moral issue with something like the Bond movie series, don't watch them.  Forcing your opinion down other peoples' throats is no more than a cover up for lack of confidence in your own beliefs.  Your attempted recruiting of others to agree with you just to make you feel more validated doesn't make your opinion any more correct.

It does matter what culture it is from. Don't overlook this. The word &quot;feminist&quot; didn't even exsist when the Bond movies/books were created. Feminists derived from lesbians or other &quot;different&quot; women. They didn't like men, and they didn't like their fellow comrades to be treated as idols or &quot;sex objects&quot; as you call it. Yes, idols. If I was a woman, I would appreciate how much men love me.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> Men can't help it, we just have a lot of [insert something that women don't have that make men more sexual]. 
<br />

<br />
Bond is not a bad character. Millions or should I say billions of people love him. There is no character created who is like him. 
<br />

<br />
Hey, you could even look at this as an advantage for you. Men will do anything for sex. So, women control men. Eventually, sadly to say, women will control the world because of this. There is actually another outcome, but I won't talk about that. 
<br />

<br />
You disagree with sex being more open in Britain? Seriously, take a gander. I've been to Enlgand on many occasions. At night, they play pretty dirty television. One such program was about improving your sex life. And they got professionals to teach you different sexual positions and even showed a dildo. Come on, that's pretty sexual. Oh another thing, go buy a newspaper. &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper is a good one. Turn to page three. What do you see? Oh, a naked woman! *gasp* Yeah, sexual. Okay, I want to go and buy a soda. I know! I'll go and walk to the nearest shop. I enter, get a soda, walk by the magazines, and what's that? Wow! At least 10 different porno magazines right out in the open. Hmmm, seeing anything yet? 
<br />
And, it's not just Britain. It's all of Europe really. And from what I've heard, Japan has some pretty sexual things as well. 
<br />

<br />
America has none of that. So, you Americans get offended if you see the slightest bit of anything. Pussy Calore. Come on, it's a joke. Austin Powers even made fun of it. British humour. 
<br />

<br />
Lightbringer: Yes, I agree with you in every way. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;You don't see things as they are, you see things as you are.&quot; 
<br />
~Anaïs Nin (A woman!)
<br />
And her quote proves: &quot;There is no right or wrong, no good or evil.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
So Bond, is neither bad nor good.
<br />
