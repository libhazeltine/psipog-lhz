			The past few weeks I've really been successful in communicating with my sub-c. I really haven't dabbled in other fields, like telepathy or precognition, just psychokenesis. I'm not sure if this counts as clairvoyance or precognition, because I did not see this event coming, but I guess my sub-c did. Anyways, some days I have to take the bus to my community college. I was on my way out the door, when lo and behold, my sub-c tells me to grab some extra change. I said no, because I'd be tempted to get a soda, which I'm trying to cut down on. I asked why I would need the change. It replied that <span style="font-style: italic">I</span> wouldn't need it. So like what peebrain talked about in his article, I trusted it and took the extra change, though doubting. I get to my bus stop, and this very nice lady I'm aqcuainted with is waiting like always. But she looked a little unnerved, and was counting change in her hand. Sure enough, she didn't have enough for bus fare, and I had brought the extra change, so she was able to get on the bus. On the bus, I still had extra change. I felt what my sub-c says to me as &quot;patience&quot;. I waited until the bus stopped for another person. He had one of those cards, but when he swiped it through the bus fare reader, it beeped; no more bus fare credit. It was in no way a coincidence, but is this precognition? Another example, yesterday. I planned on going out with some friends in the evening. I was brushing my teeth after I woke up, and again, my sub-c had a semi-precognition/revelation,  &quot;Get on the howard lane frontage road tonight, and stay on it. Don't take the highway to get to the theater.&quot; Ok...but with my luck the previous day, I didn't hesitate or doubt anymore. Later in the evening after being picked up, I told my friends there would be less traffic if we took the frontage road. This was completely opposite, and my friends were a little annoyed. But in the left lane a few cars up, there was a tow truck with car on it that stuck out. Then I remembered; that's the same color and model as my one of my friend's car, which was stolen the previous day. We called our friend up on the spot, checked to make sure it was the same license plate, and followed the tow truck. If we hadn't, my friend's car would be in parts at a chop shop. Do these events count as precognition, or do I have to envision them myself instead of my subconscious?

I'd go ahead and call them precognition. Because you and your subconscious are the &quot;same&quot; person <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.

That's awesome stuff man, keep it up.

			Yeah, we had to follow the tow truck to the impound. We gave directions to my friend to get there (His mom was nice enough to let him drive her car for the time being), and eventually (some paperwork later) he got his car back. I asked tow truck driver if they just check the plates and find the owner; he said (and this irked me) that for a crappy, beat up honda civic that smelled of alcohol inside with thrashed interior, he figured it had been abandoned, so it would go to a chop shop the next day.

			Honestly, read Peebrain's article, because once I started trying out what he talked about, everything started coming together. It's mainly just shutting up for a minute.
