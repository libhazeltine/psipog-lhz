			I have been practicing TK for 10 days now for about 10 minutes a night.  On my 9th day I am almost 100% sure I actually moved the psi wheel (with no hands) via TK.  But it was weird.  It seemed like it had a mind of its own yet seeming to move coinsidentially in the desired direction.  And something else strange was that I have could only do it for a minute or two and then I had to relax for a few minutes to do it again (I didn't feel consciously tired though; maybe my subconscious need a little time to take it all in?).  And when it went in the wrong direction I just kind of visualized it stopping while I willed it to stop at the same time and the wheel just stopped instantly like it slammed on the brakes.  Then I would try to make it spin the other way and it would wobble a little as if acknowledging my command and would proceed in the desired direction.  And when I got &quot;tired&quot; I visualized energy forming near a corner and pushing it and that worked too.  The next day I tried it in the morning and it took a little longer but eventually it moved violently as if I had created a gust of wind making me believed I had actually performed aerokinesis.  And when I tried to do it in front of my brother I couldn't do it!  But then again I had to hold my breath which made it hard (I usually just breath with my hand over my nose or breath in such a way as not to disturb the wheel).  Then that night (I have to practice covertly!) I tried again with no success.  Then I thought I would try the hand method.  It worked better than I expected.  It moved faster than usual and with a lot more reliability.  I basically moved my hands very slowly (there's no way that could have created wind) in a given direction which caused the wheel to spin in that direction or the opposite direction.  I even tried combining that with the no-hands technique to stop it or influence more and that worked quite well.  I used my hands to amplify the power.  That night seemed like it was actually made for me to experiment with my hands.  And, sorry to bring up religeon, I prayed I would be able to perform TK within 3 weeks practicing for at least 10 minutes a night (I brought it up because I thought it might have been a factor that lead to my success  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .)  And the night after I got bored of my hand TK I prayed that I would be able to do no hands TK once more and I did but that was pretty much it.  I would appreciate any advise on what to do to enhance my skills or any info. about my experiences.

			It seems you are doing quite well yourself. You don't need alot of advice, just keep experiementing and practicing as you do now. Though watch it that you do not intellectualize and label every experience you have. By that I mean, what you were telling us about you seemed to be &quot;tired&quot; and then you had to wait a minute before it worked again. If you label this too much, and if you get attached to that exp4erience too much, then you might be bound to that &quot;tiredness&quot; in future practices. So While practicing and experimenting like you do, just observe what is happening, but don't label the situation too much, before then it may become a mindblock later on.
<br />

<br />
Besides that, I want to congratulate you, and perhaps you could try moving on next week to spinning a balanced straw, or some other excercise that you like.
<br />

<br />
Keep up the good work, and the praying as it seems to help you.

			Thank you martial artist. But I have to admit that my ability to move it without my hands is for some reason decreasing and I must rely on my hands to move it now. I'm a little worried.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> Further more, in order to move it I must not use the jar because its either too big (I put my hands very close to the wheel.) or it blocks the signal.  As for authenticity, I have had success while holding my breath.  And sometimes I barely have to move my hands for it to start spinning fast. I intend to keep practicing with my hands and perhaps I can move without again one day  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />.

			Yeah, I don't like using my hands either.  The only time I was completely convinced it did something was when I pretty much didn't even move them and the wheel spun with unusual speed.  And the problem I have with the jar makes me skeptical about the authenticity of my supposed successes.  I shall keep practicing but I don't think I will get spontaneous experiences like the ones I've had for a long while. Last night I had to remove the jar and it seemed like there were small gusts of wind but I couldn't identify the source.  But sometimes it was still and I just visualized it wobble and it did and then it started to wobble by itself.  Then I tried to move it counter clockwise but I probably budged it a few milimeters.  Stuff like this leaves me to believe it's aerokinesis.  Perhaps the jars small space prohibits this.

			TK is about experimenting to find what works for you. If you keep getting advice from people you will find yourself using their techniques instead of the ones that are unique to you.

			Thanks.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> I too prefer to use my own techniques.
