I thought it was a rather nice thing to say. Once I sat down in a chair on a sidewalk and gave a little candy to two people I didn't know. The first didn't want any but glade for the offer, the 2nd was happy to give her some. Small good deeds to people just makes there day so much better.

It is indeed not funny at all, I had one moment in my life that I thought about suicide. I didn't do it because I feared death, I mite have done it in time if I didn't have a certain &quot;influnce&quot; that jump in. Most of my life I was a loner outside the public, I have been shy most of my life and people made fun of me because of that. But here something that is funny, when I grew strong enough to know words are just words. I had these kids start to think I mite bring a gun to school one day. I never been made fun of since. lol.........When I didnt show weakness they didn't look at me anymore...sort of scare some of them.

Love is kindness x 1000.  It's like kindness with passion, also know as compassion.  I guess it's hard to explain...

			Cool. It's fun to read this thread. I think actually, everything that happens in your life reflects in the end on yourself. I mean, the life your living. Why are you living it? 
<br />
I can give no answer to no one to this question and not to myself either.
<br />
But what i know is that love is so very important for you!
<br />
I like how MartialArtist described it as universal state of mind. I think of it the same way. Love is when everything makes perfect sense to you and all possibilities are laid open before you and you can choose the thing you want and you're feeling good doing it.
<br />
When talking about love you may think of love to a man or woman, but that's only a part of it. You can feel love in every moment and spread it among people you like and people you hate too. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Although the mastery of a specific skill or concept may not seem important, the training in self-discipline is invalueable.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I agree with you Apollo. Self-discipline lets you learn from yourself and other people causing you to make less mistakes and understand things better. For me it's like the training of intuitive skills and the ability to master difficult or complicated situations without feeling fear and being able to act with a more focussed mind and greater perfection. 
<br />

<br />
If you live this way accepting this love you change the world or yourself or both, but it makes no difference because both is in some way you.
<br />
In the end you change your behaviours and ways, therefore your life and your universe and maybe change everything.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
It sounds so amazing and freaky but if you consider just for one moment yourself being a &quot;god&quot; or at least a &quot;godly&quot; being, that forgot his own powers deluded by stupid unimportant issues you may feel way more confident.
<br />

<br />
For me it's like that I only do things i feel good about and when i lose this ffeeling i ask myself why i don't feel the same way i feel before and try to get back to it. Like it says above the window in which i am writing now &quot;Be intelligent&quot; is very important too in my opinion, because it is easy to get into trouble quickly in these times.
<br />

<br />
Ohh man way too much i wrote here. Yet i hope you read it and get my point <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />

			In my opinion, love is a deep caring, and devotion to a person/people/thing/idea, ect...One of the deepest feelings, and eveyone knows it.  It is a feeling of deep attachment, a feeling of happines (x1000).  Love can't be defined, because it isn't just a word, it is a feeling, a concept and lifestyle.  In order to define love, you have to know love.  Everyone knows love, and in a different way I might add.  The way that you know love is your definition.  There are no two definitions for the concept of love.
<br />

<br />
Somefatguy, you know what love is, you feel love.  What is one thing that you really, truley care about?  One thing that you devote yourself to?  One thing that you feel attached to, and feel happy with?  For most of us, we can say psionics is a thing we love, and that is perfectly acceptable.  Love doesn't have to be felt towards a person, in can be felt towards an object, a concept, an idea, ANYTHING.

I would say: don't do it if you don't know the person well enough to expect his/her feelings. Teasing/kidding all that stuff are great and can also be an expression of love.

When I was in fourth grade, everyone was always calling people names and everything was double meaning and immature, it was so screwed up. Kids would ask you if you had a pencil, like they wanted to borrow one, and then, if you said no, they would say, &quot;you don't have a wiener??? hahahahahahahahaha&quot; and if you said yes, they would just start laughing, I was like, WTF??!!!? Oh, and if you replied to these stupid insults or whatever they were supposed to be by saying, &quot;you're a dumbass&quot;, then they would be like, &quot;I know you are&quot; and shit like that. It pissed me off so bad I would have brought a gun to school and blown some certain people away if I would have had a gun. Earth would have been better. Anyway, all of this was so immature but I didn't realize that because I was at their level, and so when they told me that they hoped I would die and crap, I took it seriously.
<br />
      
<br />
So eventually I got so pissed off and sad that at night I cried myself to sleep and in the day I went renegade and kicked ass on anyone who even cut me in the lunch line, that lasted through 4th and 5th grade. In 6th grade, the rules on fighting were a lot tighter but I still got in my fair share of fights. But yeah, I was pretty messed up after people treated me like the devil's crap for a whole year. Anger issues. In 5th grade I was actually kind of popular and whatnot but still, I cried sometimes and beat lots of people up, as I mentioned earlier. Now that I'm in high school, I'm not messed up but now you can see how a year in your childhood can screw you up for quite a while. And no, you don't have to be afraid of me, I don't have anger issues.... anymore. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  Lol.

I agree fully with apollo's original post.

This post was the weirdest one I've made in quite a while.....

EDIT: just wanted to add that when I said that tankdown's story sounded like me, I meant that I'm shy like he was/is and the about the whole possible suicide part, not that he is really messed up and weird like I am.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

The influence that made me rethink my life didnt only stop me from killing myself. It was a certain dream I remember so clearly even today about 7 years ago. I wont tell you it (because I have a plan...woops you didnt hear that).

Most of these things were wonderful to read but some of the words demonhunter bothered me...

Self-discipline lets you learn from yourself and other people causing you to make less mistakes and understand things better.

Personaly I think love is to fill the void of darkness within our hearts. The void that is created from which we don't see any purpose to live. Of cource good logic tells us that its ok to die without being known, as long as you did good. I still ponder on the philsophecy of Grace......I think the reason why love exist is because its one answers to the greatest questions I came up to. </span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Why are we created?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody"> </span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Why are we here?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody"> But all these questions lead down to this one </span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">What is the meaning of life?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody"> Or so I think so far....  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
