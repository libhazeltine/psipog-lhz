			I believe it may be a good idea to have a forum into which admins/mods can move dead threads which they believe were especially tantalizing, informative, and thought-provoking: essentially, the &quot;best&quot; threads. This would give posters something to read on subjects that are informative, as well as demonstrating to newbies who read them what does and doesn't become immortalized in the annals of history.
<br />

<br />
The motivation behind the recommendation is my thinking that the ethics post in the Telepathy subforum is most excellent, and when it is finished it should not merely fade of the edge of the page. Instead, it should be recorded as having been a very good thread, and kept as a reference on the topics involved. There are other threads that are similarly good and should be set apart as distinct and better than the typically droll.

			I like this idea. It can not only provide an interesting read to people who join after the topics have died off, but provide a good example of a good topic. The threads would be locked, correct?

			I would imagine so, yes. And they wouldn't be tucked away until after they had been dead for some time.

			Maybe start a sticky for each forum section that has a list of links to informative threads.  Keep it locked and mods would unlock to add links.  Seems like an easier idea than starting a whole new section.

i like this idea.  I think it would help people learn more through the good stuff and not 50% real and 50% dragonball-z/XMen

			That is a really good idea. It's an easier way for users to avoid the fluff topics and read some very enlightening stuff.
