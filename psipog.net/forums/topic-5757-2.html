			First of all lemme just say that Israel and the US can burn in hell and there will never be an armeggedon that is racist. If armeggedon comes it won't just kill all the muslims, we will all die.

Anyways, I did hear something about the world ending in 2006 but so far I ain't seen shit so I doubt it's coming anytime soon. Your proof is all just bullshit. Theres not enough of it to create anything. If it was stronger or theres more of it, it might lead to something.

			I found my self disappointed at how nothing real importent happen on June6th 2006. You can find the number 666 anywhere if you look hard enough. Also if you think hearing your roommate say that? Listen to this.
<br />

<br />
A while ago myself and my brothers were playing in a room, one of my brothers were sleeping because it was late at night. All of a sudden my sleeping brother spoke out &quot;I hear dead people&quot;. (This was before that movie came out that said &quot;I see dead people&quot;). Well me and my older brother laugh and woke him up and told him what he said. He didnt believe us, he thought we were just lieing to make fun of him.
<br />

<br />
My point is that its difficult to understand people when there still in that sleepy trance of theres. Once and again I find myself in a trance and I sit myself up on my bed and go back to sleep. About 2 or 3 days ago I woke up in a trance and with my thoughts saying &quot;Must get up, get up for the bright, must get up. The bright means good, must get up.&quot; These thoughts annoyed me because I didn't even know what the bright freaking was. But my eyes were looking at my clock. After about half a hour of my body turning and sitting and contuine to look at the clock.
<br />

<br />
I was puzzled a little when I finally got up. But I fingure out that what I was saying to myself was that I was referring to the brightness of the clock. But yet at the same time I didn't understand.
<br />

			Yah it's odd. I would tell my dorm mate about what's going on but here's something weird I should inform you all about. My dorm mate left the night I posted the report &amp; hasn't come back since. He didn't tell anyone he was leaving, he just did. He told me when he went out the door that he was going to be right back. 2 days doesn't sound right back to me. Either way, it just makes him odd-er in my eyes. So I can't really ask him what the hell was going on?
