So you're saying the stupidness in my words makes me look awesome, huh? (Before you say anything, his use of a pronoun without properly defining what the pronoun is makes this possible.) Why not try some good grammar? Besides, your statement is illogical. If my words were stupid, they would be false, which would mean you are not awesome at all.

Good job to you too, dumbass.

And I never thought I'd be bringing threads back to life. But hey, I'm just cool like that.
<br />

<br />
Yeah, I haven't been around in a while, but I've managed to fit Psipog into my late night schedule (i.e. 11:30-1:30, when I'm also downloading things, watching Comedy Central, and deciding what time I should get up tomorrow). I figured I could at least come here to this thread and try to say something nice. Imagine my dismay when I saw it was a person I could think of almost nothing to say nice things about, and still be honest about it. Man, I need a virtual tank though, to deal with this guy. I smack him in the face, and he comes back for more.
<br />

<br />
So, ignoring Zemeon's post directly above mine...
<br />

<br />
GreatWhiteNinja is awesome because he's had enough experience with Psipog to actually know who I am, which means he's been around a while, which makes him credible.

Heh, I don't think he did know you that well. As far as I know, you left before GWN saw much of you. But the whole fact is, he is my brother and I used to tell him about the great Eldibs and how cool you were. So he automatically thinks you as cool. Correct me if I am wrong, GWN. 
<br />

Eldibs is awesome because he is smart and used to talk to me all of the time.

Heheh, I am assuming that you think I am older than him. Well, it isn't so, he is 2 years older than me.

You're right in assuming that I thought you were older. However, I didn't mean so much because you were older (which I know now you aren't), but because you had more experience with the site, since I remember seeing you first.

<br />
Somefatguy is a bit more awesome because he successfully assumed without making an ass out of 'u' and 'me.' (Couldn't resist)

Leading ME in the right direction?! I'm the one who has to point out his embarrasing grammar mistakes! <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />   I even invented/revised some quotes for him so that he wouldn't sound like an idiot if he used them here!! Then again you come into more contact with him than me. Therefore, you don't know much about lil' old me.
<br />

<br />
Eldibs is a nice guy for stopping the &quot;petty argument&quot;. I'm not taking sides either way. I have nothing against neither you nor zemeon.
