			Ok, first off, I wasn't completely sure which forum this should go in, so sorry if it's in the wrong place.
<br />

<br />
Earlier on today, I found this site that tells you stuff about you and it's quite shocking. All you do is enter your full name that is found exactly on your birth certificate and it comes up with all this stuff. Btw, it's not all the same because my mum and step dad both did it too, so it's not one of those stupid scams that have all the descriptions the same like Derren Brown did. 
<br />

<br />
Here's the link:     <a href="http://www.paulsadowski.com/Numbers.asp" target="_blank">http://www.paulsadowski.com/Numbers.asp</a>
<br />

<br />
With mine it said stuff that was dead on accurate and I havn't the foggiest on how it works. Is it phychics????? Also, mine said that I will have phychic explorations! It's like someones been spying on me and analysing me my whole life! Anyways, try it out and see if it is right or not and post what it came up with etc.

			hmmmm... I have had doubt about this...
<br />
I tried putting a couple of my friends names in and they came up with a part of mine in theirs. It's mixed. But then again, you can't write them all individually, can you? It's probably random coming to think about it. Maybe one of those phycological things where you think it says true stuff about you because every characteristic  it mentions you think of an experience that matches it. Like for example, if I told you were cold and self centered, you might think of a time when you were cold and self centered, and if I told you the opposite, you would think of a time that relates to that, therefore, you believe that it is summing you up as a whole person. That might not have made sense. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />
