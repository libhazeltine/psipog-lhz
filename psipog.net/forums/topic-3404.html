			<span style="font-weight: bold">Realization:</span>
<br />
I really thought it was real, and I'm kind of questioning it now.  I was moving the psi-wheel then I stumbled upon this:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/Uncovered%20psi%20wheel.html" target="_blank">http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/Uncovered%20psi%20wheel.html</a>
<br />

<br />
That site's really experimental also, looks extremely well-thought out and legit.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Verification:</span>
<br />
To double-check it, I tried heating up my hands then using the psi-wheel.  It moved immediately and faster every time.  
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Reinforcement</span>
<br />
Now that I think of it, even the videos of heaver TK things show the objects being either rotated in a stationary position or just moving in jerky, straight lines.  
<br />

<br />
That is, they are all being moved at the same point on the object which is pretty much what you do on the fishing-line attached to the dollar bill trick.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Question:</span>
<br />
How can this be explained?
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Analysis</span>
<br />
Even if it can, and even if the videos of heaver objects being moved by TK are real, it is obvious that the psi-wheel can be moved easily by the warmer, rising wind currents created from heat sources near the psi-wheel.
<br />
  
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Conclusion:</span>
<br />
Thus, we as a community need to come up with something better for beginners to get started on TK with.

I've heated my hands... as far as i could (yea it did hurt lol)

and errr...

it didn't rotate at all, the room wasn't heated...

so what?

I'm completely confused now :S

<br />
but it did move
<br />
with the heated hands, it didn't move at all, just the wobbling when moving my hands next to it :S
<br />
and when &quot;using&quot; my mind, my hands weren't placed like that, just my fingers were pointing to it...

			i know telekinesis is real because i can slide things from across the room...wanna know how you can get proof? its the easiest way there is.....what you do is: learn telekinesis for yourself, until you can slide things and then you'll know its real too!

			Radiometer is a better test, but a pinwheel is easier to get.  With a pinwheel, yes, you can move it with heat instead.  With a radiometer, either there is light on it or there isn't.  The objective is to stop it from spinning while light is spinning it, without interfering with the light source.  Other than PK, there is no known way to accomplish this.  It is therefore a better test.  The apparatus costs ten or twenty dollars, and can be purchased from science-geek type places.  (Edmund Scientific carries them, for example.)

Then that creates cold currents and the previously regular temperatured currents are now relatively warm..

			I'm not saying cold enough water to freeze your hand just enough to nullify the heat coming from them for a little bit.  Bah i guess that wouldn't be good enough.

			I think actually part of the reason newbies start on psi wheels IS because there is warm air current from your hands. Couple of years ago when I started this I realized that probably thats the reasoning behind the pointed shape as well. However, the warmth from your hands is usually not enough to move it. It simply makes it easier to move. There is a large number of begginers who give up after a few tries, and never pick up the skill. Sure, it introduces doubt, but once you get it and move onto heavier objects like pencils that doubt disapears.
<br />

<br />
When I started I found that exact same page you linked. And yes their experiments are quite nice in demonstrating the flaws of the psi wheel. On the other hand a large amount of people in psi pog and other forums have claimed that they can move heavier objects. Furthermore there is a surprising amount of people around the world in this and other simillar communities. Are we all being fooled? Is this some kind of self perpetuating histeria fueled by the promise of seeing something &quot;magical&quot;? I don't know, I can't tell you. I guess you are going to have to try it and see what you think about it yourself.

It's summer, right, but we still have like 5?C around here and lots of rain...

... and i wonder why :S

Or maybe the original thought behind was to create a much better &quot;You see it so you can do it&quot;-Effect?
