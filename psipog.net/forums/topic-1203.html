			ok, so in experimenting with various psi techniques i found an interesting pattern.  I noticed that if i concentrate hard enough i seem to have changed the reality of that space, where what i visualized is then possible.  For example, i used to practice psychokinesis in a certain deserted bathroom at my college.  I used to concentrate on moving the water in the toilets.  This was reccomended to me by a person very strong in psychokinesis.  Anyways, one day i actually did it, and the water looked like it had been punched.  It scared me to death, but my point is, everytime before that the water did nothing, but after that first time, i could go in that bathroom and vaguely think about it and the water would move.  
<br />

<br />
Another example is when i was reading about physical mediums (people that can manifests spirits) and while reading about a certain medium, the things i was reading became real in front of me (metaphorically speaking.. it was as real as you can get by way of imagination)  and then i heard knocking on my walls, and a sound like someone snapping their fingers.   Long story short, after that incident, now those very same knocks and taps happen at all times of the day.  Even other people besides me have heard it and were baffled.  
<br />

<br />
My theory is that something is imprinted on the reality of the location and then exists there like a ghost.   In fact i think this is exactly what ghosts are in the first place.  
<br />

<br />
Now, does anyone think that this can be done purposefully? I think it would be an excellent technique if it could be mastered.

This is one very interesting matter to say the least and it seems like one to definetly research and test deeper into, I must say it has piqued my interest. So given that, a favor, if you would? Could you detail your visualization technique, the exact way you were trying to move the water. Also any feelings or other things you had the moment it happened, the fist thing. As for the knocking and snapping thing, i'm unsure. Though, despite the uncertainity it would be appretiated if you could do such, if true this seems to prime a thing to just let slide, that much i'm sure.

I believe you are making those noises subconsciously. It is just like poltergeisting. And like you said about the water, you only had to vaguely think about it, and the water moved. Same thing is going on in your room, though perhaps you don't even have to think about it. But I really believe you are making these noises. Try to controll them if you wish.

			well, basically what happens is hard to describe.  You know that base feeling you have of the reality you are in?  well it kind of shifts, like something seems off for a second, then it shifts.  I have had other experiences of it, it was like my subconscious say &quot;OK, if thats what you want&quot; and does it without me thinking.  I know one thing for sure, in all of those cases, my conscious mind was completely nonexistant.  maybe it just missed blocking it or something.  There was no thinking, no analyzing, just imagination, then reality.  Ok typing this out gave me alot of ideas to experiment with.  Z

			Good, as it has given me a sliver of understanding on this in which I can conduct a few tests. This may be a good boost technique or feeling to search for to help aid in my psionic progress, oh and thank you for the information.

			Yes I believe ghosts are merely psychic phenomena or imprints as u said. These such things could be merely replays or &quot;psychic machines&quot; like constructs that are meant to do certain things. Like react to certain emotions etc etc. These constructs could be accidentally made when... well basically when whenever. They could be made subconsciously whenever.
<br />

<br />
Replays, as in replays of a certain incident in which a person found cataclysmic or extremely emotional, and then that incident would be imprinted. And deducing from the fact that it is a contruct or imrpint, you could basically just as easily remove it.
