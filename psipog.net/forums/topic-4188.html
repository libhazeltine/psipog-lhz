<br />

<br />
i would all so like to know if waight comes in to moveing things while moveing it can you feel the waight in your hand or is it just harder to move heavy things
<br />

<br />
and can/has any one ever levitated things and is there any camara footige of this 
<br />

<br />
all so how mutch time did you take to try and move things befor you first did and how old were you

			I'm 16, and while I haven't moved anything myself, I do believe that psychokinesis could be possible. I'm interested in figuring out what could be behind PK (beyond just the general descriptor &quot;psi&quot; <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> ). I've got a few theories, but they aren't quite complete enough to post yet. Perhaps I shall at some point...
<br />

<br />
In any case, I believe in empathic telepathy, since I've experienced that first hand numerous times both today and in the past...
<br />

<br />
To the best of my knowledge, most PK is quite small-scale, so evidently whatever it is isn't particularly strong, though there are reports of levitation and movement of large objects like couches, cars, etc., so there must be a few who can somehow amplify the effect, whatever it is.
<br />
 
<br />
If I were you, I wouldn't believe the levitation vids until you've done it yourself... it's actually quite easy to fake. Check out the Criss Angel thread for a demonstration of that...

I dont' get this one <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. If you mean if there's weight envolved, well I think that's just an illusion but yes it's harder to move stuff that's heavier. That's why you have to train on a psi-wheel first because it's easier to affect it.

Of this I am unsure, there may be footage about it but there's no way of proving they're not just faked.

I was about 15 when I first tried PK. Before anything moved at all, it took me like a couple of months. Then it kept on getting easier and easier. Then when I showed it to a friend he could do it almost instantenously grrr. It appears to be much easier if someone shows you the thing first. Then your mind stops resisting I guess.

It is just like moving something normally, the heavier it is, the harder it is to move.

			if you move something with tk ,you will feel nothing but if you use negative energy to do tk like using angry and tensetion you will pain youself while doing tk and after while after you finished you will pain in brain or other place that you tensed it .
<br />

<br />
i levitated carpet instead i levitate stick , why that happened because i used negative energy , i tensed my brain , my body and got alot of shivers all my body and i blured my eyesight and i dont recommend you to do so and dont use negative energy because it will make your aura in bad state and it will take little long time to make it become good again. but i dont have video to that levitation, i levitated bubble before but it might not me it might be hot air in the shower but i still know that i done it because it was falling down and i made it go back to up for 5 seconds.
<br />

<br />
i know that i can make tk when i made the psi wheel because when i tried i succeded and done tk and make it spin for 50 degree .
<br />

<br />
but i find out that i need to be in state to do tk , the important thing that you need to do is clear your mind from all thoughts , dont make any thought disturb you while you tring or doing tk only the thought you need that imaging the psi wheel going to spin and dont give that imagination alot of efforts or it will be like the other thoughts ( disturbing you ), i mean be relaxed and clear your mind from anything and try to spin the psi wheel with little thoughts that will not disturb you and dont get you out from that state.

You never need the hands, but no, you don't feel the weight on your hands..at least by my experiences. Is it harder if it's heavier? I don't know, I can't tell you a exact answer without science, but I can slide bigger, heavier objects then the pin-wheel and I can't even spin it.

			Ok dude i could barely understand that first paragraph (it was very painful) because it was all one sentance with no punctuation! AND TYPOES! Jeez. Uh, i was 13 when i moved the pinwheel for the first time, I'm 13 now, and it took me 45 minutes of practice (first day, 3, 15 minute sessions. end of 3rd session).

well i have just made a psiwheel kind of any way i used easter egg tin foil and a stud up pen to pu it on and i sat there trying to clear my mind but all i could here was these dam birds sinning and i could not blank them out but then i thought is sound psi energy is sound a part of one i thought yes evry thing is but still could not blank them out butthen i thought shut up birds and mutch to my saprise they did  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> so i concentrated hard and it began to move slowly then got abit faster it was makeing a full turn about every 20 seconds i know its slow but its a start but i think i over did it as i now have chest pains <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />  and i cant get it to move again is this comon for first timers or has some thing gone rong i must have been sat here 2 hours and the articul says about 40 mins max a time is this why i have chest pains
