			When i was 7, i was in the car, being driven home, roughly 6 or 7 miles from my house. When i (completely out of the blue) said, &quot;Mum, i think the phones ringing&quot;, as i got one of those feelings i get. So, my mum noted the time i said it, and when we got home, the phone had rung, at the precise time i said it was ringing, there was absolutely no way of knowing it was ringing while in the car. Ive had several other Psionic acts during my childhood, but almost all of them were precognitions. I have photos of me in 1999, or 1998, i forget, standing next to a picture i made of the twin towers burning with a plane lodged in the side, with fire engines and loads of people running around. I didnt know about the significance of this photo until i found it recently, it still scares me. I sometimes have these overwhelming feelings that something bad is going to happen, i told my friend that something very very bad was going to happen to his health, next day, he was diagnosed with kidney cancer. Another one of these bad feelings came suddenly one day, and completely overwhelmed me, i knew something was wrong, as i know what it feels like when something is wrong, a few hours later, the space shuttle columbia broke up. I have many more of these stories, but the memories are painful. Do not ask for them.

I can't say I ever had any psychic events happen to me other than maybe (I'm not sure about this) I had a dream about something I did the next day, but the dream might have been after.

			Only thing was with Pk, and i'm not even sure what happened
<br />

<br />
I was determined to have PK powers, so i'd try and try to move a ball.  I was like 6 or some thing.  Just started preschool.  SO i'd put it on my dresser and try and roll it.  I'd go to preschool and i'd cme home and it'd be onthe floor or onthe other side of the room or just not where i put it.  Idk if it was me though.  I dont see what might have moved it otherwise

			i got tons of precogs as a kid. had one every 3 weeks or so in the form of a dream. i'd wake up thinking it was very real, and the exact same sequences of events would occur anywhere from that day to half a year later!

it really freaked me out, and still kinda does. wish i could control it and know when things were going to happen though...

			i think this is a nice topic lol...
<br />

<br />
seeing demons when i was younger seemed to be my biggest problem... besides for the precog dreams. when i was younger, i guess its called electrokinesis... was my main thing that always happened... although, since i was being abused at that time, my guides supressed it when i got upset or angry so i didnt hurt anyone(not just the electrokinesis, just all the psionics in general)... but if i was calm and willfully  tried to create it, then it would happen... and im sure alot would say static electricity... but thats blue, all the sparks i created were pink for whatever reason... although, now, they arnt pink anymore, they are white... 
<br />

<br />
i healed my cat after he got hit by a deisel ... hes the same age as me and still living which he is 19... he was born july 4th 1987 and i was born january 1st 1987 <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  when i was 10, i sat on my bed talking to a little girl the same age as me that died on the oregon trail.
<br />

<br />
lets see, what else... think thats about it without getting into major detail about what all i did when i was between the ages of 2-11
