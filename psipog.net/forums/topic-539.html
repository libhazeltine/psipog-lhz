			to quote another post written by PsykillerX:

<br />
&quot;Im stoned leave me alone&quot; or that was the general jist.
<br />

<br />

<br />
but then again i also have tried &quot;calving&quot; psi into objects such as swords to see what would happen.  its worked on a few occasions and i suppose its just another construct really.  So whatever floats your boat.
<br />

<br />
but really.  do you think we live in a time of the crusades?
<br />

Experiment fine but your attention would be better served elsewhere.

wow, thats pretty special. stand like a cross??? what is that supposed to do, apart from representing a very comical target. if you want to focus energy and launch it, do so. no random posing nesacary. wether you area able to do anything noticeable with the energy launched is another matter.

thats stupid to be honest. psi-swords, are covered in other topics, i wont even bother talking about them here. but this makes me laugh.

<br />
wow. why bother making a psi shotgun. not only am i disbeliving that you were able to, and also disbeliving that you can visualise in your head exactly the working mechanisms of a shotgun, but its just dumb. why bother making a psi shotgun? you waste so much energey creating a gun that does nothing. just launch shards of energy at something if you really want to, why bother making a shotgun exept for posing factor.

<br />
mildily disturbing. even if you can create a sword that does anything apart from look pretty (which most dont cause flaring is tough), swords arent compared on their size. &quot;mines bigger than yours&quot; doesnt apply here. you sound like you would know nothing of how to use any kind of sword, mental or physical. so make em as big as you like, it doesnt do much for you.

<br />

<br />
this is the only one even close to making sense. even then: why bother with all this wierd posing stuff. if you want to shoot energy at someone, just do it!
<br />

<br />

<br />
of course the tone of this post gives me the impression that you arent serious about any of this. psi cant be used to make special anime style duels. id either consider going off and maturing before you use this board, or sitting down and learning how to use psi for useful things like telekenisis.
