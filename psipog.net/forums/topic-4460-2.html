			I'll say the same thing I've said in many other topics with far out ideas like this.
<br />

<br />
It's possible, but you'd have to be so good that nobody will ever be able to accomplish it. Some people can't send a psiball to someone over the internet. How could anybody possibly be able to encompass the entire earth in a shield?
<br />

<br />
Besides, psi doesn't enter earth from outer space or something. It's already here. You'd have to make a shield that draws all the psionic energy out of the earth and forces it into space, and blocks it from coming back in.

			In the process you'd probably get overloaded and die. Trying to move that much energy is like holding a piece of uranium and two wires in your mouth and wearing a sign saying: I'm a human nuclear reactor!

opee, He already did.  Around the time of the destruction of the First Temple in Israel in the year 586 BCE.  Look at records of spiritual movements in History.  You will see that spiritual things all around the world stopped happening soon after that time.
<br />

<br />
Things stopped completely after the destruction of the Second Temple in Israel in the year 70 CE.
<br />

<br />
What we have now in spirituality is just like an echo of what things were, also we can only reach the lower spiritual worlds in the world today and not the upper spiritual worlds.  We are completely cut off.

			Actually, shields of that size aren't terribly energy consuming because creating such a field simply requires the expertise to create it and that the psion programs the shield to draw from ley lines.  With a shield that big you could tie to every ley line on Earth, so energy is hardly a problem.  Whether many people here could actually succeed at building something that complex though is questionable.  Basically, it's not the size that matters, it's how you use it <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Well, actually, there's not really scientific evidence that humans influance things such as holes in the ozone or global warming or anything of that sort.

			Ya lets all get together at PsiPog HQ and charge our psi and make a shield around the earth preventing us from using our abilites... that way we could prove Psi is real... /sarcasm
<br />

<br />
Now onto my real thing, I think it really could happen if enough people tried.  But it would take like millions.

			it's possible.. so this sheild is like a nullifier? it neutralizes all psi abilities?  hmmm, why do that? and if someone makes it.. wouldn't that someone be affected as well since that someone also uses psi? just a thought.. 
<br />

<br />
oh, and bout the ozone layer.. yeah, it is thinning rapidly.. but, actually it won't run out.. ozone is produced when there is lightning.. but the problem is us, the humans, who cause pollution.. where we use freons, found in refrigerants and air conditioners, CO produced by cars or motorcycles... so yeah we're the cause of it all.. and no need of scientific evidence to proove it.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Anyone else see how paradoxical this idea is?  You make a shield to nullify psionic powers WITH psionics.  If you make the shield that big, then it's ineffective because as soon as you created it at any size it should have at least affected YOU.  Or it could be effective in which case you'll only be able to just start making it because it's very existence will stop you from making it any larger lol.

			Hi,
<br />
   Been sometime since I posted on Psipog. This thread sparked my interest. Humans ARE the cause of the ozone holes and all. Ozone is produced by lightning. But certain compounds like CFC (Chloro-flouro-carbons ) destroy Ozone at a much higher rate than its created. The CFC in the stratosphere will form highly reactive chlorine (Cl) radicals due to the ultraviolet rays from the sun. These then act as catalysts to convert ozone back to oxygen . A single Cl Atom can destroy thousands of ozone molecules. Other than that, CFC has a lifespan of some 100 years. See this page:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon#Environmental_issues" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon#Environmental_issues</a> 
<br />

<br />
  About the idea of nullifying psionics, maybe... if Lex Luther found out about this, he would probably try something  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  .
<br />

<br />

			About the ozone and greenhouse thing...
<br />

<br />
One volcanic eruption puts more harmful gases into the air than we produce in a year. Nature is killing itself.
<br />

<br />
Also, the surface area of earth is aprox. 1015 ? 0.510 m2. No one Psion, or even a million Psion could erect a sheild that large. And even if we had that many Psion, would their combined energies mesh to create a suitable sheild? 
<br />

<br />
Giant Earth-covering sheild? Unlikely...
