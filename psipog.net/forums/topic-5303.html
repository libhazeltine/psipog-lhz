			heh, I was looking for a scan me thread for some practice and I tried this before I realized I already tried before... but whatever, this time it's more detailed:
<br />

<br />
for the name I got &quot;d&quot; something maybe dylan. For first name
<br />

<br />
you're east of me. I'm in Kansas. Maybe you're on the west coast, or near the ocean but not right up next to the ocean. I'd say you live in a white house in a city that is not that big but is a fair sized city.
<br />

<br />
You have a dog, maybe 2. I think brown or gold
<br />

<br />
you're interested in pk and you have tried psiballs, think they're cool. Maybe clairavoyance interest? I know I spelled that wrong
<br />

<br />
for favorite color, maybe blue or brown.

Location: You're SE of me, a fair distance away (i'm in kansas). I'd say that you aren't that close to ocean but you're not too far away. I also thought of desert or at least heat and maybe sand, are you in australia? I know you're south-east of me, anyway.
<br />

<br />
You: I think that you may have one cat or no pets at all. Maybe Alex for name? Justin? Dustin? No, those weren't random guesses, lol  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> . I got an image of you either having sort of long, brown hair or maybe black, short spiked hair? I think green eyes and I saw a black shirt. You like pk and lucid dreaming. also, maybe clairavoyance. For your favorite music, I'd say punk or metal or rock. Something like that. I'd say you're 13-15, maybe 16 but doubtful on that. Taller than average height, but not too much.

Cool! Some things far away but some things right! I have indeed green eyes and i think in the last days i was wearing a black shirt. Southeast of you was right, too. But not Australia, in fact i live in Germany. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> The rest you say is wrong. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

Man i'd like to  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> be able to do this stuff too. It's cool.

You're South of me, maybe a little West.

Maybe a March or August b-day but I think the March is from another scan I did, so I'm going with a fall/summer birthday, probably august or september.

You're interested in constructs/psiballs mainly. And you're interested in clairavoyance but not really experienced. But you think it's neat. Kind of a &quot;meh&quot; on pk, I think that you can move the psiwheel a little, but it doesn't really captivate you.
<br />
I'd say you're 16, maybe 17 and a junior in highschool.
<br />
You have a dog.

Black or very dark hair. I saw greasy or gelled hair, sort of? And I saw a blue or black shirt.

Tall or above average height.
