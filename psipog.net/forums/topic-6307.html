			Got in another O.B.E. attempt last night, which I haven't properly done for quite a while. I got to the vibrations stage, my heart chakra beating fast, short of breath, etc. I tried to remain calm and breathe normally, basically ignore the vibrations. At that point, the vibrations started to die down a bit, but my eyelids started to flutter. After reading about how looking up (with your eyes still closed) increased the vibrations, I did that, and my eyes started fluttering like crazy. Anyway, the vibrations died out, and then.... nothing. Now, did I just get too excited (as what's happened a few times before), or was something else supposed to happen? I thought I messed it up, so gave up for the night.

That's funny you say this because I too made it to this stage, for the first time last night. I did not experience an OBE either but I'm just commenting about your comment, &quot;looking up with eyes closed&quot;, because I've never heard of it before. Yet I discovered this on my own, and found it works better for me to actually cross my eyes for a second or two, when my eyes are closed. Doing this helps me get to the spins very fast. It also helps me to imagine looking at myself in the 3rd person at the time, and imagine seeing a &quot;spiritual me&quot; rising/rolling out of my body. That gets me to the spins and vibs fast, then I try to go clear headed. See if it works for you.
<br />
How could you have done somthing wrong. If you were calm, breathing correctly, and clear of mind then everything sounds right. Nothing left to do after that but keep trying and have patience, as will I.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

Good Luck
