			Well, I'm dabbling around trying things out, and I've got a few questions I'd like to ask about psiballs.
<br />

<br />

<br />
1)Which in your opinion is the best way of making Psi balls.
<br />

<br />
2)'ve tried and I've had a tingling and tension in my hand I am drawing a swirl on with my mind using this method: <a href="../art-psiballs-tactile-method.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.psipog.net/show.php?cmd=wp&amp;id=19</a> - am I doing it right?
<br />

<br />
3)With this method: <a href="../art-psiballs-tactile-method.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.psipog.net/show.php?cmd=wp&amp;id=19</a>, do you need to visualize a lot and of a planet/sun? Because I find it easiest to visualize energy coming from inside me, if anything at all.
<br />

<br />
4)What should a Psi ball feel like?
<br />

<br />
5)I've got as far as the energy beginning to swirl in my hands for the first method and I can't really do much else - any ideas on how to help be create them?
<br />

<br />
6)Is it good to use this as a meditation technique, as mainly that's what I've been doing it for so far.
<br />

<br />
Thanks
<br />

			1) The 1 that's most comfortable for you <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
2) If you feel the psi ball...Yeah your doing right.
<br />

<br />
3) You don't need to visualise at all <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
4) Hot/Cold/tingly/2 magnets pushing your hands outwards...that's what i get (And always a combination of the last 2 ).But i'm not sure if it's the same for everyone
<br />

<br />
5) I visiualize that the energy gathered in my hands goes to a ball wich gets bigger/denser.
<br />

<br />
6) It shouldn't do harm...i think <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
I hope i helped you <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I agree with pretty much everything dutchlike said but I will add some &quot;stuff&quot; anyways
<br />

<br />
1. It took me forever to find a way to make one and finally Iolair who can be found on this forum, gave me a method that I use most often.  All the credit goes to him (unless he got it from somewhere) I visualize and large fire on the ground and I am standing in it.  I visualize it coming up to my knees.  I then &quot;see&quot; it seep into my feet and then go all the way through my body.  This gives a nice warm feeling.  Then I visualize it balling inbetween my hands.  This might or might not work for you.  I took acouple of weeks before I found a method that worked for me so just keep trying!
<br />

<br />
2.  I have nothing to add to waht dutchlike said on this question
<br />

<br />
3.  I dont really agree that you DONT need to visualize anything.  I think that you have to visualize something but I dont visualize it coming from a planet.  I just use the method that I said in 1. 
<br />

<br />
4.  It should feel like what it feels like lol.  The point is, dont think that it should feel like something becuase you can trick you mind into thinking it feels like something.  Just be receptive to waht it feels like.
<br />

<br />
5.  Visualize it balling and getting bigger.  Not much else to say. 
<br />

<br />
6.  Use what as meditation.  A psi ball.  If so, I could think of easier ways to meditate.
<br />

<br />
Hope this helps!
<br />

Oh hey!

<br />
I'm not so sure about the Psi balls still though, it seems like mind tricks, though they feel nice...

Thanks for the answers everyone.
