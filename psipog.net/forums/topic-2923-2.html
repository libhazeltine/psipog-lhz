			It's just based on statistics and general comments.  Nothing particularly magical here.  Actually 98% of it was wrong for me.  It's like a horrorscope: the writer makes general comments that cover most eventualities, and can then be sure that lots of people will fit it to their own circumstances.  I also noted just how cheesy the author's writing style is.  I'm not impressed. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Only put your middle name if it means somthing to you.  Like for me, it's my mom's madain name and we all love it and are proud of it because it's wierd and unique.  So if it means something to you put it.  With out my middle it was wrong, by alot.

It's seems to work, but idk.  Ppl change

			wow!

<br />
&quot;You work well with people, and have the potential to inspire. This suggests that you could successfully teach or counsel.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sounds familiar
<br />

<br />
&quot;You like to help others as you were intended to be the 'big brother or big sister' type.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Yup
<br />

<br />
&quot;Often, the excessive 3 energy produces non-stop talkers. Everyone has faults, but the 3 soul urge doesn't appreciate having these pointed out.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Thats sometimes true
<br />

<br />
&quot;You dream of guiding and fostering the perfect family in the perfect home. You crave the devotion from offspring and a loving spouse. You picture yourself in the center of a successful domestic unit.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sure.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Undeveloped or ignored, the negative side of the 9 expression can be very selfish and self-centered. If you do not actively involve yourself with work that benefits others, you may tend to express just the opposite characteristics. It is your role to be very involved with other people and their needs, but it may be difficult for you achieve this role. Aloofness, lack of involvement, and a lack of sensitivity mark the low road of this expression.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Ha ha!  They have met me!
<br />

<br />
Pretty good i say!

			I see how this is done...
<br />

<br />
by surveying groups of people, they find a common medium within name numbers and place descriptions of the people they find on there. the reason why it is so accurate is because it is so general. it covers a large base. 
<br />

<br />
how this connects with people's names is that the name can reflect (CAN) the person whom it is intended to be.think of any name and put a face and personality to it.
<br />

<br />
for instance: hank tumberland. i see a businessman.
<br />

<br />
also: Marv Ballscratcher.
<br />

<br />
no need to describe him.

			When i was little i had a small theory about names.
<br />

<br />
Names make personalities.  Like if your named andrew, your prossibly going to be a unsure of yourself.  Steven-very unique.  John-a dick possibly, able to over come with flying colors though.  Idk why but thats just what i thought when i was little.  So if your named something bold like Vince or Daren, your going to be bold.  maybe somthing like that??

			It's all mathematical, it counts the letters in your name, then the vowels, then the consonants, and so forth. Then from there it uses different equations to come up with its gay made up terms such as &quot;Dream number&quot; and &quot;Soul Urge number.&quot; 
<br />
3 vowels = Your Soul Urge number is: 3 
<br />
6 consonants =The expression or destiny for #6
<br />
It means nothing! They just have some stuff written down for certain numbers and then when you have one of those numbers in your name it uses it.
