			Last night I tried some Psychokenisis. Psi is relatively new to me and I've only been really practising in the last couple of days, and this practise wasn't long.
<br />

<br />
Well, last night, I did Psychokinesis. The Psi wheel. I did it a couple of times. I got rather excited when it started spinning and lost concentration and stopped. I'm rather skeptical and to make sure it wasn't just wind or my breath, I observed it and made sure all my breath could not affect it.
<br />

<br />
I'm almost positive I did it. Though, I'm amazed at my progress. It usually takes weeks of practise doesn't it?
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I've done a small ammount of practise here and there since and nothing's happened, but those little practise sessions lasted little over a minute.

			It differs with the person. It took me 2 weeks beofre I could spin the psi wheel, and now look at me. I am rolling cans and slightly sliding straws. Everyone is different with their progress. The reason everyone is different, is because we are all like snowflakes. ; )

			Don't get your ego buffed, in two weeks of trying, I could slide objects.

So, it's normal.

You know, The pin-wheel isn't truly a fact ,that it's for beginners. 
<br />

<br />
Nice job, anyhow.

			I wasnt getting an ego, I said I could spin the PSI WHEEL in 2 weeks. After a couple months I could roll. Your getting your buffed by saying you could slide in 2 weeks. Maybe you should chill out.

Why does people think that I'm talking to them when I'm talking to the other!
<br />

<br />
Damn it, I really need to specify to those I'm talking towards.
<br />

<br />
I was talking to psianide since he's new in this, He shouldn't get the ideal he's better then every one else, not saying he is or not, just saying that she shouldn't....if that makes sense.
<br />

<br />
Plus I used it to back up the whole, normal thing.

			congrats <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  I read that emotions can affect how you perform pk.Try not to get excited and pretend that you know the psiwheel is supposed to do that and just keep going.Just think its an old movie and that you know what is going to happen.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			It's not abnormal that you did it that quick pisanide, I did it in a couple days too. Although I can understand the suspicion (sp???) that can arrise from it being that quick, but when I did it, I didn't care if it was me or not, I was just so happy that it moved with me not knowing how it happened.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />
