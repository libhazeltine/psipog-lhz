			Because they fracture and break, its even harder trying to unbend a spoon thats bent, rather than bending an unbent spoon, and if i kept bending and unbending just one spoon, what souvenirs would i have? I have some quite interesting ones.

			yeah, it takes 850 pounds of force to break silverwear...haha  I've never done it before, nor have i tried unbending my one fork.

Here's a video of a guy pulling a spoon apart.

That guy is my hero!  lol  And to what pepsiboy said.  Most of the 17000 people jack taught were complete newbs, so it's easily possible to just bend a spoon outa no where.

			i did not say it was not possible i simply said that i personally doubt it without having to write out the word personally.
<br />

<br />
simply put the people WERE n00bzorz they didnt know that it was even possible, so they had no actual GOAL because they didnt think it would happen. u know? maybe they did have a goal who knows? but the point is.. they didnt have a buncha articles on psipog as background info on all this mind over matter shit, they simply just did it. with the guys help of course, he  had to have helped them in some way, otherwise they [all of the sucessfull benders] would have been able to do it alone.

			Well, everybody has a lil bit of talent in Pk to start with, everyone could probably just start rolling things just dont know how to.  It's that everything about these PK parties, is conductive for bending.

It's really interesting

			lol, sorry about that.
<br />

<br />
My Method:
<br />
Its very short and simple, but requires time, patience and a clear and focussed mind.
<br />
Step 1. Lie down, get yourself relaxed, take deep breathes and clear your mind.
<br />
Step 2. Hold the neck of the spoon between index finger and thumb whilst still relaxing.
<br />
Step 3. Whereas you used energy to move the psiwheel, you must put lots and lots of energy into the spoon.
<br />
Step 4. When you feel the energy 'wanting' to burst out of the spoon, take it in both hands and bend it, do not apply much physical force at all, because the chances are it wont bend, you will loose concentration, and have to start over, just give it a little 'try' every now and again when you feel the energy pulsing through the spoon, if you keep giving it tries and it doesnt want to bend or even go soft, put more and more energy into it until you feel that it will bend.
<br />

<br />
Im currently working on just bending the spoon with my mind now, no hands involved whatsoever, just put the spoon on the desk and bend it, im making slow progress.
<br />
I hope this method will make many more spoon benders out of the people on psipog.
<br />
After doing this spoon excercise, i have found that my initial Tk, and remote viewing abilities to be greatly increased.
<br />
If the spoon doesnt bend no matter how hard you try, all it takes is practice, practice for a week or 2, until you feel that the spoon really wants to bend.

			I dont use energy for my TK, i do something closer to &quot;just do it&quot;. Would i then just put psionic energy in general into it, or should i learn the other way of telekinesis that you mentioned. Its really not much of a hastle for me to learn the other way if thats what i probably should do, but I also do not want to waste time. 
<br />

<br />
Sorry for PMing this too, i was out for the hour and thought i was going to log off.
