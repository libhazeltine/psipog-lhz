			I would like to believe that there is some way to shield a living space to keep the mental projections of others out (not necessarily keep psions from contact but the everyday &quot;sounds&quot;). I mean this in two ways that a person can form a construct themselves around a space to keep relative calm in an area and that there is a material that can do this naturally to block out all the sounds beyond normal earshot. When I say sound I mean anything emotions, thoughts, and other things that we as psions may &quot;hear&quot;. I'd like feed back what do you guys think? Is it possible? If so how would it be done?
<br />

<br />
I think that it'd be similar to forming a shield except you projecting it to surround a bigger area (for energy shielding).
<br />

<br />
As for material shielding I don't think it's impossible to find a substance to keep out &quot;sound&quot;. If there was such a substance in existance would you want to use it somewhere in your home? I know I'd like to use it for my bedroom, some people in my house can get quite irratated and I'd like to remove my shields and be able to have a private sanctuary.

			i have a constuct that a carry with me that is supposted to disrupt psi use unless i say so, i suppose you could make one that will make a feild of &quot;anti-emotions&quot; or whatever you wanted(a feild would negate anything inside it, a sheild would just block something that tried to go though it.)
<br />
about the sound, it feqires a medium, and so a pair of thin force bubble sheilds with a vacumme between them would work perfectly (or it could be placed around a room, or right next to the walls)

			Soundproofing something is a decently complex task, but not a real psionic topic, if you are looking for more information, you can check this out:  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_15992_soundproof-room.html" target="_blank">http://www.ehow.com/how_15992_soundproof-room.html</a>
<br />

<br />
As far as psionically shielding (against mental 'sounds') a room, the technique for making the shield is basically the same as a normal shield.  The alterations that you may want to include are:
<br />
bigger (duh)
<br />
source to draw from or a very strong shell (assuming that this is supposed to be permanent)
<br />
make sure that it is set to stay wherever it is (bind parts of the construct to the walls, ground, roof, whatever).

I didn't mean soundproof I meant if there was an actual material that could block psionic waves or certain &quot;sounds&quot; only we could hear. I'm sorry for the lack of clarification next time I'll be more specific. I was wondering if anyone had even heard a rumor of such a thing. It would benefit most psions I know I'd like an actual material you could use that you didn't have to renew energy all the time.

			oh, in that case...hmmm.....Crystals are usually said to distort psionic energies, perhaps you could integrate a construct into a series of crystals.  But that isn't my area of expertice.  Faraday cages are supposed to hinder telepathic abilities.  This is a cage of wire with electric current running through it, but that isn't exactly ideal for a room...
<br />

<br />
Other than that, anyone else have any ideas?

			I make sheilds around my room all the time when I feel the need to. It takes a little more visualization, I think, but it's simple enough to do. I've never made a permenent sheild, though. For something to last; I'd stick to defensively charged (or programmed, I guess you could call it?) talismans, charms, and/or crystals.

			Like I said in my hello post, I'm a bit of a &quot;wilder&quot; in the sense that my constructs and such have been mostly improvised.  I built a shield from a bonsai ficas tree I keep in my dorm room... kind of magnified the energies I felt in the the tree and walled off my room with it.  It makes my room very peaceful because it blocks &quot;thought pollution&quot; (I'm not sure what you all prefer to call it, but the random thoughts normal people broadcast when they're emotionally unstable) from a dorm of seventy guys... sitting in my room is like being out in the middle of a forest alone.  It's very peaceful, and nice when I miss our forests back home.
<br />

<br />
The shield should last as long as the tree survives, or until I mess it up with  something else... it's stayed strong for about two months and my &quot;sensitive&quot; friends still comment on it even if they don't see the tree.
<br />

<br />
I have a piece of labradorite (blue-green silicate stone, egg-shaped) that I've centered dozens of shields on, and I just stretch them out a bit when I set the stone down.  I usually carry it with me and keep the shields small, but I surround my room with them when I take it out of my pocket.  I'm not sure how great an idea it is to bind them to a stone, though, as I feel more vulnerable when I have to recreate the shields because I've left the stone at home, etc.

			I already shield my house from negative thoughts and energys, i did this along time ago, 2 yrs ago i belive and check on it everynow and then when i am mediitating or using my tech that i posted, just o check its still there and the energy source ahsnt been disrupted. (that may sound stupid but i somehow know its gone if its not there). TO establish the area shield i used the same kind of technique you would do to shield yourself, i then powered this shield by the sun, since i belive that the sun is a unlimited power source. I think personally that this shield works, but its a matter of opinoion, if its not actually doing something, its doing something on a psycological scale for me <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />, gives me a sense of protection.
