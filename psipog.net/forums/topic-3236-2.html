			Sorry to burst your bubble... but he's an illusionist.  A lot of people use the logic that, &quot;If I can't figure out how the illusion is done, then it must be real!&quot;  This is terribly flawed logic.  Magicians create illusions with the sole purpose that you can't figure them out.  And they can be very ingenious.  Also, a lot of times they'll edit the final broadcast, so that you DON'T EVEN SEE the &quot;dirty work&quot;.  They'll cut to an expression on someone's face, then cut back to the illusion, and now you can't put the entire thing together to understand what is going on.  They'll hire people to stand in certain positions and pretend that they're just normal people, but really they are either blocking a sensative angle, or part of the trick itself.

			Next time read my whoel posts! I said he did it in shorts! That levitation requires special pants! If you can find out any way he pushed down a 100 foot tall palm tree I will believe you guys. Don't shoot it down, the whole point of his show is that you have to find out whats real and hats illusion.
<br />
Watch the show before you be a critic/skeptic.

			Your delusion makes me laugh. I have seen his show. Entertaining, but fake. Of course he is going to say he believes in Telekinesis and Levitation. He wouldnt be a very good magician if he said &quot; I dont believe in energy, its all illusions&quot;. Just because you met him, doesnt make him the real deal. If he was, he shouldve been trying to teach people, not trying to make them buy it on a website. You're just a blind fan with no proof that he is the real deal. He sells the tricks on his website. Nuff said.

			Once again, the fact that he was wearing shorts only means that he was doing a different trick. Remember, the <span style="font-weight: bold">entire</span> point of preformance magic, is that veiwers will not be able to tell how it's done. The fact that you can't think of an explaination doesn't make it real, it only means that he's a very clever illusionist.
<br />

<br />
Pushing a palmtree is probably a case mind over body. The human body is capable of very impressive feats of strength when it needs to. With a focused mind and a healthy body, you can push your muscles to the max (note that doing this too often would be very unhealthy for you).
<br />

<br />
So yes, Criss has some skills. He can suspend himself by hooks, lift up the front end of a taxi, and push a palm tree. These are very impressive skills, but there is absolutely nothing psychic about them.

			I love his show, it's sooo cool. About him making the light bulb light up, it's a gimmic in his hands. My friend is a magician also, and he works in a magic shop. He showed me that trick, although he never showed me the gimmick (he's into the &quot;magicians never reveal their secrets, even to their friends&quot;) It was a cool trick. It's all about the quickness of the hands and ofcourse misdirection. 
<br />

<br />
When he floated, I don't think it was real. 
<br />

<br />
1) Usually, when he performs a big stunt, there are alot of people watching, and this time there were only about 10. They could all be part of his staff, or hired people, heck, he might even be behind a green screen for all we know. 
<br />

<br />
2) If he could really levitate him self like that, he would levitate on the ground and go up like 10 feet and go to another spot 20 feet away and come down, with alot of people around him watching. I also thought that he was real, only because I wanted him to be real, that was the only proof I had that PK was real. When I was able to move the psiwheel, I had my own proof. And my theories of him changed.

Well, I saw that on tv on wednesday, and there were only 5 to 6 people on the ground, and I think like 4 to 5 people on the roof and one of them was holding a spov camera. There were no 150 people, maybe on the dvd there were, but I didn't watch the dvd. Why can't those spectators be hired to stand there?
<br />
I'm sure everyone has heard on the news along time ago that David Blaine was fake. Do you remember in season one of Criss Angel, he levitated like 5 to 6 feet in the air and came back down, David Blaine did the same thing. Now, if you're saying that David Blaine knows PK also, then, waow, I guess alot of magicians nowadays have skills in Psionics.
<br />

<br />

<br />
You can't just say that &quot;O, the buildings were 50 feet apart, it must be real.&quot; or &quot;He was wearing shorts when he levitated.&quot; What does shorts have to do with livitation? Some levatation might require you to wear pants, but..... you know what I mean?

You sound like a person that &quot;really&quot; wants Criss Angel to be real. Look at all the facts before making your decision. There is a much bigger percent chance that it's fake.

Sure because if I met him and he's a nice guy. Plus &quot;thinking&quot; or &quot;knowing&quot; that he can levitate inspires me and really helps me in PK. Since his show started My develpoment in PK has increased dramatically.

I used to be like that also. If I saw someone do something, and I thought it was cool, that inspired me to do it aswell.
<br />

<br />
Let's look at this scenerio: Let's say that Criss Angel inspires you, and by all means there is nothing wrong with that! But, let's say that he inspires you because he can levitate an object, and you start to practice right away. One day you're searching for Criss Angel videos online (it could be another way), and you find a video of Criss Angel revealing how he levitated the object. Now, what's going through your mind? &quot;He is fake, he was never real.&quot; So, then you think that PK isn't real.
<br />

<br />
In conclusion, what I'm trying to say is that don't let a person that you think can do PK &quot;ESPECIALLY&quot; if he is a professional illusionist (that's their job, to trick and make people think they have supernatural powers)inspire you, unless you were there and you are % 110 positive that it was real.
<br />

<br />
Criss Angel inspires me also, but not to the extent that if I found out he was fake in PK and then I would think PK is not real.
