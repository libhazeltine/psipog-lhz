			Actually, yes. Me and a friend both had some experience in constructs, if nothing more than a couple months practice, and tried what you described.
<br />

<br />
He made a sugar glider, and I made a monkey... nothing too complex. All my monkey was supposed to do was draw energy from anything around it (me  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ) and try to dissipate the sugar glider by passing through it with a higher concentration of energy.
<br />

<br />
He tried something similar, but it was more in tune with destabilizing the programming of my monkey than the psionic energy itself.
<br />

<br />
-----------------------
<br />

<br />
In the end, we honestly weren't sure who won. My monkey stopped trying to dissipate the glider after awhile, and I couldn't even tell where his glider was (he kept saying it was still hovering around somewhere, but I'm not sure I believe him). So... yeah. I'd like to say I won, but all I ended up with was a vaguely monkey-shaped ball of psi (ball with four sticks, immobile). We called it a draw. 
<br />

<br />
Altogether, the fight lasted around 2 minutes. Didn't time it, though, so I could be way off.

everytime I say something about psi they go on and on about how it could be real and it's cultish etc etc etc balh blha crap

If it cant be proven by religion or science it's not real

I could just make two pets fight each other but that's about as fun as playing rock paper scisors with yourself  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			I like the idea. And of course it's been tried. There were threads on it a while ago. And metalAlchemy, they are not really living if they are really basic, so it's not as if they are real. Hell, just program them to enjoy the fighting. Work like a charm.

did metal just call PETA?

lol jk. i dont know how i feel about this topic. i mean i guess if you think about it, psi is a form of existence and in that sense it would be inhumane.
<br />

<br />
i guess if you give your psipet feelings and it doesn't like fighting = bad. i dont know anyone who would do that though if they decide all they want to do with it is fight, but whatever.

PETA is not the US animal protection service - it's a ridiculous organization, and it's not an official government organization.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Psi-pets&quot; as they are created here and talked about are little more than remote control toys. The sentience is limited, and they don't qualify as &quot;life forms.&quot; There's nothing inhumane about making robots fight.

			In my opinion psipets fighting is wrong, they are AI constructs not tools don't use them for your own perosnal amusement. They should only fight in defense if all you want is a tool to amue yourselves or to see a spar or make a non AI construct.

They are what I make them. Ultimately, they're extensions of my own consciousness, and I can do with them as I please.

Artificially intelligent computer opponents in a video game aren't real people. Neither are psionic constructs.

			Psi pets are NOT living things, they dont feel anything, they dont think anything but what there told to, They dont care is they are killed, because we kill them by just saying &quot;terminate&quot; or what ever command.

			Exactly, what's inhumane about programming psi? They're not real animals, they can't feel pain, they can't feel at all. They slowly dissipate over time themselves, they don't have consciousness, unless you will so. It's like building two robots and watch them fight. They don't have feelings, just power, lots of servos and a chip to control the servos in sequence. That's it.
