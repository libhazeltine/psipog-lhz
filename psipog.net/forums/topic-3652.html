			so you wanna make a shield that'll amplify your pk?
<br />

<br />
well first you have to understand and know what ways it will actually amplify it.
<br />

<br />
will it give you more energy? will it give you more confidence? do you know what im mean?
<br />

<br />
you could make a construct with the ability to pk. let me explain this a little more thorougly. not that it can actually pk, but it has pk in it. do you know what i mean? so once the construct is opened it'll unless the pk ability onto you. you can make have whatever kind of level or degree of pk you want, but you have to realize the better the pk the more time it will take to create it. so.......you might as well just practice and make yourself better, unless this is a better way for you personaly.

			i was thinking of a construct that if you have some pk you could make it like a lens so it helps you focus your pk on what you want and and you could change it's focus strength so it becomes slightly harder to do the same thing. that way you can train and get better and still do so cool things like roll a can or pencil without having to strain yourself.

			I have tried this a few times with telepathy, pk, and sensitivity in general.  It seems though I am unsuccessful, but if anyone has success at this let me know your results.
<br />

<br />
It is also possible that the theory of a more focused shield or a enhancement shield just isn't applicable in the area of psionics, but then again just because someone hasn't built one doesn't mean it won't work.
