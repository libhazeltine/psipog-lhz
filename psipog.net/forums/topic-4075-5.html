			All I do is suck energy into my eyes, programming it whilst doing so to change my eyes to &quot;X&quot; color.
<br />

<br />
I had a buddy change my eye color, and it worked.  The next day at work, I noticed that they were starting to fade back to normal.  I took 5 minutes and brought in some energy and they went right back to what they were, and haven't changed since...but now it seems I can't get them to change at all, as the color we were going for is not possible to attain due to body parameters, so now I want Deep Blue but it seems as though it is stuck atm.  Ah well...

			For me when I program this energy, I am simply telling it what I want it to do.  
<br />

<br />
Example:  While energy is being sucked in, I visualize my eyes the way I want them, and continually think &quot;Change my eye color to X&quot;.  Thats it.

			Seems to be people like to make things tough.   This technique I use is simple, yes, but effective, for me at least.  Hopefully you too will experience success.  Let me know of any success that you have with this technique!
<br />

<br />
BTW, you should be able to feel a pressure while sucking in the energy.  I do at least.

			Thanks Kaiandy,
<br />
I mixed your technique with one of my own, and i think it slightly worked. More importantly I was introduced to sometghing else I've never felt before!
<br />

<br />
I decided to visualise myself absorbing energy and then counting to a hundred. I said to myself when I get to 100 my eyes will be blue.
<br />

<br />
I think i absorbed a hell of a lot of energy, because from about 15 - 35, I didn't feel &quot;in&quot; my body. It was really strange. 
<br />

<br />
At around 35, I realised what I was doing and for some reason &quot;woke up&quot; from it.
<br />

<br />
Strange.

			Hey, no problem. 
<br />

<br />
What seems to have happened to you is a form of OBE, either full OBE, astral, or something along those lines.  One technique for OBE is to suck in a lot of energy into your heart chakra, or if you dont believe in chakras, into your body.  I have personally not tried that one yet it seems to have worked for you so one day when I am not so tired I will have to try it.   
<br />

<br />
Glad it worked, so you did notice a change, huh?  That is good if so.

			The thing about eye color is if you do it too quickly it will hurt.  So you probably do have some color change.  Do the technique again tonight, and you will probably notice even more changes.  Good luck.

			Make a construct designed to keep your eyes at the color you want, I would think.  
<br />

<br />
Also, mine haven't changed back except for the one time while at work, which I changed them back immediately <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  I have also heard that they only need a little bit tweaking every once in awhile to keep them at desired color.  Who knows really?  It is an unknown, probably different for everyone.
