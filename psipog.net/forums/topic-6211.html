			OK...
<br />

<br />
I'd like to know how to manipulate electricity using psychokinesis. I have been practising &quot;charging&quot; my body with electricity almost every night and it feels tingly every time i do it. 
<br />
However, i've never turned off or affected anything electrical in my life. 
<br />
It seems really cool and interesting, so i want to give it a shot.
<br />

<br />
Feel free to post your experiences/help/replies

			that is my own experience : 
<br />

<br />
i was trying to produce electricity before by trying to feel it go through my arm and go to my hand then my fingers , trying to imagine it and hearing it but all i get was the tingling sensation there as my will was there so after 1 week or so i wanted to see if i realy produce elctricity or not because i feel that sensation and cant feel any little shocks or anything so i measured myself and find nothing more then my normal measure and did not increase .
<br />

<br />
i got other experience by watching people and find :
<br />

<br />
you might touched someone and he gave you little shock , you might think he is gifted or something , but i find out that they are realy in very very very sad mode or very sad but trying to hide that and they maybe are hopeless , all i refer to that they are realy sad and complately hate the life .

			oooh oooh pick me pick me!! yes! i know this!
<br />

<br />
alright ever played a game called diablo 2?well i have for years(since it came out) and anyway a month or 2 before i moved(3 months ago) i was bored and my bro was playing it, i saw the sorcerecss make a lightning arc from her hand to her staff thing and i got an idea. 
<br />

<br />
what i did was all of a sudden instantly visualized my hand charging with a giant electrical ball and then i knew i was doing it simply by thinking hey it is happening tricking my mind into doing so. then i brought it to my brother and he said &quot;stop&quot; and i just said im not touching you, he looked and was amazed and said &quot;its like a lot of little prickly things running across my arm&quot; which is either like your arm going numb or having some electrical currents run across your arm(dont ask how i know this bad experience with a plug thats prongs happened to be next to the edge)
<br />

<br />
but anyway just be like instantly be &quot;BZZZZZZCHHHHHHH&quot;(Electrical noise)  and see in your mind electricity charging throughout. how ive done it
