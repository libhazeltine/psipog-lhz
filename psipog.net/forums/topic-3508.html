			I was stubling through a pretty fluffy site (linked to in Apollo's &quot;FLUFF ALERT!&quot; thread), and they had some stuff on manipulation of light, which they called Lumokinesis (although it would actually be Photokinesis, but that's still a fluff term, and won't be used). 
<br />

<br />
That got me thinking about whether using PK to mess around with light would be possible, and if so, how difficult could it be? It might be very difficult, as it's still a form of PK, or it could be really easy, as light shouldn't be too rigid. Any thoughts?

Why does everyone think that PK on DNA, Light, other abstracts require research?

Just do it, right?  Just imagine what you want to happen, and do it!

			Lets be realistic, yes you need to know how some things work in order to move.Im sick of people saying that TK is all belief and stuff like that. The only people that are extraordinary in TK are the ones that practiced.

			I think it would be pretty easy, it's probably a form of micro-PK because you'd be affecting the waves of light (not particles) which aren't really physical entities.
<br />

<br />
Or maybe you could affect particles, that would probably be quite easy because they have very little mass, but you probably can't slow down light particles, so you probably can't change their direction either.
<br />

<br />
If you affect waves, you can manipulate the chances of the particles being in a certain place at a given time... You can probably change the wavelength (turn red into green).

I agree with this line here ^. Light travels at something like (insert number with a 3 in it and a billion zeros)mps so it would be pretty tricky to hold a bit of light for long beore it goes zooming past you. eg. A 1000 light particles go towards you, you try and bend their direction, before you can firmly grasp and bend them, they are half way to australia. 
<br />

<br />
Of course, if you keep this up, however, you will sort of automatically bend them as they go past you, but they are still travleing pretty fast to be able to manipulate properly. And plus, if you get it wrong, you could bend it away from your eyes by accident and go momentarily blind, which would scare the crap out of me. Then again, if mastered, it would be prety cool to use; YOU COULD SEE ROUND CORNERS! yay. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			I'd agree with psi_manipulator_300 in that light is a very fast, dynamic thing, and would be pretty much impossible to focuse on and move. I don't practice PK myself, but I'm just saying that trying to move light with your mind is like trying to affect the path of a bullet. By the time you even realize it's going past you, it's gone. Now, if someone could make some sort of psi-lens that affects physical lightwaves, that would work. Not sure if that's possible though. (as a side note, light acts as both a particle and a wave, and I would think that only a particle would be movable by physical force)

			Also, light is a 4-d object not having any mass...although it can sometimes go into the 3d dimension for whatever reason and have mass &gt;.&gt;
<br />

<br />
So basically if you want to try and comprehend moving an object in another dimension be my guest.
<br />

<br />
I was thinking too about that river thing... If you put a log in a river, the water will flow around it.  It's hard to control each individual molecule of water--and whatever else may be in there <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />-- but if you put a log in there, you can divert the flow of the river but only for a short time because it follows the ditch the river has made.  I dont know how light would act though, only seen it been redirected with mirrors.  Personally I wouldnt really try to hard on the bending of light thing.  I'd just use some mirrors
