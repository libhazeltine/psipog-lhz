			I've been having a look around the thread and I've read endless discussions about RV, but I don't get to undestand (as the tittle says) the difference betwen RV and plain precognitions (dreamed in my case).
<br />

<br />
Is RV like &quot;forcing&quot; the mind into the future and Precog just &quot;involuntary&quot;?
<br />

<br />
I can only say from personal experience that Precog comes without really noticing it, betwen dreams and unfortunately, you can't tell which dream could come true until it does.

			Aphanas, Elliptic, and JoeT have all discussed this at length.  To borrow from Aphanas?s post (you?ll see it stickied):

It isn't a skill at all, but rather a series of scientific protocols used when obtaining clairvoyant information.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Dream precognition is indeed a skill inside the clairvoyant aspect of psionics.  However, because the scientific protocols would (very likely) not have been followed, it would not be classified as RV using the definitions discussed in the stickies.  I?m not sure how protocols could be followed with dream cognition (pre, retro, or otherwise).  That is not to say it is not possible, however.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">To reiterate</span>, RV uses scientific protocols.  If what you do doesn?t do that, the 'correctness' of classifying what you do as RV will be debated by many folks.
<br />

Hope this was helpful,

I believe RVing can be used for the past, present or future. Correct me if I'm wrong though.

Didn't Nostradamus use RV to predict the twin towers thing?

After following proper target assignment protocol, yes. Targets can be things in the past, present, or future. Future ones are uncommon, though, as they're harder to verify for accuracy.

Remote viewing did not exist in the time of Nostradamus. It is impossible that he remote viewed anything, because remote viewing was invented in the 1970s.
<br />

<br />
Also, those predictions are entirely false and invented. Those quatrains are made up. See <a href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/predict.htm" target="_blank" class="postlink">here.</a>

			we may be more technilogically advanced than the ancients, but that doesn't make us smarter.
<br />

yes we have attributed the creation of RVing to researchers working with the US gov't in the 1970s, but that doesn't mean the ancients didn't have RV protcol at least somewhat similar to ours.

I'm not saying that I believe in Nostradamus' predictions. I'm just saying that RV, or some form of it, could have quite possibly existed before we as a community became consciously aware of the skill and its applications.

Remote viewing is a term for a specific protocol system developed in the 1970s. What you're saying is equivalent to saying &quot;just because we just now developed fusion doesn't mean we haven't had fusion for thousands of years.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Remote viewing protocol was invented in the 70s. While other protocols and systems may have existed in the past (though we do not have documentation of these things) they would not be remote viewing.
<br />

<br />
Remember, remote viewing is not in and of itself a psychic skill, but rather a protocoled system for allowing those kskills and abilities to come out.

			A better example of what I'm saying would be...take the 2000 year old batter found in the middle easter. Now compare it to our batteries now. 
<br />

<br />
See the difference? the fusion example has some relation, but I never said the 'ancient' version is an exact replica of the protocol we have now. I said similar. 
<br />

<br />
btw, if you don't know what battery I'm talking about, here's a link of a website that can give you more information about it: <a href="http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/Batteries/historyold.htm" target="_blank">http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/Batteries/historyold.htm</a>

			I'm aware of the Baghdad battery - and I think that example is more apt than you'd like it to be: it is not a battery in the conventional sense. It's nothing like the batteries we have today. Calling it a conventional battery is likely wrong. Still, it is a battery - just completely different from an Energizer.
<br />

<br />
Remote viewing protocol is a very new thing.
<br />

<br />
It should also be noted that those before us did not take as much care in scientifically studying and justifying clairvoyance - especially not in the 1500s. Further, it was never understood that one could &quot;learn&quot; clairvoyance. Protocoled systems to allow replicability not just within a single individual, but from one person to the next, seems to be fairly new.

			i call it a battery, but when i say it's a battery i dont mean an energizer battery. i know it's not the batteries we use today (duh)
<br />

<br />
now with the next paragraph you're getting too nitty gritty into it. i said similar, that means that the ancients didn't have all the same protocols as what we have today. i said a primitive version of RV. So it doesn't matter whether or not in ancient times clairvoyance was understood as something able to be taught to others.

			Thanks for the info and the ancient/70's comparison. As I've already read a tiny bit about RV, I get the idea of it. Still, I think RV may be a little too complicated (just an opinion). But all in all, it makes sense.
<br />

<br />
RV=Science in the proccess.
<br />
Precog=Something not yet considered by seriously known scientists.
<br />
Ancient ways=Considered by science as &quot;downgrade&quot;.

Still open for any corrections.
