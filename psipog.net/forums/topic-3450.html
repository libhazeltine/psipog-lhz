			So I understand that RV can be used to find objects that are lost, etc, but can it also be used to find a lost pet or even a lost or missing person? I would imagine it would be harder as they would be moving but is it not still the same concept? As long as you would say what (or who) you are looking for (ex. a runaway dog) and give some coordinates for it, wouldnt someone still be able to RV it? Just a thought that I have had in my mind for awhile.

			Yes, it is doable and has been done. As far as the matrix is concerned, there's no difference between people, animals, and objects. All can be set as coordinates.
<br />

<br />
However, as has been pointed out before on these forums, RV isn't as useful for finding locations as one might think...the information acquired tends to be good information, but places are similar enough that it's hard to tell, especially if the response is &quot;in the woods&quot; or something like this.
<br />

<br />
Pendling tends to be more responsive.

<br />
Heh I guess your post pretty much hits the nail on the head but while Im here, a conversation arose between me and another member about people using RV to view on government operations (ex. Area 51) and I had 2 questions about this: 1)Would this be considered a crime?
<br />
and  2)If it were to be a crime what would be the possibility of the government having psions designed to keep RVers out and if one tried to still view what was going on if the government would take action psionically? (such as engaging in psionic combat, being that all trespassers will be shot if spying on the facility, if this would be considered the same concept)
<br />
Kinda off topic and confusing, I know, but that was another burning question of mine.

			well, seeing where a pet was last would be psychometry(if I understand it's meaning correctly) or postcognition....but I wouldn't try anything like viewing the gov. stuff because well it's their business and we don't need to interfere <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

Yes. Same mechanism. NB: you cannot set your own target. If you want to view your dog, you're in trouble. If someone else wants you to view their dog, they cannot tell you what you're looking for beforehand, or this will screw up the &quot;blind.&quot;

&quot;Technically&quot; yes. This is a crime, it's gaining illicit access to secret information without a clearance at best, at worst, it's treason, provided you're an American viewing American military operations.

Most &quot;vulnerable areas&quot; use physical shielding type mechanisms - electrical fields designed to severely impair remote viewing operations. Others use more traditional shields and &quot;cloaks of obscurity&quot; that make it very difficult to view within. In an example, when I was younger and learning RV, my teacher, for sport, set me a target near Ft. Meade, a center for US intel operations. This area is heavily shielded. I got, literally, nothing. I couldn't acquire a signal line, I couldn't acquire a target.
<br />

<br />
In another attempt to RV a military facility, I was &quot;guided out&quot; the way an airplane might be forced to land. I wasn't a legitimate threat (and they know that, what, being telepaths and all) so I wasn't killed or anything. Nobody is going to spend the energy killing a dude who was RVing in there if that dude doesn't have any information. It's easier to make you forget you were &quot;there' than to take you out, anyways.

			Ah but in order to use your own targets it tends to go into clairavoyance, which I don't understand why there very little mention of it on the forums. It works actually better then remote viewing but much harder to achieve as well, and I think in the cases of military operations not shielded against clairavoyance as these people are not as common and very few can achieve the control to subject it to their will. Long time ago I used to be able to do this on a fairly regular basis, but now I'm sorta chicken to try it, afraid I might have forgotten how ect.

The mechanisms are typically the same, it's just the access type that's different. One of the reasons I became &quot;so good&quot; so quickly in the field of RV is because I seem to demonstrate some natural clairvoyance. The shielding is still functional. After all, it's not designed to work against &quot;remote viewing&quot; per se, but any kind of psychic intrusion. Remote viewing was initially an American method, and the defense against it was less necessary than defense against the fairly well developed Russian telepaths. Currently, the United States' main &quot;psychic threat&quot; is China.
<br />

<br />
The use of EM shields is fairly modernized, and built on radionic principles. They aren't perfect, but they are functional enough to &quot;throw off&quot; most incursions. More traditional shields are also employed - whether they are maintained by people or by some kind of electronic device I don't know.
<br />

<br />
As for the argument that it's possible to use clairvoyance here, I'm glad someone here sees the distinction. It would <span style="font-style: italic">appear</span> most people seem to think they are the same thing here, which they aren't - remote viewing is protocol driven and standardized, and uses particular methods which are structured to allow for a specific phenomenon to take place. Clairvoyance is simply viewing things far away, psychically, or as I define it in my book:

I don't think so, no. Clairvoyance is non-protocoled. With clairvoyance, an individual is capable of seeing things that are a far distance off without any kind of physical sense. Remote viewing is the same, but it uses a protocol and a structured system.
<br />

<br />
Remote presense is another matter entirely, involving some kind of &quot;out of body&quot; effect where the individual's &quot;presence&quot; is manifested elsewhere.

			One of the main differences with clairavoyance is the fact that you can know what the object is, you don't get aol like you do with rv, rp is different from either one of these. However, as I was going to say, you see everything around, almost like the same is obe but your fully conscious and you don't see the terrain in between it's basically a teleportation of the mind to see and never have to have been there. For an example, I'm somewhat connected with my cousin, when she was out in California, I would use the clairavoyance to see how she was doing, make sure all was well with her, saw all of the surroundings, and when she got back I asked about these specific places and commented on the decor and it was accurate information.

Remote viewing, as a term, was used to differentiate from the very similar practice of clairvoyance. Clairvoyance does not use protocol. You can set your own target, you can view it, etc. The problem with this is that it is much less verifiable. You can't test clairvoyance by asking someone to view a popcan, if they then describe a popcan. You can, however, test remote viewing by giving someone a target set to a popcan, and then having them describe the same.
<br />

<br />
Remote presence is an entirely different beast, and one which I'm simply not qualified to speak on at length. Typically, with remote presence, one transmits their consciousness to the target area, allowing them to move around and (occassionally, with enough skill) interact with the area. With clairvoyance, instead, one will simply see the area, and, with enough skill, be able to &quot;move the camera&quot; but will not be &quot;there&quot; per se.
