			I'm quite confused. I've been playing with psi energy for a year or so now and I can't understand how it is that when I attempt to draw energy, I pull it in when I inhale and when I exhale it seems some of the energy goes away unless I try really hard to hold on to it. Any ideas as to why that happens or if there's a way to avoid that situation?

			Maybe you should associate it gathering psi with something other than breathing. OR, take great care and focus that when you breath in it gathers, and when you breath out it holds.

<br />
It sounds to me like you have routed this into habit, so it might take a little while before you can fully correct it.

			This is just an idea, but you could program a shield to hold the psi you gather in...i guess it would be more like an anti-shield though <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

Thats a good idea too...Try gathering energy by absorbing it rather than breathing it in...or something along those lines.

			When you inhale, the actual sensory stimulation from the outside world replaces that that you imagined in your body.  It's not psi.  I'm beginning to wonder if anything is psi.  AM I WASTING MY TIME HERE?  WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO MAKE A HUGE JUMP FROM BEING ABLE TO MAKE A TOOTHPICK MOVE ACROSS A TABLE TO BEING ABLE TO READ MINDS AND VIEW ANY LOCATION IN SPACE?

			Though most of what Johnny said was a bunch of B.S., he's right about one thing. I've realized that when I try and pull psi, I breathe in because the air filling me stimulates my subconcious and tricks it (like Peebrain was talking about how he started to do TK) and then I can use that so my subconcious doesn't give me a bunch of crap about how it isn't possible. But yeah, I've been working on focusing on holding it as I breathe out and I've almost got that down. And once so far I've been able to continuously pull even as I breathe out. I guess it's something all news go through, but it's just fun to see how much I can hold. I havn't hit a limit yet (I don't think), but I'm trying ^.^ Thanks for the responses, though.

No need to be sorry. I understood instantly that it wasn't something you normally say. Not only by logic, but I'm psychic too !<img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
