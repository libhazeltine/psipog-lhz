			[b]I have only just been introduced to this site but much of what is mentioned here i have been experiencing for some time. I found my abilities started off with a rise in confidence as i started perceiving other peoples insecurities, for example when out clubbing once i saw someone wearing the same colour top as me but what i perceived as her body language telling me she felt i looked better i now think was a projection of her thoughts
<br />

<br />
Anyway, i got shown this site by my now ex boyfriend. He introduced me to the concept of pinging and try as i might to escape this person i find myself getting strong signals from them on a daily basis. At first i thought i was just being delusional but after reading more in depth about how emotions can be felt and hacking etc im thinking is he somehow not only managing to ping me and get my attention, but also transfer his emotional state and habits onto me. I found when he went away i was happy and got on with life, but as soon as he was back on the same land as me he was in control again. i get an uncontrollable urge to text him when in my head and heart i cant stand him. In the days after i broke up with him i found myself becoming like him, he spends a lot of time indoors, he cant sleep, and these habits i started getting, although in the time he was away i was fine.
<br />

<br />
Apart from this i  find i can pick up peoples emotional states, for example when in a post office with approx 20 parcels to send i got a strong sense inside the person serving me wasnt happy and i felt is so strongly my insides tightened and i became morbid like the person serving me, when only minutes earlier i was laughing about. I feel other peoples negative energies are being picked up by me and effecting me. 
<br />

<br />
I've read about breaking links, but im worried the link my ex might have created is unbreakable or will be recreated. I dont want to resort to shielding myself constantly as i like knowing how other people feel but i dont want it effecting my karma
<br />

<br />

^ Basics in telepathy, i'm sure breaking a link is discussed therein.  
<br />

<br />
There are different ways to break a link.  One, is to actually break it through energy manipulation.  Another is to visualize the link breaking, or dissipitating.  You can just think of something besides telepathy (favorite song, what you have to do today, ect...) and the link should break.
<br />

<br />
As for feeling him ping you, and it feels like he is &quot;controlling&quot; you, sheild. Here is a link to the shielding articles:
<br />

<br />
<a href="../articles.html" target="_blank">cat-shields.html</a> 
<br />

<br />
 Once you get decently skilled with sheilding, you can begin to program them to keep out what you want out.  If you have further questions, feel free to PM me.  I'm sure there will be more people that will post some tips and answers to your questions  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Also, sheilding DOESN'T affect karma, considering karma is an islamic (or buhddist) belief, and psionics isn't a religion, the two don't interfere.  There is no such thing as an unbreakable link.  Every link can be broken, and sheilding protects you from being linked in the first place.  Once you create a sheild, and you create the SAME sheild everyday for about a week or two, this becomes a 24/7 sheild.  It is always up, and all you have to do is maintain it.

Yeah, i would learn how to shield directly against him. Should work. If not, hes either A. a great psion, and you should talk to him about training, or B, its in your head...

			Well, for one, you could program a good shield to specifically reflect/refract these urges, or you could spy on him at his house, and see if he does anything when you get the urges.... (illegal lol)

			Is it TELLING you to do something, or is it making you FEEL like you have to do something?  If it is telling you, and it isn't your mental voice, chances are it is an outside force.  As for feeling it, it could be all you, but that is a form of TPS...
<br />

<br />
We all thought we were crazy at one time.  While practicing PK, I thought I was delusional.  When recieving telepathic messages in third grade, at first I thought I was crazy, but then it became natural.  Like I said earlier, learn to sheild.  This will help immensly.

			I had a problem like that. I felt like I was obsessed with this one person and it was weird because I couldn't stop thinking about her.
<br />

<br />
Shielding only helped a little.  What worked for me was everytime I found myself thinking about that person I would mentally shout out 'GET OUT OF MY HEAD!'  and then I'd clear my mind
<br />

<br />
Seems so simple but it works.
