			Well, I've got a list of techniques here for different psionic abilities. I've decided to post this before psipog goes down. These techniques are just random things that I have made up myself or compiled from articles on the forums or site. 1 or 2 of these will not be techs, just ideas and advice to help you with learning these skills. If I have used a bit of your article or technique in here and you don't like it, then I will edit it out or link directly to your article in here. Or give you recognition in this thread. But these techniques are not copied and pasted. They may contain bits of other articles, but I try to be original.
<br />

<br />

<br />
So here are the articles:
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Curing Hiccups</span>
<br />

<br />
To cure hiccups, you first need to know what causes them. What causes hiccups are seizures of your diaphragm. Your diaphragm is right beneath your rib cage, kinda where your solar plexus is. To stop the seizures, you should channel energy to your diaphragm. After that, wait for a hiccup and then, right after that hiccup, try to hold the diaphragm still and keep it from moving. Think of a gentle but firm grip, like steel around your diaphragm, constraining it. But the steel has to be soft and polished and gentle. If you do it right, the hiccups should stop and it will feel like you've just kind of &quot;swallowed them&quot;.

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Telepathy Technique</span>
<br />

<br />
This is based off an empathy article on psipog. I'll link to it at the end of this post. When I was a newbie at psionics, I read through all the articles on psipog, pretty much. Well there was an empathy article that said to just think &quot;I wonder what _______'s thinking&quot;. The blank was where you enter whoever's name that you're trying to do empathy on. I tried it and on my 3rd or 4th try I had success. It was interesting to me for quite a while but now it's just a skill that use now and then and I generally consider it a less advanced ability. Now I don't even have to ask the question of what are they thinking to myself, I just do it. The point is, I wondered one day if this could be applied to telepathy. And I tried and it worked. It's obviously harder than empathy, but I can sort of get it work. I had hoped to get good at it and be able to just spontaneously read minds like I can with empathy, but I need to post this before psipog goes down. So if you do this, you should be able to skim off surface thoughts a lot easier. After practice, anyway.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Telepathic and Precog Feelings</span>
<br />

<br />
If by chance, you are new to telepathy and precog then you may think that you can read someone's mind and pictures pop into your head or that you view the future with visions. While you can recieve pictures or images telepathically or have visions of the future, feelings are more common. Feelings like these are very complicated. You know the saying &quot;A picture tells a thousand words&quot;? Well, a feeling or two like these can tell about 100 pictures, at most. I'd have to say that they usually tell about 10 pictures, at least for me. Feelings from telepathy and precognition are conceptual, a lot of the time. They can come in strings of feelings. I've gotten 2 or 3 feelings all at once, along with an image one time when I was doing precognition. You should sit back and sort the feelings out when you get them. Not logically, though, just go with what your instincts tell you. When you get a precog or telepathic feeling, you will know. They don't have words or pictures, although they can come with them. I've done my best to describe them. :p

<span style="text-decoration: underline">My Psiwheel Method</span>
<br />

<br />
Alright, to begin, you should meditate for 5 minutes, at least. Get your mind real clear and charge, if you want. Now go to your psiwheel and put some energy into it. Just charge it up like you would yourself. You can link to it now if you want. Or do whatever connection technique you like. Whatever floats your boat. Now visualize your hands catching on fire. It can be colored fire- I do purple. Let the fire spread all over your hands until both of your hands are completely on fire. Let the flames grow higher and higher. Now say, &quot;I can use pk to move this psiwheel&quot; or something like that. Say it 6 times, out loud. Now cup your hands around the psiwheel. It may start spinning- if so, then try to control the movement and go from there. If it doesn't, then that's fine. You should watch the psiwheel passively and try to spin it. Just visualize it spinning and then let it spin. Pretend that there's something invisible blocking it and you just relax and let the barrier go away and the psiwheel spin. You should be relaxed, but keep your goal in mind. Don't get frustrated. When it does spin, don't get excited. Your whole attitude through this should be &quot;It will spin, but I don't care if it does or not. It just will&quot;. The key to this is relaxation. If you are not relaxed, then your energy will not flow.
<br />

<br />
Keep practicing this, and once you are to the level where you can consistently spin it, then try controlling the direction of the spin.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Electric charging</span>
<br />

<br />
Hmmm.. there was an article about this on mpw-13's forums but their forums are down or gone, so I'll post what I remember of the article.
<br />

<br />
You should visualize your nerves- see them under your skin, running across your entire body. Then visualize them glowing yellow, so bright that they shine through your skin. Just sit there for a little bit with them glowing brighter and brighter and then make them vibrate, giving off little sparks and bolts of electricity. Remember, this is all visualization. After a while of that, you should feel all tingly, charged with electric energy. You can use this to do electrokinesis easily or to make electric constructs programmed to shock people or whatever you make your electric constructs do. If you want to make an shield that works like an electric fence or something, then use this to charge and get your energy for it.

<br />
Good lucid dreaming tech. Link: <a href="http://www.dreamviews.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=5270&amp;hl=FILD" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.dreamviews.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=5270&amp;hl=FILD</a>

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Precognition Article</span>
<br />
On psipog's forums. Link: <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=2487&amp;highlight=precog" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2487&amp;highlight=precog</a> There is also a 2nd and 3rd part.
<br />

<br />

<br />
And here's the empathy article I said I'd post. <a href="../art-beginners-empathy.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.psipog.net/show.php?cmd=wp&amp;id=31</a>
<br />

<br />
I'm probably missing something, but I'll add anything I remember later. Read 'em and tell me if these articles/techniques are any good!
