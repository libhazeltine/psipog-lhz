			Well, first of all, (and I can't speak for everyone) but 2x2 inches sounds big compared to mine! The only piece of advice I can ofer is to practice, keep your cool, be focused, don't give up and rememeber that it takes some people years to do this stuff. I wish you the best of luck. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Listen, I have been at this for 9 months and stil haver not gotten the psiwheel to move, only a piece of string and that was probably either a fluke or the wind, keep going if I can do it then so can you.

			Try something else?
<br />

<br />
When I tried, I becames irritated and said &quot;Fuck it!&quot; and then put aside and forced as much energy in a paper ball to levitated it untill I couldn't feel my hand....nothing happened. Then I decided to slide a peice of graphite from my pencil, since I felt more comfortable about it, and it worked, ever since then, I can slide almost everything I put my mind too (no pun intended if is a pun). I still haven't spinned the Pin-Wheel yet though.
<br />

<br />
By the way, I could manipulate energy better after my...impatient action.

			I'm glad to hear you've mad esome progress. One thing I've learned is that we all progress in different ways, at different rates.
<br />

<br />
Personally I've been actively practicing TK for just over a full week now and while I do still have trouble moving the Psi wheel from time to time (mostly due to a lack of focus) most days I simply put my hand near it and think the direction to make it move. I've discovered that it's important to understand the way that YOU believe TK works, and then apply that. For me it's very much based in my hands - which is probably a side effect of growing up watching too much star wars, but I understand that and I accept that it works that way for me. Now that isn't to say that I don't practice without my hands, I understand the use of not needing to use them and that it's something for me to develope, but for now that's the way mine works.
<br />

<br />
I've also not had any luck sliding or rolling objects yet - now I said before I've only been at it a week (and took 2 days off for much needed rest, which paid off BTW) but I understand your initial frustration at not getting something to move. I think a large part of moving objects is making your mind understand that this CAN move. The Psi wheel is easy to spin because you can see it spin due ot the wind, and without touching it - that's easy to ingrain in your mind, but another object can be quite difficult.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I'm rambling again. Off with me.

			It took me like 2 weeks to move the psi-wheel the first time, so while you still may need alot of practice, you may also be very close <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Don't give up though either way. I'm barely moving it now because I havn't practiced in over a year, but it's moving, little by little.

1) + 2): <a href="../articles.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">articles.html</a> - you should find what you need about 'energy manipulation' there.
<br />

<br />
3) Levitation <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> Telekinesis.

<br />
4)  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

5) I don't know... if you mean, ~ moving things in the waking world using your dreams - I have no idea. If you mean ~ moving things, in 'dream world' then yes its quite possible.
<br />

<br />
6) Most definitely.
