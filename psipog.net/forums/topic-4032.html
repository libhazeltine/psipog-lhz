I must admit it's a fairly good argument, but even so, if this is the best one people can come up with, then they are in trouble, of course people were already in trouble, but...
<br />

<br />
anyway, that's something I get alot just bringing these things up casually,  I ask how they know they aren't, and they will usually say something like, &quot;because no one ever talks about it.&quot; lol, retarded answer, to be honest. 
<br />

People are moronic.

			indeed, what they dont realise is that Telekinesis and Pk are real, but its been used as a trick for illusionists and magicians so many times, people refuse to believe that it could be real, because its been shown how to be faked countless times.

			Even if someone were to show paranormal events in a complete scientific test enviroment, they would still be labelled as a fraud, and therefore not be rich and famous, just ridiculed until their eyes burst. Uri Geller is an exception on the other hand, he is quite the opposite to what would happen, instead of a real Pker becoming famous and a fraud becoming ridiculed, it is quite the opposite, real Pker's are ridiculed and frauds have fame and money, i find that fucking amazing dont you?

			Why aren't precognitives rich? If precognition exists.

I'm not allowed into casinos or allowed to buy a lottery ticket or anything yet =/

How do you know precognatives havn't won the lottery? They most probs have, alot of the time. Would you say to the people that deliver your money, &quot;Oh yeah, I won this by predicting the future and cheating&quot;. They would probs take your money away. It would be clever to keep you mouth shut and call it luck, than to not get your money. If they believe you that is...

i see your point, but why havnt well known pyschics won the lottery, like Uri Geller, or the dude off Most Haunted (fraud). We would have heard if they won the lottery. So why havnt they, hmm, maybe theyre frauds, <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			Or he heard about the psychic seen while in some foreign country, gave it a go by trying to bend spoons, found out he couldnt do it, so he devised many ways in which it looked as if he was bending the spoon, and gained money from it. He probably just wanted to be a psion so bad, he didnt want to bother with all the practice you have to do, so his tricks are a fast way to fame.
