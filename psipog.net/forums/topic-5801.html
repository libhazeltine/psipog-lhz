			If the way I read is true, you get the cordinates by pictureing the lost object and thinking up 8 numbers? sort of like a mental cordinate of it by randomly writing down numbers? If so mine are:
<br />
4325-9276
<br />

<br />
Its light gray on top and dark gray on the bottom. No idea where its at, and I haven't seen it in weeks.

			It seems to be trapt in a small area on it's side somewhere. In some kind of white material like clothes or blanket. I also saw a book and maybe a hat but I'm not sure about the hat so much. And the book was open half way standing up with the spine pointing upwards.

I'm trying a new technique so this could be wrong <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			Looked all over the house where books may be, and in corners and small places, couldn't find anything.
<br />
Thanks for trying though, could anyone else help me out?

			Every bit of information helps so I'll tell you everything I saw. First of all I saw it sitting on top of a VCR. Now it wouldn't be lost if it was just sitting on top of a VCR where everyone can see it... unless it was on an old VCR somewhere else in the house, a VCR no one uses anymore. 
<br />

<br />
But that was just residual memory from before I moved when we had an old VCR and to this day we still keep our remotes on top of the VCR. So I considered this to be completely residual imaging and set it aside. 
<br />

<br />
As soon as I did that, I felt it's presence in the couch somewhere. I thought of how I could link this to conscious thought and nothing, so check in between couch cushions and underneath the couch. I sense it to be in a vertical position and stuck somewhere tight, like in between the seat cushions.

			I was distracted by my own couch's color and was real close to setting it aside as residual memory but I kept at it and was able to sense it in a vertical position, it's not flat anywhere.

Every bit of information is good information. Even if you *think* he had already looked there, it can't hurt to give him the information anyways because you can't help what you see.

I don't recall if it was vertical, the end may have been sticking up a little bit.
