			I have seen numerous videos and websites stating what goes wrong in his videos and why they think he's a fake. Can't remember them now, they were random searches on google. 
<br />
But if that's where you got it from, then you have to look at other examples of how people think he's fake. Take the instance of kieth mayes site, he slags of every (and i mean every) video that is put forward to him, saying that this isn't right, the psiwheel wobbles and loads of other crap, when believe it or not, that video turns out not to be fake. All people have done is shown what could make Uri gellar fake. I don't think he is. 
<br />
He is the real deal, people just think he isn't because he's tried making money out of it, which is what skeptics advise us to do. Then they contradict themselves by saying we are fake. I personally think skeptics like that are screwed up in the head. They have an uncontrollable urge to prove it wrong because they can't take it that they're not as good.

			Dude, he already said it was fake. Use the Chris Angel method if you want to do some cheap tricks, so far i havnt heard of anyone that has levitated their whole body just by using psi, its one of two things, real, or fake, his vid was fake (with appalling music i might add), psi levitation would take years of practice, unless youre an alien called zorg ruling over the planet gurgon, who just happens to find an ancient spell that lets him have the ability to fly...... <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Why does everyone seem to think that doing exactly the same thing without using psi proves it wrong? It's just a really stupid thing to assume. Oh look I can fly in a hot air ballon, planes don't exist!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" />

Darkwolf must have thought that aaront's video of him levitating was real, you cant learn to levitate using psi, if youre practicing doing levitation using the Criss Angel method or some other kind of magicians trick. Aaront knows more about zorg from gurgon than real levitation, darkwolf asks for help on the subject of levitation using psi, i dont see the problem here.

			I think it is possible to levitate your whole body, but not with psi.
<br />
I think there is some truth to the stories of monks in tibet that levitate in a deep state of meditation, but its not something you can do with just psi.
<br />

<br />
Skuee, no need to call him a cockshit, I understand why he did it, just to see if anyone would believe it. There are stupid people here that believe everything you tell them.
