			From experience ( or non-experience ), I've learned one thing that stands very clear.  
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Your own self doubt is half the battle.</span>
<br />

<br />
     Taking into consideration that performing an action said to be impossible by the science world requires a lot of belief, how is it that we get past that without seeing hard evidence?  To the general population, seeing is believing, and experiencing is knowing.  A child fears flame after having been burnt by it.  Before, the subject in context probobly found the flame to be fascinating.  Only after <span style="font-style: italic">experienceing</span> the pain for itself did it fully <span style="font-style: italic">understand</span> why an open flame should be avoided.  If you compare the idea of &quot;experiencing is knowing&quot; to the subject I'm putting it to, all of you are well aware how self doubt comes into play of practicing and learning the techniques listed on this site.
<br />

<br />

<br />
     I've been fascinated with things like this my whole life.  Ever since I've been alive, I just knew that there was SOMETHING we'd all been missing.  <span style="font-style: italic">Knowing</span> that there was something there was half the battle for me, and I held an ample amount of determination once I began attempting techniques related to the powers of the body.  The only things I've ever accomplished were accidental, and related more to remote viewing / OBE / Astral projection.  I have accomplished nothing related to PK, and related subjects.  So why do I keep trying?
<br />

<br />
     What I've come to understand is that my own self-doubt may be the factor which gets in my way.  This may be true for everyone, but what is there for you to do about it?  In my case, there's nothing that can be done until there is hard proof.  However, self-doubt is the factor which prevents you from obtaining hard proof for yourself.  Sound a little paradoxial?  If you said yes, then you're correct.  
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Disease : Self-doubt / pure doubt
<br />

<br />
Cure for disease : Hard Proof ( experiencing is knowing )
<br />

<br />
Requirements for curing self-doubt / pure doubt : Overcoming self-doubt</span>
<br />

<br />
     If there's no other way to obtain the proof other than to overcome the self-doubt which is impossible to overcome without the proof,  that leaves an open space for outside interaction upon the problem.  
<br />

<br />
     In practicing these techniques, how can one see their progress?  For example, a psi-ball.  I've never &quot;felt&quot; the sensation others speak of, nor have I seen a psi-ball.  Where's the marker that tells me I've gone in the right direction towards achieving my goal?  From what I've experienced, it's nowhere.  The idea of forming a psi-ball completely lies on your own faith in what it is that you're doing.  In most of my cases :
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Confidence - 60%
<br />
Doubt - 40%</span>
<br />

<br />
     The doubt does NOT overweigh the confidence, obviously, but that ugly little 40% of doubt that's stuck in one's brain like a splinter is enough to hinder the whole bit.  You can have NO doubt if you wish to properly succeed, and that's a pretty fat problem.
<br />

<br />
     I personally feel that more progress would be made if someone could create a 20 page document entirely dedicated to overcoming one's self-doubt, but I've found one nowhere.  We learn better once we understand the inner workings of what it is we're learning.  An excellent marksman does not learn to shoot without his sights until he has mastered using the sights to begin with, and the same goes with other abilities.  
<br />

<br />
     To end, this is not an article trying to disprove subjects associated with this site.  I believe in the majority of them, but have had no luck in succeeding in any of it.  I have not read any good material related to doubt, so I thought this would be the place to start.

From what I understand then, you're a staunch skeptic of quantum maniuplation such as what this site covers.  Not that I fully understand what you said in that post, but from what I percieved it as is that you're saying the people who claim to have performed or have witnessed these acts in real time are merely making it up.  Of course, they aren't lying.  Their mind just makes it appear real to them, so they believe that it actually happened.  Is that what you're saying?  I'm not saying you're wrong ( since I've never personally performed or witnessed an act of quantum manipulation ), but would every person be this way?  For example, we would have different types of claims.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">(a) Imagined that it happened and mistook it for reality 
<br />
(b) Lied about the occurance of quantum manipulation 
<br />
(c) Has a mental disorder (i.e schizophrenia) 
<br />
(d) Actually witnessed or performed PK, telepathy, remote viewing.</span>
<br />

<br />
Obviously, in the case that multiple types of parties reported having experienced &quot;proof&quot;, there are more lies and deceit than ACTUAL proof.  That's how I believe it to be.  Of course, I think that there are some who are lying about every occurance they report, but they can't <span style="font-style: italic">all</span> be lying about it / imagining things, can they?  There has to be some legitimacy out there about what &quot;really&quot; happens.

			The whole problem is you have claimed seeing and personal experience can create hard evidence.
<br />

<br />
In my opinion quite the oppsite is true. Your beliefs, your experiences are very subjective. A large part of how we define reality and how science proves what is and is not real is to remove the subjective and the arbitrary. I.e. You are not talking about meaningful evidence. More just reinforcing a belief. 
<br />

<br />
By embracing belief instead of proof you risk leading yourself in to a delusion. This can be very dangerous. It can lead people to be suceptible to manipulation, cults, and, arguably worst of all, it can lead to set backs in science.
<br />

<br />
A possible area this is happening is in the quantum that you refer to. When you say quantum manipulation I cant be entirely sure what you are talking about, however, it is common for people to talk about consciousness affecting quantum states. I have already made a couple of posts on the subject that provide some evidence that this is not true. As far as I am aware there is absolutely no evidence, so far, to counter this.*
<br />

<br />
It is therefore quite worrying to see these ideas used by some as concrete theories.
<br />

<br />
*I may be off base in my assumption that this is what you are refering to, or you may have some further papers and such that prove me wrong.

Exactly why is that? All Im saying is that I think independantly. I dont need someone to tell me what to think. The reason I didnt read the whole thing is because it was 2am. I was tired and wanted to go to bed.

     To inform you, I have not claimed to have seen anything relating to telekinesis or psi-balls or what not.  However, I know there's some type of precognitive ability that rests in people because it rests in me, and many others.  I've had dreams that come true in at least some way, but the problem is that I don't know it up until the day happens.  I've even dreamt of something while it was happening to someone I didn't really know very well.  When I asked her about it, what she told me that had happened to her was too similar to my dream to be a coincidence.  
<br />

<br />
     Things relating to dreams and sleep are the only &quot;delusion&quot; I've taken to be real.  For example, I dreamt that I was in a small car wreck and spent the rest of the time trying to find someone in the country to help me with the problem.  Two nights later, this happened to someone who I was directly connected to in a situation, and it happened to him almost exactly how I dreamed it.  I've also dreamt of my own wreck happening exactly how I dreamt it, but much later in time.  That's no delusion, Mr. Pants.  Anyone else could say I was lying out my rear, but that doesn't matter to me.  I did not make it up, nor was it a delusion.  
<br />

<br />
     My only theory for that to have been a delusion is if time is actually moving backward rather than forward, and our minds just make us think it's moving forward.

     It's been written ( probobly by Peebrain ) that failure and frustration from failure adds to the problem of making progress.  Stack that on top of doubt, and that brings your percent of success down to roughly 40% or lower.  
<br />

<br />
     With all things, there are methods.  The methods for succeeding in psychic ability are very clouded, and have &quot;it works for me, maybe it'll work for you&quot; written all over them.  From what I've tried to understand about methods for telekinesis, it's all so vague.  The science behind WHY telekinesis works is very reasonable, deep, and a little more intellectual than most of us can handle in five minutes of reading.  However, getting <span style="font-style: italic">yourself</span> to understand that, and believe it in full would require you to have been taught to believe such things from birth.  Not that shaolin monks fall into the category of psychic ability, but their unusual abilities probobly have something to do with being raised from birth to believe that they can do the things they do.

First off, it _is_ mathematically possible for a bumblebee to fly.  That's an urban legend that just won't die.  The myth stems form an aerodynamics expert who wrongly compared the flight mechanisms of a bumblebee to an airplane.  Bee's wings aren't fixed, they work more like helicopter propellers.  I don't know the exact science, but I understand enough of it to know that it's wrong.
<br />

As for techniques of PK and other related phenomenon, they're all different because different people devise them.  However, the similarity between them can point to the necessary conditions required for the respective ability, such as intense focus.

Personally, I believe we can apply Hebbian learning theory to psionics.  You practice it long enough, and your mind and body will accomodate.  For this reason, understanding how it works isn't necessary to make it work.  This is where self-confidence and faith would come into play.

As for Shaolin monks, they train a lot.  That's what they do and that's all they do.  Any other person who undergoes the same regimines can accomplish the same physical and mental pinnacles.

			Wow.  Roy, I'm glad you informed me that the bee thing was just an urban legend.  Apart from that, I like how you described it all.  A simplification of what you meant was that &quot;there's no wrong way to eat a reese's.&quot;  There is a RIGHT way, of course, but it's all up to you how you go about developing it.

     I'm still not sure if there's truly a way to eliminate all doubt, though.  If a person saw it with their own eyes enough, then they'd adapt I suppose.
