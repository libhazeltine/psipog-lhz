			So last night I went to bed and I was intetionally trying to induce a LD.  I 
<br />
was imagining my self in my high school and saying over and over &quot;i'm 
<br />
dreaming! Im dreaming.&quot;  Anyways, I did fall asleep and I had what I 
<br />
thought was a lucid dream.  
<br />

<br />
I was in my high school still in this dream and it almost felt like I was 
<br />
dreaming I was havind a LD.  This is because it almost felt as if i could 
<br />
control myself but it also felt like I had none at all at the same time.  It 
<br />
didn't last long though because I flew up through the roof and into space 
<br />
and woke up right as I was going through the atmosphere.
<br />

<br />
I have a few questions for anyone who has had a LD though.  When you
<br />
 wake up from a LD how vivid is the memory of the dream?  Because alot 
<br />
of this dream is very cloudy.  And how can you tell when you really had a 
<br />
LD because I really can't decide if the dream I had was Lucid or not.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Thanks
<br />

			The memories can be clouded, but in my experience I always remember at least one part: Becoming aware in the dream. If you remember thinking to yourself: I'm dreaming, then it is by definition a lucid dream. It sounds like it probably was, because most people don't usually fly out into space in their normal dreams (at least to my knowledge) but unless you realized you were dreaming, it wasn't a LD.
