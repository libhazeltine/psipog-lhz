			Okay.  I'm new here, although not new to empathy or telepathy, which have haunted me most of my life.  But I've read most of the articles posted, and searched the forums a bit.  And I'm noticing an odd lack: explicit ethics guidelines.
<br />

<br />
This isn't to say that I haven't noticed people with ethics, because I have, but with something like this, it seems that remembering ethics would be all the more important for us, because...there's not many others who will admit this exists to remind us of ethics.  
<br />

<br />
What sort of guidelines do you follow?
<br />

<br />
For instance, pulling energy from a crowd seems a but questionable to me-because it's takng energy from other people without asking.  But then, it's excess, and not being used.
<br />

<br />
Or practicing telepathy: would you try to read someone's mind for practice, without their knowing?  WOuld you use it to find out if they like you?  To find their plans?  To spy on their life?  Where are your lines?
<br />

<br />
I ask this because all my life every time we ever discussed this, the conversation began and ended with what should and shouldn't be done, and here is seems odd to me how little it's explictly mentioned.

			Ethics are your personal holdings. YOU determine what's right and wrong for you to do. 
<br />

<br />
Personally, I don't draw evergy from other people. It's considered a form of attack sometimes. I do, however, scan people for my own ends sometimes. Usually I do it to get information they're not telling me, and then I use that information for the good of all. But that's my set of personal ethics.
<br />

<br />
It's your views. PsiPog doesn't have an official stance, as far as I know.

			Ethics is a topic I want to start getting into in the articles.  Obviously, everyone has to make up their own mind at the end of the day.  But that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about it.
<br />

<br />
I use a fairly simple guideline... if you wouldn't do it without psychic abilities, don't do it with psychic abilities.  If you normally don't go around and trip strangers on the street, then don't do it using PK.  Clairvoyance follows this too... if I normally don't spy on girls while they're getting dressed, then I shouldn't be using clairvoyance to do it (nor OBE, etc).
<br />

<br />
On top of that basic idea, I also have some other guidelines for telepathy and empathy.  Reading surface thoughts and surface emotions are fine... 99% of the time, people are projecting these thoughts/emotions OUTWARDS, so I would have to use a lot of extra effort to force myself not to perceive them.  I find that most people want their surface thoughts/emotions read anyways.
<br />

<br />
Deeper thoughts/emotions shouldn't be read unless that person is asking for help.  I get people who come to me and ask me for advice on a lot of strange situations... so I do some deeper readings to understand their perspective.  I believe they understand on an intuitive level that I can read their surface thoughts/emotions, and therefore ask me for advice because they want me to read a little deeper, and see what I come up with.  They might not SAY that, but that's the feeling I get from them.
<br />

<br />
Very deep scans I rarely do.  Usually that's only for close friends and family members, who I am very worried about, and/or very serious about helping them.  For example, after my parents got divorced, my dad was an emotional wreck.  I used to read him very deep without his permission, with the intent on helping him heal from the divorce.  Very deep scans should never serve my own desires... they should always serve the person I'm scanning.  I.e., I should never deep scan someone so that I can benefit.  I should only be able to benefit in an indirect manor - for example, if I deep scanned my dad, and gave him some advice that would help him, then I would also benefit indirectly because he would be happier to be around.
<br />

<br />
Projections I don't really do anymore.  Both empathetic projection and telepathic projection/suggestion are invasive, in my opinion.  There have been only a handful of situations where it has served me ethically.  For example, using my dad again, I used to project happy feelings to him to try and help him out.  Even then, looking back, I don't think that was the right thing to do.  But at least the intention was to help my dad out.
<br />

<br />
All projections/suggestions should be achieved through the intention-manifestation model, according to my ethics.  I also use the term &quot;transmission&quot; to describe this process.  That states that I will focus my intention on my final goal, and release that intention to the universe, &quot;for the highest good of all&quot;.  Then the people who pick up on that transmission, and want to help me out, can choose to do so on a subconscious level.  This allows me to accomplish my goals, but also allows people their right to choose to be involved without getting &quot;suggested&quot; one way or another.

			Jeez, if you're on here for 2 seconds you'll notice an overabundance of &quot;ethics&quot; here. (And don't bring up the &quot;like it or leave it&quot; because I'm not going to like something but I'm abiding so there's no reason to leave)
<br />

<br />
Anyways, when you feel energy, you're not really supposed to draw it, you're supposed to &quot;taste it&quot; meaning you can still feel the energy without actually stealing it. To do this, you should be familiar with grounding and centering first. 
<br />

<br />
They try to stay away from any of the dark arts on here for the sake of the kiddies. Also keep in mind that if there's an abundance of energy from a crowd, there's probably so much omitting from the crowd already that you can take as much as you want without making a difference. Go to a rock concert (which you probably have) and see what I mean.
