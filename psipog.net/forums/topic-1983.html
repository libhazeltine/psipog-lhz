			Hi evryone!
<br />
Sometimes it happens that I'm thinking at someone and suddenly that person appears! But most of times the people I think don't live in my town...so they haven't any businness here......
<br />

<br />
My question is...is it telepathy?

			Could you be a bit more detailed? 
<br />
Who are you thinking of? (Friend, relative, monkey etc.)
<br />
How are you thinking of them? 
<br />
How do you think &quot;at&quot; someone? 
<br />

<br />
Just answering these will help us help you.

			Do you feel like they are going to appear, or do you feel like you cause them to appear?  From the way you are describing it it sounds like some sort of precognition to me.

No, unfortunately I'm unable to do that!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

It happens with both friends and relatives..

<br />
For example...

I was walking with my brother and a friend on Saturday night, suddenly I started thinking about a friend of mine Raffaele, so i started talking about him and suddenly he stops me from behind, he was on his moped, we also greet!

			i dunno about telepathy. low scale precog. mabye your thinking of him caused him to think of you, thus hunt for you, which would be a form of TPS. although thats doubtful, since you didnt intend for him to meet you. Or did you?

It seems to me that you might be sensing them instead. Perhaps thinking about them is your subconscious's way of alerting you to approaching people. It's either that or precognition.

Because when in the class someone has to be interrogated I sense who's the selected....e.g if the selected one is on my right side.......I feel something on my right side

This amde me remember something a friend once told me.  If you see the future, and see that something horrible is going to happen, and you try to prevent it and actually do prevent it, something worse will happen in its place.

It sounds like:
<br />

<br />
FINAL DESTINATION hihi............
<br />

<br />
I believe that we can change our future in ev'ry moment,
<br />
then...why do we have this precogs?
<br />

<br />
.........................God may write its book, but I will live by myself, It may help me or not....but I will always follow my choices........however...at the end we got to vanish..........but I'll try to live forever by my actions, my feelings, my friends, my story etc....in other words, by myself!

			Without too many concrete details it could be coincidence.  I once had a couple of dreams that sort of came true.  But they are exceptions and they were no different to other dreams I've had so I think it was coincidence there too. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
