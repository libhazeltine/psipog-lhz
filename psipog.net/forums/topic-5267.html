			Okay.
<br />
For those of you who dont know anything about reiki, go to aetw.org.  Im sorry, its a little deep for me to explain totally.
<br />

<br />
My reiki master (teacher/instructor/&quot;spiritual guidance councellor&quot;) thinks I am an empath.  Is this psychic? or is it just emotional?
<br />

<br />
I believe that she is a telepathic catalyst. (if thats the right term...)
<br />
Whenever I meet with her, I gain a deeper awareness of myself, and I seem to become better at precognition, only for a short time.
<br />

<br />
We had a talk with my mother, and she told me that this is a gift, and I have it for a reason, and I need to be balanced, grounded and protected.
<br />

<br />
Well... thats all fine and dandy, but I would like to learn how to further develop this ability.
<br />

<br />
This is where Im at:
<br />

<br />
I can feel the emotional situation of someone I know when I am in thier presence.  I can feel the physical situation of my family members while Im near them, and sometimes I can just know if something is wrong when we are far apart.
<br />

<br />
Any advice as to where I can go with this ability/what I can do with it?
<br />

<br />
Much appreciated.
<br />

<br />
Thank you
<br />

<br />

''I am an empath. Is this psychic?&quot; 
<br />
&gt;&gt;:Yes. Empathy is a psychic activity. Empath simply means youve a natural skill of it and dont really need training in the aspects of using it, but controling it.
<br />

&quot;I believe that she is a telepathic catalyst. (if thats the right term...)

<br />
&gt;&gt;:Some people do that, it all depends on how your signatures and Aura correspond with each other.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Where can I go with this ability?&quot;
<br />
 &gt;&gt;: Well as for a pointer I'm afraid im sold out, except for perhaps taking up TP if you didnt already. I can speak a bit because im in your shoes as a fellow empath, I've taken up TP and am quite good with it already. Just a note you can AIM me if you want training in TP Ill help yas out

You've not provided enough information to comment on whether the empathy referenced is psionic in nature.  However, both types are valuable.

I do not recognise the term 'telepathic catalyst'.  Could you define the term?  The website you linked to was laid out in such a way that I found it a maze.  Perhaps you can link to the specific page, if it's referenced there?
<br />

<br />
As to the gaining a deeper awareness of yourself after speaking to her... that occurs after speaking to people trained in or naturally good at psychology.  It is possible that increased precog is related to an increased comfort level with your understanding of who you are.  In other words, simply being honest with yourself might have the same result.  Naturally, surrounding yourself with people that encourage you with self-honesty would be helpful.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Advice that is good for any gift, actually.  When people 'make the shot of a lifetime', they are very likely internally balanced and grounded.  However, especially with telepathy and empathy, grounding and shielding are very important.  Without those protections, the skills become unreliable.
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">I can feel the emotional situation of someone I know when I am in thier presence.

<br />

<br />
Understanding emotional bits when in someone's presence is very difficult to demonstrate as psionic empathy.  The distance bit is more easily explained as psionic empathy.  Roy was just commenting in the chat about the way that body language, vocal tones, etc, are used to communicate.  We pick up on those automatically, often without thinking about them.
<br />

<br />
The distance bit removes that possible explanation for why you know how someone feels.  The likelihood is that you will be more sensitive to family members or close friends first, because bits of 'feelers' are connected to those people naturally.  Gradually, you'll be able to pick up on people you don't know as well.
<br />

Psychometry can use empathic input.  Bevy Jaegers discusses in some of her books how she used psychometry to solve crimes, find people, make money in the stock market, and generally discover interesting information from various objects people would give her.  Pretty nifty things, imo.
<br />

<br />
Good luck,

			I think I can, &quot;Telepathic Catalist&quot; Someone that when near, you feel an ease to use Telepathy. An ease being its easier, better flowing. Some people also have the same effect with PK or Clairvoyance too.

From what Ive read, a telepathic catalyst is a person who can open and awaken the abilities of others.
<br />

<br />
Often unknowingly...
<br />

<br />

<br />
These peoople are said to know if someone is gifted in a psychic talent, and also probably have a full blown psychic telent themselves.
<br />

<br />
if you search on google, it tells you more.
<br />

<br />
As for the website, thats for reiki.
<br />

<br />
it is hard to get used to the navagation, but once you do, its probably one of the most in depth sites about reiki that ive ever seen.
