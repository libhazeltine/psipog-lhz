			I can heal almost any minor ailment from headaches, to bruises; cuts, to soap in the eyes. Although i cant heal a flu or fever because by the time i think about doing so i'm usally to sick to concentrate on it. Also I don't like to heal other people for ethical and moral reasons.

			I've seemed to increase my immuneity, that's as great it'll get when it gets to results.

I've tried cuts, and it looks liked it was healing a bit faster, but I don't know how long cuts would take to heal.

Is scars possible to heal with PK?

			Same experience here. Just a minute or so concentrating on a headache or some other small pains and they're gone. Nifty tool, this biofeedback or whatever it is called <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			I once had a fractured knee cap, and my doctor said that it healed 25% faster than normal.  I don't recall attempting to heal myself, but I was really freaking determined to get back on my feet.  I think self healing may be in part determination.  Perhaps it is just the subconsious speeding up and prioritizing of a certain normal task that makes results appear so quickly.  I tried a little experiment later on.  I happened to get a cut on a shelf while pulling my hand out of it.  I focused entirely on the cut, not (at least, not purposefully) with spionics.  I was just being aware that it was present and that I wanted it to heal.  It was about a centimerter long, one fourth of a centimeter wide, and it's hard to say how deep, but I think it was about 1/5 of a centimeter deep.  It healed in aproximately two and a half hours without any evidence of originally being there.  I don't get enough cuts to estimate how long it would normally take to heal, but I think it would take longer than two and a half hours under normal circumstances.

			I've done it to remove slight headaches, but nothing else. However, it usually only takes me a few moments to get rid of the pain. I would not recommend trying to use psi to cure exhaustion headaches, you'll probably only make things worse, just sleep to get rid of them.

			I have healed myself at an alarming rate.  I had hernia surgery, in october, my doctor said that I would have pain for the next 4 weeks after the surgery, but after three days, I didn't have any pain unless I really did something stupid.  He was surprised that I could simply walk into the office without crutches on my 1 week checkup.  Unfortunately, he still made me wait the 8 weeks till he gave me release to go back to my martial arts.

Hard question to answer, I would have to say it would make you more tired and mabye even more damaged. Kinda like using oil to put out an oil based fire.
