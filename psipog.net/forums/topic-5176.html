			dammit these &quot;ghosts&quot; as some call them are really annoying me i believe.
<br />
also i do not believe in ghosts i believe in that they are some type of electrostatic entity that is created from the brain at death and birth. i think im a bit sensitive to these as im constantly getting the &quot;chills&quot; that ppl claim to get. only mine are ALOT stronger. my entire body is tightened and it isnt as much as a chill and it causes my eyes to water normally dropping tears. i also recieve some messages and do hear things. ive actually been under my bed and began hearing very strange noises than jumped up yelling HOLY SH*** and luckily my dad knew something scared me.
<br />

<br />
anyway they really have been doing that thing to make my spine shiver alot and whenever i walk it makes my arms jsut shake like in a siezure but only for about a second so it looks like a huge twitch and i think perhaps they may be trying to get inside me or something and this makes me kinda afraid to OBE because i know seeing these there will scare the living hell outta me and might attack me.
<br />

<br />
anyway(Again) could someone perhaps help me out?

			I believe you, and I think it would be a good idea to try communicating with them telepathically... or just tell them to leave you alone.  I don't pretend to be an expert on this subject, but if they are trying to get inside you they probably want to tell you something, so listen, and then they might go away.

Edit: (Apollo) Please don't lock this thread, I saw in another thread you said talking about spirits = life after death = religion, but... it's really interesting, and unless someone starts talking about what exactly spirits are, can't we all just accept they <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> exist?
