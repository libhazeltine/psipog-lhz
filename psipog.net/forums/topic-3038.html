			Since I started practicing telekinesis last night, I've noticed a few things to help me start and stuff, and I've also noticed today a few weird things with my psi wheel. I tend to leave it up, rather than having to set it back up every time.
<br />

<br />
Twice now, out of the corner of my eye while focusing on other stuff (make it three times, it just did it again), the psi wheel will move itself. There's no AC on down here in my basement. It's a good distance from me, so I'm not breathing on it. Nor are there any fans on. So that makes three times I seem to have telekineticly moved it without even looking at the thing.
<br />

<br />
A while ago, I even noticed that the psi wheel was off the pin and upside down next to it, as though it had been flicked off by something. I have no memory of taking it off, so unless I just had a horrible memory spurt, I seem to have managed to knock it off the pin without noticing.
<br />

<br />
Although I'm amazed to be able to have made this much progress this fast, I was wondering if anyone had any tips to help me use this more on command. I can already now a little bit, but it's only once in a while, and even then, these random acts tend to be more responsive than actual attempts.

			Hammit, this is getting annoying. I've noticed it do it another 4-5 times since I've made the post. I wanna be able to actually control this and use it when I want, not occasionally have a psi wheel spin a bit when I'm busy with something else.

			Either it could be wind from you breathing across the room, or that its just faked movement by tricks of the eye.

No, this is almost always when my face is at least a good two feet from it. And I'll look at it and it'll keep spinning for a second or two, then stop.

			it could be your subconsios acting out your desire .
<br />

<br />
you could  use hypnosis to get it under consious control. i did that with my subconsious kept deactivating my shield wile i was practicing them (im clostrophobic,)now it only does that whan im in no danger or am overtired. my friend used it to gain proper controle of his empahy.(he felt it was an invasion of privacy&amp; he shode only do it consiously that and he was starting to feel peoples physical paine)
<br />

<br />
.just a suggestion  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> (im not sure how most psions feel about hypnosis) some other groups (occult or otherwise )dont like it

			It's probably happening cause it happened once, then you began to expect it to happen and look for it.  Expect it to happen when you are tryin to do it.

			Sometimes mine is at a bad angle and just rolls off the pin...but I doubt it would happen that often. For the spinning out of the corner of your eye, put a mark or something (if you are allowed to, that is) by one of the edges. If you see it &quot;move&quot; check to see if it is still lined up with the edge.
<br />

<br />
It may help to &quot;color-code&quot; each edge (one edge blue, one green, etc.), so you know if it's the same edge or not. I'm probably going into way too much detail then is necessary, but I'm just trying to think of all the ways you could dismiss it, and prevent that from happening.
<br />

<br />
I know this is most likely going a bit too far, but you could write down which colored edge was lined up so you would remember it easier.
<br />

<br />
With practice, you will be able to control it and make it spin when you want to...just keep practicing!
