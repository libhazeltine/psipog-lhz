			I am 21+yrs old currently intxcd.
<br />

<br />
First off BIG THANKS to all you regulars... Peebrian, thank you for PSIPOG it helped so much!
<br />

<br />
Wow... welll I've been coming to PSIPOG for the past few years.. a year or two ago I messed around with trying to move a psiwheel.. I was able to do it but dismissed it as Air currents. lol
<br />

<br />
I started back a week ago.. with ease I moved the wheel... problem was when I put it under a cup couldnt make it move from a  distance...
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I've been practing for the past week.. eventually I decided to use a bigger paper psi wheel w/o a cup and got it to spin real good.. then I put the plasic purple cup over it WHILE i was still spinning the psiwheel, I WAS ABLE TO DO IT!!!!
<br />

<br />
I stopped it.. THen waited, then got it spinning again! TK IS REAL!!! 100% POSITIVE!
<br />

<br />
By keeping the connection ACTIVE once the wheel was covered I figured out how to do it..
<br />

<br />
It's AWESOME! AFter I was done I tried to blow on the cup, do anythign I could.. NO AIR CURRENTS! I PROVED TK to myself!! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
After I was bored with that I was spinning 2 psiwheels at the same time in different directions!!!!! Started to try to move a small coffee straw to no avail.. YET! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I did this for about 30 minutes all thanks to you guys! You made a difference! Thank you so much!
<br />

<br />
The HARDEST part about TK is BELIEVING or KNOWING it exists, TRULY BELIEVING!
<br />

<br />
I was reading and re-reading article and forum post everyday when I practiced TK. When I first started a year or two ago I had a hard time really believing.. There was always some doubt, but I SWEAR guys you helped so much!
<br />

<br />
THe videos showing TK, watching them, really helped. You have no idea.. It took me about a year to finally believe.. But now I do! And it feels like the possiblities are ENDLESS!
<br />

<br />
Not Important was specially helpfull... as was PeeBrain of course. NI reminded me there is &quot;NO THOUGHT&quot; no MAKING the wheel move, just loving it and asking it to move.. Eventually I felt as if my hands had some type of MANGETIC power... 
<br />

<br />
right now I can only move things with my hands... I can do only one hand or two hands if I want. Meaning I have to have my hand near the object to FEEL the forcefield like magnetic like connection. It's wierd the psiwheel FOLLOWS my hand as if it was a magnetic when I want to.
<br />

<br />
So the next thing Im goign to try is rolling a straw. I took me about 5 days of practice EVERYDAY for about 40 - 30 minutes before I got results.. Just relaxing, trying to BECOME the psiwheel...
<br />

<br />
Awesome.. I can do it without even trying now... I LOVE YOU GUYS! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Hey it gives me something to do at work.
<br />

<br />
Again,  I think the HARDEST part was getting over the DOUBT.
<br />

<br />
The next hardest part was PRACTICE and PATIENCE!
<br />

<br />
Without a doubt.
<br />

<br />
Anyway I got a headache because I was doing it for like 1 1/2 hours today... I was all zapped out. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
ALSO do you guys end up seeing AURAS of objects after practicing TK?
<br />

<br />
Thank you for PSIPOG!
<br />

			Also some things I might think might be important to someone trying this...
<br />

<br />
I beleive there is no such thing as TIME or SPACE.. That everything exists at the same non-existant point. Therefore moving something with my mind is no problem.
<br />

<br />
I kept telling myself this while doing this...
<br />

<br />
Also I felt lots of heat and energy off my hands.. But I'm sure it didn't matter as the psi wheel was in an upside down CUP.
<br />

<br />
That was the biggest step. After first I coudl only get it to sort of JUMP left to right.. like holding a magnetic on something... After about 10 - 30 minutes I finally got a good spin going.. I would go from no cup to cup every now and then..
<br />

<br />
There is no thought, no force, no makign it move.. you just become passive and try to feel a force field around the object, become the object, feel the object, and once you feel that field you can just move it. It's like moving your hand.... You have to keep your mind clear though.. A few thoughts here and there of course.. but try to keep it clear...
<br />

<br />
Once you get it spinning good without a CUP then add the cup with the other hand while it's spinning.. THen move your hands around teh outside of the cup if it stops spinning.. trying to find the ponit where it connects... if no connection the remove the cup and spin again without cup.. then repeat...

You were probably seeing colors (which you thought was auras) due to staring at the object for a long period of time. It's called afterimage. Look it up.

Take care.

About the Aura's.
<br />

<br />
Yep. Although i can turn my energy-vision on/off on command. It usually turns itself on after or during a PKsession. My vision isn't really strong or colorfull. But, strong enough to 'see' 'it'.

			I see auras everywhere.  I can focus, or be staring into space and they'll become clearer, but after PK, or meditation I can see them much clearer - and it can last days.
