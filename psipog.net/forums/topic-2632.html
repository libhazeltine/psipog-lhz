			I have tried a few ways to astral project such as mantra-ing until you reach a state, that I guess is close to projection. My own recollection was a hand with an engagement ring on the finger reaching out in darkness torwards me, when I tried the first time... But I don't believe I've had an experience you'd call a true astral projection. I've heard more than one method to try.. I'm very immaginative. I visualize well. I've been in what you could call deep states of meditation. Any advice on some techniques or sources of info would be appreciated. - peace to all -

<br />

<br />
forget it!
<br />

<br />
there is no easy way to make it. To go into astral you dont need a good method. The sucess doesnt ! depend on method. It depends on you.
<br />

<br />
Sample
<br />

<br />
You can dont make any method, simply say i can go into obe now.And you will.
<br />
The more conscious you will be awake, the more dreams comes true - you will be conscious in dreams ( they wont be, simple, dreams.. )

			The easiest method I've found (and the one I use) is the one that's featured in Chapter 11 of The Everything Psychic Book. Be advised, some stuff in that book is pretty fluffy (some earlier chapters talk about &quot;Spirit Guides&quot;).
<br />

<br />
But it's a pretty good source if you're looking for AP techniques.

			although i recomend monroe's method of OBEing, i will say that i agree with fov_ness. You can try every single technique there is but most of them wont work for YOU i found that if i followed instructions to much it totally puts me off the OBE. make your own way, experiment with different techniques, mix them together. keep a diary of what techniques work the best for different stages and then you can make your own &quot;technique&quot;. for example you might find that monroe's focus levels work the best for relaxing the body and the rope method works best for exiting.

			Hey soulofstrings,
<br />

<br />
The best techniques I've found to astral project have been on the free courses at mysticweb.org
<br />
It sets out very clearly exactly what you need to astral project.  They have a range of different techniques (mantras &amp; different concentration exercises...), and it really helps in giving you the tools you need to have some success with it! 
<br />
I highly recommend it.
<br />

<br />
all the best,
<br />

<br />
Toby
