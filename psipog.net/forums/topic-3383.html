			Here I will share my ideas of how to detect minor psi-wheel movement. They might also (and are intendet to) add methods to scientifically prove and measure psi-effects on physical objects (PK). Therefore, this thread might also fit into the &quot;Science&quot;- Section of tis forum. But since I am only referring to PK effects, I felt it belonged here.
<br />
Since I am a new poster in these forums, other people might have come up with similar ideas too. If so, please tell me / link the thread.
<br />

<br />
I developed this idea while I was practising on my first psi-wheel. It was made of a 10cm x 10 cm sized piece of rather thick aluminum foil.
<br />
While I was practising, I first used the wheel uncovered and then covered.
<br />
Yet I came across a slight problem. 
<br />
I often close my eyes while trying to achieve a thought-free state of mind. It just helps me (and probably many other people too) to concentrate when my eyes don't constantly flood my mind with information.
<br />
Sometimes, I try to move the wheel with my eyes closed.
<br />
Yet, since I can often hardly remember in which rotational position the wheel was before the attempt, I can never be sure wether or not the wheel moved while I had my eyes shut. This might be especially annoying if the wheel had turned by (more or less exactly) 90?, 180?, 270?, 360? and so on.
<br />
And even with my eyes fixed on the wheel, it might be that I just don't notice the wheel moving because the movement is so slight (I'm not yet very good at moving anything yet).
<br />
So, I came up with a method similar to the Cavendish-Experiment. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_balance" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_balance</a>
<br />
The idea behind it is a simple  law of optics: angle of entry = angle of exit (or something like this). Now, if a beam of light hits a reflective surface, it is reflected back a a certain angle, which according to the above law, is the same as the angle of the light beam relative to the reflective surface. Thus, by looking at the beam that is reflected (and to be able to observe it, hits a surface [a wall, that would be]), we can tell wether and how much the incoming beam has been rotated.
<br />
Now, trying to move the light source (laser pointer, flash light) as a weak PK is rather hard/impossible.
<br />
The clue is to not rotate the source, but the mirror (reflective surfce, whatever). We could also write the above law, angle A = angle B, in a different form: rotation(mirror) = 2 x rotation(exiting beam). Thus, if a PK would be able to rotate a very lightweight mirror (such as a reflecting psi-wheel), at which a beam of light shines, then the reflected beam would move 2 times as fast as the wheel. Furthermore, since that reflected beam of light will somewhere hit a wall, I can take my pencil and mark the position where the beam hits the wall (before and after attempting TK).
<br />

<br />
If somebody tells me how to upload images to this forum, I might post a little scheme of how I think this might work.
<br />

<br />
As more practical suggestions, the idea of an exactly pyramid-shaped psi-wheel made of well-reflecting aluminum foil might fit the purpose the best. For the light source, I suggest a commercial low-power laser pointer (like the ones used for presentations). WARNING: Laser Pointers are dangerous. Especially to your eyes. I cannot be held responsible for ANY stupidities and injuries. If you do anything, you do so at your own risk. (If this was a strictly European Forum, I would not write a disclaimer. But since it's most likely American, I do.) 
<br />
So, if you use your dad's laboratory-sized 200W CO2-Infrared Laser and blow your eyeball out, not my concern. 
<br />

<br />
Another important point: since normal aluminum-foil psi-wheels are extremely sensitive to air movement (even my computers ventilation was able to rotate it), the wheel will have to be (!) covered by a transparant bowl, bucket, whatever, which seals off all air movement. Only this way it's possible to ensure that wind will not affect the experiment. As for other wind-based unwanted influences, many people have suggested thermal air convections within the covered space. I have yet no idea how to limit these effects. If you have a suggestion, please post it.
<br />

			oooor you could just keep trying until you can move it?
<br />
is easier to learn PK if you see it live. like the other day i showed this guy the psi-wheel thing over cam, then rolled a can. took me a while to get it going but after he was it he could do it =D this also happens when i teach my friends. its the beleif part. once you have sen it for yourself, you dont need to beleive really, as you know its possible.
<br />

<br />
besides, you shine a light on the the wheel, it creates heat. warm air rises, tin foil etc you get the idea...

			Or you could maybe draw a different coloured dot on each corner of the wheel? Much easier...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

 Haha that was my idea exactly! I acually did that once before but that was before I could even move the wheel... And as it was stated before I just learned by with my eyes open... simple as that.
