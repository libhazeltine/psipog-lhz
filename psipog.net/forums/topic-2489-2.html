that is a different occation.  You are alone and therefore you are targetted.  In psionics, no one is together so people would have an extremely less chance of them choosing you.  They would need to link you with something else too.  They cant just say, &quot;ok, i will attack someone in China&quot;.  They have to connect to a specific person.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
I find it difficult to agree with what you say 'no one is together'. Technically, could I just 'gang up' with a friend if I wanted to? (not going to continue that train of thought due to no-combat rule). Keep in mind that in the world of psionics, there is no 'police', and no 'punishments' - that in itself is a great motivator. The most you can do is call a more experienced friend and say 'help, this is happening to me', while IRL you're allowed to dial 911. 
<br />

<br />
Keep in mind also that distance seems to be a moot point in psionics. Someone in china could seem just like me walking down a dark road late at night.

			Motive is anything that'll get someone to do anything.

Sure, there is a chance of someone attacking another with psionics, but you have a higher chance of dying from food being lodge in your throat then a psionics attack.

Does it really matter? I mean, if shielding makes you feel good, then who cares? It's not going to do anything negitive but help with your skills. Just don't blame everything on psionics.

			Pardon my n00bness, but what exactly is 'hacking'?  Is it forceful mind reading or telepathic suggestion?

Oh, and I did do a forum search on this; most hits merely mention it in passing and at the moment I haven't time to read each of them.

			I hate all the different telepathy terms for the same thing. For what we're talking about here, these are the words I've came across to describe it:
<br />

<br />
hacking
<br />
scanning
<br />
probing
<br />
mind-reading
<br />
telepathy
<br />
linking
<br />

<br />
wow. I'd say hacking is reading thoughts from other people's links.
<br />
scanning is reading surface thoughts
<br />
probing is the right word for this, searching through memories and/or surface thoughts
<br />
mind-reading is the same as scanning
<br />
telepathy is all of the above (and below)
<br />
linking is making an energy path between the target and you.
<br />

<br />
I've heard scanning being used to describe searching through memories, like probing, many times. So I just wish that there was an article that officially defined all of the telepathy terms.

I have no idea what hacking is either. But it sounds like a collection of different abilities working together. Linking with someone, getting into their head to read their thoughts and/or memories, and perhaps even trying to exert some control on their mind. Is such a thing as hacking even possible? Believing in psiballs, shields, and other constructs and stuff is well and good, but I'm still kind of skeptical about these advanced things I hear about.
<br />

<br />
What does hacking feel like exactly? Everybody who's been hacked before, describe what it was like.
<br />

<br />
Every once in a while, I feel something thats like a tingling all over the surface of my head. Sometimes this tingle is just in certain areas, sometimes widespread. Sometimes it's my whole head, sometimes it's one side of my head, sometimes it's little spread out areas. It never touches my neck or face, just the head. And I kinda feel a bit of pressure against my head from the outside pressing in. Not a physical pressure, but the kind I often feel if I'm trying to control a bit of energy outside of my body. Is that what it feels like to be the subject of a hacking attempt? If it is, whoever it is didn't get in as far as I know. xD I've never felt anything give as if they've broken past or something. Even when I didn't know what psionics is, I've never felt that feeling change in any way. So either they couldnt get in, or that feeling means they were already in. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I havn't been practicing any psionics for a while. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> I should get back into it. I do have a few more posts to make around here about new stuff I've tried or thought up.

			Hacking is the forceful entering of anothers mind and can be used to collect information, insert information(like memories) and other stuff I can't remember...

Amaroq: I'm not sure if you were hacked but sounds like what I feel..kind of a wierd pressure that you can't exactly locate in your head and it's not really physical..hard to describe. <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" />

			Okay most psions can feel energy, either they can feel the spot where they are being link, feel the energy constantly around them(pressure thats the pressure you guys are talking about) Most psions can only do one energy sense from common to uncommon, 1 feeling energy, 2 seeing energy, least common 3 hearing energy. Hackers can do all of those sensing energy things, all hackers can feel energy, and most of them can see it( they can physically see the memory files that you have, they can look through you eyes, they can not hear what is happening but the seeing is what gives them the most information). The rarest of them all is hearing energy, sure a lot of people can hear a ping or other small bits of energy ,( it sounds like a bell) but as I said only small bits of energy(to be able to hear someones thoughts you have to be able to hear the energy, one out of a millon psions can do this naturally, allthough with practice expert psions can). 
<br />

<br />
This ends my comment on why there is pressure and on special psions.
