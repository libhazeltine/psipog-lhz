			Ok.  The very fact that I am here and talking flies against everything I've ever been taught about this.  Empathy and telepathy (if they differ at all) run in the family, and I have always been told never ever to tell anyone I don't completely trust.  But I'm frightened, and I need more help than I can get at home.
<br />

<br />
I've always picked up on other people.  I don't like it, and I feel very rude doing it, but I can't help it.  until this year, it's only been an occasional real problem, as long as I avoided crowds.  This year, I guess my natural shields have been weakened or something by everything that happend (lots of family members near death, then the hurricane).  But it's no longer at a point where I can handle it.  Right after Katrina...the evacuees a lot of them stayed with their children in the dorm.  It pushed me so far over the edge I was already near to that I am only now being able to answer my phone, and I only a few months ago began living in my room again, instead of spending most of my waking hours in the closet.
<br />

<br />
I'm not the helpless type.  I looked up shielding right from the start, and I've been trying to do it.  I center, I ground, I bring up the shield and power it.  I do it every night, and every morning, and any time I'm walking and have a moment to think it through.  It calms me down momentarily, but it doesn't seem to have any effect in protecting me.
<br />

<br />
Is there something else I can do?  Because I couldn't handle bloody exam time-I kept getting everyone else's anxiety, to such a degree that it was a very good thing my own exams were easy and that I'd prepared for them well before exam week.  And if I couldn't handle that...the hurricanes are coming, and next to them, exam time will be a walk in the park.
<br />

<br />
Does practicing help?  If you practise doing these things, does it make it easier to block them?  Or to not do them?  Not that I currently have much of an outlet to practise, but if it would help me to <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> pick up on people, I would find somone willing to practise with me.

			I have a similar story to share. Precognition runs in my family. Since childhood I have always had deja vu, visions, etc... It freaked me out for a long time. It seemed like I really shouldn't know these things. So I did a search on it, and lo and behold psipog came up. They had links to other helpful sites that helped me to understand what it was and how to live with it/control it. I finally realized, &quot;I am special because of this. I am unique.&quot; I played games with my precog and generally began to enjoy something that I thought at first was a curse. The trick is to learn to enjoy your abilities and use them to your advantage. I hope this cleared a few things up. I also practice telepathy if you would be interested in practicing together. My AIM is Anarchy4ever1991 and my MSN is <a href="#">kenPO_OPeration@hotmail.com</a>.

			Well, keep practicing energy manipulation so you can make better shields. If you don't have enough time before the hurricanes and such, just keep making shields on top of each other, as many shields per day as you can until it's &quot;quiet&quot;.

			It wasn?t until yesterday that I believed in shields. Try and try they just were a visual until finding a solution to solid thoughts  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> . Repetition was good along with using other skills such as meditation to strengthen the shield.

			Sorry to hear about how hard things are for you right now.  Empathy can be a useful skill, really.
<br />

<br />
Yes, practicing does help.  Something else that makes a difference is setting time frames for your shields.  I have a specific time (including an alarm set on my nifty phone) that I reshield.  I always set the time for my shield to expire several hours after that, in case something comes up and I don't get to reset my shields at the scheduled time.
<br />

<br />
If you have the ability to go to a park or other similar outside type area, that can provide you a bit of a break.  Rain has mentioned that pine trees like to munch the excess energy we give off, so those places are 'cleaner' than others just because of the trees.  Not to mention it's harder for 'stuff' to hang around outside.
<br />

<br />
Something we did when we moved into our current house is put bowls of salt around (it was a rather energetically dirty house).  Yes, I know this sounds silly, but salt really does absorb excess energy.  At times, I've 'played' with the salt in the bowls to help me get excess energy off my hands.
<br />

<br />
Another helpful bit is to be sure your field is clean.  One of the best, albeit rather odd, ways to help clean your field is to rattle around yourself.  Yes, a rattle.  Rain has mentioned it on various occasions.  Take a rattle (rice in a container works) and rattle it around you.  After I rattle, I like to imagine water falling over me, removing any of the remaining energy and taking it down the drain.  For whatever reason, it disrupts the field around you and cleans it.
<br />

<br />
First and foremost however, I would suggest working on your shields.  Practice helps shields too.
<br />

<br />
Good luck,
<br />
