			i know you all get the see-saw effect when you sleep after a day youve been swimming. but is that the real effect? i dont think it is, i think the astral body recreates the movement because switching from water to land. but dose anyone know if swimming really dose help?

			the see-saw effect is when your body feels like your swaying from right to left like a see-saw. (couldnt imagine it being more simple than that)
<br />

<br />
I dont know.. never tried it. That sounds like a pretty good idea though. Compare the two.

			Cant see how it would.. It generally only happens when you're swimming in the ocean, or in a wave pool I guess.. I would think its just because you're tired from swimming and the repeated motions. I never get it when I do laps in a pool.

			last night i felt like i was swaying or something (cant remeber exactly what because it only lasted a few seconds). How do I make it longer?
<br />

<br />
Also, when I was spending the night at my friend's house I think i was dreaming. But anyways I got up and it looked kind of like his room but a little different and I saw some food on a table that is not actually in his room. Then I woke up and my chest hurt for a second as if I had landed in it but I'm not sure. Can anyone explain this?

			Hmm... I think I know what you're talking about. Last time I felt the see-saw effect, however, was after a cruise, first night when I got home. After getting used to sleeping far above the ocean on a ship, dry land is definitely different enough to cause it.

			no... way different. The falling effect would be more comparable to being dizzy.

			I think the see-saw effect is biofeedback, mostly... your body is used to see-sawing and thus you get used to it, so when you stop your body still thinks you are see-sawing, and hence the seesaw effect.
<br />

<br />
Not having attempted an OBE with the seesaw effect (mostly because I haven't been out on the water in years), I can't comment on how it may effect OBEs. My guess is that it would be a minor distraction, but that's about all - though you may be able to use it to trigger a deeper and deeper trance in the same way that I use random outside noises.

			That sometimes happens to me but only in my hands when I make psi balls.  I guess I'll try to do that when I start to learn OBEs and astral projection.

			I can create the &quot;see-saw&quot; effect almost anywhere at anytime as long as i am lying down.  Never really thought about what it was.  But ive learned to control it.
