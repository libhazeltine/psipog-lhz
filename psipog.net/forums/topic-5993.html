<br />

<br />
Lots of people said they are interested in living in the forest, so I came up with forest buddies where we could all live in the same forest. So this is a thread where you give the stats on your forest ideas and then maybe we can all decide on our forest. You should follow my format:
<br />

<br />
Age- 15
<br />
Forest Location- Undecided, maybe Wyoming, New York, Maine, something like that.
<br />
Hardcore ness with the forest- Middle, could do with a cabin but okay with out I guess. 
<br />
Experience- Not much, I have done camping and have a forest book though!
<br />
Plan- My plan is to finish High School, go to College, get a good job, make a good amount of money, and then buy 50-100 acres of land out in the forest and maybe get a cabin. If we are forest buddies we can put our money together and get more land or more cabins. 
<br />
Other- I need a river in my forest, I need some grasslands and then lots of trees, a mountain would be nice too. 
<br />
Seriousness- Pretty serious, I do want to live in a forest. 
<br />

<br />
That's all I could think of, if you are interested in living in a forest maybe we can decide on the same one and the same year to move in.

Yeah, it does sound kinda gay. But it isn't meant that all of my buddies live in the same cabin and stuff and do &quot;gay&quot; things. It means that we live in the same forest. Do you have any idea how big 100 acres is? It is big man. I probably wouldn't even see them, I like to keep to myself, but we could hang out.

			Well, I never saw the 'What do you want' Thread, but this still sounds intriguing.
<br />
Age- 16 
<br />
Forest Location- The Appalacians. &lt;3 Shenandoah.
<br />
Hardcore ness with the forest- All I'd need is something to keep the rain off. Tent is fine, tarp-on-a-string woud probably be fine.
<br />
Experience- Lots of camping. I'm a Girl Scout in a 3-person group, so I've learned how to camp without a lot of people or things.
<br />
Plan- Finish High School, get through College, and write or do Physics experiments or something whilst living in the woods. I'm an amateur radio operator, so I could probably rig some way of contacting the Outside!
<br />
Other- The Shenandoah area matches your requirements, somefatguy. 80-ft waterfalls enough river and mountain for ya?
<br />
Seriousness- I would leap at the chance to go live surrounded by the woods. So I'm pretty serious.
<br />

<br />
And, HA!! The second person to respond favorably is FEMALE! So your 'bunch of guys' complaint is officially NULL! (Well, at the moment.)

<br />
I don't like I mine living there on summer vactions or something, but like Niushirra said its pointless to be there full time. That and I don't want to be around bugs all the time.......things with tons of legs gross me out. Definely catapillars with a soft body body moving all them legs....like some kind of fat ugly creature or.............YUCK ITS STUCK IN MY HEAD! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH GET IT OUT! GET IT OUT!
<br />

<br />
If there are going to be girls there to drive my sexal tematsions away then I'm fine. You have to face it...there going to be there and there is going to be a conflict...deal with it..........you knew it would come to this.

			Age- 14
<br />
Forest Location- Canada or Russia or South America somewhere. Probably Canada.
<br />
Hardcore ness with the forest- Hmm, I would need basic survival gear and a tent to start off with until my homemade lean to fort thing is done.
<br />
Experience- Not much first hand experience, but I have camped a lot before and read up on living in the wilderness quite a bit.
<br />
Plan- Either run away to Canada after high school/college or get a job and after a while, live on sfg's property. Probably write a book, philosophize(sp), and improve on psionics while I'm out in the wild.
<br />
Other- Would need a river or lake. (plenty in Canada) I would also like to be in the mountains and have snow and cold every year. It would be helpful to be somewhat close to civilization just in case of emergency, but not in someone's backyard. 
<br />
Seriousness- Very serious, I would definetely help you out with money or anything when I'm older, somefatguy. If you got a place purchased somewhere, then I would do my best to make it out there. Ever since reading &quot;hatchet&quot;, I have wanted to do something like this.
<br />

<br />
Oh, and regarding the video games thing: we could lucid dream and play each other on lucid video games.

			*sigh*
<br />
Niushirra, as much as I do want to become enlightened, I also want to live in the forest. When I mean live, I mean stay. Wasting my time? Consider it my retirement. What is your suggestion for not wasting your time?
<br />

<br />
Ahh, that is good, 2 forest buddies. Problem is you both have different locations that you want. As for me Shenandoah!! I have never heard of it but I do like your description. Thanks Amthyst. And I am fine with Amthyst being a girl as well. Fakiti, Canada is not my choice because of it's temperature problem. It gets way too cold. 
<br />
And I still feel that the gayness thing is still in the air...did I not explain it well enough. 100 acres is big. But how much does 100 acres in Shenandoah cost?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />
So when you guys are ready for the forest just e-mail me at: <a href="#">somefatguy7@yahoo.com</a>

			No time to make a reply but I'll give you a good one later fatman. I don't think it's gay. I think you need to be pretty mature and extremely strong-willed in order to do something like this, which I will do  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ...Give you specifics later fatman.

			Really 100 acres isn't that big? I used to have just 1 acre and it was big to me...maybe it's because I'm fat...
<br />
I see your point about the coldness, but then you would definetly need a good shelter and then, where are you going to get your food? Everything is hibernating and all of the plants are gone too! 
<br />

<br />
derricktheone: Yes, I would get skinny. 
<br />

<br />
Okay, last night I was talking to my mom's boyfriend about money and all this stuff. I asked him how much that amount of land would cost and etc. But man, this is going to be really tough. I don't think I can buy all of that shit by myself. I would need a damn good job. 
<br />
He didn't really know how much the land would cost but he did say compared to 5 years ago, it is a hell of a lot more money. And then he was talking about paying stuff off. And I would still have to pay taxes on the property! And then, if I build a cabin the taxes increase because I have a home there! And then, if you have a river or a water source on your land the price is also increased! Can I ever win!?

			Well fatman the land price is hugely affected on where your buying the land also. 2nd, I live near Windsor, Ontario and it is waaay too cold here in the winter to be living anywhere outside. Bums die in the big cities because it's too cold. (And that's just southern Ontario, most other places are same or colder) 
<br />

<br />
Age: 20
<br />

<br />
Forest Location- Somewhere it's never below 60* out. That Shenandoah sounds perfect if it's warm. Also it must be VERY secluded. I don't want to see anyone walking around the forest with a damn McDonalds cup. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hardcore ness with the forest&quot;- I'd have a meduim sized cabin. No electricity or plumbing or anything. Just somewhere else to rest sometime and keep rain away when you'd like.
<br />

<br />
Experience- Camping, cooking, hunting, exercising (keep in shape)
<br />

<br />
Plan- I'm in college to be a cop now so I'd like to do that a few years and travel various places in the world. Hopefully find a woman who would like to live in the woods with me on the way <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> . Then after I've done most things I've ever wanted to do, I'd head for the forest. Guessing mabye when I'm around 28-35.
<br />

<br />
Other- It's not that I've always wanted to live in a forest, it's that I've always wanted to get away from society. I hate almost everthing about our civilization and the way we're raising kids. It's all a materialistic, money hungry, way of life. All we're taught to do in this society is get a job, make money, make kids, pass it on. I plan on leaving everything about this life behind. (Except for my mental and psi abilities <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> )
<br />

<br />
Seriousness- I am going to do this. Finding a woman may affect on when I'll do it, but I will do it. (Even if I can't find a woman to do it, I would still go, just mabye not forever. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> ) Even if I did come back after I would never view it as wasting my life. I honestly believe living a life like most people do now, is wasting a life.

Then after I've done most things I've ever wanted to do, I'd head for the forest. Guessing mabye when I'm around 28-35.

<br />
Other- It's not that I've always wanted to live in a forest, it's that I've always wanted to get away from society. I hate almost everthing about our civilization and the way we're raising kids. It's all a materialistic, money hungry, way of life. All we're taught to do in this society is get a job, make money, make kids, pass it on. I plan on leaving everything about this life behind. (Except for my mental and psi abilities <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> )
<br />

<br />
Seriousness- I am going to do this. Finding a woman may affect on when I'll do it, but I will do it. (Even if I can't find a woman to do it, I would still go, just mabye not forever. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> ) Even if I did come back after I would never view it as wasting my life. I honestly believe living a life like most people do now, is wasting a life.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I like the way you think, I also am doing it because I don't like the society. If you are going to find a woman who wants to live in a forest....she might be kinda manly. (no offense to Amthyst)
