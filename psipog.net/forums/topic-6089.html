			I've only heard it as &quot;burn out,&quot; and besides you must be doing something wrong if you're getting headachs.  You need to re think your methods, possibly start meditating.
<br />

<br />
Are you forcing it? are you trying to feel a &quot;push&quot; of energy and using that to move the object.  Are you -trying-.  You should mearly have the thought in your head and let your sub-c do the work.  You don't do anything.  If it moves sporatically then your sub-c is doing fine, just learn to work from that.

 I already do mediate at least a hour a day, Jynx493

If someone could just give me a bit of information on it, it would be really helpful.

Such as how long they normally last, ways to lessen the headaches, asprin doesnt do much, ect ect </span></span>

Wrong, that's totally incorrect. The method you explained is the Just do it method. however, there are other methods. Such as feeling energy, and feeling the object move and yes, trying to move it! Please be open minded, and find out all the facts, before leading someone the wrong way. 
<br />

<br />
Also, to your question, I've never really had this but eating foods such as chocolate and strawberries has been said to help. Also, rest, and don't worry about any psi work or things like that.
<br />

<br />
Good luck with your practices!
<br />

			I'm doing it based on my experience.

I don't -push- or force it, and you shouldn't.  You let it flow or let your sub-c &quot;just do it.&quot;  I don't know maybe it's just me, still I found this only happens when you force it or are using a method that makes you exert to mush energy.
<br />

<br />
Oh, and when I did get a burn out from over doing it it took me about a month to get over the daily headachs.  Once, again it was because I was forcing it...  becareful how long you practice with a headach, it will do more damage in the long run.

Same goes for me. When I first started PK I was forcing it and got headaches when I did. Now it doesn't matter how long or often I practice for, I never get headaches. Even when I try to move something huge like a couch. No headaches. I use the same method as you by &quot;letting&quot; it move.

			Hey, whatever works for you, should be the method that you use!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  But, just know that there are other methods besides the just do it method, which work. So, when your giving out information, make sure you let that be known. Also, your right, its not good to force PK, but you can try to make it happen. There is a delicate balance, at least that's what I've found from my experience!
