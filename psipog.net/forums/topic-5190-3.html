			Of course perception of time can altered; it's all in the mind. If anyone's familiar with martial arts, time perception plays a role, increasing or decreasing the reaction time to an incoming strike and such. While you can't stop or slow time, one second might seem like thirty.

			I did karate for 4 years, and they never told me to do that. But then again, my karate wasn't really tai chi. More of a &quot;kick ass and take names&quot; philosophy rather than meditation or anything like that. But we did meditate. I'm going to get better at this altering time perception thing and then try that next time I get in a fight in school. (which happens fairly frequently, for some reason <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> )

			Yeah, you'll find it in Hapkido philosophy, and they refer to it as &quot;Total Awareness&quot;, an altered state of mind that's based on experience and instinct. Calmness of mind, intuitive response, and complete and utter detachment from life and death concerns. Many people think of it as the &quot;sixth sense&quot;, in which someone reacts and responds with uncanny awareness or precognition. This &quot;total awareness&quot; is simply a state of mind, and allows you expand or compress time perception. &quot;Empty Mind&quot; is a type of meditation to prepare for this. I'd go further, but it leads into Zen Buddhism. Religion talk = No no here :p

			Hapkido eh? I take Aikido, and there are similarities. Mushin (sp?) is the state of empty mind, and the creator of aikido had the &quot;total awareness&quot; that you mentioned. He claimed to be able to see where an opponent was going to attack before he did. From the documented accomplishments, I believe it. Throwing 12 guys at once being one of them.

			I believe the website that you are talking about is [http://healing.worldispnetwork.com/gpage.html20.html].
<br />
It's tells you how to bend time, but what happens supposedly is that after you do it the affected area snaps back after a while.  Hope this helps.

			I've noticed a beat is a lot easier to change.  I notice all the time when listning to music with a quick repetative beat, it sounds slower or faster everytime I listen to it.  With a little practice I can control it a little bit.

Clocks are annoying anyways.

			sorry guys.  We have had this discussion before.  Even though &quot;chronokinesis&quot; is not manipulation of matter, it is still a -kinesis word that is unacceptable in these forums.  For more specific ways to solve this problem, pm me or peebrain.
