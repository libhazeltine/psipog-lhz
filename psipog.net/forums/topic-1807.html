			I have written this article as a surprise for the 4th anniversary of me doing telekinesis.  I hope you enjoy the article:

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Rolling and Sliding Objects using Telekinesis</span></span>
<br />

<br />
	Like my other article, this article is meant to be typed for a new Psion to be able to read.  You can find my other article for beginners at <a href="http://psi-training.blogspot.com/2005/10/my-telekinesis-article.html" target="_blank">http://psi-training.blogspot.com/2005/10/my-telekinesis-article.html</a> .  Again, I am not liable for any injury that may occur when performing this advanced ability.  This article will be all about, as the title says, techniques to roll and slide objects.  All of the techniques that I describe in this article have worked for me so I do know that they work.  This article will also NOT cover the psiwheel.  Rolling and sliding are for people who have worked with the psiwheel and can move it fairly well (if not great).  In addition, rolling is easier than sliding because there is not as much friction.  Let us get started:
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Setting up and warm up</span>
<br />

<br />
	When you are new to telekinesis, your mind is weak.  I am not talking about your IQ, education, and those things.  I am talking about the psychic strength.  Obviously, as you know when you first started, it was hard to move the psiwheel.  You could probably make it barely budge or not at all.  Hopefully, before you attempt the techniques that this article outlines you can move the psiwheel with ease.  If you cannot, keep working with the psiwheel.  You need to build up the psychic strength of your mind to be able to move bigger and heavier things.
<br />

<br />
	To warm up, create your average psiball.  Make it as strong as you would like.  The objective here is to get your energies moving and for your mind to get into the zone of telekinesis.  Play with your psiball a little.  Make it swirl around you or play yo-yo with it.  Most of all, relax.  When you feel as if you are very relaxed and all warmed up, move on to the actual technique.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Rolling an object</span>
<br />

<br />
	First things first.  You need something to roll.  Pick something that is completely round, not a pencil that is a hexagon.  Choose a rounded pen or lead from a mechanical pencil.  This is easier because you are not working against much backpressure.  Later, you can move onto hexagonal objects.  Put the pencil in front of you and put your hands near it.  I use hands in my articles because from emails that I have gotten and people who have worked with me, I realize that it is easier for the majority of people to do it with hands.  I will use a pencil to show how to set up your hands.  Place your non-dominant hand on the eraser side and the other hand in on the side of the long side of the pencil so that your hands are perpendicular.  With your dominant hand, point (using your index finger) at the object.  Take three deep and slow breaths (I see that taking breaths actually help people).  
<br />
At the conclusion of your deep breaths, visualize small laser shots of psi shooting from your index finger to the object.  Make them small, quick shots.  As fast as lightning and envision them striking at random places on the object.  Try to feel to impact of the psi hitting the object.  Continue visualizing the psi hitting the object but also start to visualize the object recoiling in the opposite direction.  Feel the psi attacking the object and the object being pushed.  Do this for a couple of minutes.  Some people find it easier to first transfer energy to the object before trying this technique.  Try both ways.  You might also have to change some parts of this article to fit your needs.  Not everybody works the same way.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sliding an object</span>
<br />

<br />
	To be able to slide an object, you must be able to roll.  Rolling is much easier to do due to friction and technique.  With sliding, you have to concentrate on applying equal amounts of force on both sides so that the object does not tip over and roll.  If you attempt to do this and you have not gotten good at rolling objects yet, you will get frustrated and quit.  If you can roll well, this is still a very hard technique.  Ok, now that that is said, onto the technique:
<br />
	Set up your hands the same way as in the rolling section above.  Relax and this time take six deep breaths but take them slowly.  When you feel as if you are very relaxed, visualize a fairly thick piece of string psi coming out of your finger.  Imagine the string tying itself in a knot around the object.  Then with your non-dominant hand (the one that should be on the side of the object), visualize a psi hand coming out from it and imagine it gripping the object fully.  Next is the barrier of the friction.  Tell yourself mentally that you can overcome the friction.  Imagine the object sliding and feel the rub between the table (or where ever you are doing it) and the object.  Feel it deep inside of you.  Make it make you shiver.  Keep visualizing the object moving by the psi hand and the psi string.  Do this for a while.  I use this technique so it does work.  It just takes a lot of time and practice to get it.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Conclusion</span>
<br />

<br />
	You must remember that this is very advanced telekinesis.  It does take time and energy.  Please do not forget that you must take breaks.  Do not stress yourself.  Don?t wait to get a headache because that shows you that you have already overdone it.  If you refuse to take a little break from time to time, you will not be able to do it and you might even hurt yourself.  Dedicate one day per week to doing no telekinesis.  I have said it in the past and I will say it again, these techniques are very advanced.  They take a lot of practice and consistency.  Do not give up.  Giving up is the worst thing you could do.  Once again, I am open to emails about either comments on this article, questions/comments on telekinesis, or just talking.  Feel free to email me at <a href="#">chrisking517@yahoo.com</a>.  I hope you enjoyed this article.
