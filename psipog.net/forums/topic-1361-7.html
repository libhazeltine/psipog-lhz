			Pepsiboy was trying to help but thats not hypnagogia. When you are falling asleep your brain closes down on sensory input, so that electical impulses in your brain can simulate your senses in what becomes a dream. While you are falling asleep, or waking up, your brain will start the process but sometimes it goes slowly or does it in chunks instead of altogether. Which  results in disattenuated thoughts. And what seems like real events are actual hallucinations. You can choose to believe in the spirits or ghost or whatever 90% of the replies are about, but I go through hypnagogia, consciously, everynight on purpose. It happens to everyone whether your conscious of it or not.
<br />

<br />
From wikipedia:
<br />
The hypnagogic state can be accompanied by or associated with anomalous phenomena such as alien abduction, extra-sensory perception, telepathy, apparitions, prophetic or crisis visions. This conduciveness to anomalous phenomena can be correlated with the initial increase of alpha and the later increase of theta brainwaves.
<br />

			I've that a couple of times, when it does, I put on my headphones, crank up the music, put up a psi sheild, and just zone out eventually. The next morning I woke up and my radio was still on and the headphones were on the floor.
<br />

<br />
The point is, when stuff like that happens, just listen to some music. It gets your mind off whatever it is and you can't hear it either. I've growen to love music because of that.

Sorry for not contributing much to this topic, but this quote reminded me of a bonus comic I did for my forums a while back.

(context, for those of you who need it: The image on the computer is a recording from the future that the character sent back in time to himself to prevent the world end and whatnot)

Edit: OK, I've read this entire thread over now. besides getting an incredible case of the willies (just talking about dreams will do that to me though) I have a few theories. Take them as you will.
<br />

<br />
First of all. The being you encountered when you were 10. I believe it was more than any average underwater creature (Though I do know of a massive snapping turtle in a local lake here that probably could do similar)
<br />
It was likely intelligent, possibly supernatural or alien in origin. That said, I believe it left something behind from that. possibly intelligent &quot;leavings&quot; or even a suggestion planted in your mind.
<br />
Those leavings popped up later on to remind you that almost 12 years had passed. You're now 22. I'm also 22, and though on first thought, it doesn't seem like a big deal, over time as I think about it, there seems to be something... unique about that age. I dunno, I cant really back that up, it's just a feeling.
<br />

<br />
I've heard voices from time to time, though I can't recall anything major other than a word or two. Usually someone calling my name, and most likely just an echo in my subconcious.
<br />
You're 22, but its possible the 12 years havent quite passed. Maybe you were late into the age of ten when this happened, and it just has to line up. In any case, though don't worry yourself, be prepared. Sharpen up your skills, just incase. I always try to keep prepared, physically and mentally, because you never know what might happen and when. I even keep a few bladed weapons handy but hidden near my bed (Yeah, I've got a few swords laying around)

			ooh I like swords XD 
<br />
anyway
<br />
I decided I'd show my useless probobly good for nothing off the top of my head &quot;knowledge&quot; again for a few theories that I believed in long time ago.
<br />
These theories being: The majority of the show Stargate is REAL and put out by the airforce to make us believe that &quot;it's only a show&quot;. I stopped believing in this theory long time ago....HOWEVER. I have been watching stargate still (I still like it) and I'm starting to wonder again. all of what I'm about to say is based on one specific IF.......and here it is......<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">IF</span></span> there <span style="font-style: italic">are</span>  beings in the astral plane known as ori and ascended(ascended could also be reffered to as ancients or one other thing I can't remember the name but I'll post it later on this post) then it is possible that the stargate is real theory is liable. and that would also explain the 12 years. &quot;The 12 years are almost complete&quot;(not an exact quote but that's what's in my memory&quot; stargate has been on for 10 years. last year we ran into a group known as the prior and the ori. The Ori areascended being that display themselves as gods. and the ascended are jsut trying to let us live and have blocked us from the threat of the ori. It is forshadowing a big war between the Ascended and the Ori. My guess is (read the IF part again) that the twelve years is leading up to the war. and since they ,whoever <span style="font-style: italic">they</span> are, are appearing in your room you may or may not have an important role to play in this war.
<br />

<br />
P.S. yes I know how full of crap that sounds but it seems that everything is lining up. I'm almost certain that I'm jsut wanting more action and are putting a puzzle together with jigsaw peices from different puzzles. but I figure 'Hey, they fit, why not see what kind of a picture it makes'. I honestly hope that is all it is is peices from different puzzles being crammed together otherwise.....we.....are......screwed.....big time...
<br />

<br />
P.P.S. Yes I know I'm a Lunatic moron.

<br />
One time of those two, I didn't even open my eyes, I just became aware of my five senses again (could feel my body lying on bed, smell what the pillow smelled like, hear clock tickin, etc) And I heard a voice, that seemed to be right by my ear (but not in my head) and it said &quot;soooon. Sooonnn the 12 years will be complete, and we will have it&quot; Not sure about last lines. The &quot;soon&quot; and &quot;12 years will be complete&quot; im positive of.
<br />
This voice sounded extremely menacing, deep and booming and non human sounding.
<br />

<br />
The second time I remember, it was the same voice. It sounded like it was coming from over by a shelf in my room. I woke up, and had my eyes closed, but I could see the room I was in through my eyelids. I think it may have been a mental copy, because when I looked around, it seemed to take an extra split second for the scene to alter the position correctly, and the visuals seemed not quite like when my eyes are open. More washed out looking.

<br />
The voice said &quot;Foooocuuuusss... Foooccuuss... Yesss.. Foocusss.. *evil maniacal laughter* yesssss. YESSSSS.&quot;

Well after hearing that I realized I wasn't opening my eyelids because I couldn't. It seemed like I was being held there like that. I struggled, and instinctively concentrated on my midsection, in the solar plexus. I'm not sure what mental process I went through to do this, but I felt a huge welling of energy form there and I sort of &quot;burst&quot; awake. I was sweating, it was fucked. Especially considering prior similar life experiences.

			Hey, I'd just like for you to be really, REALLY careful with that stuff. Not saying it's inherently evil or anything, and even with my religion aside, some astral projectors acknowledge the existence of such evil spirits as demons that sometimes use openings that humans create when meditating and inducing dream phenomena to take control of them or otherwise manipulate them.
<br />

<br />
Just be careful, and know that you're in my prayers.

I'm not sure what mental process I went through to do this, but I felt a huge welling of energy form there and I sort of &quot;burst&quot; awake. [quote]
<br />

<br />
sorry couldn't read all the posts, too much for me at the time. But about this welling of energy from the solar plexis...did it feel like you had to flex/jerk/violently twitch to release this energy..it's kind of hard to explain. I really want to know if everyone can do this. I've been able to do this since childhood...since i can remember. Just didn't know what it's for or why I could do it. The energy is <span style="font-weight: bold">directly</span> coming from the abdomen and it only takes me seconds to envoke/cause this. Everytime I do this I <span style="font-weight: bold">have</span> to do the quick kind of jerking thing to release the energy. I really have to, it forces me to. Please let me know if this is what you felt or anyone else
<br />

<br />
P.S actually it <span style="font-style: italic">feels</span> like energy/adrenaline

I'm not sure what mental process I went through to do this, but I felt a huge welling of energy form there and I sort of &quot;burst&quot; awake. </span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">

sorry couldn't read all the posts, too much for me at the time. But about this welling of energy from the solar plexis...did it feel like you had to flex/jerk/violently twitch to release this energy..it's kind of hard to explain. I really want to know if everyone can do this. I've been able to do this since childhood...since i can remember. Just didn't know what it's for or why I could do it. The energy is <span style="font-weight: bold">directly</span> coming from the abdomen and it only takes me seconds to envoke/cause this. Everytime I do this I <span style="font-weight: bold">have</span> to do the quick kind of jerking thing to release the energy. I really have to, it forces me to. Please let me know if this is what you felt or anyone else

P.S actually it <span style="font-style: italic">feels</span> like energy/adrenaline</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
