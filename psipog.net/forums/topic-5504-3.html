			ok apollo, pulling on a line and bowing a line are two VERY different thing, pulling is applying negative force on both ends, however bowing is applying, in this case, gravitational force in the middle between an already pulled line, there is absolutly NO give and wouldn't be able to hold anything. Fishing line was made to bend one way only, and the fishing rod helps that.. Video editing is possible but there was a group of people there watching this happen, also I brought religeon in because I didn't know I wasn't allowed... so I appologize for that, however I will use a different example then: Derrick I like Coca-Cola, I'm going to assume you like pepsi.. I believe you are a moron because pepsi tastes like a word I can't say here... so you must be a moron or a (word I can't say here) lover... because you truely BELIEVE pepsi tastes better than coke.. Now I truely believe that Criss Angel is the real deal, and you don't so you can't morally call me a moron because of something I have the free will to believe in.... and by the way, religeous beliefs have a lot to do with intelligence... Next number 3 of what apollo said... Like I said before, I show people different ways to do magic tricks to because I don't want to reveal my secrets, Criss could be doing the same thing, seeing as how PK or TK is such a big deal, he lies about it so people don't lable him... also take a look at this:
<br />
<a href="http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-3659227985429276909&amp;q=levitation" target="_blank">http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-3659227985429276909&amp;q=levitation</a>
<br />
another video from google video, it shows him levitating, however in the first video shown, look to Criss' right, there are three people there, and they would most definatly notice a leg coming out of his pants.. And lastly number 1 of what apollo said, first that goes back to what I said before, misdirection to make him not look like a loon, and secondly there is something else wrong in there that is very controversial, but I'm not going to say it because it involves peoples religeous beliefs (the first time I said it, I didn't hesitate, because it was a HYPOTHETCAL)

			My God, that boy says/affirm that he isnt a illusionist
<br />

<br />
he said for me: i bet that the tricks to wlak over the water and building to buildin he DOESNT sell in his site
<br />

<br />
ah vamos analisar entao com calma:
<br />
- o vídeo que você mostrou é de um truque para subir cadeiras de 40 cm, agora na frase &quot;Now if he could seriously levetate across buildings, why fake it on that block?&quot; o &quot;that block&quot; segundo seu texto esta dizendo que é o bloco que ele ensina como subir na cadeira, concorda que seria interessantissimo mostrar pras pessoas como subir nas cadeiras usando calças falsas, para que elas se sentissem felizes, já que NO SITE NÃO TEM À VENDA O TRUQUE DE LEVITAR ENTRE PREDIOS....?? Não acha estranho nao ter este truque à venda no site??? Como você acha que ele iria ensinar alguem a &quot;levitar seriamente entre predios&quot;?? HA
<br />

<br />
- eu assisti no minimo umas 5 vezes o video dele andando sobre a água: &quot;plastic board barely underneath the water surface&quot; ele tira seus sapatos no meio da piscina, se realmente tivesse uma prancha de plastico ali como o sapato dele afundou???? concorda que o sapato ficaria parado em cima da prancha???? Além de que uma mulher passa DE PÉ no meio de suas pernas enquanto ele está andando... como seria possivel com uma prancha???
<br />

<br />
- &quot;if he could levitate that means he can fly, why would he be on a plane?&quot; Não sei se o cara que escreveu isto sabe que se usa A MENTE para levitar ou voar como ele disse, e A MENTE USA ENERGIA, ou seja, quando ele chegasse em Las Vegas depois de flutuar todo o territorio dos EUA garanto que ele não faria nenhum show de tão exausto IUAEHIUEAHEIAUHEAH
<br />

<br />
- &quot;He is a normal person, nothing special&quot; CLARO É ISSO QUE ELE É!!!!! os talentos que desenvolvemos com a mente não tem nada de especial são normais! fazem parte do ser humano!!!! A única coisa de diferente é que ele usa seus talentos, o que poucas pessoas sabem ser possivel, e ele usa nos show que dizem ser soomente ilusionismo....
<br />

<br />
- o que melhor pra você que tem telentos mentais superdesenvolvidos: assumir que tem e ser testado por todos os céticos desse mundo, ou ganhar dinheiro com isto por meio de uma mistura com ilusionismo???
<br />
garanto que ganhar dinheiro é muito mais interessante 
<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold">so, we go to analyze with calm:
<br />

<br />
the video that u showed is a trick to go up chairs of 40 cm, now in the phrase &quot;Now if he could seriously levetate across buildings, why fake it on that block&quot; &quot;that block&quot; as its text this saying that it is the block that it teaches as to go up in the chair,agrees that he would be interesting to show to people as to go up in the chairs using false pants, so that they felt themselves happy, since In the SITE HE DOES NOT HAVE For sale the TRICK OF LEVITAR BETWEEN BUILDINGS....?? 
<br />

<br />
dont u think weird it doenst have this for sale trick in the site? How do you think that he would teach somebody &quot;to levitar seriously between buildings&quot;? HA - I watched   5 times the video of he walking on the water: &quot;plastic board barely underneath the to water surface&quot; he takes off his shoes in the way of the swimming pool, if really he had a plastic plate there as the shoe of it sank?
<br />

<br />
do you agree that the shoe would be motionless in top of the plate? Beyond that a woman passes OF FOOT in the way of his legs while he is walking... how  would it be possivel with a plate? - &quot;if he could levitate that means he can fly, why would he be on glides it&quot; I do not know if the guy that wrote this knows that if it uses a MIND to levitate or to fly as it said, and MIND  USes ENERGY, or either, when it arrived in Las Vegas after floating all the territorio of U.S.A. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
i guarantee that he would not make no show of exhausted IUAEHIUEAHEIAUHEAH so - &quot;He is normal person, nothing special&quot; Surely, Is THIS THAT he Is!!!!! the talents that we develop with the mind do not have nothing of special, they are normal! they are part of the human being! The only thing of different is that he uses his talents, what few people know to be possible, and he uses in the show  just to say that it is ilusion
<br />

<br />
what is the best for u who have talents superdeveloped : to assume that u have and to be tested by all the skeptics of this world
<br />

<br />
or to gain money with this by means of a mixture with ilusionismo? I guarantee that to gain money he is much more interesting  </span>
<br />

<br />
he is fool, i dont know what to say for him, heeeeeeelp

			its a visual trick. holy shit. did you not see the frame cut when he slipped the shoe off? you didnt exactly see it come off his foot into the water. you first saw him taking the shoe off and THEN in a diffrent frame you saw it underwater already. TWO different cameras, one underwate, one above water. simple VIDEO EDITING.

			1) People already believe that Criss Angel can levetate.  Why would he not say that when people already believe that.  The completely destroys your arguement on that front.
<br />

<br />
2) In the video, watch the part that he is in the middle of the express way (at about 25 seconds into it).  When he goes up, watch near his right knee.  Thanks to bad quality, you can see something black appear and then disappear right there (foot).
<br />

<br />
3) your arguement with pepsi vs. coke:  about 50% of people like pepsi and 50% coke.  Criss Angel levetating is about 99% to 1% (1% being you and about 3 others here).  There is a difference.  Especially when Criss Angel has <span style="font-weight: bold">shown</span> people how to do what he does.
<br />

<br />
And yes, you can say shit on these forums.

			ok well you know anyone can make up fake statistics, 99% of people know that... 88% of people here hate you because you're a fag, and the other 22% dislike you because your arguments don't make sense... And I am positive a hell of a lot more than 50 50 for coke vs pepsi, and a lot more than 1% for criss angel...
<br />

<br />
One, he would say he can't levitate so people don't label him as things... you know that whole salem witch trial thing? hmmm... you know they said they weren't witches, but you never know, just because they say something, doesn't mean it's true... it's called misdirection, look up houdini and you'll learn a lot about it...
<br />

<br />
Two, in that video at the 25 second mark... he's wearing all black... there is no possible way you can see a foot out of that, and plus the lighting was bad, therefor making it more black... Also try disproving the segment before that, or after that... 
<br />

<br />
and pepsiboy... you make a good argument... if it were true, because you see, I've already proven that a piece of see-through glass or plexi-glass or plastic, spaning that distance would be physically impossible, Especially with the added weight of the water ontop of it..
<br />

<br />
Also Carrie_white... I don't know if you're helping me, or against me, I can't really understand you... But from what I can get out of it I think you're helping me... Also there is no need for bold, I know they piss me off too, but you don't need to actually show it...
<br />

<br />
(By the way incase no one figured it out, the statistics  I used above about apollo were completely made up, they are not true, and I do not believe them, they were just said to prove a point)
<br />

<br />
Also I'm going away for the weekend, I might be able to check again and reply once more, but I will be returning on tuesday, so if the thread is burried I will not be responding, for the sake of making new topics, and changing topics... so If you have any really incriminating evidence (which I doubt you do) I will try to respond tonight or tomorrow night

			Who are you....apollo has a hell of a lot more respect from people around here than you do...do you know why you can't walk on water or cross buildings...because you don't have the knowledge or money to do it...do you think if he had an idea to fake crossing buildings and levitating on water he would actually sell it?...He's rich already so why give away some of the best tricks ever done..He doesn't give those ones away so it stirs up questions and controversy in people like you...and how do you know the plexiglass would bend? If it's a secret that means he thought of a way to do it that noone else has...thats why you can't explain it..because if you could you'd be walking on water and making money too...even if it wasn't video editing how do you know it wasn't like a bridge with a couple plexiglass, or glass pillars underneath for support...you don't know how thick the plexiglass could have been or if the people in the pool were actors swimming around and under the &quot;bridge&quot;....it's not like he doesn't have the money to do it

			dear log 2. nothing is impossible EXCEPT floating from one building to another AND walking on water. the possibility of reinforced plexiglass spanning from one side of the pool to another is possible. it is also possible that the plexi glass was reinforced and built like a bridge. not just ONE strip across the pool like a belt, but like a BRIDGE with supports. open your EYES, and THINK with your BRAIN. there is only ONE animal that can walk on water.

			Did you hear me say it COULD'VE been reinforced....this thing could've cost thousands of dollars to make. You have no idea what could be going on so you just assume well he has to be walking on water.

Thats right...He <span style="text-decoration: underline">wouldn't</span> sell his best TRICKS..is the key word..YOU think he's not telling people how to really fly and walk on water..they are tricks which are done very well and that's what he wouldn't sell...read twice next time

Oh yeah, i forgot.  Its more of a 74% to 87%..... OH, wait a second....that makes 161%.  I THNIK CRIS ANGLE IS RAEL!!!1!

Obviously people already think he <span style="font-weight: bold">can</span> levetate.  If he said that he was, he would not be labeled anything new.  Obviously he is one step ahead of you by already misleading people (you)

Ok, so something that is dark black that pops out and back in where his foot should be (like shown in the video link i posted earlier) is just lighting.  Ok, i can live with that.  We all know that videos can be faked so videos cannot be used unless Criss Angel says something in them.

I forgot to respond to one point in a past post:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">ok apollo, pulling on a line and bowing a line are two VERY different thing, pulling is applying negative force on both ends, however bowing is applying, in this case, gravitational force in the middle between an already pulled line, there is absolutly NO give and wouldn't be able to hold anything. Fishing line was made to bend one way only, and the fishing rod helps that..</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Yes they are.  One is bending the line and one is pulling on it.  A fish pulls on a fishing line (eliminates the pulling part of the arguement; simple enough).  If you have ever been fishing, you will know that when a fish is hooked, it pulls on the line and moves around.  When the line is pulled, the rod makes the line bend.  See the picture below:
<br />

<br />

<br />
Therefore, the line can bend.  Once again, WRONG.

			oh my goodness people, if there was a bridge it would look like this right:
<br />
------------------------------------------------
<br />
|       |          |              |         |        |    |
<br />

<br />
Or something similar.... well if you look at that, there is a flaw, you see... actually two... first off it would still bend in the middle, unless they were really close... but then people wouldn't be able to swim under it... also people wouldn't be able to swim above the surface infront of him... because last time I checked people can't go through plexi glass, unless they have some powers... 
<br />
Also that fishing picture... look more closely at it... there is no bow in the string, it stayes straight the entire time, it bend like a corner between the hooks... This is an image I made... the redline represents the line hanging between the buildings, the black lines represent the devices supporting it..
<br />
<a href="http://imageshack.us" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/7861/pullud1.jpg" border="0" /></a>
<br />
The blue lines represent the stress points... now if a line is pulled tight (you can even try this) between two objects, and there is force applied in the middle, there will be an extreme bow, no matter what... now keep applying pressuse until the givaways, don't giveaway anymore... (the black lines being the giveaways) the line would have nowhere to go, but down, and it would break under the tension..
<br />

<br />
As for the video, I thought you were talking about the video I posted, there happens to be a part exactly at 25 seconds where he's at a small wall doing a levitation...
<br />
As for the first part of your post apollo.. I have no idea what you're talking about... it doesn't make sense, logically..

EDIT: There is a difference between bend and bow apollo
