Magic is seperated from psi by results, intention, and method usually.
<br />

<br />
Most psions seem content to muck about with psi-balls and such, while magicians usually call upon whatever force they call their own and use it to achieve a wide variety of things.

These are, of course, generalizations, but I figured I'd point it out.

			I have no idea what you mean by Omnimancy.  But I doubt it is the same thing as psi.  I'm willing to bet they're screwing around with things like Earth, Wind, Water, Fire, etc.  In terms of psi, which make a modicum of sense, these concepts are useful as visualizations, but have no intrinsic power of their own.  And god forbid if they follow the ancient alchemical formulae of all material in the universe consisting of those elements.  Though I doubt if anyone does that now.  There's just too much backing behind atomic theory.  (but until we actually PROVE that there are atoms, it is important to accept the possibility that we may be wrong)

			I believe it was in the book &quot;A brief histroy of time&quot; that Hawkings speaks of the 4 elements earth air water and fire being real.
<br />

<br />
Earth which is mass in gerneral is replaced by gravity.
<br />

<br />
Fire is Thermodyamics, which leads down to entropy and a lot more
<br />

<br />
Air and water leads down to the power of the atom.
<br />

<br />
Or something like that. But the point is clear, like the 4 elements the greeks came up with long ago. We still go by 4 basics elements today, simply called by different names. When I think about it, the difference from ancient elements and our elements are not so different.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: blue">Strong</span>
<br />
<span style="color: red">Weak</span>
<br />
<span style="color: brown">Gravity</span>
<br />
<span style="color: violet">Electromangtic</span>
<br />

<br />
Unless you like to think of different elements counting for different things. Then in a way the ancient 4 elements are still elements today, but of our lifes.

Considering that I actually did search Omnimancy after making that post, and did <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> mention it in my post, I'd say you're being a bit pushy.
<br />

<br />
Direct magic <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> a seperate art from psionics, and I summed up the differences I'd noticed between psions and magicians. I've been studying direct magic for as long, if not longer, than I have psionics.

			If you just look at website and don't use the information it contains in your argument, how is that different than never searching for it at all?
<br />

<br />
You just have a preset classification for direct magicians and have decided that even though you had far more limited information, that classification would suffice for ever and ever because you researched it a bit.
<br />

<br />
I've been doing direct magick since I was 6 years old and can say that the many other direct magicians I've encountered are very closely tied to the methodology of psionics with the added perception that energy can be donated from various abstract (or not so abstract) sources for the use of performing psychic actions.
<br />

I'm betting your experience with direct magick is not so extensive...so ha! <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			I searched for it.  Looks all well and good.  Apparently its doctrine is to use direct magic in respect to scientific theory, and to test it as if it were a science experiment.  A very noble goal.  In fact, it makes me want to join.
<br />

<br />
But there is no mention of any kind of standardized spell creation mechanism.  Nor is there any indication of the use of one, or records containing them.  So tell me again how this is a repeat of Omnimancy?

			Oh, yeah.  This is the first thing I have shown here that is complex enough that it could not have been accomplished without the aid of a method to depict it like this sigil/rune/whatever system.  This construct is designed to catch sunlight, collect it into its center, and store it inside itself, with a handy outlet to wire to something else if you want to use it.  It is composed of three functional subconstructs.  
<br />

<br />
1) On the outer solar &quot;coating&quot; it boasts a very special experimental construct of mine, which projects a parabolic scaling surface of a type of energy to be described herein.  Basically, light hitting this parabolically curved surface is always focused to the same point- the center, or vertex, of the parabola.  This means that the sunlight from the entire surface area of the parabola is collected with no additional expenditure past creating the parabola.   (for example, a satellite dish is a parabola, and works in exactly the same way as this collector)
<br />

<br />
However, using just the basic shape wasn't good enough for me.  So I made this special type of energy.  This energy is actually composed of a special point-construct.  One side of the point-construct is photophobic, and the other is photophilic.  This means that one side will orient itself away from light, and the other will orient itself towards light.  However, it also must join with other like point-constructs on four sides (the front and back are photophilic and photophobic, respectively) which forces the construct into a flat sheet.  But I said it was a parabola, you say?  
<br />

<br />
The energy also repels the energy on the surface of the main construct's base, because of the repelling energy moving through both it and the surface of the base.  This energy is the reason power is necessary for the parabola to function.  The strength of this repulsion varies directly with the cube of the distance away from it.  This means that the farther the energy is from the top of the construct, the stronger the force pushing it away from it.  I used the cube because the interaction between two bodies varies inversely with the square of the distance, so the amount of force must first overcome that barrier.  Cancelling the square and the cube leaves a direct linear relationship.  When the two touch, the repulsion exerts no force pushing them away.  When it is far apart, there is a significant amount of force pushing them apart.  When it is a small distance apart, however, the force is small- not enough to overcome the force of gravity (which is constant), causing it to sag into a perfect parabola (though it needs to be anchored!!).  The collector soaks up light and wires it down to the base, where most of the inner workings take place.  This is a sigil diagram of the parabola element of the construct:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://x5.freeshare.us/view/?121fs933536.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://x5.freeshare.us/121fs933536_th.jpg" border="0" /></a>
<br />

<br />
2) The base is an enclosed area, which is supported with energy.  The base includes the maintenance of this structure in its operation, which it derives from its generated energy as well.  The base contains four different varieties of energy, which are compressed and mixed together appropriately before being fed to the solar projector.  The projector then uses it to collect sunlight and wires the energy collected from the light back down.  Though the energy collected is greatly in excess of the energy expent to maintain the projector, the base only receives enough to continue operating (the rest goes to the output reservoir).  This sunlight is slashed and transformed appropriately, and is then moved back to the energy reserves to be used again.  This is a diagram of the base:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://x5.freeshare.us/view/?121fs934037.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://x5.freeshare.us/121fs934037_th.jpg" border="0" /></a>
<br />

<br />
3) The last part of the construct is the output module.  This is a fully distinct module on the construct, and can actually be removed and replaced.  It skims its reserves off the excess created by the collector, with only enough to sustain the system being sent back to the base.  I think of it as like a disc that is sandwiched between the collector and the base, which redirects any extra energy into a sidechannel to be stored.  It does have a very sophisticated method of energy storage which enables a great deal of energy to be kept for a very long period of time.  Preliminary (of course) estimates tell me that you can expect it to stay in such a module for 40 years and lose only 1% of the energy stored.  The constant motion of the energy through the circuit reduces the traditional &quot;half-life&quot; to a linear decay due to inefficiency.  Note that there is a line of energy markers through the circuit.  The energy can be held in storage there, as well, but a balance will be maintained between the circuit and the pools due to the Law of Change instigating an equilibrium.  This dramatically increases the storage capacity of the module, though cuts its decay-reducing properties.   However, the circuit constitutor transforms the supercompressed (64x) energy into a form where it is less energetic (easy because it is so dense), thus reducing its rate of decay dramatically even in the normal method of storage in the pools.  Here is a diagram of the module:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://x5.freeshare.us/view/?121fs934851.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://x5.freeshare.us/121fs934851_th.jpg" border="0" /></a>
<br />

<br />
You guys have no concept of how effective this thing is at energy farming.  The only element which is probably a little odd to you guys is the sun constituent energies.  They work in together to run the projector in pairs, and are broken up into different pairs once the energy is recirculated.  I have found that this is the most efficient arrangement, though my testing is far from extensive.  Sunlight can be considered to be general psi with a few extra laws.  Namely, it is always moving at the speed of light, it bounces off matter, it imparts its energy to the matter it bounces off of, and it is produced by matter similarly energized.  These correspond to yellow, blue, red, and green, respectively.  This means that, when paired together, they are as follows:
<br />

<br />
TO COLLECTOR - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - FROM MODULE
<br />
Yellow (speed) &amp; Blue (bounce) - - - - - - - Yellow &amp; Green 
<br />
Red (impart) &amp; Green (release) - - - - - - - Red &amp; Blue
<br />

<br />
So the combined energies needed to power the parabola are a G+speed of light/G+bounce hybrid.  This produces the mobile element of the repelling energy.  Note that this energy DOES NOT impart its energy onto particles that it impacts.  The other species of energy in the works is a G+impart/G+release hybrid.  This energy is G that can be absorbed as energy by particles, and then released as itself from those particles.  These two energies mix together WITHOUT SYNTHESIS, and the motile energy carries the other in energy form.  The other energy is released up to repel the parabola.  The motile energy then returns to the base of the parabola, and proceeds up the parabola, catching the nonmotile energy (different than that it released), thus holding up the parabola.  In this way the active circuit within the parabola keeps it in its parabolic shape.  
<br />

<br />
However, these energies were created from sunlight, and will return to that state if left together.  Not all the circulating energy is reconstituted into sunlight during its circuit, but that which is gets drawn back down with the newly collected sunlight at this point.  Note that a G+speed of light/G+release hybrid and a G+bounce/G+impart combo is returned to the base.  This is because sunlight logically degenerates into this state.  Energy is released at speed, while other energy is shared among other particles (bounce) and then bursts forth as light (release) from a different particle.  Energy in the parabola will have transformed the YB/RG pair into pure sunlight, which then imparts onto the parabola (by design).  Some of this energy will return in the same form, and some will split into YG/RB before being rejoined with the other variety in the same particle.  This holdover in the parabola is also by design.  But meanwhile this energy is cycling back down to the vertex of the parabola, where it is sent back to the base to be broken into Y, G, B, and R individually before being decompressed and stored for use again when the reserves are tapped.  They are actually tapped continuously, but you get the idea.
<br />

<br />
I know this thing is incredibly complicated.  Read it like you would a math textbook- slowly and digestively.  Your satisfaction guaranteed if you make one of these.  I make my other constructs run using the same output modules as batteries, and those batteries are even hardy enough to be reusable!  I mount one of these batteries and a generator on my sock and have it broadcast a bodyshield for me.  I have only ever charged one of these batteries for 24 hours, and it made the shield last for 6 hours.  By my estimate the battery is large enough to store 300 hours' worth of power for the shield (12.5 days continuously) but would require 50 days to store that much power.  So if you have fifty of these, the sum total output of them for one day would equal 50 days of a single collector.  I'll work on a method for taking numerous output modules and combining their power onto a single module.  Or someone else can do it.  Whatever.  You have the plan for the module, just make ten plugins for it and a channel to move their contents to an eleventh.   (That's ridiculous.  That's not even funny)

As extensive as practicing for (in my case) eleven years? No.
<br />

<br />
As extensive as being a practitioner of an art which is closely intertwined with psionics and direct magic but which is neither for the last few years? Yes.
<br />

<br />
Many direct magicians practice similarly to psionics, with a different outlook, which, in my experience, works differently. I used my previous experiences with the person who taught me my basic methods and outlooks, and my time spent at TLoK to make the statements I did.
