			so I learned how to make psi balls 3 days ago, I have been praticing all that time. yesterday it was probably 12:00A.M. I decided to practice a bit more but I felt that the psi ball was weaker! to be more precise,  I didn't feel much of that magnetism it produces ever since I learned how to do it.  I don't know what happened! I am afraid that I may have forgotten something or maybe its my concentration. 
<br />

<br />
what do you think?
<br />

<br />
has this ever happened to you?

			You're probably just drained of energy.  It's pretty easy to make psi-balls if you always have a lot of energy.  I &quot;absorb&quot; energy all the time.  Instead of absorbing energy right when I'm about to make a psi-ball, I do it earlier in the week when I know I'll want to make one within the next few days.  I don't know many people who do this, but it works so well.  
<br />
     I dont think your technique is really the problem, but you should try many different ones to see which has the best results. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Ya that happened to me. At first when i started my psiballs would always be cold, but then it started to fade away and get warm, and now they are very magnetic. So you should just keep trying and itll come back.

			burnout dude, ur suffering from a burnout
<br />

<br />
u are a newbie so ur psi capacity aint very big, so as those psiballs fade away (in effect, they are actually dispersed into the atmosphere), ur psi level drops
<br />

<br />
u could just rest and wait for it to come back, or try absorbing energy from several sources (much faster way)

			i agree with theorist, you probably over exerted yourself and suffered a &quot;burnout&quot; or what me being a cycling junkie would probably call &quot;psionic bonking&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
i'm pretty sure that's what happened, b/c it happens to me all the time  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> XD

			No noob should get a burnout from psiballs......I practiced for a long time with no signs of burnout when I started. You're probably just getting used to the feeling and it's not quite as foreign. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			heh, Brett I get burnouts from PK, but yeah that's true. 
<br />

<br />
Thank you. Hmm, I did, but it really matters on who coined the term &quot;bonking&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
nope, never grounded or centered...i suffer all the time hehe, whether big or little, i'm too impatient to &quot;recover fully&quot; (which i wouldn't know how long the duration would be anyways XD)

			dude.......noobs can surely suffer from Burnouts.......noobs, as i know from friends hu are noobs, usually just spam out their psi, not giving a damn about control......so the psi just leaks away......at a very high rate, leading to a burnout......yahooo!!
