			A few nights ago i attempted to have an OBE after reading some of Robert Petersons book about OBE's. I started with the usual approach, relaxing and not trying to fall asleep. I used one of his techniques - the yoyo one. I felt like I was on the edge of leaving my body but I was stuck. I felt the vibrations in the back of my head, kind of like a humming. After that I started to feel a bit sick in my stomach so I opend my eyes and got up. has anyone else been close to having an OBE?

<br />
Anyway, there's always tonight to practice again.

			I was trying obe and i started getting numb allover, and the stupid thing is i was laying on my side. So i was waiting for stuff to happen and im just laying there and my side starts to hurt. So i gave up and decided to do it early in the morning where no one can distract me. Oh and when i was laying for a while with my eyes closed i saw like colors that u see when u like squeeze ur eyes but i wasnt squezzing or anything and they were like in shapes etc. and they moved around and then as soon as it got to a certain spot it repeated and so on. Oh and when my body was going numb i realized i started sweating and my body was heavy. Does this mean i was doing the right thing and all?

			Flamester: As far I know your body is not supposed to feel heavy and sweating is a nono in the astral &quot;self&quot; . You are supposed to feel light and as if you're about to float out of yourself. But try a more comfortable position because if you in fact do have an OOBE on your side you'll be greeted with a huge discomfort when you return to your body...prolly x10 more than you felt then...However from what you're saying you seen as if you are close. Keep it up, try another position.

			And green mango, yes I have been very close to haveing and OOBE. I have experienced the REM and the weightless feeling, as if I was about to lift my hands and feel out of &quot;myself&quot;

			yeah, once. it was a sunday and i had a weird dream (one of those ones where you keep on trying to open your eyes (in real life) but can't for some reason.) cue me, waking up eventually and slumping back under my duvet to realise that my body was very relaxed, so i decided to try and 'get out' and i experienced the vibrations for the first (and last, so far) time. i was sure it was the 'vibes not only because of the sheer magnitude of it, (trust me, when you have them, you know) and i could hear the bells from the church about 300 meters away from my window chiming away for morning mass or whatever the church does on a sunday.

			was close recently as well! 2 nights ago or so. I always thought those vibrations would be rather subtile, but boy was I wrong! Also started around the neck area for me and I thought &quot;Wow thats a little more intense than I thought...&quot; when suddenly it started to pull me out of my body very heavily, almost violently for a splitsecond. My body didn?t move but it was extremely intense, just the upper part of my body though. This amazed me so much that I had noch chance but to flood my body with adrenaline, sitting up and having the &quot;oh shit&quot; expression written in my face. Amazing and fun stuff!
