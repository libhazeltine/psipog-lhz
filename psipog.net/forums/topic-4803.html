			Why is becoming one with the object so important to you?
<br />

<br />
I've never enjoyed the idea as it felt spiritual in my mind, so I just ignored the whole steps of this...like most of the things I read. Hahahah.
<br />

<br />
Seriously, Why is it important? I've never done such steps to do this. Maybe it's a sub-consciouc link that I'm not aware of. Whether it is or not, I still don't do it and I still can do PK.
<br />

<br />
Maybe this should go into the skeptics area then the PK area, but most newbies fall in here..so I'll let the mods decide.
<br />

<br />
Do you, longer experinced Psychokinesis doers, still &quot;connect&quot; with it? Like using psi or at least, consciously?

			i take it this is a relation to my topic yesterday eh?
<br />

<br />
well id gotten fairly good at moving the wheel ,so then i set a thin toothpick on my desk and attempted to make it fall over.after 3 days of nothing i posted here about becoming one with an object and someone gave me a link to there article which i found more then helpfull and within the hour i had it fallen over and purposely rolling off my desk..
<br />

<br />
and towards the question of 
<br />
do more experienced pkers still &quot;connect&quot; well,the key there is &quot;experienced&quot; us newbies herehave a harder time with moving even some of the simplest objects by a year or two when some of this is easier maybe well be good enouph to try to just move something we see without connection what-so-ever.but like me most newbies dont have enouph patience to wait a month to get good at a harder way that in the long term might be stronger.
<br />

<br />

<br />
well if you actually read that thank you

			It's just a concept for newbies that is easier to conceptualize... It's easier for them to understand that concept so that they can perform pk more easily. It's just a concept. It's not what actually happens during pk.

			The closest I get to &quot;connecting with the object&quot; is my flow of energy to the object.  After that flow has started, it's subconcious and I just get to moving the object.
