			I thought that we should probably have a topic to discuss some of the more popular methods of lucid dream induction. I was wondering what everybody's experiences with these techniques were like. I also thought it might be useful for the sharing of tips and solving of general WILD/MILD problems.
<br />

<br />
For those of you who have no idea what either of those are, you can check the sticky about dreaming terms for a general Idea. If you want a more in depth look, there are links in the sticky.

I'll start off with my experiences with MILD
<br />

<br />
I actually practiced the reduced version of MILD, because the information I read was incorrect, until that article Peebrain posted set me straight. I have yet to try the full-blown training of the mind method, but I think I'll get around to it soon. Anyways, I didn't do any of the training and still saw some fairly good results. I would simply repeat to myself that I would have a lucid dream and remember it before bed, and now and then it would work. However, what this really helped me with was dream recall. I rarely remembered my dreams before starting this. But after using this, I can almost always recall at least one dream from the night prior. 
<br />

<br />
Well, that?s just a starter. What has everybody else gone through?

			Usually I have WILDs. Thanks to a very good method that learned a while back from a good friend who happens to be a psion. But I experienced a MILD the other night. I had a dream that some man just walked into my house, trying to shoot me. luckily he ran out of bullets and left. This happened several more times in my dream before something else wierd happened. I shot in the leg after several more times of this happening and then I started saying to myself, &quot;This has to be a dream&quot;. 
<br />
So somehow my mind was triggered to do a dream test and suddenly. Lucid dreaming time. So I equipped myself with matrix like powers and killed the man who had previously been trying to kill me. It had to be the coolest dream I've ever had.

			That &quot;MILD&quot; sounds like a DILD (Dream Induced Lucid Dream). MILDs don't really &quot;happen&quot; by accident, you kind of have to train yourself for them. Unless thats what you meant. From the way you described it though, it sounded like you realized you were dreaming randomly.

			=/ okay, I guess it was a DILD. Either way it was still really cool and the word DILD makes me laugh <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> JUSES I CANT RESIST THE TEMPTATION ANYMORE!!!1 MUST SAY IT! .................. DILDO. now that I've got that off my chest I can move on to more important things. How can I do the DILD type again? Or was that just a fluke and I have to settle for WILDs?

			I should be more specific. To my understanding, MILD trains you to have DILDs. But unless you were specifically doing MILD, then the DILD wasn't caused by it. One way to get lucid is to do reality checks.

			WILD is my main focus. I do it every single time I wake up and start to fall asleep again. I start by relaxing all my muscles to the point of not putting any strain with them. Then I will breathe deeply for a short time and clear my thoughts. When I have done this I should hear the tinnitus very loudly and feel like I'm made of puddy or something. Then I will start my counts 1 I'm lucid,2 I'm lucid, 3 I'm lucid...etc. I will go through the puddy stage, then the comfort decieves me and says, &quot; I'm not comfortable, move!&quot; I just stay still until this overwhelms my body, then thats where the I fall asleep, or I roll off the bed border is. When I roll off the bed it feels like I put no effort into it but I did think about the sensation for a while before it happend. Then I stand up, stabilize, and enjoy.
<br />

<br />
And MILD is a method I used originally. I did RC's at least twice an hour. And while falling asleep I would tell myself I would have one. And imagine a dreamscene with me becoming lucid. I also thought about it all the time and told everyone I talked to regularly. It worked but then I switched to WILD for willpower achieved LD's.
<br />

<br />
Hope this is what you wanted.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Exactly so. I imagine you mean that you left your body when you WILD? Or do you mean you rolled off your bed in a false awakening? Also, which method do you find more effective?

			Not sure, I was in bed and I was imagining the sensation of rolling off my bed. Then it started to happen and I thought, &quot;ok, ill go with this. if i hit the floor im still awake, if not then I succeeded.&quot; When I opened my eyes I'm not sure how I knew but I stood up and was in awe of how realistic the dream was. I guess it could be considered a false awakening where I wasn't fooled.
