			Oh i'll even feed him the big pellets, where he starts to eat things like a maniac. I think he would be a valuable tool for consuming psi where i don't want it.

			Well, my psipet thing is complete. Her name is Cindy and... she's a bit retarded. I forgot to add some important programming and i have been adding eversince. She is basically a psiball, with two eyes, an antenna and 2 wings.
<br />

<br />
I programmed her to show her mood by color. She just changes color when her mood does. So that way i can easily know if she's pissed at me and doesn't want to communicate telepathically. Also, she knows she exists, but she can't really grasp the concept of thinking by herself. Like, i had to tell her to use her wings to fly.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Other than that, she's really obidient and doesn't talk back, yet. But i hope she will eventually evolve to a more intelligent being, capable of actually assisting me with all kinds of problems.
<br />

<br />
But for that to happen, i have to actively communicate with her, so she'd actually learn from me.

			Wow...It seems this topic is well covered all ready. I have recently gotten back into psionics after thinking about this subject, and joined the forums to see if anyone else had interest in it. This is good...
<br />
I hope on making a type of body guard, if you will. For example, &quot;ansem&quot; in Kingdom Hearts (not really ansem...I know) but w/e.
<br />

<br />
By the way. I am Devious Xen, or Xeno...whichever. Whatever. I shall make an intro. Peace

			I once made an entire army of intelligent creatures from psi (seriously).

It was actually pretty fun to make them, I made about 100 I think.  It took a full hour, and a very large amount of psi.  They were easy to make since they had no purpose whatsoever, and only lasted another hour.

I'm actually working on something like that, but I'm making them as strong as my first pet (He was the prototype) and I'm having other constructs collect energy to build them for me.  And like before, I'd really appreciate it if someone could scan around me to see how many of them are still functioning.  I can definitely tell a few of them are there, but I definitely can't guess how many.

			Good idea. Everyone pour energy into this psiball that I will give you co-ordinates for. Pour energy into it whenever you want.
