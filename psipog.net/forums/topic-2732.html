You all need to lay off the video games and try not to so obviously be preteen.

hey, you want me to scan an image of my drivers license for you? you want to act like you know everything, and yet you are apparntly quite blatantly incorrect. you cannot verify my experience to be unreal any more than you can verify my age. i was in the middle of working on proving my story, and i'm ready to show proof that i am the age i clame to be.
<br />

<br />
i do NOT like being called a liar. i do NOT lie other than maybe a couple small insignificant ones in every day life that everybody does. but i do not even do those little ones as often as most people either.

anyways, i believe lucid dreaming means a dream that you are awake in right? if it is then yah, there shouldnt be any reason you shouldnt be able to have one about games/tv shows. i normally dont realize i'm dreaming, i'm an overly cautious person, and my dreams are rather close to real life, so even if i am consious during the dream i never do anything to break the flow out of fear i might be awake.

			I used to dream about the movie aliens a lot and be riggly but I get scared a lot in dreams so I usually freak out in my dream or wake up. I've been in like micheal myers movies, the halloweens, it's usually scary places.
