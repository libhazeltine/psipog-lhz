			If you are looking for a solid and 100% cure and not doctor crap that you will be running back to in a matter of months for new meds. then I suggest going to the <a href="http://www.edgarcayce.org/" target="_blank">http://www.edgarcayce.org/</a> it has edgar cacyes records of over 14,000 cures, natural mind you, so they are more likely to work than those pills given.  Sure, it is hard to believe that something grown can cure someone rather than something chemically made, I'm not trying to convince you, I'm just saying if you want to save his life then there you go.  It does cost about 50$ to gain access to his database, so 50$ could, well you get it. 
<br />

<br />
Secondly, you wont get much from asking the staff and members of psipog for help nor will it do much... though I do hope something works out for you.  The next best thing I'd recomend is to see a reiki healer. A good one!  Go fly to china if you have to, do research... because no one else will do it for you.  I can't really say much else, and I wont except... doctoral perscriptions will not help only postpone the problem.. as I've found, though this is not at all a suggestiong or w/e . Go do what you have to.
<br />

<br />
I gave you the best two things I've ever used and saught help from.  The choice is yours.  I really hope he gets better.  Good luck in your search and do your research.

Actually it isn't hard to believe at all. My father also says that science is sometimes making things worse. I believe that all things can be cured in a natural way, but it can still be hard.
<br />
It costs 70$ outside of the US. I will try researching as much as I can, and tell my father about what I found, because I can't do much alone. I'm still 15(16 in march) and I don't have a Credit Card or something like that, so I won't be able to register with the site either.
<br />

<br />
Big thanks to everyone that support me and try to help me. I really appreciate it <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Oh , that's okay and I'm glad you understand.  My dad actually registered an account a while ago, so if you give me the disease and ailment then I'm sure I could look up what he suggests.

I still say let the doctors do their work.

Who knows, even with good intentions, we can't be sure if we (the psions) are helping or hindering the medical treatment he's getting. We could just be getting in the way.

			Hey guys, perhaps we could apply our psionic powers in a different way.
<br />

<br />
Instead of making psionic cures and such, which could actually make it worse, why don't we just increase the chance that he'll live?
<br />

<br />
Alexandra said he has about 10% chance of surviving. We just use micro-PK to increase the chance, micro-PK can't physically alter his state or anything, so we couldn't make it worse.

			Stony did the correct thing by locking the other thread.

<br />
We are not doctors.  The majority of the members here are teenagers who are completely new to psionics.  Be responsible.

I'm sorry your brother is in a bad position, but WE CAN NOT HELP YOU.  Stop posting this topic.
