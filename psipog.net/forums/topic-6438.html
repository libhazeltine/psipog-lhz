			Haha, I would have thought some response like yours SFG.
<br />

<br />
I have many friends on xbox live, many with which I have contact now in real-life. I have found very interesting people that have helped me and people whom I have helped. Xbox live is a great community. Beside that, I play Rainbow Six Vegas just for the sake of re-playing old-times with those people. We were very active on the xbox 3 years or so ago. We often stood in the top 5 world rankings and such. We had a great time. So now with the new xbox, we all decided to buy it at least one more time. I consciously choose to play xbox for one more year, learn what I can here to prepare myself in the meanwhile, and go to India this Summer probably and find what I am looking for. Whether I return or not, I will see when the time comes.
<br />

<br />
But for now, I am enjoying my competetive teamwork with my friends versus other teams. With all love and respect towards the opposite team off course, I would dislike to fall into duality while playing on the xbox <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />. Everything you do can be a spiritual practice. Even xboxing.

That's very interesting, I must say.

I don't have an XBOX though...I only have a PS2 and Gamecube at the moment. Even if I did have an XBOX, going online to play it would most likely be out of the question.
