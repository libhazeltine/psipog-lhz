			I need a lot of help. I have been trying pk for about 2 months with NO results! i haven't budged the psiwheel or anything. Now i've been practicing every day but at different times and sometimes not even up to a half hour. is this the problem? do i need to have a set time and length to practice at? also, what are you supposed to think of as you sit there? are you just supposed to stare at the object in hopes that it will move or what? hope you can help

			Maybe you should work on other aspects of PK. For example, instead of moving a psiwheel or large object... Try dice first. That's what I did, many years ago when I practiced PK... It took me three-four months to realize I wasn't moving anything, I moved to Dice, they started to be influenced well and then BAM moved to Psiwheel's and they started spinning like crazy.

			It takes people weeks to years in getting PK to be done. Do what Sheepking said and start with Micro-PK.

Personnally, I never could get the pin-wheel to spin, I just went with sliding because it seemed easier.

			Just practice at least once a day, read PsiPog articles, and try different techniques.  I played around with THREE different techniques before I had results.  You may want to play around with other abilities first.  Psi Balls, Constructs, Telepathy, who knows, you may exceed in one of these?

You need practice, it took me 3-4 months and trying about 6 or 7 techniques and I finally spun it so just keep with it...

			Read the article about getting in tune with your subconscious. There really is a huge difference. It used to take a lot of effort just to push a psiwheel just once around in a direction. But now I've been increasing communication between my subconscious, and it now takes almost half the effort, plus I can get it to spin 5 times with out letting up. Also, keep practicing, just keep going.
