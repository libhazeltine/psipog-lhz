			This is the complete methodology for writing constructs to share with other people, or to read off to create very sophisticated constructs later.  This'll be a long, extraordinarily dense post.  But there is a lot of cool stuff in here that I suggest you learn how to do, as you can then start keeping records of your experimentation and even invent stuff and give them to other people.  This will probably explode your brain the first time you read it.
<br />

<br />
There are a number of basic forms for the writing of constructs.  The first is diagramming, which involves a circuitlike diagram I have used pictures of in the past.  This provides a detailed picture of how the various components of the construct interact, paying particular attention to the motion of energy through the construct.  The second is active notation, which uses equalities and mathematics similar to a chemical equations.  This notation is more useful for describing the exact transformations of energy and action that takes place within the construct's functional or intrinsic components.  A more fundamental tool is the use of energy descriptive notation, which packs the earlier, somewhat clunky, method of describing energy into a very small number of symbols.  The last critical one (I have been a busy little man) is the constructive notation, which describes more simplified constructs using notation rather than a diagram.  More complex constructs are virtually impossible to represent with this, but particle-constructs, for example, work beautifully.  These four are the most important.
<br />

<br />
Diagrams consist of a number of basic symbols drawn on graph paper and connected together.  Circles represent varieties of energy, squares represent functions, and triangles are one of a number of symbols which represent proprietal functions (designations turned into a science!), in this latest type, the other new symbols represent the various species thereof.  Diamonds being reactive functions, double slashes being disassociative functions, etc. etc.  If you have questions about this, pm me, but you probably can get by with just triangles as designations using the old system.  I tell you truthfully though, using functions instead is much faster and easier if you take the time to learn.
<br />

<br />
Active notation is similar to a chemical equation, using chemical formulas to describe a change.  G + G = 2G is a simple active notation equation representing the compression of two G streams into one denser one.  (It's fairly inefficient, however.  8G2 is my standard compression)  These can do just about anything, and be as complicated as you want.  But since the action is purely conceptual, there is no reason to cram lots of functionality into one action, you can just chain multiple of them together.  Granted, lots of actions makes the construct more difficult to form, but a small number of fiendishly complicated ones requires still more skill.
<br />

<br />
Energy descriptive notation is also deviishly complicated, but can describe any kind of energy that I have discovered or can possibly think of, though I make no attempt to pit my system against infinitude.  So feel free to get creative with it.  Essentially, energy can be described in a series of equalities and inequalities, as well as highly abstracted formula.  G is simply E = G.  Similiarly, compressed G is 2E = G.  Now if you want to try getting really fancy, try something like 4E = (3M-3N)^2 &lt; 4G = 16J.  This is perhaps better split into two different equations and linked together, as 
<br />

<br />
4E = 4G
<br />
16J = (4M-3N)^2 &lt; 4G
<br />

<br />
Essentially, this states that this energy is at quadruple compression and quadruple diffusion.  Though it simplifies to E = G, a function is required to split it such.  Think of it as a loop having X (in this case four) notches on it where it can be cut into straight segments.  Or perhaps a square.  Whatever.  The second part of this energy description states that it is composed of 16 parts J, which is equal to two folded elements of quad-compressed M and tri-compressed N.  The sum total of the energy of the folded M and N is not to exceed 4G, thus describing the nature of the fold.  I should perhaps go into more detail about folding to explain this example, but it's a little intensive.  Pm me if you're genuinely interested.
<br />

<br />
Constructive notation is the simplest of the lot.  Basically it is the addition and shape description of a small or simple construct.  For example, a tetra-piscine particle is simply four piscine energy packets arranged in a pyramidal tetragon.  This can be written as c1P + 3P, which reads &quot;center of P with three P particles.&quot;  If there were a third element that would be around the second layer of P.  To represent other energies in the same constructive layer, use parentheses, c1P + (3P + 1G) is a charged tetra-piscine containing an extra G.  (by the way, piscine is a variety of energy: (2G+1)/4 = (2E - 1)/4, and G +[(Omicron)] (cross-associative function of the entropy of G, which causes it to bind with matching cross-associative properties, with other useful effects) 
<br />

<br />
I guarantee that was my most confusing post yet.  Sorry about that.  You don't need to know or even think about half the stuff I said, but I illustrated it anyway.  All you really need to know to use this is that you can draw diagrams with circles, squares, and triangles to represent energy, action, and designations respectively.  Reactive notation helps to pin down precisely what those reactions are, energy descriptions enable you to effectively customize or describe whatever energies you use or synthesize, and constructive notation lets you make sophisticated energy constructs from combinations of basic energies.
<br />

<br />
As a sidenote, higher order energies or magics can be made as well, with the same basic concepts, but using higher-order functions, with more fundamental operations performed on them.  One example of a folding of pure energies, might be, from G and X, written as (2G + 3)(3X + 2G)(G-X) / (G^3 - X/G).  Incidentally, if X is tetra-piscine this magic will hold shape, and it continuously bounces short-band energy between its layered shells.  It creates a shield which is continuously active, forever, requiring no (user maintenance) input.
<br />

The most disturbing thing about this post is that I have only scratched the surface....
