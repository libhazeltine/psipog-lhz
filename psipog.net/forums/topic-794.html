Anyway, you'd use telepathy with animals just as you would with a human. Difference is, it's simpler.

			I can understand you thinking that you're telepathic, but animals do not think in words as far as I can tell. They don't know the English (or any other human) language and cannot communicate to you in a language like that. Animals use lots of body language. You might just be paranoid

			I understand cats pretty well. You're right, they do give off a lot of body signals, which is interesting because they are very carnal and are universally understandable. Cats most often have that apathetic/ bemused look of someone who couldn't give a crap if they tried.

You could program your SC (sub-concious) to interpret their signals as words that you understand, though.  Right?

			Apollo, I think that would be going through a lot of trouble just to &quot;hear&quot; the thoughts of animals. Sometimes emotions and &quot;primal&quot; feelings can interpret a lot more effeciently. &quot;I want&quot; type emotions can go a long way. If you have a pet why not practice reading what they are feeling/doing?

			our senses are filtering our environment
<br />
when someone goes blind the physical part of their brain that was used for seeing things is taken over by the other senses as to enhance them in order to compensate for the loss
<br />
applying this to telepethy and just reading people in general, i know as i have gotten more accurate with my reads i have experianced almost words in my head that explain that person's mental state to a tee
<br />
i know this because when i get very accurate reads of my friends i ask them if the phrase that just went through my head was what they were just thinking (and almost everytime i have been right) - it is important to sometimes ask them to say the phrase first as to know if they are just making a false memory or not. i also tell them first sometimes as to create justification for them...but one has to be very careful of making false memories of their thoughts because the recreation of memories can happen at subconsious levels, so you/they wouldn't know that you/they are making a false memory of the thought shared
<br />
i am just suggesting that this process works in a similar way to the sense thing because telepethy is another way to filter your environment.

Can those things even think? Either way... I doubt it. Unless your brain and the animal's brain both have a sub-c that can understand each other's (which I'm not so sure those things even have one for anything more than important bodily functions) sub-c... then no
