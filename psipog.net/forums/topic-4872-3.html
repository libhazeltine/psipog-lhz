Anyhow, let's see if anyone can find a connection...
<br />

<br />
1) We can only see a tiny fraction of the known universe, and can't even experience about 95% of what's there. (We call this 95% or so &quot;dark matter&quot;)
<br />

<br />
2) 95% of the brain's activity doesn't apply to the waking state, or &quot;physical reality&quot;.
<br />

<br />
3) Scientists don't know what 95 or so percent of DNA does, and disregard it as &quot;junk dna&quot;.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I think I see a pattern here...

			I just remember something about gaxalies, such that for gaxalies to take and keep there form. Some guys and some computers did some math and found out that gaxalies had to be 3x bigger for them to get there shape. Amost enough matter to cause a big crunch. I also remember that dark matter it beleived to hold a gaxaly. About 20% in a gaxaly.
<br />

<br />
Its easy to see a pattern, such as America dollar bill.
<br />

<br />
       13 original colonies,
<br />
       13 signers of the Declaration of Independence,
<br />
       13 stripes on our flag,
<br />
       13 steps on the Pyramid,
<br />
       13 letters in the Latin above,
<br />
       13 letters in &quot;E Pluribus Unum,&quot;
<br />
       13 stars above the Eagle,
<br />
       13 bars on that shield,
<br />
       13 leaves on the olive branch,
<br />
       13 fruits, and if you look closely,
<br />
       13 arrows.
<br />
        And, for minorities: the 13th Amendment
<br />

<br />
And yet we still reign surpreme.....errrr in some....ok forget that I don't want to get potlical and its not for this bored. As for the DNA part, I heard of a lab that is carefully recording every bit of the human DNA in Maryland. We getting closer.....

			okay, sorry to be a nerd but i think some stuff should be clarified:
<br />

<br />
1.  anti-matter exists on the quantum scales and explains some weird quantum...weirdness.  anti-matter combines with matter to produce energy...e=mc2.  i don't think anti-matter has anything to do with psionics, but it's been used for a lot of technology.  it's also not dark matter/energy.  
<br />

<br />
2.  a tachyon is a mathematical entity created when string theorists tried to use einstein's hypotenuse.  they had to put it into 22 dimensions, and what they came up with was an extra particle that had a negative square mass...which is impossible.  that makes it a very weird particle that defies physics as we know it.  later versions of string theory (which is still only mathematical, none of it has been observed) eliminated tachyons by creating things such as spin...i think.  i could be wrong.  i'll go check out my textbook in a minute.  but i wouldn't trust tachyons 'cuz right now they're still math...
<br />

<br />
3.  It is currently thought that Junk DNA assists in turning genes on and off in eukaryotes.  So it's not really Junk at all...Out of curiosity...If Junk DNA were coding for paranormal/other-worldly/not physical stuff...How would that work exactly...?  Would it make invisible proteins or something...?  Like...How would it code, cuz it's not using mRNA, we know that.  Or anything else that can be seen...I dunno.

No offense but as a nerd you seem rather forgetful about these things.....I know how that feels all to well.
<br />

<br />
However I think the DNA and the anti matter thing was settled.

			checked out my textbook for anyone who cares, lol:
<br />

<br />
supersymmetry and superstrings killed off the tachyon.  it doesn't exist in modern string theories.
<br />
 
<br />
yeay for physics.

			I don't really agree with string theory....but I myeslf don't think the tachyon don't exist....well for a little while now.
