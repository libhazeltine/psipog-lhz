			I have no special way to make shields, though I do have a few I have not heard of before. Some I'll post, some I'd take to long to explain there job to discribe them. And some I don't have the skill to make yet so I won't even try to explain there job. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Black-Lash Trap Shield: When hit the shield acts as a solid mirror shield, exept that instead of reflecting the energy it storys it. The energy is reshapped into the type spesified in the trap discriptor, and then returns to the caster to do evil deeds apon him.
<br />
-Visulization: I think of it as a thin almost clear shield. A faceless person is visulized as using harmfull Psi against me, but it is absorbed into the shield. Then, the discriptor word flys back twords the facless person, and is absorbed into him.
<br />

<br />
Energy Leech Shield: When the shield is hit by a ping, telepathic signal not caused by yourself, and so on, this shield is ment to absorbe the energy. Clean it of any harmfull leftovers, thoughts, ect, then send it to an energy reservoir, or, if none exist controlled by me, then to myself.
<br />
-Visulization: The same as the Black-Lash shield, exept the attack energy is visulized as red, then after it is aborbed it is visulized as green flowing into the reservoir, or target for storage.
<br />
--After-Thought: If one had enough skill this could work exactly like the Back-Lash Trap Shield with the leech discriptor. The Shield would focus the energy into creating a link between the shield, and the person who attacked the shield. Then, any Psi they tried to pool could be leeched out of them as they attempted to pool it. That was the origional idea anyway. Just an after-thought now.
<br />

<br />
Reservoir Shield (Untested): This shield is ment to go as a piece of another shield I have not been able to make. It stores energy from the Energy Leech, and like-made shields. I don't have any visulization for it however, because I have not yet tested it.
