			Mostly for the mods, but I guess others can answer this to.
<br />

<br />
I already interviewed peebrain, I have tried interviewing other webmasters but no one has answered, so I brought my interview questions here. I ask that an under-study of peebrain answers but I may get more than that.
<br />

<br />
Interview Questions
<br />

<br />
1.	What do you think of the Psionic Community now?
<br />
2.	How do Psionics and “New Age” correlate?
<br />
3.	Do you think some Practitioners are after a higher meaning or have most lost their way?
<br />
4.	Where do you think the Practitioners now are going?
<br />
5.	How do you think these Practitioners relate to those who do not practice the arts?
<br />
6.	Do you see the Practitioners as more advanced than those who do not practice the arts?
<br />
7.	Do you think embracing these abilities will lead the way for a New Wave of human-kind?
<br />
8.	Do you think skepticism is an important part of evaluating claims?
<br />
9.	What are some of your own experiences with both: Practicing (if any) and Skepticism (if any).

It's sloppy. i guess it's to be expected from a community who's key majority is children just hitting puberty. (i'm not saying that's everyone, but sometimes it sure as hell feels like it.)

To me Psionics is the boiling down of all the new age hoo-hah that's out there. Taking out the facts and making it more scientific.

Some never found their way to being with! I've got my own reasons for doing this kind of stuff. not because it's 'cool' or 'different' but because i have a thirst for knowledge.

Unless there are some serious people who actually get out there. regardless of any possible repercussions, and scientificly prove it, then we're going nowhere.

(Arts?) Some (idiotic) 'practitioners' believe that they're better than the general population because they know about this sort of stuff. but that's a load of bull. you can't generalise. people deal with other people in their own way.

No. Everyone is created equal. we are all capable of doing anything anyone else can. even if the environment we live/grow in differs we're all one and the same.

I can't see there being a widely accepted form of psionics in year to come. perhaps it will become akin to a religion or sport. With only  people interested in it practicing these &quot;arts&quot;.

Without skepticism i wouldn't be who i am today. If i didn't analyse anything i was told/shown then i'd probably be doing &quot;electrokinesis&quot; and crap like that.

I hardly practice anymore. well, most stuff. I try the occasional OBE now and then, and that's my focus right now. i'm skeptical as they come when i'm in the mood to be. Psionics is kinda boring to me these days... doesn't get me going like it once did. oh, well.

I find to see many to be what they're aren't. I find some sites to be ran with inexperience (psionics and web design). I find some that is lacking members or use the chat more often than the site. I find some with poor articles, some that'll make you want to rip your eyes out. Although, the community itself as people, I would wish some of them would see that the only way to learn is through not someone telling but through practice and thoughts.

I'm trying to achieve higher levels of psionics, but practice isn't coming around very often as school is burdening me.

I'm not as skeptic as much as some of these actual poggers, I'll open my mind up a bit. I'm mean, some ideas that would be claimed to be impractical or improbable, I might aim for it. Of course, if science doesn't catch up and beat me to the answer.

Depends how you look at it, I guess my answer is that its the same as any other Community. Only a different view on different matters, however like most groups they tend to stear away from major issues and ignore what is importent. I don't think everyone in the Psionic Community is completly like that however.

A little of both may be for all of them, I don't really know them enough to tell. But there all human so were already lost in some way. Some of them may have reach a higher meaning, but parts of them are infact well be far lost. Or so that is to me. We are after all only human.

Of cource, just look at my quote. However without the foundation of simple turths to build up your foundation only more choas develops. But I see that finding simple turths to begin with are not so simple to begin with. One has to be completly open minded to what could be ture and what they know could already be a lie....

Wonderful, I think some of my skills were build up naturaly but it wasnt till I found this place did my mind open to new windows. But I don't see myself better of anyone else, infact I see myself at the bottlem.

They would be my dreams, if not for them I wouldnt have open up to the possiblities when I was younger. They let me begin in practicing the arts without me even looking at a book or any websites. I learn on my own for many years but I wasnt to into them to streghten them to the next level. Powerful as they were.
<br />

<br />
Infact a few months before I found psipog I was giving up on my &quot;self reseach&quot;. But it was not till one day parts of me lead me to this website, my eyes open once again but wider! I believe my work have come back to me, but this time its here to stay.

My thoughts on the Psionic Community...well, I like it, I think most people who are part of the community are at least somewhat intelligent and they are interesting people.

I am not sure if I can answer this well, but I think they are becoming more as one as time progresses.

<br />
When they begin their journey for practicing, no. But, I think that after a while in being in the field they will start to look for a higher meaning.

The practitioners will spread out all over the place.

They are just people that are a bit more open to things than the people who are in the &quot;norm.&quot;

Not really, but once again, they are more open to things and are willing to search for what they want.

Possibly, but there is still more than just &quot;abilities&quot; to cause a change such as that.

I can't really say...I guess it's good to be a skeptist but you should at least keep the door cracked open.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Practicing, well I don't practice much. I have tried a little TK, energy manipulation, OBEs. I also meditate a lot. 
<br />
I am not really much of a skeptist.

<br />
Ok.
<br />

<br />
1. What do you think of the Psionic Community now? 
<br />
Well for psipog, it's closing dow. When it comes to more credible sites like ppsociety, the communication is slow but some topics have good quality.
<br />

<br />
2. How do Psionics and “New Age” correlate? 
<br />
The two shouldn't be in the same category though many people place them together. I have done so as well before. The &quot;New Age&quot; is a categoru while Psionics are practiced abilities.
<br />

<br />
3. Do you think some Practitioners are after a higher meaning or have most lost their way? 
<br />
At first, no, they were trying something new and were selfish. But after practicing these abilities awhile, I notice a change and seek more than selfish means.
<br />

<br />
4. Where do you think the Practitioners now are going? 
<br />
Those in psipog are leaving. Those in others, are going to continue to practice and reach a new goal.
<br />

<br />
5. How do you think these Practitioners relate to those who do not practice the arts? 
<br />
I think those that practice such arts are advanced in a sense that once these arts are widely accepted, we will be ahead. But besides that, we're pretty similar.
<br />

<br />
6. Do you see the Practitioners as more advanced than those who do not practice the arts? 
<br />
As stated above, in a sense, yes.
<br />

<br />
7. Do you think embracing these abilities will lead the way for a New Wave of human-kind? 
<br />
Not yet at least. I think we may be looked at as an example of what can be accomplished but we can do more than just a few abilities if we seek a higher path.
<br />

<br />
8. Do you think skepticism is an important part of evaluating claims? 
<br />
Yes. It is important to not fall incredibly gullable but not have such a closed mind, you dismiss everything.
<br />

<br />
9. What are some of your own experiences with both: Practicing (if any) and Skepticism (if any).
<br />
I have practiced energy manipulation, telekinesis, healing, minor telepathy and really try to OBE.
<br />
With skepticism, I'm still trying to manage. I'm sometimes gullable or want to believe something so much I dismiss everything against it.
