			Sean you cant! Dont archive the site!!!
<br />
I realize that you created psipog for proof and not for helping people to learn ,and now that you have this &quot;proof&quot; of which you speak your shutting it down! &quot;Psipog has fofilled its purpose for you but not for us. Your &quot;students&quot;. Why not give Psipog a new purpose the purpose you thought you created it for. Helping people discover truly amazing abilitys. Now you say you've figured it out. Great, now you can help us figure it out too. If you must quit psipog at least keep it running! I'm sure other authers will use the chat and forums and Q&amp;A!! Please sean. This site means so much to me... when I had just found it after looking at thousands of other &quot;psychick&quot; websites which only wanted your money, it was truly a &quot;ray of light&quot;. I always knew there was something strange about our minds and this site helped me figure it out. Please , for all the other people out there who want to find out, who want to know, who want to be great, dont let this light dim.
<br />

<br />
Please consider my suggestions and those of all the other 14254 and growing number of people....
<br />

<br />

<br />
Thanks
<br />

<br />
Joe

			Read the whole post before answering, it can misled you! I answered NO because I thought you were talking about archiving the whole site not archive as shutting it down.
<br />

<br />
I'm also against the shutdown, pass it over to someone else who is entusiastic enough to take a good care of it.Taking the site offline would be a terrible waste and a stupid move.I understand Sean aka Peebrain has other plans in his life but this is large community and everyone who wants to learn TK comes to PsiPog first.
<br />

<br />
Don't condemn thousands of people who will probably join the PsiPog in the future just because you switched from telekinesis to OoBE.It's a selfish move, think about others.I support Sean with his plans because I'll probably join the new website but don't kill this one.If you don't have time, let someone else run it.
<br />

<br />
May be harsh but that's what I think.
<br />
At the end it's all about you and your decision and we'll have to respect it whatever it may be.

The info for all those beginning seekers will still be here. He made that point clear. Not accepting his wish, his natural intuition to wanting to move on; to serve a greater purpose, is a selfish act <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
He explained did he not? If you are his students, then respect the wishes of him as a teacher. Don't make this harder on him. I know you feel like it sucks Psipog is not going to be interactive anymore.. But really, that's all that will go away really, the interactive part. It is only natural that he wants to evolve. Don't you think he has considered this decision over and over before? Don't you think he thought all this through? All these people who feel like they are so dependent on Psipog, I am sure he has thought about them. Nevertheless, he has decided to follow his own path which leads beyond moving psiwheels with no greater purpose than being self-satisfactory. There are plenty of forums, there will perhaps be a new forum at his new site as well... Don't worry so much, there are plenty of outlets like this forum and this chat. Things come, and things go. You let them come when they come to you right? You should learn to let them go when they fulfilled their purpose also. How can new things come, when you are not willing to let go of the old things?
<br />

<br />
Try to accept and respect his wish, I'dd say. Don't keep begging him to recall his decision. Try and see the beauty of it. Admire his courage and decision.

This is peebrain's site.  He can do whatever he wants with it.  There are plenty of other good sites out there and that is why i created my site, <a href="http://www.psilinks.co.nr" target="_blank" class="postlink">Psi-Links</a>.  You will find more sites that are just as good.  Everybody has to move on.  Communities come and go, thats life.  No community will last forever.  Peebrain has made 3 different sites (Psipog, Codetank, and that bleeding one).  He obviously has more than he can handle along with daily life.  You have to respect the <span style="font-weight: bold">Webmaster's</span> choices about <span style="font-weight: bold">their</span> site.

With my post I was actually pointing out to the fact that yet another topic on this has been made. I already foresaw the same discussion coming to this topic again.
<br />

<br />
I only quoted that part from your post, because I think that that is the way alot of members feel like. So I was not referring to you personally <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> .

			If i may : mayby this &quot;shutdown idea&quot; came, because someone don't want PsiPog be operational. A conspiracy theory, but... It's too big, it has too many members, let's close it. Hmm...
<br />

<br />
As for me, if peebrain doesn't want to &quot;rule&quot; this site, so he should give the Webmasters rights to someone else. Closing it is not an option.
<br />

<br />
Science is Evolving, right ? So is this what you mean by saying &quot;evolving&quot; ? Veni, Vidi, Log Out ? No, for me this is simple running from responsibility. 
<br />

Close - No, Give webmaster rights to someone else - Yes.

Yeah, seriously, I wish we can just leave right now and get it over with...instead of waiting 6 months talking about Psipog ending. It's too much anxiety. I just want to move on to Peebrain's new site and forum right now. But I guess we'll have to wait.

you've never written any code/html or ever had you own website have you?

<br />
webmasters have full control of what they do reguardless of what you think.

edit: I just looked around at some of the other psi sites, and they're bunk as hell. I cant belive half of you are members of two or more of these other forums.

			So mayby someone should build a new PsiPog site from nothing. There will be new web page of old PsiPog without &quot;Peebrain Code&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
Peebrain want to close this site, i understand. What i don't understand is that i have strange feeling that every PsiPog member think : &quot;how sad, i must find a new psi site&quot;.
<br />
You think &quot;this is the end&quot;. No, it is not. You simple run out of ideas. WE must find a new webmaster, with knowledge of html, build a new web page, a new forum perhaps. This is the end for psipog.net page, not for organization ! We must stay together guys ! Don't give up, let's do something ! Please, do not give up...

			i dont think you understand.  The forum and chat is being closed only.  The rest of psipog is being archived.  We didnt have a forum for a long time before January.  There are plenty of &quot;psipog&quot;s out there.  They are just named different things.  You need to get off your dependency of psipog.  It is closing and there is nothing you can do about it.
