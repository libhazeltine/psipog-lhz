			Ok I was on msn with honorable psion and I felt this strange energy. I tried to view what it was. Normally when I do this I travel through the stars and see my desired vision. This time it was just black, no stars. This has NEVER happened. After the energy passes honorable psion starts to feel it. He said its the strongest energy he ever felt. It definetly couldnt have been roaming. Then my friend in new zeland felt it about 10 minutes later. I live in Pennsylvania, then 5 minutes later its in Montanna, then 10 minutes from that its in New Zeland.

Sorry to stray into conspiracies on this topic, but Alex Jones, who predicted 9/11, today posted that another attack will most likely happen before october is over.

That's a bit sooner than 2012. Could that be it?

@ Daniel:Its hard to explain. To see what i want i travel at a high speed through the stars. It creates some sort of rip in time that i can travel through which in turn lets me see my desired time
