			The goverment and the &quot;military top secret underground&quot; know more than you think. In fact they're making you think that they don't know anything when actually they do. They just don't want the public to go all crazy so they're keeping it a secret. That's what I think.

			i agree with infected. Humans naturally fear what they dont understand if the government were to announce that psionics were real ppl would freak out and would start hating us and the government (more so). i think this is undeniable so to keep their votes the government keeps it hidden.

			One could really go into a HUGE conspiracy theory on all this. The government knows MUCH more then what anyone can imagine. Notice how the reports downplayed Quantum Theory whilst also saying that it might be the key to figuring it all out. I think that's BS, and I think they know nearly the complete effects of Quantum Theory on all of this.
<br />

<br />
Conspiracy part--How do you think they found Sadaam? The government can keep checks on <span style="font-style: italic">anyone</span> in this world. Its just who, and when they choose to find such people. With all this research into Remote Viewing over the years, are you telling me they can't find Bin Laden? Bullshit.

			The gov't knows everything. They know all about psionics. They know about this site, and every other site about it. They are not interviening with it because they know it is real. The &quot;secret&quot; military base Area 51 holds all the keys to it. The aliens have landed there. The aliens have mastered all concepts about psionics and have even made technology based on it.

Man, <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" /> You are PARANOID.

You have no proof of this, except probably, internet sites. I'm right yes?

Why would WE make &quot;extroardinary soldiers&quot;. This site is for learning.

			Nah, I'm pretty sure aliens don't live at Area 51. And aliens mastering psionics...heh, who knows, but I'll say one thing, Dreamcatcher is definetly a good movie. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
They do however, do a ton of stuff with radioactive material and secret ships there. Take a look on google maps...its quite interesting to look at Area 51. Its surrounded by small organized craters and plane landways. Secret stuff definetly goes on there.
<br />

<br />
But anyways back to topic. I've known people who've tried to remote view or project towards places like Area 51 and other high security places and it never works. They're always repelled, and my theory is these places are not only protected by the army and high security forces, but by psionics as well, with large shields and other protective energies surrounding the places. What do you think?
<br />

<br />
I don't even pay attention to the fact Bush and the government might be listening in on phonecalls, I'm more afraid of the fact people might possibly looking into my mind for the government's own sake. Agh!

			As a matter of fact, I have had difficulty viewing classified locations before, in blind runs. The Groom Lake facility is an airforce testing facility, and has been publically admitted to being such. I don't buy anything about aliens, though. No matter.
