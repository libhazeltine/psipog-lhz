Sometimes I think that although articles are helpful, an additional resource is needed, the resource I have in mind could be an area specifically for personal experiences.
<br />

<br />
This may be in the form of a dairy for example, one which documents psionic experiences on a daily or even weekly level.
<br />

<br />
In the past couple of days a lot has happened to me (psychokinetic wise), I think it would have been helpful to have read someone else’s experiences to see if my own experience was common, and maybe to gain a greater understanding of exactly what was going on with my body. Also, the person posting their experiences can gain a lot from the replies they are given.
<br />

<br />
I guess what I am proposing is some sort of psionic blogging community. I’m sure this idea has a few problems that would have to be sorted out or prevented, but overall I believe it could work and be a hugely beneficial resource.

If such a community exists, PLEASE point me in the right direction and POST THE LINK.

			The personal Technique thread is there for some of the &quot;experiences&quot; and ways of doing something...
<br />

<br />
some people have journals and blogs on psionics.
<br />

<br />
I don't know what's on Peebrain mind nor the limitation of the forums and site. 
<br />

<br />
Couldn't you just....register for a journal or blog site and post your experiences?

			In the new PsiPog, it has the feature of creating your own Psi Journal/Blog.  You'll have the option of making it public or private, and if it's public, then others can search all the blogs on PsiPog.net for information and experiences.

			Yeah, like mine for example, see the little bloggie link below this text? it's mostly psi stuff, and a bit about me. So far who has gone in there have found it an interesting read. I strongly suggest the blogs of peebrain, sheepking, NI, and any other experienced psionics here :O

			Peebrain, that sounds awesome. That will make keeping a blog much more tightly knit into psipog, and make it visible to many people. Are there any other new features for the next psipog? 
<br />

<br />
...and if you had any idea of the timetable for its completion, that would be great too.
