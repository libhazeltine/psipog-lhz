			Hello, I have been doing research on telekinetic/psychokinetic/psionic phenomena from a strictly scientific standpoint, and I've figured out that, at the very least, there's no evidence against it, and a good amount supporting it. I've tried a few times to create psi balls, and may have experienced some results, although I can't verify it.
<br />

<br />
My question is simply this: To you who have been on the forums for quite a while, how many people that post master the psi ball, and how long does it normally take?

			Also..... I meant to post this in the psi-ball forum. But it kind of applies to all psionic activity. Are there people who will never be able to do it?

			It depends on what you consider master and this should be in Psi Balls...Most likely, everyone can make one.

			Yeah, I would agree that everyone can make psiballs.  All it is, is energy, and you would know, were all made of energy.  Therefore, why can't we manipulate it? We can!  Also, it can take 1 try to 1 day to 1 week to 1 month.   I would say that to master it would take a while, but to consistently make one, about 1 week although some get it much faster.  
<br />

<br />
Good luck and let us know how it goes!,
<br />

			Indeed anyone with enough practice can master making a psiball but i have two things: One Im curious as to where you found this evidence, if its online post a link ^^. Two the real skill is not mastering just making a psiball, but telling it effectivly what to do and actually having it work is the skill wanted with this.

			The scientific evidence for telekinesis is actually quite obvious, and you don't really need a website to prove it. Only look at what you see around you and what is in history. (I may get a little into religion here, but I promise to keep it brief and objective, so please don't lock the topic)
<br />

<br />
From what I have seen, there is evidence for a LOT of stuff that we previously thought impossible or nonexistant. Take dragons, for example. There are several mentions of dragons in ancient texts from around the world, including the Bible (the Leviathan is, in fact, a dragon, and not a crocodile as some translations would have it. Crocodiles do NOT breathe fire). There is also equal if not more evidence of a worldwide flood; every ancient culture has a flood story. The same is true with psionics: Magic in England, Chi in China, and Chakra in India. These places were huge distances apart, and yet there were many practitioners everywhere. Where there's smoke, you can usually count on a fire of one kind or another. What I'm trying to figure out is where this fire is, and how big it is, figuratively speaking; how much you can do with psionics before it goes into a realm I'd rather not mention (and cannot mention) on this forum. How far we can go with just human power alone, basically.
<br />

<br />
As for evidence today... yeah, it's possible that this entire site is a hoax (I don't think it is, but anything's possible... there's another evidence in itself). If that were true, a lot of people went to a lot of trouble for such an elaborate hoax, and that's just one site out of thousands. My basic &quot;proof&quot; for this is &quot;Why not?&quot; I have seen a lot of things that say it could be possible, and no evidence to the contrary. (Not saying that just because you can't disprove it it doesn't exist; psi has some hard evidence, even if it's hard to come by)
<br />

<br />
Well, there's all the evidence I can come up with off-hand. The old addage, &quot;If so many people agree, it's most likely true&quot; applies here. I know for a fact that there is something in psi. I'd just like to find out how much.
<br />

<br />
PS: Sorry if I pissed off a moderator with my religious stuff. I'm keeping it objective here, and I continue to insist that, although a large amount of its evidence comes from religious texts, psionics itself is a completely religion-neutral ability. Hope that cools your jets a little  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

Much better than I would have done explaining it!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  Also, the only real way to believe for yourself, is ofcourse to try it.  Simple as that.
