			I started PK this past monday.  I moved the psiwheel within 5 minutes of starting.  I did at school in the mornings for people, although I had little control of it.  I then tried it Saturday night and couldn't budge it.  I have two questions...
<br />

<br />
1) Is it normal to have a headache and not have any PK power if you do it too much? How long should I rest before attempting it again?
<br />

<br />
2) Where can I learn to have control?  Another topic or article would be appreciated, as well as personal techniques.

			1) yeah, it's normal. When I started doing pk, I would have a day when I could move the wheel, and then the next day I had a headache and couldn't, but then the next day I could practice again, but then the day after that I would have a headace again. It kept going for about two weeks before I realized that I was practicing way too hard. When I eased up a bit and took a lot of breaks (and had a few bananas) I found I could practice every day and be fine.
<br />

<br />
2) control, as well as other techniques come from practice. I know you hear that a lot, but that's just the way the world turns. The more you practice, the more you are exposed to it. The more you are exposed to it, the more you begin to understand it. The more you understand it, the better you will be able to control it. Articles aren't going to help you as much as figuring it out yourself will. I think it's much more powerful to figure out how to use pk by yourself than having someone do it for you, mainly because there is no universal way to do pk; everyone is different and as a reslut, so are their techniques.

			I think I understand where you're coming from Isotope.  I'll try PK this afternoon and post back on what happens.  Other opinions are welcome as well...

			This is called burnout people, you're supposed to avoid this as in the short term it takes longer to recharge from having nothing and in the long term you can cause permanent damage if you do it too often. Mike I'd recommend both shorting the practices and spacing them out more, feeling a bit drained is ok but what you're describing is over exertion, tinker with things too try and get it so you avoid going that low. You should get stronger with time so after a while you can always make the practices longer and more often.
<br />

<br />
Also as to what Isotope said yea, bannanas and orange juice are your friend,  you need stuff like that to replenish the nutrients you used up *afterwards*. It helps but its not enough for a full rechage so you could get right back to work (for one its not enough unless you gorge with then brings up health problems and second your body takes time to metabolise things).
<br />

<br />
Basically, the energy that you use to do pk isn't coming from nowhere, for energy can neither be created nor destroyed, so you can run out and run into stuff like this, but also its normal to feel tired as you'd expended resources in a similar way to normal exercises.

			My only concern is that when I am replenished I'll have to start at the basics and work my way up again.  I heard people talking about it and I am easily persuaded.  Also, what should I move after the psi-wheel?

			Tk can survive with downtime, one of my close friends actually advised me to sit it for a couple *months*. Not only this but sometimes you can resolve stuff if you sit it for a while. Speaking of which I gotta start up again soon <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			First day i started, i only tried for maybe 30 mins the whole day. My brain was fatiqued but no headache. Second day I practiced roughly 35-40 mins. If you slowly work yourself up and take breaks in between you can build your mental strenght capacity up pretty dang quick. I'm just now starting my second week of doing this and i'm up into 3 hrs a day practice now with frequent breaks and if i noticed my mind being tired I stop right there and then, no use giving myself a headache and undo all the advances that been made. 
<br />
Learn what your limits are and only push past those lightly and in no time you will be able to practice a great chunk of a day. As for resting, had a two day hiatus this past weekend, and my third day was a break day.
<br />

<br />
As for control, there will come a point that the wheel will seem uncontrollable &quot;my opionion of course&quot; is when need to work on sliding/rolling practicing strictly on that. Feel free to correct me if i'm wrong <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />
