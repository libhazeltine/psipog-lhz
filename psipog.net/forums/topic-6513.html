			So what forms consciousness?
<br />

<br />
Your receptors are infinite and you have the capability to receive any energy signal. Thing is, the lower organisms with no level of consciousness can only pick up on the lowest levels of stimuli because they don't have as many receptors (they amount grew with evolution) and either blocks or doesn't recognize, pick up on, or memorize the rest. As the chain moves up into more complex organisms, more and more levels of energy are picked up and converted as stimuli. 
<br />

<br />
Minds are like computers, they may start of either completely empty or with the basics. From there they're programmed and translated to other things. But here's where it gets more interesting: The receptors and the levels we can pick up are always growing and have an infinite capability for the conscious organisms to grow. Basically we're able to pick up more and more stimuli every second. 
<br />

<br />
So with a fetus, they'll obviously pick up on the lower frequencies and as they grow and develop, they'll develop the receptors for the higher levels of energy.
<br />

<br />
 Therefore, the development of consciousness is proportional to the amount of stimuli we can pick up. 
<br />

<br />
What defines consciousness: The growing amount of stimuli we're able to receive, recognize and translate and the levels of energy we're able to recognize.
<br />

<br />
More on spirituality: 
<br />

<br />
As a celestial being, all knowledge (meaning energy and stimuli) are out in the open and travel freely. It's when we're astral where we shed the boundaries of which frequencies we pick up and are open to infinity but in physical forms however...
<br />

<br />
The same signals have been established from the moment we took physical form on the earth. Everything we pick up on is temporarily closed off and stored when we die and as we're reincarnated, that file on which energy we received and interpreted, travels with us as we take our next form. Since the file becomes temporarily closed off, it slowly opens once we have the ability to recognize and interpret familiar signals again. Once we recognize these, the signal from the exact instinct it first reached us is relayed. Often these are from past lives.
<br />

<br />
So that's my theory on how consciousness developed. It may be off the wall but I don't see anyone else coming up with anything, but as I said, actually take time to understand it and let it sink in and then let me hear your feedback.
