			Hello all.  I have long been fascinated by both physics and ESP, and have a theory on how they work.  Telepathy is nothing more than radio-like transmissions.  As electrical impulses flow through the brain, they produce EM waves, like a radio.  Other humans, with the same length of conducting pathways in their brains, can convert these signals back into electrical impulses.  These received pulses, however, are very weak.  Telepaths and Empaths can both pick up on these weak signals, and remap the electrical pulses to figure out what the sender is sensing/feeling.  Likewise, a shield is just a low power electric field around your brain, acting like a jammer against other signals.  Fluctuations in the field can be sensed by your brain, thus allowing for alerts, however, the jammed message cannot be reconstituted, protecting the user from incoming and outgoing messages.  Clairvoyance would be using the combined consciousness of billions of people to know their actions in advance, and thus predict the future. Even PK *might* be explainable.  If the brain could, like an MRI, cause all the atoms in the target (or part of the target) to align, it could use small electrical pulses to repel or attract the induced magnetic field, and thus the object (I think).  Furthermore, the ability of the brain to influence/move/detect atoms explains cryoPK and pyroPK, by accelerating and decelerating the motion of individual atoms.

			Very nice theory.  I'll post any questions I get.

			This one is easy to disprove.  If it was electromagnetic waves making it work, they would decrease in strength as the sender and receiver were separated by greater distances.  However, it has been proved that telepathy works independantly of distance, and that it does not work using the electromagnetic spectrum.  Leonid Vasiliev got two subjects who could be put in a hypnotic trance by telepathy and put the sender in a lead capsule with a lid that sealed itself in a groove filled with mercury, and the message still got through.  That's impressive because lead stops all the forms of radiation we know of.  Tests have also been done with the sender and receiver in Faraday cages etc and over long distances.  It makes no difference how far apart you are or how many forms of known electromagnetic radiation you block.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Another possiblity is that human brain transmits through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace_theory" target="_blank" class="postlink">hyperdimensional subsection</a> of our reality. In a sense using superstrings(1 dimensional objects) to conduct the flow of EM  through our &quot;hyperspace&quot;. So there is surely still a possiblity that EM's are being used, but to what extent we still not have tested, mostlikely due to lack of knowledge in different fields of unexplored quantum physics. Therefore ruling out the transmission of EM waves would be quiet foolish.

			When I was younger I once thought that the very soul was a form of the samething and so was physic abilities but I grew out of that after I saw flaw after flaw in it. Second I never seem to get to liked string theories, I know the results they have but the fact that space itself has to be (1 dimensional) sounds to aboslut to me. Also the fact that time seems to be one of the key elements in the string theories also bothers me.
<br />

<br />
I think a more simple word for hyberdimensional subsection is just hyberspace....but that donest really manner now does it. Normaly I think of the universe the same of most people mix and string togather like the frabic of cloth. Of cource the thought of photons traveling through a different rount would solve the problem. 
<br />

<br />
But Neil Bohr once said (something like this I know I'm wrong on it but right in the general point of view) 
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Neil Bohr

It is pointless to make therotical work, if you don't plan to make any oberserations.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
So I agree seeing Woodpecker already prove it wrong so I'll end it there. I think the EM waves are more of a byproduct of the brain and not have anything to do with thought patters. I like where Nalos is going because it involves many other dimensions then our normal 3. I believe the photon travels in 9 dimenions out of the top 10 (some theory says 16, others more) But I'm sure people already checking up on my information while they read this. Makes my work easyer, but the evidence shows no good support for the hyberspace path.
<br />

<br />
I remember saying this before but I think the psi patters are more related to tachyons particles which explains some of the adnormal obeys to the law of physics. But again I see the flaws in it.
<br />

<br />
I do think of this, the nerves of the brain may not be able to do these actions through acts of chemcial fusion process to form the commication. But rather through a self absorbing the information through some kind of quatumn state.
<br />

<br />
Or I could be wrong, I have before
