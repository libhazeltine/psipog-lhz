			If you haven't read the article you need to know what it says before reading this post. <a href="../art-psiballs-tactile-method.html" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/show.php?cmd=wp&amp;id=19</a>
<br />

<br />
I'm not trying to discredit Peebrain with these criticisms, but this new method he's developed really doesn't seem adequate to me. It just seems like an ineffective way to manipulate psi.
<br />

<br />
So, it seems inadequate because Peebs is saying telling you to replicate physical contact in your mind so you can feel the psi. It seems to me that the replicated physical contact is being mislabeled. All it is is induced analytical overlay. That doesn't mean you're moving psi. So in the end you are just learning to stimulate physical sensations rather than manipulate energy and this of course doesn't move the practitioner anywhere skill-wise.
<br />

<br />
I don't know, maybe I came to understand that article differently than what Peebs meant, so correct me if I'm misunderstanding the article, but I feel very strongly with what I said. This method doesn't seem to effectively teach energy manipulation.

			Are you from Veritas??? Because they were saying the same thing there.

<br />
Anyway, I have been making psiballs for a few years and i still found this article very helpful, especially for helping my friends. The thing about the physical sensation is it gives people who are new at this something to build off of. When your new at this it's easier to know if your using psi or not by relating it to a physical feeling.

			The method uses tactile visualization, and it's very effective <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
Pure visualization hardly compares to it. I can personally vouche for the method, even though that may not be enough for you... But, when using this method I have more success with other people feeling Psi too.

well that was only speculation. i havent tried it myself because it just seemed odd to do something like that, but now that you guys are saying this stuff it wouldn't hurt to give it a try.

If you are sensing psi properly, wouldn't you experience tactile visualization if you are moving throughout the body?

			I can vouch for this as well. I think the entire point of visualization is to get to tactile feelings. My best successes with other people feeling my energy has been when I started with visualization/tactile and finished with tactile.

			It's perfectly logical to be skeptical of results.  ANY psi ball method has potential to induce false results when you first start.  That's why I linked to my article on how to verify your skills at the end.

			What Peebrian says is true.
<br />

<br />
It IS very possible to create false-sensations with ANY method. That is why you must be VERY careful when you are performing Psi manipulation.
<br />

<br />
You would feel stimulus from the psi moving through your body. But that stimulus is not the visualization <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. The visualization is the feeling YOU make. Often times, the feeling you try to make is in conjunction with the feeling of Psi, so it feels slightly &quot;different&quot; than just a random sensation on your body.
<br />

<br />
REmember my &quot;Beginner's Mistakes #1&quot;? That discussed feeling thing psi, and feeling a false feeling.

			so I tried a few days ago...and i didn't really feel anything different than what i usually do. if anything, replicating the touch of my fingers was sort of distracting. 
<br />

<br />
i think it this method might have the placebo effect.

ill just continue to do what i've always done w/ psi manipulation. i was hoping the technique would work wonders for me, but it doesnt. i really wish these skills wouldn't take so long to master, but hey, i guess getting there makes it fun.

			I agree with freakinrican626, this method gave me just the same feeling as when I used the other methods; however I was left feeling rather &quot;detached&quot; from the energy; I felt as if I had far less control over it because I was concentrating on maintaining the sensation rather than on directing the energy.

			Perhaps this method is better used once you've already practiced with another kind and already have a handle on basic psi manipulation.
