			This is my topic dedicated to trying to understand a nagging question that has been bothering me: Since it seems the most basic type of shield is the empathic shield, used to filter out emotions so empaths do not get overloaded; And since constructs are seemingly limited to what we are capable of, are we already capable of filtering out these emotions?
<br />

<br />
If so, why would we need a shield to do so?
<br />

<br />
Since this question popped into my head, I have felt no need to shield to deal with empathy, I just deal with the emotions themselves and block them out mentally, it actually works better for me.
<br />

			i have always understood that a basic resistance sheild was the most basic...oh well  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />   yes, we are already capable of filtering out these emotions, but with some sensitive empaths, filtering isn't enough.  they need some other layer of protection to help them deal with overload.  in a way, they are already filtering out some emotions, the sheild just helps block the rest.  and in some cases, dealing with the emotions without sheilding (for long periods of time) can cause a &quot;delayed overload&quot; which most empaths don't want to deal with later, so they sheild to prevent this.  the sheilding is different from person to person, and some people are better at sheilding than others.  empathetic sheilds are <span style="font-style: italic">sort</span> of like an air bag:  you already have the airbag to protect you, but in some cases you need the seat belt's added protection to keep you safe and unharmed.

Woah, woah, woah, hold it. Your looking at it from entirely the wrong angle. What's the diference between stating,
<br />
  &quot;My psi ball can block emotions, so that must mean I can too,&quot; and,
<br />
  &quot;My psi ball can flare, so that must mean I can too?&quot;
<br />
 I hope I've made my point.

			@ survivorman: FYI Zell is a character from a game which I played awhile ago and just used the tag I have for PsiPog on everything and I'm used to it  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> Anyway what I meant was that since psiballs basically can only accomplish what we can, we should be able to block out emotions anyway without them.
<br />

<br />
@ Nightshade: You have a very good point, and I understand it now, thank you very much as this won't be nagging me anymore.
