			me and my friend were talking abt pk, and he asked me, the way we do pk, like we think of it and make it happen, can we use that same method and make hair on our body go back into the skin or grow more?

			Hello FuryX721,
<br />

<br />
Interesting question. Although I have no experience in increasing the rate of my hair growth, I wouldn't doubt that it would not be possible. It very well might be. However, please take in consideration that I have never heard of anything similar to this. So, I can't say &quot;Yeah, I heard of that, it works.&quot; My advice to you is begin practicing PK and see where it leads you. If you become decent enough, begin to experiment with it. 
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />

			Well I have done it more than one. So yes it is possible. It is not like you turn your hair back into your skin, but I magaed to alter the speed at which my hair grows. Not much is needed for this, merely the intention. If I went to get a haircut, and I thought it was really nice cut, I then wanted it to stay as it way, and it grows very very slowly then. However, whn my hair had been cut too short, and I want it to grow longer soon, it grows very fast. So biological processes like this can be altered with the power of intention. I suppose visualisation could do the trick as well.

			I would say it's possible, but I don't think you can cause hair to retract or anythings, that probably has to be done with a razor, but increasing growth does sound possible and I have tried it and it made my scalp tingel, although I don't think it worked.
