			2 days ago I was just messing around, trying Psi Balls. I was making them like Kakashi's Chidori (Naruto...), so I kind of formed Psi going into my hand, and changing to electricity.. 
<br />
Then, yesterday, My arm was feeling like it was being electricuted for no reason at all.. It lasted hours. Could it be because of what I did 2 days ago? It started off really noticable and then it slowly died down over time..

			How did it feel?
<br />

<br />
I mean, really, I've never been shocked or electricuted. I would think of convulsions and pain...which also could be muscle spasms and cramps from lack of Potassium (so I hear). Eat a banana?
<br />

<br />
Although, as much as I think the problem is.I do know that you should cease in such stupid habits as such of gay anime characters...find a new hobby then roleplaying characters from a terrible anime called Nurato.
<br />

<br />
You're lucky I typed this out in a friendly way....I was just going to post &quot;Well, stop acting like a fucking dumbass from nurato and you wouldn't have the problem anymore!&quot; But didn't feel neccessary.

			...thanks for the support neveza... (/sarcasm)
<br />

<br />
It just felt very tingly, and a bit painfull... And I dont role play any character from tv, I just thought of trying something I read in the manga, seemed like it could have worked. It was the first time I really felt anything from Psi balls besides very slight magnitism.. (If it was Psi balls and not some weird medical condition, lol)
<br />

<br />
(And naruto is not terrible, you may not like it, but that doesnt make it terrible.. And if thats your friendly...)

			what you are feeling shadow TH is what most people describe as bioplasmic discharges from the nurves in your arms.

			Nerves are very sensitive things. If you prematurely morphed the psi into an electrical current, it wouldn't take much of a charge at all to make your nerves go haywire. It's quite plausible.
