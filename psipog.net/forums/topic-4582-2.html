			That's some good good thinking Roy. For once a smart person on psipog. I'll rephrase it, the majority of the human population can learn to use psi. I haven't met one person that couldn't learn it but you are totally right that there could be someone out there. From this evidence and that it has been around almost forever I am deducing that everyone can do it. Our whole world is based on things we take for granted or guess a; I'm just making another guess.

			hmmmm... well since i'm no genetics expert i don't want to take a side. i just think that if anyone wants to do some research on the possibilities maybe we should look into what they are saying about the 'smart gene'. 
<br />

<br />
I say this because it seems to me that those who practice psionic abilities tend to be smart and/or become smarter while developing their skills. (keep in mind i haven't conducted an experiment, but i guess i could get one started to see if its true or not. hit me up if you're interested.) Maybe we can at least find a connection between the two and since scientists are most likely researching a 'smart gene' we can come narrow down the possibilities by looking at this research, if you guys get what i'm saying.

			i wasn't saying that those who aren't smart don't do psionics at all, but i think since when practicing psionics we are conditioning and 'working out' our minds, we build up certain aspects maybe resulting in becoming smarter. at least that's my theory. 
<br />
so i wouldn't necessarily say that just because you're smart you're going to practice psionics more than those who aren't smarter. i just think it comes down to the fact that those who are smarter just tend to be better, more gifted, and learn psionics more quickly than those less-smart. 
<br />

<br />
hmmmm with saying that i guess you could say that smarter people are more attracted to psionics because it just comes more naturally to them. who knows.

I believe some intelligence comes from the subconscious especially the great memory part. Psi is based upon good conscious-subconscious communication so practicing psi could make you smarter and smarter people could have an affinity. It's bad logic and no hard proof so I won't state it as a fact yet.
