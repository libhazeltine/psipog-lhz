			I was trying Ap and got the feeling that my hands had almost left my body... but I felt really tired, I could almost feel my spirit trying to reach AP, but I couldn't fully get to that state. I fell asleep (I think I'm not sure), and when I woke up I was drifting in and out of consiousness for several minutes, i kept only opening my eyes for split seconds, then closing them. I was only 'asleep' for 10 minutes, but everytime I opened my eyes while I drifitng in and out of consiousness, things moved, and I could feel every muscle in my body go tense, then my spirit rising out of my body. Things stopped moving after a second, then I would shut my eyes again and it would begin again. It hurt in places because my muscles were so tense. I can't even remember what I dreamt of, just that I did manage to get out of my body for a few seconds, but I was so tired and drained I couldn't fight the feeling of my muscles becoming so tense, the tiredness and everything. I wasn't fully consious, but I would still see my room. I wonder if this was AP but I achieved it throught a dream like state??? 
<br />

<br />
I have been practising AP for the last few days, but very concentrated, for hours and hours, discussing it and reading up techniques, it seems to be something that comes very easily to me, unlike seeing auras. 
<br />

<br />
Just wanted an general opinion on the situation
<br />

<br />
Thanks

			Very interesting. I think it was probably astral projection. This is because you felt a spirit rise from your body and then come back. This makes sense, as this is what is supposed to happen. Yes. I think that you achieved AP.

			Staying fully consciouness in an astral projection it's really hard, I'm happy only if i remember anything of my travels  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />
It's normal to fall unconscious when you &quot;fight&quot; to stay awake of mind when the change comes.
<br />
If you have ability to reach this practice practice and practice it and you will become good at it.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

What makes you believe this?
<br />

<br />
Since your into defence why not try shielding before you OBE?
