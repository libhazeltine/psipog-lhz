			Is it possible to make a psi pet that actually has its own intelligence?  The only ones I have been able to make are almost &quot;robotic&quot; that have only a strictly limited number of capabilities.  Making one which has only the basic fundamentals of a pseudo-living organism which is capable of creating its own functions based on its situation would require a completely new type of programming.  If anyone believes they have accomplished this, please say how.  I would be very interested to find out.
<br />

<br />
As a sidenote, it may be possible to create an entire psi-species which is capable of reproducing and maintaining itself.  Interesting idea, but could be pretty dangerous.

Haha! That's nasty dude...

I like this idea actually. Can be a little risky though if they go a bit crazy on you. You would have to lock tight the programming if you were planning on making loads of them. And there would be no shortcuts either if you think about it; you can't give it your mind cus that's just asking for it be disobedient. You would have to program each and every bit.

If you could flare easy why not try making a harmless new species and then setting it up for tv.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> Everyone would be like: &quot;ALIENS!!&quot;

Your perverted LOL. It's not like you you could see them do IT anyway. Unless you are a advanced psion and you fill 2 stuffed animals with programmed psi to do IT. But I wouldn't even attempt that, it's weird.

			I think it says a lot about the people here that I created a post with a word like &quot;sentience&quot; in the title, and all you guys can post in it is about dogs and dragons having psisex in your living room.  Wackos  ; )
<br />

<br />
I think the major problem with making a new psi-species is that the forces of evolution WILL act on it.  And considering that psi is an insubstantial energy (I personally think it ties in with the basic energy that makes up the universe) which can be channeled in massive quantities from any form of matter, they could become absurdly, absurdly, ABSURDLY numerous very quickly.  If they use mitosis, splitting whenever they gather enough energy, and they can gather enough energy in one minute, then you have an exponential growth curve operating on 2 to the mth power, where m is the number of MINUTES the species has existed.  Assuming a standard rate of evolution, that means you would have several hundred times the biodiversity of earth in a matter of years.  And Earth has had life for 2 billion years.

I suppose it'd be possible, but not probable.   Waaaaay too much work to properly create one.    Let alone an entire species.

I can see someone achieving a sentient construct, then having to go Chronus  or Uranus on it's ass(yay for greek mythology!).   I'm thinking that with some sentience it's will to survive would at least give you a run for your money.
