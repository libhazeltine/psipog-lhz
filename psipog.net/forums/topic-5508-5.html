I'm sorry, I really wanted to read everyone's comments, but I ran out of time. If someone has already said what I am about to say, I'm sorry. I read your blog Peebrain...I am not exactly sure if my memory serves me well, but it sounds like you just want to make a new website focusing on OBE's and sprituality etc. But you made this website, you made the rules and those rules were no spirituality and religion. And you can change those rules. If you want to talk about different things and learn about different things, then add those things to the website you already have--Psipog. Why let something die when you are still going to stick with psychic related ideas? I don't know much about the internet, or about websites, but you must just be able to add your new ideas to the already exsisting Psipog. Don't get rid of Psipog...change Psipog. This is the first thing that came into my head when I read what you wrote. I love it here, this is the first place on the internet that I have ever been on where I can talk to people. I know almost everyone here. And I have changed, my beliefs are so different it amazes me. You can have your cake and eat it too...can't you?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
I think that would'nt work SomeFatGuy,
<br />

<br />
You see, everyone is used to Psipog the way it is. It has established a name for what it stands for. That is why these members are here, because they like Psipog and what it stands for. The way it expresses it's ideas. Besides that, you'dd still have alot of people around asking the same questions about how to move a psiwheel and how to make a ball of energy between their hands. The atmosphere of Psipog is just not suitable to be changed, or mixed up with OBE/Spirituality. Because 1) Psipog would lose its own authenticity, and 2) It would not be beneficial for Peebrains new project. 
<br />

<br />
I'dd say it is best, considering the circumstances, that PsiPog gets archived. That way, those people who have questions about spinning paper on a needle, can still find <span style="font-weight: bold">plenty </span>of information here. And there are a dozen of other sites where they can ask further questions. 
<br />

<br />
The information in Psipog (so I mean without the interactive parts) Has a certain authenticity that is best left alone the way it is. A mix up between the already established PsiPog, and OBE/Spirituality would, on one side, screw up Psipogs already established authenticity, and on the other side, it would hold down the progression of the new project. Besides that it would also provoke alot of conflicts. 
<br />

<br />
That is why I think it is not profitable for either sides to perform your idea. But that's just the way I see it.

Why would the freezing of this community stop you and others from learning and progressing? Same info will still be on-line..It is a bad case if your progression really depends on this site's interactive parts only. You should be capable of learning on your own, instead of being dependent on any site whatsoever. You say you feel used, but <span style="font-style: italic">as long as you don't give your power to learn and progress away to anything outside of you, then nothing outside of you can ever abuse you.</span> What I am trying to say and warn you for is: Don't be dependent on any site or anyone to learn and develop. Take your own responsibility when it comes to your process. Peebrain is not responsible for the further growth of you or any of the other members. No one here was obligated to join, we made that choice ourselves. So we should not blame Psipog or Peebrain for creating or closing this community. Don't give away your power of growth, don't lay the responsibilities that belong to you, in someone elses hands. We should all take up responsibility for what happens to us and the way we react to it <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> . I believe it will benefit us all once we do that. It is a very important principle.

			Having got over the initial shock, I'm now agreeing with Peebrain.  I know it's sad and I don't want it to go either, but it has legendary status with all of us.  That won't change.  Peebrain is the founder of Psipog and really is the reason it is such a success.  Without him it might go horribly wrong, even if taken over by someone else.  That in itself would be a sad end to a great site.  I also admire his strength in making this decision as it must have been a hard one.  It's been 6 years of hard work, which is a lot for anyone, and since all the information will be archived anyway it will still be an excellent resource for newbies.  We don't want to spoil its sanctity whatever we do, so yes, I have to agree that it is a good idea and fully support Peebrain in his decision.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Hmmm...I understand what you are saying, but at the same time I feel that at least a part of what I said still has something to offer. I still want to see if Peebrain has anything to say about my idea. I was just connecting that Psionics, spirituality, and OBEs all can be related in a sense. And who says they have to be related to be on the same webpage? A lot of members have already said that they will go to Peebrain's new site anyways, so if that is the case then the a lot of Psions are open to Peebrain's new interests. I for one will go to his new website, I would love to be able to go on a sight that offers more information on things that I like. I would appreciate guidence in spirituality and I am curious of OBEs as well. Everything can and probably will change in this world, why not Psipog? 
<br />
At this point I am going to express a different opinion from another part of me: Doesn't it seem like Peebrain will just keep on going around making awesome websites about stuff he is really interested in and then stopping them because he will eventually get bored with what that interest may be? It was just a thought of mine, especially since it may happen in the future.

As for the idea about just changing PsiPog...
<br />

<br />
I can't.  PsiPog was FOUNDED on those ideals.  It is an essential part of the identity of the website.  There is a reason why parent companies will spawn smaller companies with different brand names.  It's because the way the human mind identifies things.  The truth is I don't have the power to change PsiPog.  I can post new rules, but it won't take away from the public's perception of what PsiPog IS.

Well, im hoping to fulfill this one if its the last thing i do.
<br />

<br />
Ok, i know that psi will still be here to use, have fun withm and practice, but thats not the point. PsiPog isnt just a site to us. Its a symbol, it has a meaning for it self and something deeper.

Remember when you were a very little kid, and there was the one thing you loved so much that you couldnt get rid of even if you tried because you didnt want it to be gone? For me, it was a little stuffed bear. My grandmother gave me it when i was a baby. I had very bad asthma, and nearly died many times. I used to sleep with it by my side every night. But then i grew old of it, and put it in my closet on the shelf. I plan on taking it down some day, and giving it to my kid.
<br />

<br />
My point is, PsiPog is the little bear in this story. And, you peebrain, are me, and everyone else, is the kids. You grew old of the bear (psipog). What do you want to do with it now? What seems right to you? Should you throw it out and never have to deal with it again, but time to time, regret that you did. Or would you rather keep it, and keep it for us? 
<br />

<br />
I hope you make the right decision peebrain. I hope for all of us who has ever loved this site...

			So Sean, the &quot;next&quot; PsiPog or whatever you intend to call it...will you shut that down just as easily as this when you advance even further?
<br />

And will it be just as easily accessable for us?

Please answer this post, I feel I and everybody else deserves the answers to the questions within it.

I personally think, that it won't go like that, since you can divide people roughly into 2 categories: Sceptic and Believer. This site was founded on the sceptic part of Sean's process. His new site will be based on him as a believer. So even though he will continue to progress and evolve, the new site will have the right atmosphere and identity to grow along with that, unlike this one. Also I think it is impossible to say what lies ahead. I don't think it's possible that he guarantees anything about the new's site survival. In the end, I believe everyhting (except for truth) is transitory. So wether or not Peebrain guarantees anything, you still can't predict what's going to happen. So I'dd say, if you are afraid of getting heartbroken again in the next 10 years or so, don't become attached so much to his new community  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> .
