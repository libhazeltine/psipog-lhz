			alrighty, so i've been trying to make a psiball, and from what i've been reading it's got a lot to do with visualisation.
<br />
visualising what you think energy looks like and all.
<br />
my problem being that i can't think of a visualisation that makes sense to me.
<br />
when i think of energy, i don't think of a color, or temperature, or anything else that could really turn into a visualisation.
<br />
kind of like the wind; you know it's there, but you can't see it.
<br />
and since i've never really used psi before, i can't go off of a feeling either.
<br />

<br />
any suggestions?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			ya im kinda in the same boat as you,
<br />
i would recomend that before you start anything. think about what energy looks like or sounds like, i thinks about lightning charging the ball in my hands directly. i have hade some minor results. yet im only on day two of trying out psi. just keep trying

			Just do whatever fits, don't force it.

<br />
If not that, then turn to Tactile visualization.

			that's my problem.
<br />
you say to do whatever fits, and to think about what energy looks like as i see it.
<br />
that's the thing.
<br />
energy is everywhere, you just don't necessarily see it.
<br />
so for me, energy doesn't have a color, or texture, or temperature.
<br />
how do i visualise something that, for me, has no visual qualities?

The visualization doesn't necessarily needs to be visual. Anything you think about 'energy' can be recalled to make a psi ball. 
<br />

<br />
Yea it's like the wind, you know it's there because <span style="color: blue">you can feel it</span>. You can't see the wind, as you cant see a psiball (unless you flare). And you're saying you cannot feel a psiball yet (this is my problem too). Even so, try to imagine a electric/hot/cold/anything sphere, you say energy doesn't have a color, or texture, or temperature, but this will help your subconscious to associate psi as energy (that's why we visualize a hot sphere to make a hot construct, we gather psi and convert it into heat, we are not creating a hot ball alone.)
<br />

<br />
And the most important, don't 'search' for a specific feeling, it varies from person to person.

			For me, it was a matter of knowing it was there, and convincing myself it did exist. At first, I had a friend make one for me, so I could feel it, and then I tried myself, with that energy in mind. Thus I disocvered my own energy pattern and feeling, and I just go from there.
<br />

<br />
Energy can be in any color, or shape. Whatever works best for you.

			I never said that energy have to look like a specific way, could be cow shit going in your hand, it wouldn't make a difference. Just do what you think is right...If you have a hard time doing that then learn TACTILE!

<br />
Tactile visualization is all feeling and no mental imagination.

			It doesn't even need to be visualized. You just have to have that feeling of energy pouring into your hands, into a shape. And to get that feeling, you just need to know. Visualizing is just to help.

			if u really want to know what psi looks like, here it is
<br />

<br />
ki energy are tiny little dots of changing colour, and moving at a rapid speed in a way much like Brownian Motion
<br />

<br />
don't ask me why it is like that, some things are just the way it is
