			&quot;3.43. By performing Samyama on the relation between the body and Akasa and at the same time bringing about coalescence of the mind with light (things like) cotton down (there comes the power of) passage through space.&quot;(The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali)
<br />

<br />
  This excerpt explains a process of a deep meditative state which allows &quot;passage through space.&quot; My interperatation of this quote is that phasing is the result of an understanding that physical and ethereal body is the same, which, when accompanied by the symbolic imagery of cotton down and other  such fluffy things, results in the ability for the physical body to pass through physical objects like the ethereal body does to physical and ethereal objects. I have not yet pursued this, but I'll be doing a two week study in a bit followed by a two week break followed by another two week study to note any external or internal experience. I haven't tried it yet, so it can't really be called a technique; it is only an excerpt from an old text at the moment.
<br />

<br />
  I know a lot of forum members would really love to walk through walls and what-not, and when I found this, I felt it would make a good topic.

			I understand that completely, but I also have come up with the idea that the way a person approaches an experience can change the way they feel about it. Imagine, if you were pushed out of an airplane without any warning and you had to pull your parachute cord before you died. That would really suck. Now, imagine that you are skydiving, and you jump out of an airplane after having long instructions on how not to die. That would be really fun. It is the exact same with any remarkable event considered paranormal by most people. Rain was probably very scared by the idea that the world was not what she thought it was. If she had been trying to do this, of course, she would most likely not think it was a horrible thing to undergo.

			Hmmm, I think I need to answer this.
<br />

<br />
First of all, I have no quarrel with your interpretation of Patanjali.  You might be right (or, conversely, you might not be).
<br />

<br />
I would, however, quibble with your interpretation of what happened to me.  I'd been involved with psionics for roughly a quarter of a century when the phasing started.  Yes, phasing seemed pretty improbable to me.  It still does.  Starting to fall through the bottom of a motor-vehicle travelling down a highway at a hundred kilometres per hour is frightening, yes.  It also hurts.  (I strongly suspect that it would have hurt even more if I'd fallen all the way through....but not for long.)
<br />

<br />
Falling partway through the countertop in my kitchen is merely inconvenient, rather than scary.  That said, that usually hurts, too.  Likewise, going backwards through the chair in which I am sitting is not overly frightening.  However, it does hurt, quite a lot.
<br />

<br />
From my experience, it seems that how much it hurts seems to be related more to how much of the body is involved, and which parts.  With the countertop, it is just the hands and arms. With the chair, it is the ribcage, spine, various internal organs....
<br />

<br />
*shrugs*  In any case, enjoy your investigations.  Keep us posted.

			Watcher was telling me about something similar to this:
<br />
The percentage a person's body is metaphysical--vs the percentage of their body that is physical.
<br />

<br />
How does it work?
<br />
My guess: drastic changes to the frequency oscillation of the body matter?
<br />

<br />
Problem:
<br />
Gravity.
<br />

<br />
A complete phase would bring you into the center of the earth?
<br />

<br />
Suggestion:
<br />
Learn how to fly before you learn how to phase.

			I have always thought about that, but I don't think it's a big problem. You don't sink to the bottom of the ocean when you swim, right?
<br />

<br />
Also, thanks for your insight, Rain. I will be sure to keep those points in the back of my mind during my experiences. My samyama program will begin soon, right now I'm just working through some basic deep meditation to increase the benefits, whatever they may be.

			I'd say that's doubtful, as it is something she apparently doesn't like. It's an interesting idea, and one I would try myself (just fingers through paper and such), but I've only been interested for about a year, and getting consistent results for less than 3 months, so I'm not even close to being able to pull that off  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Well, so far I have had no success in phasing, but I have done a number of the nifty little tests in the yoga sutras, such as stopping my hunger, physical pain, physically visible aura, etc. It's all temporary, of course; I don't feel like pursuing any of that. I am going to also be trying to levitate with the instruction in the sutras (laghima).

			i'd trust rainsong on this one. phasing through objects does sound painfull, and painfully inconvenient. what happens if you start going through the ground? how would you get yourself back up?

			so deep mediation.
<br />

<br />
have you tried coming up w/ your own mantra to help? i am 100% sure that a mantra could help w/ your progress. you probably already know that though since you study sutras =)
<br />

<br />
ive always been interested in sutras. the Patanjali sutras are the ones where you're getting your levitation and phasing information? i'm not well versed in the sutras so im gonna check 'em out.
<br />

<br />
btw, you said you were studying levitation too. i heard of these yogis learning to levitate. hav e you gotten to the point where you can sit in lotus position and jump? they were jumping considerably high. i thought it was an interesting documentary.

			Personally, I wouldn't want to try phasing. Because, the way i see it, when you phase, your molecular structure would be intersecting that of the object. Thus, if you walked through an oak door, you'd have wood molecules in your lungs! NOT cool!
