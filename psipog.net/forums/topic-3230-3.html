People say a great deal of things on chat forums. Psi vamps seem to be one of the most prone to exaggeration. Your always drawing energy from around yourself so I don't see how it would make much of a difference if that energy came from a person. The only problem I can see is if that person was sick and from those I've spoken to they are adept at filtering the energies they take.

<br />

<br />
Aren't one of the indications of being a psi vamp greater natural psionic skills? The more energy you take into yourself the more your energy body (or whatever you call it) has to develop to process and store that energy.

<br />

<br />
This is because your constantly taking energy from your surroundings anyway. Be it the trees or the earth your standing on, whenever I'm out in nature I can feel the energy around me. Whats the difference between drawing energy from a tree and drawing from a person? In both cases the energy isn't &quot;yours&quot;.

<br />

<br />
It may seem that way but if your body has got used to operating at a higher level of energy when you stop drawing in so much energy you will feel tired and sluggish. Any energy where ever it comes from feels nice because its the stuff that makes us up and sustains us. Nothing against whoever your friend is but that blackout thing sounds like an exaggeration.

I meant that it can naturally lower it, as in, when you have vamped loads and then you are getting tireder and tireder because of the &quot;drug&quot; effect, and then you try doing pk or anything when you haven't vamped for a while, you won't be able to do it aswell, unless you vamp again. That's the dependent thing I was on about. Hope that made sense  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />
And we should probs get off this topic again, starting to sound like chickens again...

			Of course your going to be able to do PK better when you've just vamped because you have more energy to perform it. When you haven't charged yourself with energy from a source you'll find your abilities weaker. This doesn't prove your suddenly dependant on vamping this just means that your dependant on energy. Your posts suggest you think this is unique to human sources when its not. If you stopped drawing energy from somewhere you'd soon find your abilities fading. 
<br />

<br />
The drug effect you talk about is your body getting used to a higher level of energy. Then when you stop drawing your body has to start getting used to less which makes you feel tired and fatigued. You seem to take this as some sign of a druglike addiction. The same happens when you exercise regularly and then stop. Your body is used to the higher level of activity so you start  feeling restless and out of sorts when you do nothing. 
<br />

<br />
Do you get what I'm trying to say or do you want to pick a thread where we can discuss this without sounding like chickens?

			hmm i got idea across my mind , when i started doing tk and pk i started to eat less , somedays i eat half what i always eat and maybe less then that so i think without we think about psi vampire or maybe call it psi draining or call it getting energy from outside and outside maybe is human and maybe just energy from natural or sun or maybe any other thing , we get energy from outside without even thinking of drain anyone energy.
<br />

<br />
so you can make physical work and you need to get energy and you get energy from physical thing ( foods ).
<br />

<br />
you do mental work and you need to get energy and you get energy from energy around you mentaly.
<br />

<br />
that is idea not completly sure of it but i start to believe in it <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> .

			Yes, of course you take some energy from everything around you.  But consiously taking a large quantity of energy from some one, is stealing.  And not like taking a couple bucks from them, it could screw them.  You dont know what they needed the energy for, you dont know if taking that energy could have tipped the scale and turned thier day into a bad one.  And for wahat?  The benefit of moving a peice of paper on a pin, or just having a lil more energy?  Thats selfish, and really wrong anyway you look at it.

And it's combat.

And it needs to be stop being promoted.

			If you read my response to you properly you'd have read that I agreed with you about people taking too much energy from one person being wrong (in my opinion) Skimming off the top of a group however is barely noticed and has no adverse effects. You seem to be demonising anyone that takes energy from other people because of the bad examples of a few. Also in your first post that I responded to, you sounded like you put some universal moral implications on something that isn't governed by morals. Energy has no morals.

I'd be interested to know what you think about drawing energy from nature then? In your own reasoning that energy isn't yours. What gives you the right to take it? Are you a vegetarian? I'd laugh if you spouted all this and then turned off your computer and went to eat your nice juicy rump steak.

I'm not promoting combat and psi vampirism, I'm just trying to promote logical thought.

			Well, there is a big downside to vamping. How do you know that the energy you are taking from someone isn't negative energy? That person could be ready to kill someone or could be hugely depressed. That aint good energy to have, especially if it's alien to your body.
<br />
 And about the energy taking from the plants etc, our bodies create their own energy in way more amounts than plants. So the energy we subconciously take from plants is much smaller compared to the energy we biologically make. It's only when we conciuosly make the attempt to drain energy from plants that it becomes stealing. Stealing is a concious act, so therfore, when you take energy from plants without meaning to, it is not considered stealing, but vamping from people is.
<br />
And just for the record, you can also take energy from objects.
<br />
BTW, has anyone tried drawing energy from a stretched elastic band or any other object that contains that type of potential or stress energy? Would the elastic band not ping back into shape???

So when I'm walking through the woods drawing in the energy there I'm stealing? Awww poor plants. Your getting in to subjective views that have no right answer.
<br />

<br />
Your perception of stealing is your point of view. Some people will think its wrong to take energy from another (even responsibly) and others will think its not. My problem is when you suggest that anyone who dares partake in these practices will end up as some kind of psionic junkie. Or in Rahmids case with his DEFINETLY combat, DEFINETLY not good. These are your subjective views and to spread them as fact is misinformation.

I completely disagree and I've never heard anyone say that before, either.
<br />
It is fact that if you take something that is not yours, it is stealing it. Now, you're probably thinking, well what about stealing subconciuossly? Taking energy from living organisms with our body is natural and almost uncontrolable. You walk through a forest and leech off trees without knowing it, that can't be helped. But as soon as you take it on purpose, it would be considered stealing. It is different for energy. If you steal and product from a shop accidentely, it is stealing, but shoplifting isn't really a natural thing for the human body to function, is it?
<br />

<br />
 Your statement is true for good and evil, but not for stealing. That's like saying that your perception of playing the paino is your point of view. Point of view is for topics like religion. Stealing is a one way thing. I have never heard a criminal arugue that taking a bannana from a store was not stealing because he couldn't help it and he was hungry. He will still get screwed for it.

That sentence pretty much explains what I meant, don't you think?

I'm aware of what stealing is. Thats fine though I'll rephrase it for you. Your perception concerning the morals of stealing is your point of view.

DamianM: Yes its the same as taking energy from anything else. Although those that are wise usually filter the energies they take to avoid any harmful energies.

But i'm done trying to persuade you.  We're both never going to change, so no huge point of beating it to death.  I still say it's really wrong and shouldn't be spread around especially here where it's against the rules to do so.

			Yes its very generous of you to let me slink away defeated. Where in my posts have I promoted the use of psi vampirism in anything but a responsible way? Combat to me suggests trying to harm someone with intent. I'd hardly classify skimming energy of people harmful. I've said nothing thats against the rules.

I'm a veggie too and don't need to take energy from anyone. Maybe if you took the time to actually read my posts properly, you'd find that this whole discussion that you seem to find so bothersome could have been averted. You can try to take the moral high ground all you want but your act is transparent to me.
