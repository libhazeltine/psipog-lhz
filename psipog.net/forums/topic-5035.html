			ok i moved my psi wheel up stairs into a closet that was in a room that had its door closed (note the room behind the door was 74 degrees)...
<br />

<br />
I stood back about 3 feet or so, and i got the psi wheel to move with my hand over a foot away... I got my dad's girlfriend to come upstairs and i had her watch....i stood there with my shirt over my nose and my mouth--my right hand holding my shirt up---and me being about 3 feet away..and i had my left hand about half way away from me and the psi wheel but  at an angle that was below the wheel and about midway pointing at the cup...and i was like &quot;YOU SEE IT MOVE!&quot; to my dad's girlfriend, and she was like &quot;Yes!&quot; and walked out of the room quickly!!!
<br />

<br />
Man that was awesome and funny!! but my next question is, does tin foil absorb heat? because i was gonna make a wheel thing using tin foil...
<br />

<br />
Um also, how long should i be working on the psi wheel b4 i move on to something else--and what would that &quot;something else be&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
thanks for the inspiration!

			Well, first off, great job on moving the psiwheel!!! Also, yes foil would move with heat but it is easier to move becuase it has less friction.   I wouldnt reccomend using foil if you have already spun paper as paper is the more diffucult of the 2.  Also, you should work on the psiwheel until you can control what direction it goes in and when to stop it.
<br />

<br />
Good luck,

			yea you can move the foil and paper psi wheel with heat but you need something boiling to get it moved so dont worry about that and you will know if you moved it or other things , heat is good to the wheels make it absorb heat so the object have embeded energy inside the psi wheel to make the object move easier , that is why we sometimes cant move the psi wheel untill we give it push so it embeded push's energy inside and then it is time to move it .
