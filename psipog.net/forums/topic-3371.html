			its kind of weird but when i do what i normally do to make it spin, its not working anymore. but if i leave my psi wheel alone and just browse the internet or something  it just starts spinning by itself. just a second ago i saw it was spinning and i was focusing on my hand. i kept focusing on my hand and nothing else and it got faster and faster. and another funny thing is i got 2 psi wheels and put them about 25 centimetres away from eachother, and as i focused on the one on the right, the left one span, and vice versa. does anyone know how i can get some control over what my subconcious is doing, because it feels like its toying with me.

			your subconcious usually does things when it shouldnt.Thats what some people mean about focused in-attention.Try to focus and then distract your sub-c by doing something or looking at something else.....see what happens. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

			Hehe, you know when people tell you that your mind can play tricks on you? Well, that would a be a prefect example of it. Perhaps the reason your sub-c is &quot;bullying&quot; you and making you pissed with this is because it doesn't think you're up to scratch. Maybe it looks down on you. 
<br />
I should try doing more than one psiwheel more often....

			The same thing happens with me all the time (spinning when I look away) but I've gotten better with it. One thing you could do is look at it and try to spin it and if that doesnt work look away then look back real fast as if you were tricking your SC into doing it. Even though that sounds weird it does work for me. Also if it is just spinning even when you were not trying (like if you were reading a book or something) I believe that is just because I/you don't have much control over PK yet (or your SC for that matter) It will pry decrease as practice continues.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" />

			Sometimes, when I turn it, for example, 90 degrees; I relax and the psiwheel comes back to its original position.

I have a rebellious subconscious.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

			When my sub-c acts up, it makes the wheel go in the opposite direction I want it to. I suppose I should concentrate on the fact that it's moving and not which way, but it's  too damn frustrating. <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />
