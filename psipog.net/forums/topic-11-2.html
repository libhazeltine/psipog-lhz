			If it wouldn't be that hard to integrate here, I'm a personal fan of LD4all's acronymn thing. Type in an acronymn, say PK, and in the post PK would be underlined. Hovering your cursor over it shows the full word, psychokinesis, and a quick definition of what it is.

			(Pretty Obvious) Fact: All of these word are in latin so all of them are (technically) correct.

I do agree with Peebrain saying that made up words are retarded but if it is a pretty common slang word then it should be allowed eg. Telekenisis.

			I think we should use terms found in a dictionary like Telekinesis <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=telekinesis" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=telekinesis</a> or Psychokinesis <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=psychokinesis" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=psychokinesis</a>
<br />

<br />
All other banned terms aren't even in the dictionary so they aren't valid.
<br />
BTW Telekinesis isn't slang it's just a synonym for Psychokinesis.

			Ha! I just looked up Tk and Pk in my school's online collegiate dictionary with 
<br />
word origins and date. Telekinesis was dated 1890. Psychokinesis dated 1914. TK came first. Just thought I'd share the info.

			If you read about studies in parapsychology, it separates them into two groups: ESP and PK.  That is the only reason why I think PK is considered more scientific than TK.  You will see TK being used in other mediums, but PK is the term most parapsychologists use.

Just a quick question:
<br />

<br />
Why are we allowed to use pyrokinesis and cryokinesis if, again, it is just PK? Biokinesis, ok, it is a little more complicated so I guess thats fine but why pyro and cryo?  Are they more commonly used?

			The reason I think pyrokinesis is &quot;ok&quot; is because it's widely accepted.  I.e., it's used in multiple published sources, and people can identify with it.  I don't consider the term scientific, because I haven't read of any serious scientific studies concerning it (although I honestly haven't looked that hard), but your average joe schmoe will know what the term is from comics and movies.
<br />

<br />
Cryo-PK is &quot;ok&quot; because it seems like the opposite of Pyro-PK... it's a little silly of a reason, and you could probably convince me to take it off the list if you were really persistant.
<br />

<br />
PK, TK, DMILS, Bio-PK, and pyrokinesis are the only terms I've heard used outside of the internet.  Cryo-PK is included only because of it's relation to Pyro-PK.  Everything else is scrapped.
<br />

<br />
If that doesn't make sense, feel free to share your opinion.  This is by no means written in stone, however I think it's a good guideline to cut all that extra crap out.

OK.  Just a statement/question:  Isn't pyrokinesis the same as cryokinesis technically?  Because you could argue that cryo is pyro but taking pyro away....and vise versa.  Just tried to sound smart... Good response though, peebs ^^
