			If it is indeed a ball of conciousness, then I would consider it alive. Computers can't do that yeah, just programs s'pose. They can still turn on you though, apparentely in the future. I even had this guy turn up at an assembly once in my school couple years ago who warned us that computers were going to take over hehe.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> People are saying that they are gonna be used in schools???!

thats the paradox-ish think about programming, programming is basicly &quot;telling a microship what to do&quot; say calculate 3 + 3 and it will do it. without saying &quot;ill do it but hand over that extra ramslot first, im feeling tired&quot; and whys that? becourse again, its programmed to do whatever we tell it to do
<br />

<br />
Can we tell it to think for itself? First, we must teach it what &quot;teach for itself&quot; means, that itself is a very hard task. Second we must make some kind of system that tells the computer how to &quot;feel&quot; what mood it should be in. 
<br />
Then we can start teaching it how to talk and what Evil is etc etc..

			Has anyone seen the episode of Star-Trek, where Data wants to resign, but can't because Starfleet does not yet deem him living?  In the end they deem him to indeed be alive.  And in it they define living as:

That's because they don't deem him sentient. I'm a trekky, and he was subjected to be dismantled and rebuilt and to see how his positronic brain was built to build more. It was a question of sentience, not livelyhood.
