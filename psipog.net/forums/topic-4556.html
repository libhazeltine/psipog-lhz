Well guys this may seem like bullshit (and it did to me too) but it was made by bradley thompson who is known for putting out respectable self-help programs. Furthermore his company has made some genually leglt non selfhelp software. Even still, he's one of the guys that who sells those instant-hypnosis shits and my brother bought one and it worked so since he had already established credibility I decided to give it a try.
<br />

<br />
The review:
<br />

<br />
data from everysingle psychic site that's free on the internet + three pieces of software to help you develop psychic powers + formated for day by day learning.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Sure most of the information in this course is free but the beauty of it comes from the day to day format he gives you for 5 months on devleoping supreme psychic powers. As always, he includes some of his binurual beat technology to keep everything fresh.
<br />

<br />
the software program ares
<br />
&quot;The intuition machine&quot;
<br />
basically a program that helps you build intuition by drilling you on random card things. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;meditation station&quot;
<br />
he includes some of the relaxation cd technology he sells seperately.
<br />

<br />
&quot;visualization station&quot; 
<br />
program that helps you  visualize. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
so basically its everything we can get from surfing psi-links.com + some programs + mapped out on a dialy bases for optimal trainiing.
<br />

<br />

<br />
If your some super hard core psychic master dude theirs just no reason to buy this coures.
<br />

<br />
But if your some lazy kn3wb who really doesn't know what skills to master first or what you should be doing every day or how exactly to train your psychic skills or any of that non sense this is for you.
<br />

<br />
but yeah, i'll copy and paste the table of contents for each book.

my review, and my words.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I just got the course today and i read through the material and its all solid and is a well planned training course for gaining psychic powers. but like i have said, <span style="font-weight: bold">EVERYTHING</span> can be found online. furthermore, it does ont give some subjects the attention they deserve. Whatever though. For me it will be a nice outline.  I skipped week 1 because it was a basic meditation course.

I'm highly against anyone charging anything for info like this.  You can find all this on sites for free.  It's true people.
