			Ok, before I say anything, hear me out. I'm not going on a rant or freaking out or trying to make people give me a weird look. But this is my current scenario:
<br />

<br />
I was listening to music on my labtop using headphones this afternoon and heard my dorm mate sleeping as the music went into transition. I soon heard him growling and howling in his sleep. He then started to chant things in a demonic tone. He said, &quot;Awaken my Mother&quot; and later &quot;November 4 2006&quot;. Soon after he started to continue growling and howling before he started to shake and his body went into fits.
<br />

<br />
I immediately started to research the date and found the following statements: “Plans are now being made for another round of ‘global demonstrations’, demanding urgent action to prevent the catastrophic destabilisation of global climate.” The headline of the article: International Demonstrations on Climate Change November 4th 2006.
<br />

<br />
The link here, “November 4th 2006”, is the demonstration of climate change meeting. “Awaken my Mother” correlates with Mother Nature and it’s climate. Count the letters in “Mother” and “Nature” Six and Six. The third six is in “2006”. Here is the link to the climate change article: <a href="http://www.greenguide.net.au/anuec/?q=node/63" target="_blank">http://www.greenguide.net.au/anuec/?q=node/63</a>
<br />

<br />
Another website I found was a collection of prophecies and here is a statement of a Pslam for 2006: “Psalm 105 describes the 10 plagues in the time of Moses. Could that indicate similar plagues hit the world in 2006 (Bird Flu or SARS, tidal waves and earthquakes, etc.)? These plagues may hit I think Muslim countries: the giant earthquake and tidal wave hit hardest Indonesia, the largest population Muslim country. I think a series of plagues and disasters may hit Muslim countries soon, because of the Muslim terrorism against the U.S. and Israel.”
<br />

<br />
More results on things such as tidal waves and earthquakes. Mother Nature 2006. More results I’ve found. Here’s the link: <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/zine2/Number666/calendar.html" target="_blank">http://www.angelfire.com/zine2/Number666/calendar.html</a>
<br />

<br />
Last: Currently, my friend is translating the Torah for me. It’s in Hebrew but a listed date in it is November 4th 2006. Here’s the link: <a href="http://www.hebcal.com/sedrot/lechlecha.html" target="_blank">http://www.hebcal.com/sedrot/lechlecha.html</a>
<br />

<br />
That’s all the significant data I have found thus far. I will add the translations as soon as possible and will re-capture the videos of my dorm mate from my cell with my webcam. If anyone would like to view them, you are free to.

Dude.  First off, finding &quot;666&quot; in that is real weak sauce because you're going through a strange and non-uniform method of finding it.  Also, I wonder what you could dig up if the date was Nov. 5th, or the 6th, maybe October 4th, and with that, I'm sure you can find some &quot;mother&quot; connection.  The &quot;Psalms&quot; evidence is pure crap.  It's religion and therefore it is ill-inspired and...ahem...wrong.  As far as that website with the fascination with the number &quot;6&quot;, if you look hard enough you'll always find what you're looking for.  If the number &quot;666&quot; was so damn powerful, then why didn't a godamn thing happen on June 6th, 2006?
<br />

<br />
None of your data is significant.  You're another Chicken Little.  Buy a clue.

Don't act like my response was unexpected.  You're  presenting an incredible load of bullshit.  Sure your roomate could be talking in his sleep, that doesn't make it significant.  Lots of people talk in their sleep.  Lots of people do lots of weird shit in their sleep.  It's usually not an indicator of death and destruction.  So before you throw an attitude at me, consider how it looks from the perspective of someone who isn't you: You post a thread entitled &quot;When the World Becomes Catastrophic?&quot;  You do &quot;research&quot; and come up with terribly flimsy information that provides terribly flimsy support to your terribly flimsy hypothesis.

			I did expect your response but I don't need this Chicken Little stuff. I rather people just read this quick documentation I put together inspired by what happened to me today. Did I say all this is happening? No...It's just a hypothesis with research I've done to support it how I can. It's not like people write history about the future.

I did recieve the translations of the torah, nothing significant.

			Uh-huh...Well I thought it over..I would like to add, before anything gets out of hand (discussion, controversey, flaming *lol*), that I may have just reacted out of excitement. Yes excitement. I thought this was pretty funny &amp; I just decided to search the stuff he was mumbling and thought some of my research was somehwat significant. Either way, I find this amusing to at least read and wonder &quot;Maybe...&quot;. Thanks.

			Ok lets put this into perspective. I was once told when I was talking in my sleep some years ago I said &quot;PLEASE NUMBER SEVEN DONT LEAVE ME!!&quot; Everyone who talks in their sleep spouts random bullshit. Or maybe he was awake and he was just fucking with you.

Btw the way Roy, the logic of &quot;It's religion so it's wrong&quot; is truly the epitomy of bullshit.  Saying the religion has no foundation (and showing the lack of basis) for a certain claim or prophecy would have been far more useful.  Prophecy is not a science and religion can factor into it regardless of your atheistic preferences.  Too many people still believe religion for it to be truly inconsequential yet <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

You're just playing with semantics here, Lightbringer.  I said &quot;ill-inspired&quot; meaning religious ideas/literature used to support any prophecy automatically weakens or even nullifies the conclusions that are drawn.  This is because religion is inherently flawed, filled with misgivings, and frequently misinterpreted.  Silly me, I thought that this could be inferred from my tone and the general tone of this website/forum.
<br />

<br />
Religion can factor into anything, yet that doesn't mean it should carry weight.  It does however, because, as you mentioned, many people believe in religion.  Also, fyi, don't make assumptions as per my religious beliefs.  If you want to assume that I'm an atheist because of my skeptical nature, then you'd be wrong (which I'm sure isn't a first).
<br />

<br />
Edit: No offense with that last comment.  I get aggressive when I wax intellectual.  I think you might have noticed that by now.
