			Well I kind of know what this sensation is sense I brought it upon myself. But let me explaining it to you guys who are better than me so I can see what levle I'm on.
<br />

<br />
During a meditation I got this tight feeling of intensity in my brow chakra. Not the regular semi-painful headache of a link.
<br />

<br />
But like theirs a huge mass of something heavy tightening within me. Like a mass of energy (i dont wanna say energy cause we all feel energy differnetly) in there. Furthermore sometimes it goes back into my head circles around and comes back. It's just always htere.
<br />
It's been two days now and it seems as if its permenant. Everytime I meditate it seems to grow into my mind and into the back of my head and get tighter.
<br />

<br />
Not complaining, my telepathy is great now. I got 6 in a row?
<br />

<br />
But what is this? I'm assuming it's just that i've OPENED my third eye to another level. The first sensation I got a while back was thick energy constantly leaking down my nose to my mouth (it was thick and i could super feel it).
<br />

<br />
But how far down the track am I? What sensation comes after this? What, from your experience, could you begin to once you got this sensation.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Thanks.

			Ahh this sounds like me man. You just have an overactive third eye. Congrats. I wouldn't know why it's like that for sure, but I find it a good feeling. I'm still trying to figure out why it happens &gt;_&gt;; so i'm in on this too.

Well I know what i did to make it happen.
<br />

<br />
I meditated on my third eye everyday.
<br />

<br />
I played binary beats that activated my third eye for hours at a time while doing regular tasks. 
<br />

<br />
I used mixtures of herbs such as wormwood cream (wormwood, vinegar, honey, slow cook for 3 hours, let dry, apply to htird eye)
<br />

<br />
and all around just tryed to open the thing.
<br />

<br />
My personal theory is that it's just the next level in opening my third eye to a higher extent. 
<br />

<br />
I just wanna make sure though, and want a more detailed explination on whats going on. Furthermore this is just my opinion through observation of whats happening.

			I never heard of anyone going to that extreme to open it. So far i've realized when it does open up, I become more aware of energy and a bit of my surroundings. On a more sciency approach, the frontal lobe seems to tense up, or get some pressure in the very front of it. I don't remember what it is exactly but i'm pretty sure it is just something extra that we never realized we could use to help us be more aware in our focus or surroundings.
<br />

<br />
To be honest I never truly payed close attention to what it does, or is; I just use it.

That's why I'm developing so quickly. If I had a NDE I could psychic powers in an instance. The speed in which I gain my power regardless of how fast and how slowly is completely up to me. Either that belief be true or not, it's ideas allow me to develop at frieghtening speeds.

Thanks. Ever since the end of the 21st it has stoped doing it constantly but when i sit down and meditate or focus boom. I think its a brain wave state or something.

			zricondude, you might have an open 3rd eye and just don't realize it. Yeah, mine's open, but I don't remember when it did open, but I had been trying to open it for the past couple of years. I get this feeling whenever I focus on it. What is it good for? What can I do with it? I've realize that I can see psi very easily when I close my eyes, and focus on my third eye, like when I'm gathering energy or making a psi-ball. I believe that one does not open the 3rd eye, they simply learn to utilize that chakra more every time they work on it.

<br />
When I talked to you I was surprised you said &quot;you researched the brain&quot;
<br />

<br />
but when I talked about the third eye and the subconscious mind not only did you have mixed ideals about it but you were at a loss. 
<br />

<br />
I suggest you research those things so that you can get a grasp on what they are and the concepts behind them.
<br />

<br />
Your a strong psychic, but you act a bit foolish and know at allistic at times when you really know nothing. `
