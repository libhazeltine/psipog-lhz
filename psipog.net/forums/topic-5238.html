			I showed a person that uses psi on my msn a another energy called ki and once he read all of it he made big visable ki balls in an instant. He said first they were small but then he made it almost the size of a basketball. What a lucky person. Hes been practicing for 2 years though. He shot it and made a bottle cap move so i guess it isn't that strong yet but wow!

			Watch the all caps topics, it makes it seem like you are screaming, and the moderators will get you for that.  Also, psi is the only energy form discussed at PsiPog.  Several of your other posts have mentioned &quot;ki&quot; energy, but please refer to the energy as psi to avoid confusion.  &quot;Ki&quot;, I hear, also has religious connections, and religious talk is forbidden on these forums.

Yes, avoid caps on topics. Also &quot;OMG&quot; is to be avoided at all costs if you want to be taken seriously. As far as the &quot;ki&quot; thing goes: They are considered the same here at PsiPog, different names for the same thing. Please use psi, as Barth said, it has less religious connotations. Third, about your friend... He can make flared psiballs and move bottle caps? Two years of practice? You should ask him what he's been practicing, and what the techniques are. Only if you're sure he's not BS-ing you though. If he's for real, I bet the techniques will be close to the ones on this site.

He might be saying that he practiced psi for 2 years. I mean, most people seperate the two.

By the way, use fucking &quot;YOU&quot;, damn I tired of this.

Exactly. Until I see a picture, I think that either:
<br />

<br />
A- He's lying because he thinks he'll get recognition.
<br />
or
<br />
B- His friend lied to him because his friend is a dickhead.

There may be another 'ki' in reiki, I have no idea.  But ki is the Japanese form of the Chinese ch'i or qi, which roughly means life force.  They both have basically the same kanji.
