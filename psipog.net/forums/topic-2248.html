			I don't know where to put this post, but it is kinda of a personal technique. I was messing around and was pretending to be like a jedi and use the &quot;Force&quot; and my friend said he could feel it. Is this possible? to emit energy from your hand to touch someone? I hope this makes sense to you all. And i tried this agian without my friend noticing and he once agian said he could feel something? IS this possible or is he just going crazy?

			This is possible, but not alot of people can pick up objects heavier than a pencil O_o; It takes ALOT of practice, and eventually, yes you can use the force.
<br />
I've been able to do that to people, but they never really notice until i tell them &quot;did you feel that there?&quot;
<br />
I think this is because you focus your &quot;force&quot; on someone, moving your energy towards him, causing someone to feel it like.. tingling, heat, or gravity.  Thats just my thoughts.

			just like if you point your finger at someone, they will feel a tingle.  That is the knowledge that your finger is pointing at them.

maybe you could just have a knack for these things!
<br />
it seems that mood effects the ability to move things.
<br />

<br />
like once i was just messing around and did the same thing, but on a door and managed to shut it! never been able to do it since...im still on rolling cans.
<br />

<br />
OR maybe doing PK on a living vessel is different from an inanimate objects?

			Well, one of my thoughts on moving certain items around is that if you have opened and shut that door so many times, picked up that ball so many times, etc. you become more familiar with the item you keep using. Therefore, it could be easier to move the object.. kinda linked together.

			Doesn't that kind of sound like Energy Manipulation to you?

You know, their is more to &quot;Psi&quot; than Psiballs and Psychokinesis.

yeah, theres alot of unexplained stuff out there, and also undiscovered stuff. the reason i say stuff is because theres nothing i can call it!
<br />

<br />
to be honest this all links to peoples views about things, i.e. sometimes i look at psi in scientific terms, sometimes in the &quot;one universal energy&quot; terms.
<br />

<br />
either way, whatever, do what ya do, to each his own!
