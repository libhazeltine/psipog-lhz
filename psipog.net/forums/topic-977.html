			I will be following this practice routine that i made from now on, and i encourage others to read and maybe take part in this routine or make one up for themselves as consitency is the key. 
<br />

<br />
Last night I thought about how in school they teach us multiple subjects that integrate with eachother to give us the intelligence we gain as we grow older. So here's a routine I came up with that should show some great results if you just follow it.
<br />

<br />
In order the combination of these practices should integrate one anothers teachings to provide better results for the next subject on the list, and should help in our developing of psychic abilities. Do them one right after the next. All of the articles on techniques for these excercises can be found on the main Psipog site. Remember this will take time to achieve success in some or all of the areas, but practice is key.
<br />

<br />
1) 20-30 minutes of Meditation practice:
<br />
Simply just meditate to clear the unfocused mind.
<br />
2) 15-25 minutes of Visualization practice:
<br />
This will help in visualization and you can even try to visualize goals that you want to achieve during this time. Visualize objects or just anything you want, and as time goes by try to add more deatil to your visualizations so it's almost like the object is right there in front of you.
<br />
3) 15-25 minutes of Psi-ball and Energy Manipulation practice:
<br />
This exercise will let us get in touch with energy and guide us through the manipulation of Psi. Practice making a psiball and try to make differecnt shapes, or creating different colored psiballs. After a while, move on to creating constructs in place of this.
<br />
4) 15-25 minutes of Extending Your Awareness practice:
<br />
Basically you want to have your eyes closed and visualize your awareness of where you are move outside your body, as if you were actualy experiencing this in real life. Put your presence/awareness in a different room and examine your surroundings (feel what it would feel like if you were in that room). There's an article that explains more in depth what this excercies exactly is here<a href="art-psiball-source.html7" target="_blank" class="postlink">art-psiball-source.html7</a>.
<br />
5) 10 minutes of Snack time:
<br />
Go eat something and take a quick break to absorb what you've learned.
<br />
6) 20-40 minutes of Telekinesis practice:
<br />
Practice some Telekinesis. Establish that you can move objects with your mind, become one with it and then practice moving it.
<br />
7) 20-30 minutes of Telepathy practice
<br />
Practice some Telepathy excercises. Read other peoples minds.
<br />

<br />
Duration of how long this schedule should take if you follow the times listed above:
<br />
115 minutes minimum time of total practice.
<br />
150 minutes average time of total practice.
<br />
185 minutes maximum time of total practice.
<br />

<br />
I Hope Everyone Enjoys and I Wish You All The Best of Luck!

			Hmm that seems quite interesting and in the right proportions to suit me. I shall have to try this. You could also try to sprad it our throughout the day. i.e. doing the stuff before the snack break in the morning and doing the rest at night.

			Yea why not, you can do whatever suits you. I just thought of it before going to sleep and thought yea this seems like a pretty good idea, and I thought it may help eveyone think of a routine and give them an insight on how to practice using the school organized routine. 
<br />

<br />
So yea if you feel comfortable doing it in 2 parts go for it! <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />
Thanks for reading.
