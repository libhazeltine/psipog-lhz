			No, that is a terrible idea. Next people will want a fanfiction forum. Then people will want a &quot;Singles&quot; forum. Then people will want an &quot;18+ Only&quot; forum. Stupid art. Such trash.

			well, damnit.....

<br />
ive seen other creative/art forums,  and theve hardly consisted of &quot;fan art&quot;.  They mostly posted artwork for uni, or their bands' new projects, So, i thoght it would be a good idea.

			I agree with you, Sayspo. Perhaps I am as stupid as DanielH believes art to be, but I do not find artistic endeavours to be wholly useless. 
<br />
Yes, art is separate from psionics, but psionics can be expressed artistically.
<br />
Yes, I'm serious. I feel the same way about this as I did about the fiction idea-- Using creativity does not necessarily encourage fluff. If anything, it encourages discovery and new ways of doing things. Is creativity not necessary for coming up with new sorts of constructs? Is visualization not important in most, if not all, aspects ofpsychic phenomena?
<br />
No, things such as art and writing can help with visualization, and I'm certain some fascinating things could come from an artistic rendering of a construct, or of the mental images from a remote viewing or telepathy practice session.
<br />
That, however, is my opinion. It's not likely that it will matter in the long run as far as this idea goes, but I felt that perhaps some positive support for the idea could be of use.

He is stating that if you get an art forum, others will want other forums.

indeed, and if you guys are afraid that this will arise to new (stupid) forums, then we will never get anything new.

			No one is stopping you from starting a &quot;share art&quot; thread, or something similar in the General Discussion section of the forum.  I'd imagine it would be akin to the Post Your Photos thread.
