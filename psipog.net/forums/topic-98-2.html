			I think it would take a VERY long time for scientists to &quot;generally&quot; agree that psionics is real.
<br />

<br />
Someone could come up with unlimited theories as to why the deck of cards is sliding around the table. &quot;Oh it was a ghost/gust of wind/electromagnetic interference/minor earthquake/nuclear fission/chinese food&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
Can you really prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it realy is YOU moving that pen around and around? We'd need some sort of brain analyzer that can detect psi manipulation or whatever causes these effects.

			If you read the post about a theory in progress in this board you'll find we are working on defining Psi. 
<br />

<br />
Currently we believe it is on the electromagnetic spectrum and so we need to  narrow down what band width it is on. 
<br />

<br />
We do know Psi can be converted into any part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but the most common occourences of psi taking the form of things on the electromagnetic spectrum has been on the wide end. Near radio waves. thus we assume it may be on that end somewhere. If we can narrow it down enough we can find what instrument is designed to detect that wavelength and thus we can detect psi.

Bull Sh*t. If I was a scientist, I'd believe if you just showed me. If psi exists, then someone would have made it public by now. People are just ridiculous.

			But your NOT a scientist, you cant judge how they would view this.
<br />

<br />
Imagine. Your years of studies, university and such. Years of research that have made you somewhat reputable.

Imagine that you might lose that reputability and be concidered a crack pot psuedoScientist by the scientific comunity because of your views on Psi.

Even if it is right you wouldnt want to throw away a carreer because of Psi.

			i think the people are not ready to think it's real. rainsong is right in her points, but it's more of a  taboo.  think what would heppen if we wake up and it's real.  not only would we get a lot of dumb people (i'll get to that in a bit) we would also be feared.  if people knew we could enter their mind, would they want us to be able to walk around citys?  if a person was good at scanning, they may be able to find next to anything with time.  i'm also glad people thinks it's crap because well...people.  we would turn it in to a tool of war, or get swamped with dumb kids who want to get back at mom and dad. but i am trying to get a friend to get in it, so i can have a buddy i trust.  the person is ready, but people are not.

			Personally, there are plenty of reasons why it's far better that it's NOT mainstream. 
<br />

<br />
Firstly, many before me have said it would be warped into a weapon of war, which would be a very bad thing. 
<br />
Second, we know things other people don't. We can do things they can't. Which gives us the advantage. 
<br />

<br />
And I guess it'll never become mainstream, because no scientist wants to lose his credibility (and therefore, most of his funding) due to his views on Psi. And if we magnify this effect to the thousands of scientists out there, Psi will never be mainstream.
<br />

<br />
But personally, I like it being hidden and underground. It's a good community.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Yes but advantage over what? I dont want this thing to go all X men on us with a war between psions and regular people. All for the better that we stay underground i guess. I suppose that if anybody wants to broaden their horizons they can always look on the internet and get sufficient training.

			Well, I wasn't suggesting that we were superior to non-Psis, but we do have an advantage over them to some extent. Of course, they have advantages over us too. 
<br />

<br />
But I think it'll get ugly before it goes mainstream. Not X-Men, Psi-Ops ugly, but still violent. So I think it's a good idea if we just embrace the undergroundedness of Psi, and enjoy the thing that binds us.

			Didnt read the all the posts but....
<br />

<br />
It is in the governments interest to continue to deny its existance. They know what it is, and its power. Enough research has been done to prove  elementary concepts which easily justify more advanced research, but none is made.  
<br />

<br />
The high level research is not done because it is not in the financial interests of the government to back it; and many private organizations with the funding are either influenced by the govt, or are not interested in such fluff. 
<br />

<br />
Knowledge of Energy/PSI= Power, Knowledge, Individuality, Reasoning
<br />

<br />
You cannot control a intelligent, powerful group of citizens. They will rebel and have you repealed from your position. Unless, of course, you are acting within the best interests of the people; which in this case, they are obviously not.
<br />

<br />
I will step into speculation here and say that is exactly why the WTC came down. To control the will of the American people.  A country instilled with fear is easily swayed and influenced. Wars, unreasonable bills and acts, all justified and accepted under false pretenses. 
<br />

<br />
A country overwhelmed by fear and insecurity is also not going to spend their time postulating new outlandish ideas (psi). They are going to be worrying if their next door neighbour is going to come over and murder them in their sleep. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;America is safe once again, because we destroyed the threat.&quot; 
<br />
They fail to mention, they created the threat.
<br />

<br />

<br />
THE BOTTOM LINE.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
The media controls the world. If the media will accept it; the world will. </span>The media is influenced, and in many cases, directly controlled by the government.
<br />

<br />
If all the scientists in the world come a new concensus, and that is: PSI is real; without the support of the media it will never become a global concept. If the media says this idea is crazy, or even 'blashpemous', then the new energy paradigm is doomed. This is the sad reality we live in. 
<br />

<br />
The more individuals who experience, practice, and share their experience the greater the force of the masses will prevail; but only once we are free enough from fear and falshood can we hold our own opinions against the media.
<br />

<br />
You cannot prove anything to someone who has already accepted it doesn't exist. They can only prove it to themselves.

Off topic a bit, but have you ever tried manipulating a TV antenna's signal? I used to do it a few years ago to get better reception, if that helps narrow the band.

			Well mostly it'll go like this(And those who learned in university or such should remember from physics lab and course hours):
<br />
<ul>
<br />
<li> You make a theory based on something (observation or such)
<br />
<li> You make like 1000nd test or so and than you can only start thinking about proposing the idea
<br />
<li> Than the same test should be made by many more scientist with the same result 
<br />
<li> And just than you can start hoping that this will be approved
<br />
</ul>
<br />
Now if you are reading about science stuff you'd know that there are many cases of people trying to claim that they achieved something and than is gets out as nothing.(Well there are those who just try this to achieve fame or prizes)
<br />

<br />
Now consider that if there are scientist who believe Psi how many difficulties thay will face? Or the possibility of loosing a scientist reputaion.
<br />
Well there are those who did come with revolutionary ideas and knew what will happen but still did and they were ignored at their time so only years later their ideas are taken.
<br />
But are there many people like this, aspecially when talking about something like psi.
<br />

<br />
For example I dont remember exactly about whom it was but there were psi test about PK with known scientits and they made all they could that the test will be &quot;clean&quot; they looked satisfied in the end and convinced, they promised a written/signed document saying its real but then a long waiting came, after which when those who were involved tried to contact with those scientis were ignored like nothing happend and the scientist denied any connection.
<br />
And if not talking about scientits who wont do it: WOULD YOU LIKE TO FACE TREATMENT LIKE THIS??
<br />

<br />
Than again there are centers of psi research, but we dont hear much about that anywhere unless we search for it.
<br />

<br />
It'll take much to make psi accepted as granted!!!!!!!
<br />

<br />
Whooaaa whats wrong with me today?? another long post for non-english speaker.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for reading anyway.

			Ow and how ironic, just opened the newspaper and found an arcticle about Einstein and heres a quote from it(If I'm translating right):
<br />
<ul>
<br />
<li> &quot;It truly takes a great amount of courage to think about some phenomenon not the way everybody else does&quot;
<br />
</ul>
<br />
or maybe: 
<br />
<ul>
<br />
<li> &quot;It truly takes a great amount of courage to think about some phenomenon in a different way than everybody else does&quot;
<br />
</ul>
<br />

<br />
Either way the meaning is the same.
<br />

<br />
