Already have about 10 of her friends in on it, we're organizing a rather large intervention. Face to face coming to terms with the issues.
<br />

<br />
She has only told her closest friends, which is about 4 people. She has lots and lots of friends, and they had absolutely no idea. We're thinking that there will be close to 25 people at the face to face intervention.
<br />

<br />
She has passed out on occasion, up to one minute in duration. She is very pale, and has clammy skin.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for the input.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

She better shape up or she's going to turn out like Terry Schavio.  I mean, don't bulimec people realize that they look uglier than fat people?

			Fat person to the rescue! I am the complete opposite of bulimia...I eat vomit!

Just kiddning, that is disgusting, wouldn't you say?

Well, I think enough advice has been given for me not to be able give any helpful advice. But a lot of the points that have been made are very good advising tools.

The scary thing about bulimia is the people think they are making themselves look better the thinner they get.  Usually by the time they realized that they are fucking themselves up it's too late.  Some of them reach 80 or less pounds and STILL think they are fat and ugly....so they'll keep trying to lose weight.  That's why it is so important to get a bulimic person help before they go too far.

			Hmm...interventions are bad, it's not a serious problem, we chose what we chose because we chose it, regardless of the others around us. If you stop her she will always just be a belemic inside regardless, you can't modify the foundation of personality that makes up the person. Oh and yeah, leave her alone, I have a theory that can make suffering easier to accept, life is a story, a very dynamic one, you are not the main character, you are only a side-character who may help out if lucky but most likely you will always be that dude walking by the background (busy New York street) when the main character was talking to that other dude.

*Coughs*  Bulimia isn't a serious problem?  Don't you know that it is one of the most common eating disorders in America affecting millions of people?  Are you aware of the dangerous effects it could have on a person?  And no offense, but that theory of yours is crap.  If you have a friend with a serious condition such as this, WTF are you thinking just standing by letting it happen?!  You might as well shoot them!  Also, if you intervene and get a bulimic person help, they will thank you, and won't revert to that life style (most of the time, and if that is the case, you just revert the process).  I'm sorry, but that post is just ignorant.  That puts me in a bad mood.  Do you even know what the fuck you are talking about?  Maybe you should look at the other posts in this thread, or google bulimia...Then you'll see how serious this is.

Never intervene(sp?), it's not your place. Let people make their own decisions for themselves, after all, they are just living this nihilistic world. You mind googling the meaning of that before you continue reading.
