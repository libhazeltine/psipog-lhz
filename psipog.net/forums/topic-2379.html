			I've been wondering this for a long time now...  I've read the articles on psychokinesis.  Bare with me here as I try to orginize my thoughts.  
<br />

<br />
First of all, what is gravity?  In one article it says:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Did you ever think why gravitation exists? Nobody can explain why two objects attract each other. </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
I was told gravity is simply the electromagnetic pull of seperate masses.  The electrons present in both masses &quot;wanting&quot; to pull together the way electrons do.  In certain circumstances they can also repel eachother, depending on it's configuration.  For some reason, everything &quot;wants&quot; exactly 8 electrons, the rest are put outside in various rings of sorts to be traded off.  Nobody I have asked can explain why there must be 8.  Knowing this, there is clearly an organized code or program of sorts that make reality itself possible.  
<br />

<br />
I believe knowing more about how this &quot;code&quot; works will lead to better understanding of the nature of the universe and consequently the nature of psionics.  
<br />

<br />
I've also noticed that a lot of the articles have an underlying theme about them:  To be able to move or manipulate something, be it a psiwheel or a toothpick.  They say the two factors in doing so are the belief that you can, the energy to carry out the task, and possibly something else I am forgetting.  When I think about this, I wonder; would it not be possible to utilize the energy of the toothpick itself and all that is around it?  &quot;Energy&quot; comes in all shapes and sizes and if found in everything we see.  Also like the article says: Seperation is an illusion.  Knowing all things in the universe are bound together in sort of a gigantic soup of condensed and not so condensed energy, who is to say a 30 pound office chair is any more difficult to move than the toothpick?  It is possible we are limited only by our belief that larger and heavier objects are more difficult to move.  
<br />

<br />
I also think: &quot;What would happen if multiple people attempted to move the same toothpick?&quot;  Two people... or 30 people?  
<br />

<br />
Forgive me if all of this has been discussed already.  I've looked over the forums and have found little to relate to these thoughts.  Feel free to critisize and correct any mistakes I may have made.  I am open to any ideas.

Yes, but what if we could overcome that?  What if we could learn to develope faster?  That is basically what I am getting at.

			Somehow I'm getting the impression that people aren't reading much past the title...  We would not be where we are today as humans if we did not strive to achieve more.  Sure it might take most people several years to move a piece of lint... but it doesn't have to be that way necisarily.
<br />

<br />
There is no one way of doing things.  I was hoping to stem new ideas from others off of my own, but it seems so far you are content with what you are already capable of.  The possibilities are nearly limitless.  
<br />

<br />
Another example:
<br />

<br />
If scientists could learn exactly what functions in the brain take place when people use TK, that part of the brain could potentially be augmented artificially using medicine or some sort of electrical device.  
<br />

<br />
We are not limited to what is layed before us in these articles.  They say so themselves:  We are the pioneers of this study and it is up to us to expand our knowledge of it.

			I do not believe I am satisfied. My long term goals would be things like: move another person, get as close as to mastering teleapthy, remove viewing, and other things that would involve ALOT of hard work and training. Our limits is what we think is our limits, if you think they are endless, then so be it. Personally, I would agree. There is no limit to power, but there are things that limit us regardless.  If someone can reverse the aging process, if someone can release ourselves from this mortal coil; then yes, limitless.

			I'm slightly believe that the more we use psi our DNA some what changes, making our offspring, more able to control it, yet that is just a little idea that comes and goes.
<br />

<br />
personaly, I wouldn't enjoy artifical augmentation just to increase my abilities, sort of like getting fake muscles in my arm, it wouldn't be awarding. Not to say, if one figures out all these locked mysteries of psionics, we probably could advance further with a bit more speed then now, since we are lost in the dark of most of that occurs. agian, just my thoughts.

			Our limits is our self.  Mental blocks created to think we must do this in order to get this effect.  Mental blocks that say something heavier HAS to take more training because it is heavier.  Mental blocks that say there is a container around it, it MUST be harder.  Mental blocks that say I wasn't able to do this before, why should I now?
<br />

<br />
Summary, we set our own limits, at least this is what I believe.
<br />

<br />
I'm not saying that we don't need to go through certain things to get to a certain point, I'm saying why we can't get past certain steps.  If we didn't have the obstacle of mental blocks I believe we could progress a lot faster, which is why people progress faster than others, but even the fastest have trouble at a certain point at some point.  If someone was raised in a completely humble way with no other belief than that they can control their own reality, they would be able to do almost anything, I say almsot because I have a mental block that someone CAN'T do anything <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.

			According to String Theory (or M-Theory), Gravity is a particle created by a string vibrating is a specific manner.
<br />
This 'graviton' is called a messenger particle.
<br />
Each time 'messenger particles' (or gravitons) are sent between one mass and another, and the more frequently they are sent, the stronger the attraction is between the masses.
<br />

<br />
The more mass, the more gravitons.
<br />
The more gravitons, the greater the 'warp' in space-time.
<br />
The greater the warp in space-time, the greater the 'pull' (or attraction).
<br />

<br />
This is not like Electromagnetism, or the Weak Nuclear Force, or Strong Nuclear Force.
<br />
Gravity is much much weaker than any of these other forces, yet it moves through all dimensions.
<br />
I just lost my train of thought, but I hope this helps somebody......
<br />

<br />
PS: Gravity moves at the speed of light.

Perhaps you are right.  I have not been able to move so much as the psi wheel.... largley because something is stopping me from the inside.  I cannot so much as read the articles without becoming nervous and light headed.  When I do practice, I can only manage to do so for a few seconds before giving up.  I lose focus very easily.  When things in my life settle down some, if ever, I'm going to try self hypnosis to overcome these mental blocks.

			hypnosis works, but i have found that this works the best..(atleast for me)
<br />

<br />
When i practice i sort of find that in order to break those mental blocks, such as the why should i be able to do it now, if i didnt do it a few hours ago. If you use the fact that you are making progress even while your not moving your object of choice, then to break down this mental barrier you have to sort of trick your mind into thinking it did actually happen. Dont bother with the details (such as the object really didnt move <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />) Then when you do move it, exaggerate it to your sub-c. &quot;you see that you moved it. I told you that you could.&quot; You just have to catch your mind doing it and play the &quot;i told you so speech.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The container thing, and even heavier things break under the same rules, its just that when you try to move those things, you have the knowledge of moving it a certain way before. (such as its not a light weight psi wheel, or that psi wheel wasnt covered.) So it then becomes, not harder to move those objects, but harder to put forth the needed patcients to move the object, and the discipline to keep practicing.
<br />

<br />
Also i heard somewhere, that when your learning a skill (whether its sports or a musical instrument) that you dont learn it while playing the sport or the instrument, but you learn it while not playing it and either doing cross-training drills, or studying scales and progressions. I have never gotten better at playing the guitar by just playing it alone.
<br />

<br />

<br />
So i guess the limits are ourselves. Its also how much thought you put in your skill. When you read an article and see something you missed, or have a click in your brain like &quot;ooohh thats what they ment&quot; Then your sub-c just progressed some...

			To move something that is heavy, just try and convince yourself that the item is completely weightless. In fact, try finding an object that you have never touched before and just move it, without feeling the weight of it. All that does is put doubt in your mind.
<br />
Maybe if there was an object really small, like for example, a thimble, but it weighed 10 kilos, would you be able to move it if you thought it was the weight of a normal thimble? This experiment can really determine if it is the weight of the object that you are moving that is the factor to limitations, or if it is the actual belief of the person doing the pk on it. Someone should try that. But anyone reading this can't because they will know that the thimble will be heavier than it looks.

			I just had another thought...  I wonder if it would be possible for me to create a Flash program of a moving object on screen, say a ball, with no controls as to actually move the ball, but have it still able to move.  I wonder if it would be possible to manipulate objects on a computer screen the same way actual objects are moved?  I'm not sure.
