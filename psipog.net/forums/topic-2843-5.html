Indeed no one likes doing that, but ignoreing it donest really help. The one thing I don't like about some groups is that some tend to not to listen to other groups. There is many form of intellegence but you have to listen for it first. You sound like a smart person but harsh words are bond to get harsh reactions, that is untill one side decides to end it.

I think I will be flamed but don't belive evolution I don't think we were once monkeys or any of that stuff. I do belive that we are able to adapte to our enviorment at a small rate.  I am new to pis have barly made pis-balls but even the person who thought up evolution didn't he even say that we were to complexed to evolve somthing had to make us? So he thought up some alien thing.

Creationists and ID proponents of course! <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  I'm a teleologist myself but that, along with every other &quot;side&quot; of the debate are spiritual standpoints, not scientific ones.  I find that is often the case with those who are believe in materialist evolution as well as creationists, etc...

			When i say carbon dating is not reliable i dont me exact dating im talking about i could never be proven that it works.
<br />

<br />
People have taken and carbon dated a turtle (alive) from the sea and the dating said he was millons of years old.
<br />

<br />
People have burying and object (bone, shell, and other things) in their back yard then sent to be carbon dated after a few years in ground and they came out to be like 600,00 years old.
