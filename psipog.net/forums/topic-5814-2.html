			What do you mean, it would require an extraordinary amount of programming?  Basic cellular automata programs can have &quot;lifeforms&quot; that contain only a few bytes of information, but nevertheless exhibit all the emergent behavior that evolution has to offer.  
<br />

<br />
Psi creatures with developed intelligence could be similar, but distribute their intelligence between themselves.  So each one has a very small amount of programming, including the ability to replicate.  They communicate, and duplicate effective emergent behavior.  That's intelligence, right there.  Self-aware intelligence, or sentience, could be created by simply allowing such organisms to evolve for a long period.  Eventually, circumstances will make sentience a useful survival trait, and they will develop it.

Alright, I'm not entirely sure what you're saying now..... but, it still holds that you'd have to program in their 'evolution' or ability to evolve, and good luck on that one; I'm not sure where you'd start getting even the idea of evolution into your programming, let alone speeding it up from taking thousands of years.   Not to mention how you would guide it along.
<br />

<br />
And then you've got all the safeguards to program in..... you'd need something to state a maximum pop. size(you wouldn't want 10000000000000000 of those things around, would you?), what energy, and how much, it uses to create another one(or use for nutrients), and, of course safeguards against them hurting you or other people(if they achieved sentience/free will, without precautions there WILL be a bad seed somewhere in there).   I'm sure there's others I'm forgetting...
<br />

<br />

<br />
If you can do it, go ahead, knock yourself out, just remember the risks and account for them....
