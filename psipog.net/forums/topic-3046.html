			I havent managed to move PsiWheel yet
<br />
Well, it moved few times, but I'm not 100% sure was it I, and I wasn't able to control it
<br />

<br />
Anyway, my PsiWheel moved when my eyes were closed, my head down(no way my breathing moved it), and I was not thinking about moving it too much
<br />

<br />
And I also read in some article that you shouldn't thnik &quot;Move, move&quot;, just say your sub-c what to do and think nothing, like when moving your arms or legs <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Hope this helps, but again, I'm kinda noob in this stuff <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

Basically, don't worry if it moves or not. I just recently learned this lesson.
<br />

<br />
If it doesn't move, don't get frustrated; it takes more than a week, or maybe a month, or maybe years for some people to do PK.
<br />

<br />
If it does move, be happy. But don't be so happy that you lose concentration on the wheel.
<br />

<br />
Just don't worry about it; Just do it. xD

Edit:

So all i really have to do is believe that it will move?
<br />
just watch it, waiting for the wheel to start moving?

			Me, the psiwheel was almost imediate.
<br />
But for a month before that I was working with a key ona string, very hard.
<br />
But the Psi wheel is very easy.
<br />
Just don't get frustrated, because any amount of anger or annoyance will not allow you to do it at all. Check out my thread titled: &quot;I think I've lost it&quot;.
<br />
Alot of people gave me good advice.

You may try that, I never did personally. Different people do different things. I just imagined it, and it happened.
<br />

<br />
Meditation wil most likely make it easier for you not clear your mind while doing it, so yeah try it.

			OH MY!! i just got it ^_^
<br />
i was just staring at it.... like, observing it, waiting for it to react. like waiting for your opponent to make its move in chess. Then my eyes lost focus, and i was blankly thinking. Then it started to rotate, at first i thought it was my breathing, but it was rotating too long for it to be me. i was performing TK!
<br />
When it started to move, i regained focus and started talking mentally to it, saying such things as &quot;Well done, now try to go faster&quot; or &quot;Now you have it like that, try the other way.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I'm SOOO excited!
<br />

<br />
Edit: May i add that i was sitting in the warmth of a sleeping bag on this cold day.

			Keep up your training and <span style="font-weight: bold">believe</span> that you can do it that's the most important part.

And there's no exact tutorial on how to do it we can just show you the way - you have to walk it yourself.

I did.
<br />

<br />
You have to be relaxed, not tired, angry or anything else, just relaxed.
<br />
Try to think as little as possible and if it helps - try meditating.
<br />
Music instead of meditating worked for me, however I don't know if it will for you.

			Now that i have finally achieved signs of telekinetic power, i have to learn how to controll it &gt;.&lt;
<br />

<br />
And on my 2nd day of learning how to controll PSI!
<br />

<br />
Edit: For those who are learning, try this:
<br />
Just look and <span style="font-style: italic">believe</span> that it can move, just watch, waiting for it. If you believe in it enough as like you <span style="font-style: italic">know</span> it can move, like you <span style="font-style: italic">know</span> a cat can move, it will.
<br />
Try that.

Believing is the most important.
<br />
When its moving do not think of wind or breathing that _Could_ have moved it, be sure that you did it, when you practice more and more you will see more results and in time be able to controll it.
