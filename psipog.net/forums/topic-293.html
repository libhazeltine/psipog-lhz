			Anyone here read Lovecraft? My question is did the guy have any psionic clue about what he was writing? I think he did but (as anyone who wants to make money) added his own horror-ish flair to it in order to make it more interesting for his readership. Though his works mainly deal in the occult, I believe he had a handle on the fact that everything is energy. At the very least anyway. Opinions?

			Lovecraft rules, but I think that the necronomicon (and parts of it) is a bad thing to read about before trying an OBE...
<br />
Love all of it. I don't know which is the best but i kinda can't seem to forget the reanimator (rules), and of course the Call of Ctulhu my personal favorite... (dunwitch horror is also great, I don't realy know if I spelled it right, but that one actualy has a summon from the necronomicon in it... well a part of it anyway)

			Yes. He is my favorite author. You don't know anything about him so don't talk about him. Fluffy people. He was a fiction writer is all. Read up on him. All of his ideas were taken off of various myths, friends, etc.

Lovecraft is an amazing writer.  It's one thing to write a few good books, but it's quite another to create an entire mythos that has spawned numerous books (both written by Lovecraft and his fans) and movies.
<br />

<br />
Check out &quot;In the Mouth of Madness&quot;, it is a most excellent movie.

			You guys. I asked a question. I don't want to be tread upon. Please answer this: Who the hell is H.P. Lovecraft, what genre are his books, and what are the names of his best books?

First off, I'm sure that if you can access psipogbb.net, you can also access wikipedia.com.
<br />

<br />
But in case there are unforseen circumstances that prevent you from accessing wikipedia, yahoo, or google, or perhaps any other search engine or relevant website on the Internet, I'll help you out.

H.P. Lovecraft is a prolific writer of horror/fantasy short stories.  He's generated a terrific following due to his detailed and wildly inventive mythos regarding &quot;the old gods&quot;, supernormal beings that lie dormant until they can rise up and conquer the known universe as we know it.  Although dormant, these old gods still have a profound impact on people who either explore ancient cult lore or who, in one way or another, fall under their covert influence and this usually manifests in abnormal or psychotic behavior.  My description will not do justice the wide body of Lovecraft's work.  There are paperback books that contain dozens of his short stories.  Also, I've found several websites that reprint his short stories, free for you to peruse at your leisure.

The necrinomicon was created after Lovecrafts stories and is not real. he never elaborated on it. So thus no one can really know what he intended to be in it.

There was only one necrinomicon, it was bound in human flesh. Tell me, is your book bound in human flesh? <img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" />

But it has not right to be called the necrinomicon. The people who wrote those books have no clue on what Lovecraft intended to be in the necrinomicon, let alone it's still fiction.
