			The astral plane is also similar to the physical world. In the ethereal you are like yourself but without anykind of physic obstacles like breathing or crossing solids.
<br />
And in the astral plane, it looks like ours but you are like a superhero, you can do whatever you want. Also you have your senses powered up and also you have &quot;other senses&quot;, like something that works like a radar (you know who is around you and where they are), and more.
<br />
I always have gone to the astral plane (oh well this what it seems).
<br />

			What is your technique to going to the astral plane because I have not been able to do this or an OBE yet.

1) It doesn't matter.
<br />

<br />
2) Just do it and don't worry about where you're going.
<br />

<br />
3) They're probably talking out of their arses anyways.

well the first couple of time i OBEd i lifted myself out of body and walked over to my bedroom door i turned around and saw my slelf lying on the bed, here i freaked out a returned to my body. 
<br />

<br />
About the 4th time i did it i got used to seeing my self and decied to walk through my door since my hand was passing through the handle after this i felt like i was being pulled back iddidnt fight it and i returned to my body.
<br />

<br />
My fifth OBE was the one i remember the most after reading robert peterson's book i decided to do it his way and fight the silver cord i managed to do it and got down my stairs and out of my front door to my garden.
<br />

<br />
Where ever i go nearly every thing is the same as the physical world, except for a few differneces like door knobs on thwe wrong way, pictures wonky, and things that shouldn't be there.
