			i thought about some questions that will help us and especially the beginers to know how long did we practice to move any kind of objects especially the heavy objects for not to be hopeless or to know that psychokinesis need alot of time to learn them and master them . for people who are patient be positive and go practice but for people who are not patient if you like psychokinesis you should learn to be patient if not then stop learning them because they take long time to be good at them  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  good luck all of you.

2- I started out hard with PK, then lost a little interest.. Fortunately, I started doing other psionic stuff to keep my motivation up. If only I had moved on to pencils after a month or so... I could have become much better with PK. I can't just pick up on where I stopped, either.. The interest and joy which I had in the beginning will never be exactly the same. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
3- From the very beginning obviously.. A huge leap of improvement must have been after almost 1 month, when I made my first force bubble.
<br />

<br />
4- That's the strange thing.. Only the psi wheel, but using a force bubble, I have made the wheel change direction so fast that it should be more than enough power to move other stuff, too. Still, when I moved other stuff near the force bubble.. It didn't react. Only the psiwheel reacted to my force bubble.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

The second day.

I still have not seen improvment except I might see I shake a little but that seems to be a hallucanation since no one else sees it when I show them.

yea i was wonder why only psi wheel it can be moved why i cant move pen then i said no wonders pen is much much heavier then psi wheel and im making the psi wheel spin slow that is why i cant roll or slide the pen.
<br />

<br />
Zaxol you need to practice to move the psi wheel and to see improvements .
<br />
i think you would better dont make anyone know you do tk untill you can move the psi wheel at least.

psi wheel. But i think i also moved a pen. Balanced it on a fulcrum (my phone <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />) and moved it about pretty much in any way that i could. I thought i spun it alittle, and rolled it. No noticiable progress with it other than that, but i just got a job, so practice time is starting to slump alittle.

i've seen some improvement, im still trying to keep the wheel going as long as I can, so far I only get a few roatations, then maybe a couple more after its almost stopped and I want nothing more but for it to go again.
