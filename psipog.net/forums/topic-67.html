			<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE: First thing I would like to mention is that the title is not meant to offend anyone. Please don't take it personally. It is just a title to show that it goes into great detail on the subject. Now that that is done, let us begin.</span></span></span>
<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Introduction</span>
<br />
If you don't know how to make a Psiball, then don't try to make a shield. Check out some articles at Psipog. I am not going over it, notice the title says <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">'Bubble Shields'</span></span> not <span style="font-style: italic">'Psi Balls'</span>.
<br />
                                        
<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Common Uses</span>
<br />
Make sure you don't try to use this as a shield for combat situations, I hope you don't ever have to worry about that, but just for reference you will be annhilated if you try to use this as your only defense. This shield is used for everyday things. Mostly to block out telepathic and empathetic information. It can be made very complicated or just as simple as,&quot; Hold your shape and stay together.&quot;
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Creating It</span>
<br />
Now we shall cover how to make it. Firstly you need gather energy. This can be done by imagining a waterfall of energy pooling over you, drawing it from the earth through your feet, etc. Now, take a little while to get a strong feeling. I personally like to close my eyes. It helps my visualization process. After you have a good, strong feeling I want you to imagine the walls of a bubble building around you. Start it off as whatever energy visualization you use, then slowly let it fade into a hard plastic type. If you want to make it stronger make thicker plastic, if you are really an idiot and think a smaller one will be better, make the plastic thin. Now feel the sides of it, look through the clear glass, smell the plastic, and for gods sake(sorry to all who aren't religious) don't really do that. <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">VISUALIZE</span></span> it.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Programming</span>
<br />
Now you ask,&quot; Ok, I have a worthless shield. Now what?&quot; <span style="font-weight: bold">Programming</span> is what. Those who don't know how to program. Keep reading. Those who do, well, keep reading too. Now programming can be done in many different ways. 
<br />

<br />
*My favorite is to just tell it to do a certain task. I would say(in my mind),&quot; Stay together, Hold shape, and block out all telepathic and empathetic communications. When I say go down you go down, when I say go up you go back up if you are already up disregard this statement.....&quot; Anyways, you can go on forever like that, you shouldn't, but you could. 
<br />

<br />
*The second one is visualizing the programming. Like see it holding together as you walk around, see a little bubble that says,&quot; Go down.&quot; See it fading away. Then see yet another bubble that says,&quot; Go up.&quot; See it coming back. See it up and a bubble saying,&quot; Go up.&quot; Watch it stay the same, incorporate as many senses, as you can see im visual. If you want to add a cool sound when it goes down and up. See your self knocking on it and hear the knocking, feel the sensation in your knuckles. 
<br />

<br />
*Now onto the next, tactile visualization. Using feelings to program it, personally I don't use this but I'll try to explain it. Feel it there, being. Remember the feeling of solid, round. Incorporate that with the shield. Bring back the feeling of something going away and coming back. I don't think that is the best explanation but I tried for more info on programming go to the PsiPog.net Articles Section. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Conclusion</span>
<br />
Making a bubble shield, as you can see, is not too hard. Just remember this G.F.P Gather Form Program. Gather the energy. Form whatever you are trying to make. Program whatever tasks you want it to do. Simple, Simple, Simple. Thank you for reading. Comments, Tips, Thoughts would be appreciated.

			in reply to the comment about it being the same. it is in much more detail about one subject. not many. i just want all the newbies to have a more detailed guide to go by. since the bubble shield is the most basic shields get. i thought it should be put into detail for people new to psionics.

			I will try to get one up asap. Probably a marshmallow/mirror. Don't know which one. I am also going to do some other guides on different things like RPing and Remote Viewing. Maybe even telekinesis once I move that darn pencil better. I'll probably have another guide up soon. Thanks for the comments, Happy Shielding!
