			Hmm well i was wide awake at that time and never got any feeling at all. I was staring at the moon yesterday night before i went to bed in a trance for like 5 minutes, it felt really really good for some reason. Then it looked like the moon was moving around radicly, but that was probably just my imagination.

			I know what psi feels like, and I didn't feel crap. If anything I was probably playing a game, spinning a psiwheel everytime the game is loading something.  I find the 2012 thing a bunch of crap.  My theory however, if anything was going to happen, is that we'll probably all be a little smarter in a few years.

			Yeah well, I didn't. I had a bad feeling however, but it was only my instincts kicking in on avoiding a certain place. I was glad I avoided someone I didn't want to see.
<br />
I however have had normal depression in the past, but it was because of my personal problems.  Just relax, take your mind off this crap. I used to think something was seriously wrong, I was all like <span style="font-weight: bold">oh noes</span>! but then I just thought hey maybe these are actually good things going to happen instead of bad. You know what happened? good things happened. Simple as that.

Please tell me the &lt;/dumn&gt; part was to show it was a joke and that you in no way think that. The only weight the Earth has gained or lost has been what has landed on earth (meteors, etc.), and what has been sent into space(ships, etc.). We are made of parts of the same materials earth began with. The earth hasn't gained or lost weight, the weight has just been... redistributed a bit.

Edit: And to finally get myself on topic, now, as I have made a lot of off-topic posts... I agree with those that said it was just a sort of paranoia.

We don't even use that damned calendar. We use the Gregorian Calendar. Anyways, it's not like we have an ancient calendar sitting somewhere, and people make a calendar from it every year. Welcome to today, buddy, we have computers and can figure out a calendar on our own(without a computer) easily. The Mayans were just failures who got lazy making a calendar. Or it just corresponded to some event in their crazy religion. Who cares about their religions and beliefs? They're dead. We don't take into account every end of the world theory, do we?
<br />

First off, the Mayan calendar is much more accuriate. It's designed to where there isn't a leap year. Second, even though you do not agree with any of their beliefs and you live centuries after them, have a little respect. The ancients were smarter than most will admit nowadays. I bet they were smarter than you.
<br />
That is just TOTAL arrogance. 
<br />
You don't need to believe the calendar or not, it doesn't even matter.
<br />
You can at least show a little more respect.

			Ok, i realized this too. I think something is out of wack. I didnt feel anything, but the temperature is all wierd. (im not sure if anyone posted this yet) It feels like the summer is colder, and the winter is getting warmer. I never remember having it be 40 degrees in the summer, and being 70 degress in the winter...

			Who cares about its accuracy? It isn't used, and you're actually wrong - the modern Gregorian calendar is a good deal more accurate than the Maya calendars. One of the Maya calendars had an error every fews years, whereas the current calendar has an actual error after a couple thousand years. It also has no relevence to the modern day, as neither it or any descendants of it are used. Theirs was accurate in comparison to other calendars at the time, but compared to today's? Not at all.
<br />
I give more credit to the Egyptians, really. They were smarter, and did more during times that were a good deal before the apex of Maya civilization. As I've said, you're giving them way too much credit. Maya were smarter compared to most of the civilizations of the Americas during the time, I believe, but this wasn't much compared to the rest of the world at the Maya's highest point. The Maya civilization has done little in regards to today(Outside of art and such, which don't count to me), whereas much of European, Middle-East, Eastern, etc. civilizations actually have much more relevence. Much more today(science, language, etc.) comes from them, rather than the civilizations of the Americas.

			I'm not telling you to believe that the world will end in 2012. Shit, I don't even believe that.
<br />

<br />
Actually I'm not wrong. Maybe you should read this:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.levity.com/eschaton/Why2012.html" target="_blank">http://www.levity.com/eschaton/Why2012.html</a>
<br />

<br />

<br />
When I meant by accuriate, I meant more accuriate than the Roman calendar..........I can't verify the validity of what you said about the error every few years versus the error every couple thousand years. 
<br />

<br />
I think you're a prime example of Western arrogance. There are a lot of topics that are misunderstood by the West and it bugs the shit out of me. 
<br />
I don't think there has been enough research done on the ancients, so even though the Egyptians did more does not mean they were smarter. I do not know who was smarter and frankly, I don't care.
<br />

<br />
You want to know why the Mayans have not been able to contribute much to the West? Because they are misunderstood. Yes the art is different, but if you can't appreciate art for what it is and take what you can from different cultures you are no lover of art. 
<br />

<br />
I don't if you've ever realized, but Western imperialism started in Europe. So look at the areas around Europe; Middle East, Asia, etc. Let's look at middle eastern influence on Europe. The arabs went travelled through northern africa into the Iberian Peninsula and stopped their conquest where the French and Spanish borders meet. The Silk Road trade route was established when Europe began to realize that Asia had some pretty cool stuff; spices, silk, etc. 
<br />

<br />
Now we're going into how American Civilizations came into the mix. The Spanish want gold. They decide to go looking for it. Columbus makes a wrong turn and goes straight for the Americas. He thinks it's Indian and starts calling them Indians. The Spanish see the human sacrafices that the mesoamerican cultures would perform. They now consider them savages that need to be conquered and converted to Christianity.
<br />

<br />
So now the question is 'Why didn't any European countries grasp and try to deeply understand the Meso-American cultures?' 
<br />
This is a simple answer; because they felt superior to these cultures. They felt that anything these cultures could offere were useless and folly. They felt they knew enough as it is and were not open-minded to different ideas. 
<br />

<br />
Conclusion: If now you can't see why Meso-American cultures couldn't contribute to Western culture, then I think I'm just going to stop debating because it's no use.
