Exactly. X-III the last stand except with smart psions <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />! Sorry I posted here with the avatar and all. Though I don't think I'd be classified as a &quot;Narutard&quot;. I shall change it for fear of being labeled <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />.  But I ask of those who know about these Narutards (I don't, because I really don't care much at all and don't go on the forums all the time <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />) to tell me exactly what &quot;crimes&quot; they have commited. Is it just because they are ignorant or because they must be idiots because the like Naruto or both? Which is it? If it's just because they like Naruto then I think you guys are just being prejudiced. But if it's about intelligence, and leading them in the right direction/putting up with stupidity is too much for you, then I guess your reasons are justified and we are all screwed <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

			Alright, it's not so much the show ,as the blatant stupidity that the silly little pre-teens are showing in trying to teach themselves abilities that you see on an anime.
<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">
<br />

<br />
Anime is always massively exaggerated.</span> 
<br />

<br />
I know that ninjustsu is or was real, but it was more stealth-orientated and self-discipline-based then any of the fireworks you see in that TV show/manga comic
<br />

<br />
I'm a healer, I help people, but this place is dead. I'll be on applied psionics whenever someone needs healing or a bit of energy. I'll also operate through private messages for the more &quot;personal&quot; of problems.
<br />

<br />
But I'm steering well clear of everything else except the eye colour thread on the personal techniques board.
<br />

<br />
So I'm not really gone so much as focusing on one element of the board, where the only real problem is people asking for scans. 
<br />
Which, in my opinion is 100 times better then those little accidents running around screaming about &quot;shadow clone jutsu&quot; or &quot;super ninja fart&quot; or whatever.
<br />

<br />
Besides, I need to stick around for details on Sean's new website, should he make one. As I myself am researching the more spiritual aspects of psi myself.

			Anime is overly exaggerated. Kids do enjoy anime and like to watch it. They sometimes get out of hand. But, they are young, you must not blame them. They will grow out of it and see that things like that are not real. But this doesn't have to affect you. Personally, I haven't seen a single post about any Naruto related stuff. Just avatars of Naruto characters. 
<br />

<br />
If you see a silly anime topic. Ignore it, don't make fun of them or leave because of it. You are the only one being silly if you do. 
<br />

<br />
Well I'm done with this. I too am starting in the spiritual field Solus. Perhaps we can speak together about things.

Sorry to hear that. I still wish my intellegence in psi grows to be seen. But I still can't do anything with it. Regardless that I feel my energy play everywhere when I'm happy. Perhaps I could have help if I was stronger.
