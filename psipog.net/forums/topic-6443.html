			I have to ask this, even if it does sound a little stupid and impractical... 
<br />
Has my subconcious taken over? I know this sounds unreal, but i think its time for me to consider it as a possibility. Nowadays, i'm extremely lazy, i dont exercise like i used to, i'm becoming increasingly careless and beginning to care more for myself than others (more than i should care for myself). 
<br />

<br />
I used to be the complete opposite before... e.g. i want to clean my room, but then i just decide to screw it, even though i know i'm doing the wrong thing, and that i want to clean my room. I exercised heaps before, and i did things on time, but now i find that im starting to go backwards. Don't tell me that its just me or that it's a part of life, because what i'm feeling isn't. And its also starting to affect my TK practise... i can't move the toothpick or even the psi wheel as well as i could before.
<br />

<br />
I would REALLY like some help, so any replies are greatly appreciated.
<br />
Heres my msn, in case any of you want to contact me.

			You may be experiencing depression, a serious and treatable disease. I would reccomend that you visit a psychiatrist, or at least do some research of your own into the disorder and treatments.

Sorry mods if I've stepped over the line viz. the &quot;no medical advice&quot; rule, but I think that it's both necessary and proper in this case.e

			Thanks for the reply Felix, but i don't think i'm depressed. Nothing sad or depressing has happened to me for a while, except for the fact that i'm letting my parents down because i never seem to finish any errands they set me. I don't have any disorders or genetic diseases either.

			Does the subconscious emulate ideas of sloth and laziness? People who are active are also afflicted by subconscious things. So no I don't think you are. Are all people afflicted by the subsconscious lazy and fat? You are afflicted by dullness and oblivion and distance. Try not to think of distant things that are unrelated, don't waste energy being worried. For some random reason I think rock climbing might seriously help you.
