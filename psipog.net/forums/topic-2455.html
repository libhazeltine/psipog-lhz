			Im new here, and I need some guidance as to where a good place for me to start would be. For as long as I can remember been drawn to the supernatural. Ive often thought that it might have something todo with me heritage, but since Im adopted Im dont know. Ive always been really in touch with my emotions and other's too, so Ive thoguth I might be an empath. Ive also always had very vivid dreams and I get de ja vu alot. Does this sound like I might be an empath. Its like I can be fighting with soemone one minute and be mad as hell but then when one of us walks away and Im alone my mood changes as fast as it came. Also when Im sitting at home alone sometime I just start to feel different emotions for no reason. Does anyone have any advice on how I could use it and control it? Also does it sound like Im an empath or is it somethign else? Thanks

			the easiest answer. The advice you need is the only person in this world who is going to help you is yourself (from within). People talk and it all boils down to what you think so create your own reality. Now to control this relative moment write commands down then reread

			Everybody dreams, sometimes it's vivid. Deja vu is miscalculation of time by your brain.
<br />
Also, why would those signs mean you're an empath?

			Because I can feel so many emotions that comeup so fast when Im around the people that show them. Then when im aways from them Im neutral again, plus it gets overwealming. I just said that about the dreams to get some opinons on dreams. But today I was really hurting because of the heated conversations of a debate. I was dying, I was seriously hurting so bad, and thats never happend before. Its was brutral.

			It does sound like you might be bipolar. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

<br />
And a bit emotionally sensitive.  I don't recommend automatically attributing to the &quot;supernatural&quot; what is easily explainable by normal stuff.  Some people may be more empathic than others, and you may be one of them, but empathy plays only a part in our senses of others, along with visual cues (body language, eyes), vocal inflections, pheremonal signals, and so forth.  I'm sure empathy plays a role in adopting the emotional states of people around us.  I'm not sure that your to quickness to adopt others' emotions is anything more than simply being emotionally sensitive.

			Sometimes you think that you are an empath, but sometimes you just arent. It could simply be the difference of seeing someone feeling down and knowing their emotions to you seeing someone without an expression on their face and you being able to know what their feeling is.

			True. It might be that you can read body language well. The best way to test this is if you look at someone who looks happy and receive their emotions. If they turn out to be sad and you were right, empathy. If not, it mabye isn't empathy.

			Empathy is a strange one..
<br />
Alot of people get confused with what the brains tells them about a person via body language, tone of voice, micromovements.
<br />

<br />
Empathic abilities are rather difficult to live with..especially if you have no control.
<br />
It can easily be overwhelming
<br />

<br />
Imagine going to a party and being bombarded with every emotion that everyone there was feeling, has felt...and is going to feel at some point in that night.
<br />

<br />
Now controlling empathic abilities.
<br />
Its hard to learn and its hard to teach.
<br />

<br />
Ive found the easiest way for beginners is &quot;Creative Visualisation&quot;
<br />

<br />
Detach your own emotions from that of the inner empath..actually visualise it.
<br />

<br />
Once you have seperated your emotions from the emotions of others you can then teach yourself how to control it.
<br />

<br />
Just try to attach a &quot;Switch&quot; that you can turn on and off when needed.
<br />

<br />
Not having control..can have some rather nasty effects.
