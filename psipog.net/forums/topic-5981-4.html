I'd just like to correct you that NO male species in the animal kingdom gives birth to young. The sea horse thing is a myth. The females give birth and the males carry them until they're mature enough to leave.

			I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true. It was recently in the news that china(mabye japan) is dwindiling the sea horse population by bringing so many into exhibits. It's almost impossible to keep one in captivity and have it live for a long time, so they just keep grabbing more and more. During the documentary they explained how the males giving birth was a myth. I'm kind of insulted you think I would say this if I wasn't sure about it.

Oh, my sincere apologies. It is just that I have always heard that the males give birth so I was therefore reluctant in believing you. But I would like to point out that just becuase you said it and you are sure about it, it still doesn't mean that it is true. I looked here: <a href="http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/anphys/2000/Cook/Reproduction.htm" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/anphys/2000/Cook/Reproduction.htm</a> 
<br />
I only skimmed but it looks like the female places the eggs into the male's pouch. And it says the male gives birth. To me, it only makes sense, why would the eggs be given to the male, and then taken back by the female when they are mature? The female doesn't have any place to put them. The male is equipped with the pouch and gives birth as far as I know. I would like your source in writing if you wish to waver my opinion.

			This is just a sort of off topic post just to clarify and correct some things said about reproduction in general. 
<br />

<br />
one person claimed that the Y chromosome carries more genes than the X chromosome. This is not true at all. It is the oppsotie. 
<br />
Source: <a href="http://ghs.gresham.k12.or.us/science/ps/sci/soph/genetics/notes/sex.htm" target="_blank">http://ghs.gresham.k12.or.us/science/ps/sci/soph/genetics/notes/sex.htm</a>
<br />
(The Y chromosome is 1/3 the size of the X chromosome. Y = 30 genes, X = 1000 genes)
<br />

<br />
In the link above, it also says what exactly determines the sex of the zygote (a fertilized oocyte). Females can only produce X chromosome carrying oocytes, while males produce both X and Y chromosome carrying sperms. So if an X chromosome carrying sperms fertilizes the oocyte, then the zygote is female and vice versa with an Y chromosome carrying sperm. 
<br />

<br />
There were a few posts talking about the presence of hormones playing a role in sex determination. This is not true, but has an importance in a different kind of way. The level of male hormones vs female hormones doesn't change the genotype of the sex chromosomes. If a female does have more male hormones than female ones, they will develop (to some degree) male and/or female reproductive organs. This will happen if the opposite hormones are present prenatally of course. The general term for this subject is Hormonal sex and there is a difference between this and chromosomal sex.

Did the males create the eggs and expel them? No. The female did.  That is birth and was not possible without the female. The male cannot <span style="font-weight: bold">create</span> eggs or young. The male is the substitute womb and nothing more. This happens all over the animal kingdom. My source was watching the television lol. I'm 100% sure. The people who ORGANIZE and dedicate their<span style="font-weight: bold"> whole lives</span> to sea horses are the ones who explained this. Go check about the dwindiling sea horse pop. in China or Japan and something should come up about the documentary done. It was a large show like 60 min or somehting like that.

Did the males create the eggs and expel them? No. The female did.  That is birth and was not possible without the female. The male cannot <span style="font-weight: bold">create</span> eggs or young. The male is the substitute womb and nothing more. This happens all over the animal kingdom. My source was watching the television lol. I'm 100% sure. The people who ORGANIZE and dedicate their<span style="font-weight: bold"> whole lives</span> to sea horses are the ones who explained this. Go check about the dwindiling sea horse pop. in China or Japan and something should come up about the documentary done. It was a large show like 60 min or somehting like that.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Oh, okay, that's what you mean. My defintion of giving birth is different from yours is all. I do know that the female gives the eggs to the male but since the eggs are not necessarly developed or <span style="font-style: italic">alive</span> so to speak, I do not catorgerize the female as giving the birth. Now the question is what is giving birth defined as? My definition is quite simply releasing a fully developed organism into life. Not releasing an undeveloped organism such as an egg...

			The rican is wrong. Scientists are just discovering that a lot more goes into genetic manifestation like alternative splicing and shit. In fact the Y chromosome is smaller and carries less usuable genetic code. Most of the maleness of organisms is in the lack of two X chromosomes. The Y does in fact carry some vital genes but is mostly repeat sequences.

one person claimed that the Y chromosome carries more genes than the X chromosome. This is not true at all. It is the oppsotie.

(The Y chromosome is 1/3 the size of the X chromosome. Y = 30 genes, X = 1000 genes)
<br />

<br />
In the link above, it also says what exactly determines the sex of the zygote (a fertilized oocyte). Females can only produce X chromosome carrying oocytes, while males produce both X and Y chromosome carrying sperms. So if an X chromosome carrying sperms fertilizes the oocyte, then the zygote is female and vice versa with an Y chromosome carrying sperm. 
<br />

<br />
There were a few posts talking about the presence of hormones playing a role in sex determination. This is not true, but has an importance in a different kind of way. The level of male hormones vs female hormones doesn't change the genotype of the sex chromosomes. If a female does have more male hormones than female ones, they will develop (to some degree) male and/or female reproductive organs. This will happen if the opposite hormones are present prenatally of course. The general term for this subject is Hormonal sex and there is a difference between this and chromosomal sex.

All that just for clarification. Don't post information you're not totally sure about and if you're not sure, do research.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Sorry but I was sure that I said I wasnt sure, or I lest met to, I'm afired I was the one who miscommucaited. I said the X had more (or lest I mean to) and that the Y had less. I heard of it having 57 genes, and the X having 1500. This agurement was with a guy I had with a while back. He told me there was some hormones in the sryum, there were other things I think he said (I THINK).

Once again I say sorry for not saying my words clearly, I tend to have a problem with that. I'm glade someone did some reseach on it, because I lack in the human anatomny.

Actually, the &quot;maleness&quot; does in fact come from the Y chromosome.  Men have both fully active Y and X chromosomes (with a few deactive sites).  Women have just one fully active X chromosome and one X chromosome with a handful of genes that sometimes are active.  So, since women have only 1 active X, your assumption (that men are male mostly because of their 1 active X chromosome rather than the fact they have a Y) is wrong.
