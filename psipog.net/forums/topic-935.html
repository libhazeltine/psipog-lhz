			Since we seem to be getting some noobs here that can't read something that's not in a post (i.e. an article), I'll post this.
<br />

<br />
Okay, when you come to the Psipog message boards and ask a question that is already answered in an article, you make your self look foolish. Therefore, here are some common questions about psi balls and the respective answers you can expect.
<br />

<br />
Q: How do I make a psi ball?
<br />
A: First of all, this indicates that you took no time looking at the main site (which I suggest you do). Anyways, <a href="../art-psiball-source.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">this article has the answer</a>.
<br />

<br />
Q: How do I make a visible (flared) psi ball?
<br />
A: <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html106" target="_blank" class="postlink">Read this article.</a>
<br />

<br />
Q: How do I tell if I've made a psi ball?
<br />
A: You feel it, physically. What it feels like varies from person to person. Some people feel warmth, some feel coolness, some feel pressure, etc... Personally, I feel tingling, like when your leg falls asleep, but weaker. There are many things you can feel. So, don't feel for anything specific, just feel for something. Also, <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html165" target="_blank" class="postlink">see this article</a>.
<br />

<br />
Q: How long does it take to learn to make a psi ball?
<br />
A: It varies from person to person. It took me something like a week to learn how to make them. Some people make one on their very first try. Some people take over a month to learn to make one. The norm seems to be around 1-2 weeks.
<br />

<br />
Q: How long does it take to make a psi ball?
<br />
A: Once again, it varies from person to person, and with how good you are. Personally, I can make a weak one in less than two seconds. Some people spend up to 30 minutes on one.
<br />

<br />
Q: How do I get the psi ball to do stuff?
<br />
A: You need to program it. <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html155" target="_blank" class="postlink">Read this article</a> to learn how to program.
<br />

<br />
Q: How do I change the temperature of my psi ball?
<br />
A: <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html155" target="_blank" class="postlink">You program it.</a>
<br />

<br />
Q: How do I keep my psi ball from dissipating?
<br />
A: You need to <a href="art-psionic-shielding.html5" target="_blank" class="postlink">shell</a> your psi ball. Doing so will allow it to last longer.
<br />

<br />
Q: Can I make other shapes?
<br />
A: Yes, you can make all sorts of shapes. You can have psi cubes, psi cones, psi cylinders, psi dodecahedrons, etc... If it's a shape, you can make your psi ball into that shape. Making it into a different shape is fairly easy. You can <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html155" target="_blank" class="postlink">program</a> it to be a different shape.
<br />

<br />
Q: What all can I make my psi ball do?
<br />
A: For the most part, what you can do with a psi ball is limited by the skills you have. For example, if you can psychokinetically move a pen, then you can make a psi ball do the same. But if you can't move the pen, then you can't make the psi ball do it. There are a few exceptions to this, such as changing the temperature of your psi ball, giving it a certain texture, making it have a certain taste, etc...
<br />

<br />
Q: Can I make psi weapons?
<br />
A: Hypothetically, yes, I suppose it's possible. However, it's highly improbable that you would get that good. For the record, I consider psi-weapons to be constructs meant to be used like a physical weapon. A psi-staff meant to bludgeon something would be a psi-weapon. A psi-sword meant only to store energy would not be a weapon.
<br />

<br />
Q: Can I use energy from other objects to make a psi ball?
<br />
A: There's not really a simple answer to this. It appears that you can do so, but some people believe it's just a mental crutch. I recommend using your own energy. That way, you build up your own energy generation abilities, and you don't have to rely on other things for energy. But, you're free to try drawing energy from other things.
<br />

<br />
Q: Do I need to use my hands to make a psi ball?
<br />
A: No. You can make a psi ball in two hands, in one hand, on your nose, in your pocket, wherever.
<br />

<br />
Q: Do I need to know how to make a psi ball to learn &lt;insert name of skill here&gt;?
<br />
A: No. You don't have to learn psi balls before moving on to other things. However, it's recommended that you do learn how to make psi balls, as they make a good stepping stone to harder skills. Think about it this way: If you're learning to play a piano, do you learn how to play Beethoven first, or do you start with something simpler, like Mary Had a Little Lamb?
<br />

<br />
Q: What should I learn after psi balls?
<br />
A: Whatever you feel like learning. Personally, I recommend learning to <a href="../articles.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">shield properly</a>, but you don't have to.
<br />

<br />
Q: Is there anything I should learn before practicing psi balls?
<br />
A: Psi balls are about as basic as it gets. You could get good at meditating beforehand, but it's not necessary.
<br />

<br />
Q: My question isn't on this list, nor is it answered in an article. What should I do?
<br />
A: First, do a quick search of <a href="../qna.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">the Q&amp;A section</a>. If you still can't find an answer, do a quick search of the <a href="forums/viewforum.php?f=6" target="_blank" class="postlink">Psi Balls</a> or <a href="forums/viewforum.php?f=4" target="_blank" class="postlink">Constructs</a> sections of the message boards. If you still can't find an answer, post a new topic and ask your question.
<br />

<br />
I hope that was straightforward enough for everyone.
<br />

			Very well written!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> I deffinately agree... on the fact that you need to do a little homework before asking questions so you don't make yourself look stupid, ... and on the answers you gave to those frequent questions. 
<br />

<br />
 <img src="images/smiles/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" border="0" /> Might I add as a tip to someone new to psi who wants to ask questions... Psi isn't concrete. It's not like math, where there are right and wrong answers and right and wrong ways to do things. The vast majority of people who practice psi sort of blaze their own trail and develop their own methods and beliefs. So, basically, don't get stressed out about what the &quot;right&quot; answer to something is.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Very nice. But one thing I have to ask you. If the newbs you are targetting didn't bother to read the innumerable articles out there, specifically the ones here at psipog and in the closer psionic communities, how can we expect them to read a post that may look as if they are amongst a bunch of other past threads? Eldibs, you did everything right in this thread, but I don't think this will have any more of a positive affect on those newbs than the articles button that's in big bold print at the top of psipog's homepage.

			Yeah, I know it may not have an effect on the noobs. But, there's a chance that it will lower the noob count, so I had to do it.

			Yeah, I can see where you're coming from. Someone should invent an article pop up that newbs can't exit out of until they read every bit of all caps heavily flashing obnoxious words in the article. That way, it'll either make them realize, or it will bring them into a hypnotic state and force them to read the rest of the articles. Either way, the invention would be a hit!

What do you mean by this?  Like, creating a psi staff?  its just a normal construct.  What do you mean &quot;it's highly improbable that you would get that good&quot;?
