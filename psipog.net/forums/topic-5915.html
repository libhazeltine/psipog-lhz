Double winks to all.
<br />
 ;D
<br />

<br />
I want to see how well he works for other people. I already know how well he works for me.
<br />

<br />
He's been embeud with many good things, now it's all about utilization.
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e378/fruitpooper/Foremethenonisek.png" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
To the upper left, is his name, with symbols around it. This is for communicating with him, and accessing his energies, etc. It's a big name, but it has meaning so you should wisper the whole thing after centering, grounding, casting the circle, etc. Wisper the name 12 times or so.
<br />

<br />
To the right is his body with the armor suit off.
<br />
Bottom left is him with his armor on.
<br />

<br />
In the center of the page is a simplified sigil which directly connects to his body and his existence.
<br />

<br />
-
<br />

<br />
He has allot of energy, but what he needs is good guidance to do the tasks. He's rooted into a higher realm so it may be easier or harder to access his full force, depending on what you are adept with.
<br />

<br />
If anybody would like to test using him for tasks, then please try it and tell me about the results. Do silly little tests, it doesn't matter, really. Ask that he make somebody phone you within 30 minutes, or ask that he makes it rain within a week, etc. Things like this, just test out what he is capable of and what he is not. Maybe try using him as a form of awareness-gate with a Ouija board, or something like that, also. Or you could ask him to heal a friend of a certian health problem.
<br />

<br />
Be patient with the evokation or invocation, as you can draw more and more of his force out from his realm, depending on how hard you try and how long you do it for.
<br />

<br />
Many thanks for those who wish to play with my servitor and test him out.
<br />

<br />
Cya later.

			It's an advanced &quot;psi-pet&quot;, which exists mostly in the &quot;astral plane&quot;. It's instinctive paradigm is to do business with people. It requires good guidance, and perhaps physical energy, and in return it will do a task.

			MetaAlchemy, is this your project you've hinted at around the forums for the past few months?
<br />

<br />
If I was more experienced, I would try this.
<br />

<br />
I think this simply uses that one rune system, or a kind of rune system (or they're for decorations) that was up here earlier.. As well as, this seems not to be some kind of demon, but rather, a very complex 'psi-pet' of sorts. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
At the same time, I could be totally wrong. I dunno.

			Psi-pets can only generally be used by the creator, and for them to have any usefulness for the things that he has described, he must've spent days programming the thing. Maybe longer. How do you know it exists on the astral plane, MetaAlchemy? How would you confirm such a claim, and what is the astral plane, exactly?

			I understand what it is. A servatar is like a magick psipet conjourd withh a persons own energy and a name written on something like paper and a whole process I don't remember anymore. He sounds really cool, but I wouldnt call on him because I don't quite trust it. I reasurched magick before I found psipog. Arn't servators really advanced? I've only done an invisibility spell, a simple protection spell, and my spell I use to calm me down when I'm upset.

the whole magick thing sounds like witchcraft. does it include demons?
