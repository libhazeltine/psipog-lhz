			Last night, July 13 2006, i spoke to some people on gabbers. I recived some tips, i was still unhappy because i didn't get any actuall instructions. So i went forth with what they said, and read the PeeBrains chat log. I did it step by step, and i actually did it. It was the most amazing thing in my life, after getting the energy move around my body. 
<br />

<br />
For those wondering how did it feel. It felt like there was a repelling magnetical void. There was nothing there, because i tried seeing what i had in my hands. 
<br />

<br />
If i had any friends that believed in this, oh i would be bragging a lot! Thanks to you all for you helpfull tips.
<br />

<br />
My question is, what should i be doing now? Training? Well i did try to repeat the ball exp. while laying down before going to sleep, and i didn't get the ball. I accumulated the energy, but i think it didn't want to ball.

			ya i would practice. are there anything you do in your daily life where you can incoroporate psi balls and practice that way? like if you're a boxer or martial artist or something; you can practice by sending psi balls when you kick or punch or block. it's not just fighting sports though, maybe basketball or something.
<br />

<br />
just try to incorporate it into your daily life and over time you'll begin to master the creation of psi balls. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

good luck

			For me, that is, psiballs are not easy to make, i need to concentrate alone for a while before i get the feel for it. I am a skeptic. A skeptic testing. Once i get the psi wheel working like its supposed to... Then i will be able to master this whole psi areas as i will be a believer. If not then i will do the stuff skeptically.

There isn't anything you should really do next it's all up to you really but getting aquainted with energy is always a nice start. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			i think thats why you're having difficulty with your psi balls, because of the fact you are a skeptic. i think you're kind of holding yourself back. i mean, being a skeptic is a natural thing. i was a non believer for a long time, until i realized i had been using telepathy naturally for a few years and didnt even notice. maybe i was in some sort of denial state. 
<br />

<br />
who knows, but i would say though, try one day or whatever to believe that all of this is real. for one day just drop the skepticism. try to dedicate that day to working on the psi ball. truly believe that you can do what you're doing. the next day reflect on what you did. did you improve the psi ball? were you stronger, etc. once you've realized that you improved at least somewhat, that might make you a believer, instead of just waiting for the wheel to move.

			If it were that easy to stop being a skeptic, wonder what else would. Does using the psi wheel require energy control? I have gotten the psi wheel to tag me, that is to stick to my finger, and follow it with contact, but when i try to push it... either the wheel is broken or i am broken.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I read the not important PK article, well both actually, and it is saying to create a link between you and the object. I still don't understand this.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I tried to make the psiball before i read all your posts and it didn't work. Owned by the energy?! &lt;- (Counter Strike insiders joke: Owned)

			what ni means by connecting with the psi wheel is become aware of it. try to feel its presence; make a connection.
<br />

<br />
i dont know of any other way to explain it. maybe someone else can add a filler for me.

			the only way right now that i can think of is to have an experienced psion who can sense psi balls sit down with you and tell you if you have made one or not. 
<br />

<br />
now if you are confident in your able to sense psi then go ahead and ditch the other person, but i think for a noob, depending on the person, it's best to have a teacher there to help with verification, etc.
