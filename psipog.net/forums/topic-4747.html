			heh i was going to post that, you beat me to it! guess its old news
<br />
Not sure they're using 'psipog methods' though, does anyone think this telepathy experiment will be successfull?
<br />
It's kinda silly, saying virtual reality is going to make the test work better

			If I was a scientist that worked for a company that is experimenting on telepathy then why would I choose random people off of the street when there are people that have a SPECIFIC written technique that actually works?!?! Wouldn't it be even BETTER to make a contest but use computers and lab results to back up the ranking/judgeing? To me that would be the fastest way to learn how to prove its a reality. From there it would take just a few tests and controlled experiment to put out a theory. (of course this could take a few years) . Think about it though, isn't what they're doing just using a fancy and high tech version of the (cards with circles, squiggly lines, plus signs and star)?

1. It's more convinient.
<br />

<br />
2. There isn't much that makes psipog empirically different than any other group of people that claim to have psychic abilities.

			I've read about this before.  I don't understand why they choose to use a virtual world to test telepathy.  This seems like overkill to me.  Why not just send some images like everyone else?  What does this virtual world offer that normal images don't?

			by 'psipog methods' I mean, the people who try telepathy aren't using a method, they just tell them to try to send an image, do they know how? And  they tell them to receive the image, do they know how? What's the point if they don't know how, and don't pratice how? its B.S.

Wouldn't seperate rooms with the same objects in it do the same trick? <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

It doesn't matter though, real or virtual.

It is simple. The machine is configured to receive the tiniest of signals, when the real world is not.
