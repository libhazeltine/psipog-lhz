			From time to time (once a month is a reasonable estimate), I will have a dream in which I am exactly where I physically am, aware of everything that should be surrounding me -- bed, blanket, my room is as it should be. I can't SEE that, but I just know it. I have had a bit of an internal conflict concerning whether I am dreaming or awake when this happens.
<br />

<br />
I will believe I am awake and will try to open my eyes. I get that feeling that you get when your eyes are adjusted to darkness and you brightly light up the room in which you are, and my eyelids won't open the slightest bit.
<br />

<br />
I try to sleep in the closest thing to complete darkness that I can -- there are dim lights from the air conditioner, alarm clock, computer LEDs, and some light leaking through the bottom of the door from the kitchen, but major things like the computer monitor, television, light bulbs are off. I pretty much only see darkness unless I go out of my way to find a weak light source, such as those that I mentioned I leave on.
<br />

<br />
Though I'd have no trouble with my eyes refusing to open if I were to wake up in the middle of the night and still be sleepy, one thing that these dreams have in common is that I shield my eyes from any &quot;light&quot; with my hand and then attempt to open them again. I succeed, but see nothing, and when I remove my hand, the &quot;overwhelming brightness&quot; (though all I see is darkness) will force my eyes shut.
<br />

I mean, religion wouldn't have even been mentioned in this topic if you wouldn't have mentioned it.

As for the eyes thing, I think it's:
<br />

<br />
1. Eye boogers/ sleep gunk
<br />

<br />
2. A bad dream
<br />

<br />
3. Sleep paralysis/ some weird sleep thing where your eyes stay asleep

			I was lurking for a bit before posting this, and saw that in one topic about odd sleep/weird dreams, religious solutions came up and people would post things like &quot;this thread's getting closed.&quot; It's really better to mention in advance that you don't want a certain type of answer than let people argue about it in your thread until it gets closed and you're left with unanswered questions.
<br />

<br />
Much like locking your door at night, whether or not you think someone will enter and steal your belongings, you do it anyway, because it's a reasonable precaution.

			That one thread where someone wanted to know what to do about a dream stalker or whatever? I think the person who said to cast it away in the name of Jesus was pepsiboy logged in as a different account. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			I have had dreams before where everything was normal, like in the house, but as soon as i stepped outside, the light was so bright I had to close my eyes.  It was like when it snows and the sun hits it at about 10 am and every thing goes white and burns your eyes.
