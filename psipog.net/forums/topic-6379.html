			someone while i was at school came into my house went up to my room found my money stash and took all the 20's and 50's, while the 10's 5's and 1's were left in the stash...
<br />
  Most of the U.S. bills were 20's a few 50's.
<br />

<br />
this happen around 10 o clock A.M., november 29. After the person was in my room he went into my sister room where she was sleeping and started going thru her draws, then woke her but she dident think anything of it, she assumed it may of been one of my friends... then the kid leaves the room after about a min and says <span style="text-decoration: underline">hello to my dog and knew the name of my dog &quot;Zoey&quot;</span>.
<br />
Then leaves thru the basment, bedrooms are on the top floor, and my sister saw a silver car maybe audi A4 silver/gray in color drive off from the house, but my sis dident see the car to well and it was far away as she viewed it from the inside of the house... 
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">THE KIDS DISCRIPTION</span> (my sister saw him in her room, but she was just waking up) had a light grey skully on and a coat with grey on the back of it maybe black on the sides and maybe some white on, one of those puffy jackets but not a down jacket but sort of puffy. The Kids FACE dark brown hair witha few lil hair curls coming out from the skully cap on the side of his head, he had puffy dark eyes, eyes like a puppy would have no facial hair that could be seen, was a white person with a more pale blue/white skin color. He had a  skinny long face with a long nose.
<br />

<br />
-numbers-    -description of numbers-
<br />

<br />
0000-0001    for the grey/black/white puffy jacket
<br />
0000-0002    for his face description (long skinny face, puppy dark eyes, long nose)
<br />
0000-0003    for the silver car
<br />
0000-0004    for the 20's and 50's 
<br />

<br />
i live in NY, Long island, sag harbor, but the kid could be from any town thats close by (the hamptons), and so far i have not been able to identify this kid in my highschool or remember seeing this kid at all.. but he knew my dogs name, knew where my house was, where my room was, where the money was but the money was not hard to find it was in my computer desk draw. 
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">IF ANYONE COULD FIND ANY INFO on anything using these descriptions to help find any clues i mean ANYTHING! PLS!!! help!!!</span> I MEAN ANYTHING CAN HELP AT THIS POINT TO PUT CLUES TOGETHER

			hehe i live on long island too. great neck wich is like an hour away. idk the bills are spent by now its a good idea to have posted the number things for the items of clothing and car. what i would do is think of a friend that
<br />
a: can drive and has a car heh
<br />
b: knows you well enough to know your puppies name
<br />
c: knows you well enough to know your room and your sisters room
<br />
d: knows for sure that few people would be home around that time due to the fact that he seemed to go in with such confidence even as your sister slept.
<br />

<br />

this also has to do with the point that i had a huge bag of marijuana, and had black mail agianst me as the kid got a girl to call my house at 1 o clock and black mail me telling my mom i was drug dealing and they were gonna tell the police.. but it has to be black mail.... the phone call was black mail im sure of it.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" /> and i dont think the kid knew my sis was here....
<br />

<br />

			this kid knows you. I haven't done this in a long time and trust me I'm rusty but I'm getting strong energy of vengeance when reading this story The kid was getting revenge. Have you done anything really mean to anyone recently? I also detect confusion, the kid might have thought he was getting revenge on the right person.

			You don't need psi to detect that highadrenaline. He's <span style="font-style: italic">definetly</span> a friend of a friend. Sounds like you might push a little green now and then, and might have some people who would like to take advantage of that knowledge. He's a friend of a friend because if you've never seen him before, you obviously don't know him, but if he knew that much about your life/house, he's been informed about it. Also, if it was somebody just looking for money, they wouldn't have left anything behind, especially when it was right infront of their face. They wanted to hurt you (and get some cash), but not leave you completely empty handed. That's not any typical robbery. You've got an enemy amoung friends that wanted some kind of revenge and I doubt you'll ever find the person unless you see them yourselves. Your &quot;friend&quot; will not tell you and it sounds like it was well planned. The person who wanted the money most likely got someone they knew, you wouldn't ever know, and picked them for that reason, then split the money with them. Your &quot;friend&quot; provides the information and the accomplice does the job. Split the profits and noone will ever find out. Sorry, that's what I think.

<br />

<br />
