			Hi, I was just wondering what the field of study we would place psionics under.
<br />
Currently I am planning on independantly studying this at school, but the science department head isn't sure if this would go under science or under humanities with psychology
<br />
My cooperating teacher also says that its humanities, or at least pseudoscience because u cannot use the scientific method in terms of quantitative results.
<br />
I think it's only partly psychology, in terms of tactile and visual visualizations, but in this Independant Study, I plan to study mainly 'psi'.
<br />

<br />
I was wondering what you all thought, and if you could help me convince them that it is a science and not psychology, humanities, and pseudoscience.
<br />

<br />
Thanks to you all!

			In my psychology book for school says that Telekinesis, Telepathy, etc belong to parapsychology, that they aint scientificaly proven, but many people say they exists...

			Ya, Parapsychology.
<br />

<br />
I'd like to believe that if I am studying all the aspects of psi, that it'd be a science, considering how psi is most likely energy. For psychology, isn't that studying the thinking? While that does play a part in manipulation of psi, I plan to study the actual energy itself, so I'd think it'd be biology or chemistry.

			What part of the field do you intend to study?  Most of the study of psionics is properly part of Physics and Engineering: Physics, for the theoretical stuff, and Engineering, for the applied.  If you're looking at how or whether a person's state of mind affects their ability, overall or in a specific circumstance, then it falls under Psychology or Biology....depending on how you are going about the study.   How does psionic activity affect the body (such as the potassium issue)?  Biology, Biochemistry, Physiology.... There are aspects of psionic investigation that wander into the other fields, but those are the main ones to start from.

			Well, I am studying mostly in general, but I intend to try and explain some of the psionics. So I guess energy manipulation, and what is really happening when somone shields, or whena  contruct is made, or (what I still don't really know) remote presence and viewing.
