			define the farmost &quot;Boundaries&quot; in PK in your own words, because some of you seem to believe they are there.
<br />

<br />
i believe there is no boundaries because if you could think(and know) levitation through physcic means is possible, and has been done, and walking through solid objects is also possible by physcic means, why isnt everything else? i mean, saying &quot;you can levitate a pencil without touching it (i mean psycic means), you can walk through walls, but you cant teleport, or manipulate gravity.&quot; i think thats a little bit hard to believe, providing the first 2 statements has happened. its like saying &quot;you can go into outter space for lightyears, but you cant enter the deep-most parts of the ocean. you know its possible, it just hasnt happened yet.&quot; i feel the same rule goes to physic ability. its possible, it just hasnt happened yet.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Also, on &quot;level of PK strength&quot; i feel thats all crap too, i believe that &quot;level of PK&quot; is actually where your personal beliefs and boundaries stand. so if you believe your not &quot;strong&quot; enough to levitate a pen, then it wont happen, but if you do believe you are &quot;strong&quot; enough to levitate a pen, then you will. so practice is actually just a help for people to understand physcic abilities and help expand on their boundaries, allowing more of the certain type of ability. for example: practice on PK will eventually lead you to levitation. this statement is both true and false. practice will help you to expand on your boundaries allowing you to reach this goal, yet, it is up to the person who is actually performing PK where he sets his boundaries and in other terms &quot;things that <span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span> happen&quot;. as i have said, experience is just a help, yet dont think that this could mean a first-timer could pick up a ruler and levitate it instantly, it takes time to expand on your boundaries.
<br />

<br />
what do you people thought when they discovered gravity?
<br />

<br />
have a good long hard think about that question, and many other large discoveries in the past of what people thought. like &quot;the world is round&quot; people thought he was crazy, but he proved he was right. thus people should think more about &quot;If telepathy, TK ect ect is possible, why isnt this?&quot; and expand from there, instead of thinking &quot;impossible. so and so would happen disallowing this ability.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
but dont forget: we also set sub-concious boundaries that we cannot easily change, such as, materialising a cookie in ur hand, we all <span style="font-style: italic">know</span> its not going to happen, so it never will. and the key-word there is &quot;Know&quot;. its probably not possible to change that boundary, but only time can tell what we might achieve.
<br />

<br />
Thus i conclude: Boundaries are only set by ourselves, and everything else is possible. but there are some boundaries that we might not (and most likely, will not) be able to change, yet that ability is possible, we just make it impossible by our sub-concious boundaries.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
now instead of posting &quot;your crazy&quot; or something else like that, give this a good long hard think about it, then reply.

Haha, just kidding. All your points make sense to me. All we need to test is that if a kid is brought up thinking that psionics is possible, and say, that it can materialise a cookie in its hand, would it happen?

			psionics isn't magic, it follows some form of scientific rules.
<br />

<br />
Sure, it might be able to do many things, but it's not the tool of reality.
<br />

<br />
Really, more I learn about Chemistry, the more I think about of converstation with ErikJDurwoodII, the more I feel that psi is just a typical small particle or photon (moving in waves) but follows different rules.

but as i said, &quot;reality&quot; in today's terms is something we face every day and we cannot hide from ourselves because we see proof of what things can/cannot happen. this means that theres no way to materialise a cookie in ur hand unless ur a total freak who doesnt know what reality is, and doesnt understand what can/cannot happen in today's terms of &quot;reality&quot;, but if he was quite experienced, you would think hes got a decent amount of brain-power.... a bit a brainteaser question.

			There are boundaries to psionics for the simple reason that the amount of energy that the human body can handle or manipulate at once is limited to an amount that doesn't cause serious physical harm. This is why so many people on this site are skeptical of people who are like &quot;OMFGZORZ, I JUST LIFTED A CAR WITH MY BRAIN!&quot; Is it possible to lift a car? Yes, after years of conditioning your body to tolerate higher levels of energy and your mind to be able to manupulate the same massive amounts of energy. Either way, there does come a point where it isn't healthy, and is possibly lethal, for even the most skilled psion to handle the amount of energy a task requires.

mmmm yes.... that is true....... dont forget, i said, it is possible to achieve basically anything we believe in (you know what i mean by that) but i never said anything about being able to withstand the pressure it puts on your body. or even what kind of things could result from what you tried to achieve. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />. in this sense that you have posted, boundaries is not actually boundaries, its border lines, that disallow us from reaching a certain point if we want to maintain our health, yet if we were to try, we wouldnt be stopped by these borders, more like &quot;critical warning&quot;.
<br />

<br />
and yet again here there is no right/wrong answer.
