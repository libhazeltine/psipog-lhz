			First off, yes I'm a newbie but you will all be seing alot of me from now on <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />
So I got this site off a friend, and after reading a bit, I managed to create a Psi ball within a minute, after that it takes longer and longer, but I can hold it longer.
<br />
Anyway, so I made a psi wheel and I've followed every instruction but it doesn't even shake. I visualize my &quot;atoms&quot; moving it without touching it, and it doesn't move (after 10 minutes my mom walked in and thought I was doing drugs) I also heard a guy made a psi ball and threw it at the wheel making it move. I did this but nothing happened either. Does anyone have any good tips? I've searched the forums but everyone seems to be able to move the psi wheel.
<br />
(By the way when I'm doing it my mind is clear and I'm really focusing on it)

			Don't worry too much - I have only been trying this for a couple of days, and I can get the psiwheel to move, but can't 'get' anything from the whole psiball thing. I just sit there feeling silly with my hands together for 5 mins hah. 
<br />

<br />
A good term I have heard in the past, which seems to work for me on the psi wheel is 'focused inattention'. i.e. be very aware of the wheel in front of you, but don't strain yourself to 'force' it to move. Be very casual and almost keep looking away from it every now and again, then let your eyes come back always keeping the wheel in your mind.
<br />

<br />
Good luck, and let us know how you get on <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			you can't just move it on visualization alone (well, i can't, anyway).  Try expecting it to move.  you could maybe pretend that there is a fan behind you, and you just KNOW the psiwheel is going to spin.  or maybe, you could pretend this is your favorite movie clip, and you know whats going to happen.  and remember, all things take patience, and a lot of practice.

			well I definitely need some more practice. I will try it abut an hour a day.
<br />
I also tried to make a psi ball over the wheel which I couldn't do  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> I focused everything like I always do, but the ball didn't form.
<br />
Thanks for all your help guys, I'll be sure to try out each technique <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			don't forget to practice...., you will regret it if you do.  also, make sure to give yourself a break inbetween.  if you start feeling lightheaded, take a small break, maybe get a cup of coffee <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			It took me about a month of nearly nightly attempts to get it going at first.  I never really have been too fond of any method involving energy or psi, just because I haven't figured out for myself whether or not they are actually there, or if I'm fooling myself (only way to find out is to try as far as I'm concerned, still working on that).  
<br />

<br />
Something I found that helped with attention, as I'm borderline ADHD, was meditating.  It can be hard, but if you find something to focus on it becomes easier.  I would light a candle and stare at the flame for about twenty minutes or so, calming my mind in the process.  From there, I used the &quot;just do it&quot; method to get it down.

			that sounds good, I'll light a candle <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> thanks for the help.

By the way, I know this isn't the right thread or anything, but if I manage to, oh, lets say excel at telekinisis, does that mean it would be harder for me to learn empathy and stuff like that?

			I personally have never heard of an instance such as that, however I do have one word of caution: if you do become adept at PK it may be a little difficult to get into those abilities because they don't bring definite, visual evidence of its success like PK does.  When PK works, you see it.  WHen telepathy or empathy works, how do you know it isn't just a random thought or feeling floating through your mind?  If you do get PK down, and with patience and practice you will, just make sure to have plenty of patience when dealing with the less visible disciplines.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Also, I can't stress enough the importance of daily, or nearly daily practice.  I used to be able to manipulate up to 5 psiwheels at once, but i stopped practicing for several months and now can barely work 2, an thats only after a long time of warming up on 1.  Taking a short break every now and then can actually help though.

Lol. I have no doubt about it that you can do it, I can't I know that, I always feel my own body heat and my mum says she didn't feel anything either. It's just funny how some people say it as:
<br />
- I visualize my atoms
<br />
- Physical Teleportation
<br />
- Changing Physicial appearance
<br />
Now the last 2 are obviously bogus, if you really could teleport then why would you need a car? and so on.
