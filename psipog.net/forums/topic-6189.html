			Recently I have been feeling <span style="font-weight: bold">very</span> odd. Last week I started getting headaches and felt drained of energy. I tried to make a shield and failed, and my headache got much worse. The only way I can get rid of the bad headache is if I shut down (technique from Rainsong's website).
<br />
I can't (attempt to) do anything psionic without getting a big headache.
<br />

<br />
Could someone please scan my field for any bad constructs? (or shield me?)

			I don't think I'm good at scanning but I tried to placed a shield around you. Don't know what to say about these fights I still nwe to all this myself in some ways.
<br />

<br />
When I looked at you I saw a faint weak shield. I hope that helps

			I'll try and send some healing energy. 
<br />

<br />
I've been told I'm a born healer, I've had evidence backing this up when I've tested it out. Let's see what I can do, eh?
<br />

<br />
The Doctor will see you now.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Edit: I've tried sending a little energy, tried to build an oval-shaped shield around you, not sure if it did the trick though.
<br />

<br />

<br />
May try again later.

			From what I can tell, there's something up with the right side of your brain, near the front on the top. Is your headache stronger there than anywhere else? Nonetheless, I too tried to heal you a bit, hope it helped.

			Hokay, Solus and I are collaborating to help you with this. He'll be sending you healing/cleansing energy, I'll attempt to make a shield for you.
<br />

<br />
Edit: Shield in place. I'm not the greatest at it, but it's there, and it's programmed to deflect any mental attacks. I'll try to hold it up for a few days, at least.

			Urgh, I think you're under attack right now. I'm getting a headache from where I'm sensing the shield (if that made sense for you folks). Seems to be holding out, though. I'll re-fortify it.

			Thanks for the energy/shields. I didn't get the headache when I did a little energy manipulation earlier today.
<br />

<br />
I am thinking it may not really be an attack. My usual shield system would (probably) stop most attacks. I tried a good grounding/centering and it might have fixed my problems.

That is correct. It is strongest on the right side near the front-top. You are a very good scanner.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
