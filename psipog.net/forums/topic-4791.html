			I wanted to share a little story with you guys. This is right from my away message. Kinda creepy.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I almost got carjacked today. No joke. I was at work and took my lunch break. I went to subway and got the usual- meatball sub and some cookies. As I walked out, a guy came up to me and said, &quot;Excuse me sir, excuse me. I'm from out of town and my car just broke down just up the road and I need a ride. Can you give me a ride just up the road here?&quot; It seemed very shady, so I told him to hold on a second as I went in the store. As I went in, he followed. When I got to the counter, I said to a coworker, &quot;Hey, this gentleman's having some car trouble and needs a ride.&quot; I just looke at my coworker, trying to hint that something was wrong. I didn't exactly get help, so I turned to him and told him I couldn't help and that I was on duty. He said it was ok, but then asked if I had 5 bucks for a cab. That sounded really shady, but I pulled out my wallet to act as if I had no money. As I did, he said, and I quote, &quot;Just... if you have 5 bucks.... 10 bucks would be great though... if you've got 20 bucks thatd be really great...&quot; At this point I got very nervous. I said to him, &quot;Sorry man, all I have is a 20 and I'm not giving you 20.&quot; He then walked out.
<br />

<br />
Now you know damn well that that guy was going to carjack me. I don't know if he was packing heat or not, but yeah. Not exactly a good situation. Come on. For chrissakes, I'm 17! Cut me some slack! What the hell am I going to do?
<br />

<br />
Oh well. If you read all that, thanks. Leave a message if you want.&quot;

			Heheh, I would've told the guy to fuck off....dangerous or not. Hell, I wouldn't even look in my wallet, I'd just look at him with the &quot;I don't give a fuck about you&quot; look and tell him, I have no money.

Just because you're two years younger doesn't mean you can't make a comment man.

I was never really happy aobut giving my age out online, because honestly, I think the number is complete bullshit. I know kids at the age of 12 who are much more mature that alot of adults I know.

			Damnit.  I saw the words &quot;Exclusive&quot; and &quot;Pants party&quot; and I got all excited.
<br />

<br />
And I get a spooky story?  *sigh*
<br />

<br />
Seriously though I'm glad you're okay.  I was surprised when I finally learnt your age.  I always assumed you were in your twenties.
<br />

<br />
Anyways because you weren't hurt, nothing bad comes out of the experience but getting the pantsparty scared off you.  It seems like you took it well.  I probably would have started crying, given him my wallet and ran away.
