			I'm guessing you don't know much about kung fu. The different between the chinese and japanese/korean/etc is that all you do is throw some kicks and some punches and when you see them on the floor you're like oh ok my job is done. The chinese concentrate on a lot more than just throwing punches. 
<br />
It always takes a few decades before chinese martial artists start kicking butt because they haven't mastered the art yet. Once they do there's no touching them. Bruce Lee, Jet Li, Jackie Chan? 
<br />
Ya I do watch UFC. There are some very good fighters. Actuallly, Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz are some of my favourites.
<br />
You don't like kung fu, go ahead be my guest. There isn't one martial art that works for everyone. I'd like to see you fight one of those monks.

I wasn't saying that kung fu arts are superior. I said that each art has its own benefits that help certain people.

Bruce Lee? Jet Li? Jackie Chan? They're all actors. I think out of all three of them Bruce Lee has ever been in a real fight. I don't think Jet Li or Jackie Chan have. This reminds me of Johnny Cage's problem <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Sorry, but if your style takes decades of practice to allow you to knock someone out... it sucks.

I'll look into that stuff later. I don't generally buy into that &quot;knocking people out by screaming&quot; thing, or &quot;dim mak&quot; stuff.

			They are actors, but before they were actors they were martial artists. They all began studying kung fu when they were young and continued to practice when they were adults.
<br />

<br />
I dont think you realize that when I said untouchable I really mean UNTOUCHABLE. When it comes down with it, I think it's worth it because you have to remember kung fu wasn't around just so they could teach self-defense. They were around to bring about spritual healing and things like that. The monks could afford to spend years and years mastering their styles.
<br />

<br />

<br />
So if you don't think it's worth it fine. I'm not going to try and change your opinion, but don't say it's stupid because it's more than just learning self-defense.

			Actually, Bruce Lee was an actor before he did any martial arts. Look it up.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Untouchable? I think every culture has it's &quot;UNTOUCHABLE&quot; people. Huo Yuanjia for example. I know Capoeira has AT LEAST five. I can only ever remember the names of two though. So on and so on. They're not untouchable though. They can still be beaten.
<br />

<br />
Things like boxing aren't just for self defense. They're for fighting. That can include protecting people, assaulting them, winning a title belt, self defense, etc.
<br />

<br />
Kiai... eh. Those result in too many broken jaws for my liking. I don't care much for energy bursts. They remind me too much of dim mak.

			ACtually ya you're right about Bruce Lee. I read in a bio he began studying martial arts because he wanted some discipline. I'll give you that.
<br />

<br />
Like I said before, you don't have to like Kung Fu just don't say it sucks because it has different ideologies than the martial arts you practice.
<br />
By the way, what do you practice anyway?

			That's hard to explain. I always do Capoeira and BJJ. But I do a lot of boxing, karate, wrestling, and judo right now. That changes weekly according to where I'm at, if I feel as if though I've put in enough hours to honestly say I'm practicing it, and so on. That's why my list fluctuates so much.
<br />

<br />
I don't care about (or for) kung fu's &quot;ideologies.&quot; I care about how effective it is in a fight.
<br />

<br />
Also... have either Jackie Chan or Jet Li ever been in real fights?

			Martial arts to me is not a sport
<br />
not a way of life
<br />
not self defense
<br />

<br />
Just the most effective way to kill a man.
<br />

<br />
Sadly finding tha type of martial art and those type of moves and mythologies among all the watered down (for the masses OWN good) nonsense is quite hard.

			I don't think you realize just how effective kung fu is. You're just looking for fighting abilities and self-defense obviously. Cool. Kung fu practitioners want more than just that. It's always difficult for outsiders to understand it because they plainly just don't know. I think maybe what you should is just research it before you decide it's ineffective.
<br />

<br />
I'm not trying to make you in anyway to practice kung fu. Kung fu is obviously not really for you. I'm just saying it seems you really don't know much about it and I think that if you really wanna have a debate on it you should do some research before you just flat out say it's ineffective.
<br />

<br />
Honestly, I have no idea whether or not they've been in real fights. I know Bruce Lee has. He always had a tendency to get into fights. Maybe resulting his background mroe thoroughly you can find out how studying Kung Fu actually affected the outcomes in his fights. My guess is that when he began to study kung fu he stopped getting into street fights, so that info that would help you might be a little difficult to find, but I say look for it anyway. 
<br />

<br />
By the way, when I say all of this, I'm not incinuating that any other martial art is ineffective. They're just different. I think maybe you should just be a little more open-minded to ideas and practices different from your own.

I'm not sure what you mean by that message. You have to MASTER the style before you can fight well? Sounds like a bad style to me. What about Jet Li and Jackie Chan? Bruce Lee was pretty good, but he studied things like boxing too.

What style(s) of kung fu are you talking about? Are you on the inside? Give us some insights. I believe Kung Fu is ineffective because I've studied it. I've taken a class or two in my day too.
<br />

<br />
Like I said... Bruce Lee studied a lot of non-kung fu styles too <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. Hell, he probably had a lot of raw talent and motivation to begin with anyway.
<br />

<br />
I'm open minded. I'm doing Tai Chi. I don't see it as an effective way of fighting though.

Debate? Sure, why not. You mentioned it. Let's go for it... hopefully it liven this post up.

Well what's wrong with mastering a style? How does that sound like a bad style.
<br />

<br />
Ya you're probably familiar with how Bruce Lee invented Jeet Kune Do which concentrates on gathering what works for you from different styles.

What do you mean by on the inside?

Well I think that everyone can learn from all the martial arts. Each have their own weaknesses and advantages. I try to have a more jeet kune do mindset, not saying that you don't.

That's probably true. I watched a Bruce Lee documentary and Brandon said that Bruce basically lived and breathed fighting.

Sounds pretty cool. Everyone has different fighting ideologies and opinions.
