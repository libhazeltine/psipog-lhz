			Here are some vids I found of google 
<br />
This one is a 13 minuete session of a guy losing one pound in a minuete from trying to levitate. It was taken off of a AAG (idk what that is maybe it was something else &gt;.&gt; oh well). Its long but intreguiging.
<br />

<br />

<br />
This one, real or not, kicks ass, I love it and looks very realistic and possible. It would take quite a bit of training to get to this state but it would clearly be worth it  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I find it amusing that every spoon bending video ive seen, its either obvious that theyre bending it using physical force or its not, this is one of the more obvious ones. Hes using his fingers to hide the fact that his thumb is bending the spoon, its also funny how the spoon bends exactly where his thumb is.
<br />

<br />
The crappy music, credits saying 'its not fake', and those bloody cutscenes of 'Will you believe?', just make me believe its all fake.
<br />
Must have taken a lot of thought though, hmmmmmmm.

			working at a magic store for a while, i can honestly say all of that is bull. The coins were metallic coins you can buy for a dollar that react to magnets. The spoon, was bent with the thumb. The folding bill was done with IT(invisible thread) which can be purchased here as well as see a clip of someone else doing it <a href="http://www.penguinmagic.com/product.php?ID=1144" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.penguinmagic.com/product.php?ID=1144</a>
<br />
As for the pencil...any psion who needs to put it on the edge of the desk needs to stop. Chances are he blew on it. I feel that these vids are a mockery of psion communities. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			i know its fake but the coins were awesome ,but still obviously fake...
<br />

<br />
but can anybody here actually imitate it slighty?
<br />

<br />
oh and the doller bill was obviously fake..in2 seconds he can strongly stand up a set of coins but he has a harder slower time with the paper i think not.

			Yeah, the first time I saw the dollar bill I was like &quot;I've seen that before&quot;  I actually saw it from illusionist somewhere.  I used to be a magician myself.   And yeah, I watched the spoonbending and is like, wheres his thumb?.  That's cool though.  Did you ever do any tricks yourself assassin?

			Wow. If you look at the dude's forearm while he is bending the spoon, you can see the muscle that controls the thumb move. Loved the coins though, cool nonetheless.
