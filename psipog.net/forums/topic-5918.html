			Hmm, maybe it was but he/she was scared of what happened, so his/her subconsious made it happen again and again.
<br />

<br />
Or you could have been thinking about that dream, and you didn't like what happened, and you were thinking so strongly about it that you dreamt about it again.

			Hi
<br />
This is definately weird. I think you should think about your dream. I guess dreams are something that your sub-cunscious makes up, just to reflect stuff or maybe to tell you something too. Of what i'm sure is that you can learn from your dreams. So in your dream you had to find the right way, else it wouldn't stop. Seems pretty obvious for me. It's like in many life-situations, too. You can't go on, until you've found the right way. 
<br />
I can understand you pretty good because i had similar dreams. They wouldn't stop until i found out what i was supposed to do.
<br />
If you get into these kinda dreams again, try out different stuff. Maybe do something that you think is fun. Make fun of the dream and see what happens. If you're not able to do that because you're not or not fully lucid, you should maybe do the same thing you did before; try to find out what you're supposed to do and do it. 
<br />
After some time the dreams stop or they evolve. Try to learn from them.
<br />
It's what i would do. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />
To the meaning of the dream or this kind of dream i would say it's like you're keeping yourself trapped for what reasons ever. Think about that.

			Never give in to your dreams, I said this once and I saw it agian. I think the subcounious as 2 mirriors, your counious reflects onto the sub-c and returns a change thought, and vice verse an.
<br />

<br />
As in dreaming over and over again I wouldnt know much over the following nights. But once in a while I'll wake up late at night when I was having a good dream, So I just wish I was still having that dream after I turn off my alarm clock and go back to sleep. Then POOF hehehe.
<br />

<br />
I did had this one really scary dream that said I was going to die if I didnt do something first....It was one of the first times I repeated the dream.

I'm glade that I'm alive.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
