			Is it possible to telepathically share a lucid dream with a pal in the same room? Me and my friend want to try it but I just want to see some feedback on the idea to see if we would be wasting time trying to do it.
<br />

<br />
Thanks very much,
<br />

			I can see why you posted this under telepathy, but this is a dream subject.
<br />

<br />
It is possible, as far as I know. I have talked to many people who have claimed to have done it. No way to really check, unfortunately.

			Of course you can check; all that would need to be done is to talk about it, or write down a description of the dreams and compare them. I know I've been in dreams with my friends/girlfriends/family/etc. a few times. It's not that wierd, but I don't know how you could consciously decide to do it.

			I meant to prove it. You kind of have to take people on faith for shared dreams. The only way I could think of would be to isolate two people from communication with each other until they had a shared dream, and then have them tell each other a password in the dream. They would then tell you each of their passwords, at different times. That's quite a labor intensive process. 
<br />

<br />
As for people over the internet who claim to have had a shared dream, you'll have to take them at their word.

			Well, yeah, but it's really not a big deal. I don't care about conclusive proof for a shared dream, more like we both sort of remember having a dream about each other and said &quot;hey that's wierd.&quot; Proof does not entice me.

			The reason I mentioned that is because PsiPog focuses on being able to back up paranormal claims, and I thought I would mention that shared dreaming is inherently hard to prove over the internet.

			I've shared a dream with a person before, although it wasn't very lucid.
<br />
I don't know how it happened either.

			Kay guys thanks for the help. I did some research and I believe a popular place to <span style="font-style: italic">meet</span> other people in shared dreams are known as the Lucid Crossroads.

			it is very possible, and as long as the second person is in REM when you try, they dont even have to be any good at lucid dreaming themself.

			i think its possible, one night when i slept with my girlfriend i had a dream and while i was dreaminig i had a dream with her inside, and i asked her whats shes doing there, and she told me that we have the same dream. it felt so real. when we were awake i asked her and she told me that she cant recall any of her dreams in monthes. 
<br />
maybe its just my subconsiuos fooling me.. but it can be possible. 
<br />
and in OBE i heard about a term called &quot;astral tempels&quot;
