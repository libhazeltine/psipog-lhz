			Ok i tried doing pk, and got it to move a bit today.  I had a controld environment.  Now this is where it gets wierd, i stop to let my mind rest a bit so i went to the fourms and was reading something someone had posted.  In my perifial vision i saw my psiwheel sping pretty at a good speed (its only like 2 feet away).  I look over and it was spinning then it slowed down and stoped.  My concultion is i was concintrating on my computer and so how that made it spin.
<br />

<br />
History: I was 100% computer person 95% of my time was devoted to computers until 2 days ago i got into TK/PK.  So a bomb could go off in my back yard and i would still be on the computer(meaning i could concitrate on the computer with no distractions).  Why am so concitrated on the computer well i am a computer programmer.  Not the best one so dont ask to build you a program.
<br />

<br />
The thing that irritates me is that when i actualy practice TK/PK i cant get it to go that fast. 
<br />

<br />
I think if i can concintrate so well on the computer if i could redircet how i concitrate on the computer to TK/PK.  Man that would be awasome.
<br />

<br />
Just if you are wondering everything was off A/C, fan.  The windows shut, the door shut.( I even tryed using my dorr as a hugh fan to see if it did anythin to it. It did not.)
<br />

<br />
I am so sorry my spelling sucks.
<br />

<br />
Wierd huh?

			copyed from topic called i need help and pasted here and it is my post.
<br />

<br />
ok my point of view that come to my mind so i dont know if it right or not but here it is 
<br />

<br />
if you saw your friend from far and you saw his sad face then you will be all the day sad and that saddness of him turned your day to be sad day but if you see your friend from far and he is happy he will turn your day to be happy day so what i mean is that you are get effected and are effecting on the surrounding things with aware or without aware so on other hand your em field is the same effecting and get effected by the surrounding objects with your aware and without aware .

			Well, this could happen because essentially it is your sub c who spins the psiwheel.  When you are focused on one thing, your sub c has an easier time &quot;coming to the surface&quot; and spinning the wheel.  I suggest to clear your mind and focus on your breathing when practicing psiwheel as I think that this will work for you!

Good luck,
