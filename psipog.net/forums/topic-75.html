			I hope everyone has enjoyed reading my construct flaring method.
<br />
 
<br />
<img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> But whats so kool about construct flaring, if the newbies can't make a psi ball! <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
    Don't worry kids, I have my own method for making constructs (a psiball for those who don't know what a construct is <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> )  First I get in a room that I have all to myself where their won't be any distractions.  I get in a good positiong and sit down.  I start to draw in energy before i make that psiball.  I fill my entire body with energy.  I visualize the sun sending energy to all parts of my body. After i do this for about a couple of minutes,  i place my hands in front of me and cup them.  I start to draw all the energy in my body(and I mean all of it)  into my hands and visualizing the psiball into the shape of a ball( of course!).  Incase any of you are wondering, after i empty all the energy i have in my body, thier is no more.  So what I do next is picture the sun sending energy into my arms only, then into my hands to then go into the ball.  I always keep the ball no larger and no smaller than a melon or mango. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />   Anyway,  I also try to use my sences.  For example, I try to feel my psi ball and try to sence a change in temperature.  A strong visualization is one of the best tools I have.  After a while you should have made a psiball and congradulate yourself!  your getting closer to learning construct flaring!
<br />

<br />
Be determined guys!  Don't give up too easily. try try try!

hope everyone learned something.  be aware of future posts by psiboy20 <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I found that when i'm trying to make psiballs I first, as you said, sit in a comfortable position. Then, i visualize that the air around me is filled with static, and is the color of whatever i want my psiball to be. Then, as i breathe in i visualize the blue energy filled with static going into me and then into my arms. Next, i cup my hand and visualize the blue, static energy into a ball the size of a basketball. I start to see layer and layers of in my ball so that when i put energy into these layers, they get REALLY tight. Then, when I can not let anymore energy in, i make the ball smaller and  then i have a psiball, very strong one. <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

Well...
<br />

<br />
You could shell them and keep them around for a while:
<br />
<a href="art-psionic-shielding.html5" target="_blank" class="postlink">Gnome's Shelling Article</a>
<br />

<br />
Also you can program them to do what you want them to do:
<br />
<a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html155" target="_blank" class="postlink">SunTzu's Programming Article</a>
<br />

<br />
And, when you get really good, you can make them visible:
<br />
<a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html106" target="_blank" class="postlink">Evan's Flaring Article</a>
<br />

<br />
Just to let you know i am pretty new too so i don't know much about this myself  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  I've just pointed you in the direction of these articles so you get an idea of what you will ultimately be able to do. But it's best to start small with just a psi ball before you get into programming and shelling.
