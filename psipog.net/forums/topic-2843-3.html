			Another opinion:
<br />

<br />
The next major step in &quot;evolution&quot; would be a spiritual revolution.  As individuals, we all have our own religious/spiritual beliefs.  But as a society, we are athiest.  I would go into more detail on why I believe this, but that would require me to break my own rules, and I wouldn't want to be a hypocrite <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

That gets me thinking on a few things:
<br />

<br />
It has come to my attention lately that evolution genetically isn't nearly affecting us as greatly as Societies Evolution, and Spiritualities Evolution. It would bring up a good topic.
<br />

<br />
Too bad we don't have an avenue at Psipog to allow us to discuss these things <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

			I agree with sheep when he says that it's not right to think that we're not evolving.
<br />

<br />
I think we're kind of de-evolving. (well it depends who of course) Most live in a world full of technology. Our lives are made easier by it. Imagine the computers we all use to go on psipog. Think of the monitors....your monitor shoots out light right? and the newer the monitor the clear and brighter it is right? So you probably sit kinda close to your monitor (depending). Well what's happening to your eyes? (I've noticed this in myself and I would be silly to think it's just me. I sit in front of computers, televisions and other electronic things that present pictures and images with descent/high resolution.) You're eye sight gets worse over time because your brain realizes that it doesn't have to have that good vision that it used to have. Our technology has gotten so advancd that it will be clear for us, instead of our brain changning the picture so it is clear.
<br />

<br />
Do you get what I mean? 
<br />

<br />
How about music? Most people listen to music quite loud. Why do people tell you to not blast the music? Because you eventually lose your hearing. Again your brain has realized it doesn't need that kind of hearing anymore because technology has 'supplemented' it with its loud music.
<br />

<br />
those are about the only examples I can think of and there are probably others I haven't noticed, but thats what I mean about de-evolving.

			I'm a proponent on realizing the affect of the mind on the body myself... While I'm inclined to agree with you, I have to disagree. 
<br />

<br />
The eye-sight and hearing loss are not genetic failures, but rather environmental ones. For example, I doubt your children will have poor eye sight because YOU stared at a computer monitr <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
However, I noticed something strange myself... Like I said, I am a proponent for realizing the affect of the mind on the body. My whole family wears glasses or should, under certain conditions. By far I have used the computer more than anyone... But my eye sight has actually IMPROVED over time. And I have noticed that I can improve my hearing by focusing on listening over the course of several weeks.
<br />

<br />
It's kind of weird <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, to conclude... If it's not affecting your genetics I don't think it counts as evolution and or devolution... Unless you are a spiritual biologist.

			Well you do have a point. I think though, that given enough time ti is possible that could happen. It takes thousands of years to evolve. Granted this would mean we would all still be alive and have not killed ourselves by dropping nukes on everyone. (I'm still hopeful that won't happen). Ya so we would need to have the kind of technology we have  (or better) in order for it to affect genetically over time.

			Try to remember that even speedy evolution takes thousands of years. Humans have been more or less the same since we first evolved (with only 'small' changes; cranial capacity has increased in the last 2000 years, for example), as have most other species. Psi would be part of this evolved state, meaning that the human race has had it for some time, and, on the whole, not known about it. You can't evolve to have something you already have (then again, maybe to enhance it?).
<br />

<br />
Survival of the fittest means that if some nasty predator comes along and starts gobbling a species up, the survivors of that species will go on to reproduce because either they can escape the predator, they don't live where the predator lives, or they are smart enough to defeat the predator. Therefore, in the majority of species, reproduction is quite alright with anyone, because since they are alive they must be the best, and will pass on good genes to their kids, who in turn will be good at getting away from the predator.
<br />

<br />
In human society, how would survival of the fittest work? Firstly, they'd have to attract a member of the opposite sex, so they have to fit all sorts of criteria in order to be attractive (height, weight, strength, intelligence, etc). This alone filters out the 'unfit' people -- those who fit evolution's built-in guide to the perfect partner to some extent are generally 'fit' people. However, the world is full of people who are 'fit' according to this, so in order to get a good mate, you have to be the best of the best.
<br />

<br />
In caveman days it meant throwing rocks at your rival until they stop moving. More recently, duels have been popular. Today, you're more likely to have to impress someone in ways other than killing your rivals (well, it was impressive when pointy sticks the cutting-edge of technology). So, you can do that by being smart, outwitting your rival instead of out-gunning them.
<br />

<br />
This is where psi might come in (I'm trying not to break the rules here, so I'm not talking about using psi in a more caveman way). Psi's a pretty impressive skill once you get used to it, so it makes sense that it could be used in order to say &quot;hey, look at me, I'm doing something he/she can't do, which means that I'm smarter then him/her, so sleep with me instead&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Or, then again, you could completely freak her/him out, and then they might start a middle-ages-style witch hunt against you.
<br />

<br />
Now that I've written all this, I'm not sure how relevant it is. Ignore it if it isn't.

			if Psi really exists (hello, it's the skeptic again  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> ), then obviously it'll be the  next step in human evolution

i'm positive about that

Doesn't survival of the fittest imply that those who are &quot;Not Fit&quot; will not mate? 
<br />

<br />
In the case of society today, especially in the industrialized countries, those who are 'Not fit' generally do mate <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. With the exception of extremely debilitating diseases.

Since most people tend to survive nowadays, humans depend on social and personal factors, or, in other words what we're attracted to and what we're told we're attracted to. There's dozens of factors that are decided unconsciously. Whether or not a person it 'fit' depends on individuals: beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

This brings up a few good points/questions about this topic.  Humans are now intelligent and capable enough to not have to adjust to their environment, but rather, adjust their environment to them.
<br />

<br />
If you recall correctly, evolved structures and behaviors evolve because they help an organism survive long enough to reproduce.  Since we're advanced to the point where we adjust our environment, there are other factors that determine whether or not we will reproduce.
<br />

<br />
Simply, these are personality factors.  Evolved psychological mechanisms.  Mating behaviors.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Evolutionary Psychology</span>.
<br />

<br />
Change in the body can be minimal compared to change in the mind.  The point being since we're always changing over time, but now we do not have the strong catalyst to change out bodies, then evolutionary focus will be on changing the mind.
<br />

<br />
But I digress: is psi the next step in evolution?  Only if it would get you laid (lol), but more appropriately, only if it would become an evolved psychological mechanism that would increase an individual's exclusive fitness, and therefore increase his/her chances of propagating the species.

that would never happen. evolution wont just stop  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> humans rely to much on there mind, they're going to keep getting smarter and more creative untill... well.... i dont know how to finish that sentence. I think that the human race will be done with before they get to know everything in the universe. 
<br />

<br />
And human brains aside.

-i think that since so many people are FAT latley americans will eventualy adapt with faster matabolisms or something that will burn those calories and help protien to be converted into muscle

<br />
-for the last 1500 years or so humans feet have been growing. concidering they've only taken about 500 years to go from womens everage shoe size of 4 to 7.. i dont know how this will end up.
<br />

<br />
yes it takes millions of years to evolve something like wings or to completley lose your limbs and be able to slither on the floor by contracting your muscles in certain ways but little changes dont take too long.
<br />
----
<br />
i dont think theres one step in evolution. When things change they change on a large scale. So these skills we're learning are probubly one of the many things out minds are only now letting us tap into. After all the human brain has been growing/changing pretty much non-stop for millions of years. Maybe it needed a certain amount of stuff in there to able to do this stuff.

			this may have alread ybeen stated but I'm too lazy to read the whole thing but I believe that the only evolution taking place or that has EVER taken place is us adapting to our surroundings like you would after you move into a new house or go camping. I believe that if monkeys were us before then they would not be around because if they were then they would have died out because &quot;evolution&quot; is nessisary to survive. (evolution in the sentence meaning adapting to your surroundings)

The next major step in &quot;evolution&quot; would be a spiritual revolution. As individuals, we all have our own religious/spiritual beliefs. But as a society, we are athiest. I would go into more detail on why I believe this, but that would require me to break my own rules, and I wouldn't want to be a hypocrite . </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

   Nah. We're going into alternate religions these days. More and more people are becoming atheist too. That's a good thing. Hopefully we'll all become atheist. The next step in evolution will hopefully be fully controlled by us.

   I believe that the next &quot;step&quot; in evolution will be controlled by us humans with genetic engineering. Atheism, superior humans, interfacing with machines and computers, so on and so on. I can't wait for it.

   I thought you didn't believe in evolution anyway.
