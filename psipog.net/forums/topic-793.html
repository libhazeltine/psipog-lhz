			<span style="font-style: italic">NOTE: First thing I would like to mention is that the title is not meant to offend anyone. Please don't take it personally. It is just a title to show that it goes into great detail on the subject. PsiPog does not support combat or does it like the mentioning of it either. Now that that is done, let us begin.</span>
<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Introduction</span></span>
<br />
If you don't know how to make a Psiball, then don't try to make a shield. Check out some articles at Psipog. I am not going over it, notice the title says <span style="font-weight: bold">'Mirror Shields'</span> not <span style="font-style: italic">'Psi Balls'</span>. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Common Uses</span></span>
<br />
Now that we got that out of the way, lets find out how we use this particular creation. Mirror shields <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">always</span></span> go on the outside of all of your other shields. Why, well, if you put one inside of a, say, a bubble shield. Whatever penetrates the bubble shield will reflect of the mirror shield, thus penetrating the bubble shield again. It is a two birds in one stone for your opponent.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Creating It</span> </span>
<br />
Now we shall cover how to make it. Firstly you need gather energy. This can be done by imagining a waterfall of energy pooling over you, drawing it from the earth through your feet, etc. Now, take a little while to get a strong feeling. I personally like to close my eyes. It helps my visualization process. After you have a good, strong feeling I want you to imagine the walls of a bubble building around you. Start it off as whatever energy visualization you use, then slowly let it fade into a hard plastic type. If you want to make it stronger make thicker plastic, if you are really an idiot and think a smaller one will be better, make the plastic thin. Now feel the sides of it, look through the clear glass, smell the plastic, and for gods sake(sorry to all who aren't religious) don't really do that. VISUALIZE it. Now that we have that, lets imagine a mirror (on the outside). You don't want your own psiballs bouncing back and hitting you. Once you got that you pretty much have your shield. I will go over programming just so you don't have to click your mouse a couple time back the my original guide.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Programming</span></span>
<br />
Now you ask,&quot; Ok, I have a worthless shield. Now what?&quot; Programming is what. Those who don't know how to program. Keep reading. Those who do, well, keep reading too. Now programming can be done in many different ways. 
<br />

<br />
*My favorite is to just tell it to do a certain task. I would say(in my mind),&quot; Stay together, Hold shape, and deflect all energy coming at me. When I say go down you go down, when I say go up you go back up if you are already up disregard this statement.....&quot; Anyways, you can go on forever like that, you shouldn't, but you could. 
<br />

<br />
*The second one is visualizing the programming. Like see it holding together as you walk around, see a little bubble that says,&quot; Go down.&quot; See it fading away. Then see yet another bubble that says,&quot; Go up.&quot; See it coming back. See it up and a bubble saying,&quot; Go up.&quot; Watch it stay the same, incorporate as many senses, as you can see im visual. If you want to add a cool sound when it goes down and up. See your self knocking on it and hear the knocking, feel the sensation in your knuckles. See the mirror shimmer on the outside. 
<br />

<br />
*Now onto the next, tactile visualization. Using feelings to program it, personally I don't use this but I'll try to explain it. Feel it there, being. Remember the feeling of solid, round. Incorporate that with the shield. Bring back the feeling of something going away and coming back. I don't think that is the best explanation but I tried for more info on programming go to the PsiPog.net Articles Section. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Conclusion</span></span> 
<br />
Making a mirror shield, as you can see, is not too hard. It isn't as easy as the bubble shield, but shouldn't be too hard to make. Have fun with this guide. Try not to have a reason where you need this(unless of couse, if you are having a psi ball war with a friend, tickly style). Now you just have to remember this G.F.P Gather Form Program. Gather the energy. Form whatever you are trying to make. Program whatever tasks you want it to do. That should be used for any form of energy manipulation. Until next time, thank you for reading. Comments, Tips, Thoughts would be appreciated.

			Thank you for the info. I will have a guide for all shields once I get done. Just put all of them together. That will be my next project. I will have to get to work on that. Lol, Psionics for Dummies. That would be a long long book.
