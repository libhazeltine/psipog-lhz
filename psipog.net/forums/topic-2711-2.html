			YOU IDIOT.  Why do you impersonate peebrain?  Now, whenever he comes into the Gabbly chat, his name is changed to &quot;Peebs.&quot;  I also know that you're the ONLY member here who impersonates other members.  That's right, I fully analyzed your specific attitude, personality, likely responses, typing style, etc.  I hope you realize what you're doing to psipog...Gabbly is a great place for members and noobs alike to congregate informally and chat without being restricted.  But I guess some attention fiend like yourself just HAD to take advantage of such a worthy oppurtunity...
<br />

<br />
P.S.  As a side note, you may or may not realize that so far, no one, and I mean NO ONE else has done any impersonating, even though YOU said it was apparently &quot;inevitable&quot; that someone else think up the &quot;genius&quot; idea of impersonating someone more deserving of respect...such as peebrain.  You really have no life except the computer...

All and all, I like what you said. BUT, we don't actually know how many others have done bad things on Gabbly. We are not on all of the time, and if there is an impersonator...we don't know who he/she is. And, after a while, history on Gabbly is deleted so you can not see what everyone has said. So, to sum up, the guy everyone is blaming for impersonation may not of been the only one to impersonate. 
<br />
Side note: Why is all the attention and respect given to just Peebrain, there has been others impersonating too, isn't that a problem? (not that no respect should be given to Peebrain, but others deserve it too.) 
<br />
Down note (I made it up): Is impersonating really that bad? It isn't really a giant problem. The only reason people put their names on there is so others can tell who that person is. That person was only having a little bit of fun...not much harm was done, I mean you guys found out it wasn't Peebrain anyway. As long as the person doesn't take it really far and impersonate for a very long time, a brief joke is fine. 
<br />
Fat note (I made that up too): Please don't argue with me, or at least don't use such a harsh tone as others have done in the past. I am not here to &quot;boil the stew&quot; ( <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> ) but instead to stir it and bring up different views/ideas. 
<br />
I am on no one's side, I just accept all facts. But, let's not impersonate others anymore please...to avoid dispute.
