			Psipog was a great place back in the day. Now it seems like the focus has shifted from psionics to mental retardation. I came back here recently looking for some real discussions of psionics, where view points come from experience. But now all posts are basically rants about the mind, ego and spirituality. Where every post is like some fierce cry for attention and acknowledgement of wisdom. These topics are paradoxes. If you are truly wise you will abstain from discussion as they only cause more confusion on the search for truth. All posts concerning these things are just one of the thousand artificial ways of looking at the truth, they are dregs on the path of wisdom. If you do not think they are true then do not accept them. They are like temporary ways of thinking which can cause more headaches and more suffering. My advice before I leave is that if you have any wisdom whatsoever then why expend on people who will not listen? If you want to have ultimate knowledge then why give your secrets away? Just listen to other people and learn, accumulate, and don't add more to the fire.

Wow, that's a lot of harsh words you speak. You are very interesting to me. You think the opposite of everyone. It is so interesting! 
<br />

<br />
Anyways, I disagree with a lot of it.

Ummm, let us think about this. We are here to learn and some are here to teach. Of course what you said is correct for someone who is done, someone who has reached the highest level. And those who have are non-existent. You don't see them here, because they aren't here. (Confusing yes, but ehh...) Discussion has it's reasons. If you complain about such a thing, then you are complaining about the whole existence of the Internet! (e-mail, forums, chat rooms)

Maybe for you. For the most part wisdom helps people...
<br />
Suffering is also a way to teach others.

The first thing I think of when I read this is, complete and utter greed. Are you kidding? How can you be so evil to hide information, information is for all. Secrets are for no one.

No. We are here to add more to the fire. I don't know who's side you are on. I don't know who's fire we shouldn't be adding to. Maybe it's yours but then you are completely dwelled within yourself to say such a thing. We do listen to other people, and then we respond to what they said. 
<br />

<br />
No path is right or wrong, there is only one path anyways.
