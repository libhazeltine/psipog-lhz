This doesn't make much sense to me, a force bubble usually is a construct designed to keep matter out, in other words move it.  And it most certianly requires a decent amount of energy.

Each to his own, but I have noticed if I don't shield I don't feel as well by picking up quite a bit of telepathic and empathic noise.

Yes I can feel knots and build ups, I try to keep them to a minimum, but they build up and I find that I notice them the most after I brush them out (sort of like a knot in a muscle...you can feel it, but you feel the effect of it going away much easier)

			Well for me it requires very little energy. Think of it this way, i'm constantly leaking out energy anyway thus reasoning for the lights flicking and the power outages, with this shield the best way I can describe it is like a soap bubble only much stronger. For other people the energy usage might be high but with the amount that I radiate anyway, doesn't matter, I don't not have any noticable drain period.

I see what you mean.  I'd call it a normal bubble shield.  Remember the type of shield doesn't mean it can only be programmed one way.  So you can program a bubble shield to do many things, bubble just refers to its shape usually.

			i use the advanced chaotic sheild, layers are in order from farthest out from my body to closest:  my first layer is a reflecting surface.  the second layer is a cloaker (i don't want things reflecting into the cloak sheild, and this makes me appear to only have the reflecting sheild).  my third layer is a resistance sheild, just a basic sheild.  my fourth layer absorbs any telepathic/empathetic messages/broadcasts that are meant to be harmful, like a filter.  the final layer is a marshmallow sheild that depaternizes psionic attacks and attack constructs.
<br />

<br />
the advanced chaotic sheild is programed to randomly switch the layers of the sheild around.  for example the first layer may shift to the fourth layer, then the second, then back to the first, then the fifth, ect...  on top of that each fist sized area of the sheild is a different type of sheild, so there isn't one attack that specializes in getting through, it would take a &quot;shapeshifting&quot; construct.  i know this may sound fluffy, but i got this type of sheild from an accredited site.
<br />

<br />
i also have two expanders and a stamper that follow me around.

			Never heard of the chaotic shield idea before...i'll have to think on it and test it out.  Problem with anti-attack shields is that you have to know how the attackers think...hard to get on this site which forbids combat talk.

Good plan, I personally love expanders, they are the coolest even if I don't use them that often.  They've only saved me some uncomfort once or twice, but I still like them.

this is true, that is why this sheild is beneficial, only skilled &quot;predators&quot; can get through.  and anyways, by the time they figure out how to, they either get bored since i'm not an easy target, or get intimidated (they see how advanced the sheild is, so they know i am advanced.)
<br />

<br />
i personally love expanders, they are very useful.  stampers too, but i never had to use one.
<br />

<br />
i can give you the name of the website (or a link) that talks about chaotic sheilds, but it will have to be in PM form since i think it is against the rules to &quot;advertise&quot; other psionic websites.

Yes, but the mirrored part would be ineffective, I'm just saying its pretty easy to scan for weak points of shields, much less ones that aren't enclosing.  I was just suggesting that a mirror shield that enclosed you completely would be more effective is all.

			I currently have 9 external, automatic shield layers.

The ninething is the absolute outer, and is meant for cloaking.
<br />
You must send back null signals if signals enter you, and keep the frequency levels so high or low that no-one can detenct.

My shields are probably quite astral, not very physical.
