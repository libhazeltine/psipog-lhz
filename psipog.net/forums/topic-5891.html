			Hi everyone. I have a question which may sound a bit stupid but i'm new to telepathy.
<br />
SO, is it possible to do telepathy with a person which doesnt know you are going to talk to him/her? I mean for example. I want to do telepathy with a friend but he don't knows anything about telepathy.
<br />
Could my friend hear my voice or is it impossible?
<br />
Thank you 
<br />
Bye

			I'm pretty sure that depends on how sensitive to psionics your friend is.  The more sensitive, the easier it is for him/her to pick up.  Does your friend practice psionics at all?  If so, there's a good chance he will pick it up.  But don't think that by just thinking at him telepathy will work.  It takes practice, and time.  You may need to start off simple with practicing shapes and colors...then by the time you get good at that, you may be able to send thoughts with more ease, enough to which your friend will pick it up (if he is sensitive enough.)
<br />

<br />
You could also ping him, which is sending something simple (&quot;hey!&quot;, maybe a pinch on the neck, ect...) with a burst of energy...We need some more information in order to answer this question fully.

<br />
I say yes you can.  I've been experimenting with people at work and I've gotten unfriendly people to say hi to me just by me thinking 'hi' at them.
<br />

<br />
(had to ping them a couple of times and it worked by the end of the day)
<br />

<br />
Also there's this friend who if I'm thinking about her or looking at her she looks back at me. Every single time. 
<br />

<br />
She's psychic but I don't think she knows it.  I bet she thinks it's a coinicidence.
