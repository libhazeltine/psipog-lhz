			this doesnt break any laws of physics! We use psi (energy) to push something. like the psi wheel for example. Thats so irrelivent. No?
<br />

<br />
oh i dont realy wanna say yes or no because i realy dont know you or your mom. it all depends on her reaction. if she's going to take you to see a psycologist over it... then, well... just dont lie to her face. lying is the last thing you want to do. Because if you do they're going to think that whatever is worth lying over is realy bad. Soo yah..

TBH I wouldn't tell your parents, because if you already know they'll then refrain you from practicing, you might lose the chance to learn psionics, which after all is perhaps beneficial.
<br />
Now on the other hand, if psionics is pure invention and bullsh1t (but that you can't know for sure now), then maybe you should tell them because they'll get you back on track and you'll stay in line with reality, instead of spending your weekends and free-time locked in a room trying to move things by the power of your mind, to eventually end up in a madhouse.
<br />

your choice.

wait until you can at least roll pencils.

and then dont prctice it exsesivly when they are home..... because when ever they walk in i lose concentration. Also my parents think it's all fake, so that doesnt help. <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />

Don't tell them if you think they won't accept. They may end up making you stop training psionics (yes, and this is happening with me, unfortunately.)

			It's not like you're coming out of the closet doing cart-wheels and wearing streamers. 
<br />

<br />
If you're 8~15, your parents are more likely to not take you seriously if you tell them you practice Psionics. That's not to say they won't interfere, they'll just believe it's another crazy phase. So if you're going to tell them, make sure you can at least roll something.
<br />

<br />
When you approach your more &quot;adult years,&quot; and you tell them you practice Psionics, they may be more open to it. They'll trust by now (hopefully), that you're mature enough to make decisions on your own. So even if they don't believe you, there's not much they can do. If you can't do a thing, however, Lord knows what they'll think.
<br />

<br />
All families are different of course, that's just a common trend I see. If your family is really close and open about things, you've probably already told them (or should). I showed my closest friend, and now I'm moving on to my brother. Eventually I'll show the whole family. Just tell whoever you think will be the most accepting, and move on from there.
