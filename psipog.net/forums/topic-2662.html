			I'm a musician. I'm also fairly new to this site as well. Not new to it's topics however. I Personaly have experimented with psi balls... I like to call them Chi balls. And have began deeper meditation into unlocking the flow of chi throughout my body (washing the chanels between my chakras). I Find myself in a major trance like state whenever I play my guitar or sing.  Loose myself so to speak. I also think that a person can focus their psi or chi into their instrument to play better. Has anyone felt intense psi energy while playing music. I want to get more into the art of unlocking certain types of pyschokenisis with the right sound energy behind your focus. I know that sound waves make up everything that's animated. By the atoms in their different states constantly vibrating. This also leads me to question. Could there be more effectiveness in psionics if you could tune into slower vibrations. Maybe even emmiting a sound from you diaphragm as you focus... This is all just pouring out of my head.. if any of this interest you or have something to share please do.. ~peace to all~

			I frequently listen to music while I meditate/clear my mind. It works extremely well for me. I tend to forget everything else and I try to focus solely on the instruments and I try to open my mind and I listen to every single sound. I tend to listen to instrumental music (mainly trance). I find it immensely easy to get into a focused state of mind with music, and I can often perform PK after listening to a quick 5-10 minute song. I've noticed if I try to command myself into a open mind, that it will not work and I often have to relax myself. If I just focus solely on the song, I can clear my mind extremely easily. I also find myself much more relaxed after a quick nap as well, and it is also easier to clear my mind.

			I always listen to music when I meditate.  My mind wanders a lot so having something to concentrate on always helps me out, and afterwards I have much more energy.  Especially if there's a lot of different instruments playing all at once.  Focusing on as many individual ones as I can at once usually helps me out a lot.  Similarly, just sitting with my eyes open, trying to focus on as many objects as possible with my peripheral vision also helps my concentration as well.
<br />

<br />
This thread's topic also made me think of something else... Has anyone tried vibrating air particles to make sound?  That would be pretty sweet.

Hey whats up. Im a musician too and i have to tell ya, i know what your talking about. Its not to the extent of playing better, but smoother movements while moving around the fretboard and the neck, your ears are more open, and you can hear everything (if working on a cover) as well as putting together an original.
<br />

<br />
I thought of messing with my sound waves, but dismissed due to, not wanting to blow my amp. I have a shitty pedal and now its starting to cut out for no reason at all. So i put that aside, ateast until i get better equipment. Try it out and give some feedback. 
<br />

<br />
I dont really meditate with music, my mind keeps constantly focusing on the music, and i find that the clear mind meditating is only the beginning. Sooner or later, you will have to meditate on something to acheive full effect. Its like clearing a pallet, and then painting something.

			thank you for the cool feedback... That idea about vibrating air particles to make sound... that sounds pretty cool... I'd have to focus pretty hard though... I wish i had the equipment to pull of some major sound waves... Right now I'm limited to an acoustic and my voice... I know that there is power in chanting... mantra-ing.. which would go along with sound waves... and as far as instruments.... well i know a jamba bongo circle definately puts me in the mood to meditate.. like some Tool sounding stuff... anyways.... keep posting if you think of anything else... I've aslo been thinking about the number 12 alot in coordination with frets on a guitar till you reach the open note... color wheel... zodiac... months... 12.. sound... color... and a full cycle.. all these things can somehow be connected with music..and I'm sure can unlock more doors which I would like to open.. ~peace to all~

			ya ya look for connections like that. Its all over music. Tool deffenatly has a kick ass sound. Heard their new song? Schwing! Bad ass shit. And if your into progressive with only minor scratchy vocals, check out symphony x. The song, The Odessey actually helped me with pk. And keep on playing!!

			this could be applicable.. I'm going to begin experimenting with vocal tones while making psi balls... and trying psi wheels... hopefully I'll find something that's benneficial.. I know many types of monks learn many different chants to alter conciousness... maybe something along these lines will go hand and hand with psi... ~peace to all~

			In my case, the amount of energy put out depends on the type of music. If I'm listening to something slow, like Final Fantasy piano music, I'm more relaxed and I don't get as much as energy, but it's easier to control and it flows better.
