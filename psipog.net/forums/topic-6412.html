			Since my first OBE my sences have increased dramatically. For example the last time someone threw something at me i heared it how it slashed through the air, i turned around and saw everything in slow mothin, i quickly lifted my hand and caught it. And the other day i could hear everything that someone was saying across the room while she was whispering. And if i close my eyes i can see a mental picture of everything, like daredevil could.

Plz tell me what is wrong with me...it is fun but it is scaring me

			There is nothing wrong with you. Just relax and learn how your senses work. OBE's can trigger many things in people, increasing their habilities is one of them. The real question you should do to yourself: how you gonna use them?

			The entire world should stop quoting Spiderman, right now. No offense, dude. I'm just kinda sick of it.
<br />

Anyways, do OBEs really do that? I've been trying on and off for a few weeks and I haven't really had any luck, but I did notice how my hands relax. Also, being able to mentally picture everything is just being able to sense things, basically. I can do it. It's how I play tag, eyes closed. My depth perception is waaaay off, though. I need to work on it.

It's a good saying that the movie stole from someother. Maybe you should stop watching movies? <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

Spiritual development can trigger many things. I never spected to feel my third eye doing TK, and now it seems I can see with closed eyes. OBE's is about lifting yourself over your physical limits, and that may build on youself. Can you see the connection between expanding how much you feel (senses) with lifting the physical barrier?  It's the same thing.
