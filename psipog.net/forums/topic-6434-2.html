Problems are in perspective. You don't know my problem first off. Second off, maybe my problem isn't much to you since you have a different perspective.

Once again, I'm in the process of deciding. I have been doing some meditation and was actually starting to feel better. But then I read this thread again.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Infact, every single thing you wrote was pure perspective.

There is nothing wrong with saying &quot;I love you&quot; to everyone. You shouldn't judge that. Those are my feelings, I brought them out so you could see them. Thanks for stepping on them. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			First, a therapist isn't always the best option. Heck, If I were to show one half of my life perspective they would go insane and jump the window. Some of them are very close minded regarding unscientific things that showing them first hand would probably give more problems to them than yours.

Second, it may put another problem on your hands: lack of confidence in resolving problems yourself. I consider that to be the last option always for me. But that's me.

Third, felix, I usually am very tolerant to people, but I stepping on people fellings for no good reason shows that you have a problem too. Needs some help with that? Or will you wait to find the same wall somefat guy found?

Fourth, somefat guy, I dunno what your problems is, but if you feel you want to hear a second opinion, PM me your problem. You are right you shouldn't try to hurt people, even over the internet. I did that once, not really on purpose and I didn't had the chance yet to repair what I have done. I think I managed to feel what the other guy felt due to it, and I woudn't mind going to hell if that were to stop people feeling the same in the future <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" />

Thank you, I don't even know you, but still, thanks.

I am being pushed inside whether or not to stay kind and generous or whether to turn and act like all of the humans I see before me. Derricktheone and Felix make me want to stoop to their levels of evil and inconsiderance. But you, you make me want to stay as the kind loving person that I have always shown to you guys. 
<br />

<br />
When I wrote I love you guys. I was really about to cry literally. It's a thing a haven't done in years of course. But this is just how much it means to me. And if you can't see that, or you think it is stupid, girlish, gay, whatever critiscism you wish to provide. Your wrong and ignorant. You have yet to understand how deep emotions flow and how we are all one, and how I care for you all.

			Dont listen to those guys. Love is universal. If people can show love for a pet in the short amount of time they have had it im sure its perfectly fine that you love a group of buddies you can share these psionic experiences with. For a lot of members, this is their main site, so its only natural to develop a connection to it. Its not girly to say I love you to a group of friends. In fact, it shows how much more of a man you are than they.

No, I do not need any help. I do think that people who believe that we must respect everyone's feelings in everything we do are hopelessly naive, though. Need some help with <span style="font-style: italic">that</span>?
<br />

<br />
I think I made it pretty clear that I've already gone through all sorts of mental and emotional crises, including, I would note, one or two that have made me cut off contact with the outside world altogether.
<br />

<br />
We're all trying to help SFG in our own ways. You're essentially sitting down and telling him, it's ok, your feelings are valid, you must follow your emotions, and so on. I'm giving him a good thump over the head and telling him to quit being silly.
<br />

<br />
And if there's anything that I'm sure you'll agree with, it's that we all have different, equally valid ways of helping one another with our troubles.

No, I don't know your problem and that's not my fault. You're the one complaining about a problem, yet how are others supposed to help you if you don't tell them what the problem is? How am I supposed to understand you're perspective if you don't tell me what that is? Don't cry about a scraped knee then run away when I try to put a band aid on it. You and I both know I would help you if you wanted (MSN  conversation ring a bell) so don't talk to me about stooping to my level.
<br />

<br />
Secondly, be yourself. Stoop to &quot;my levels&quot; or become &quot;like all the other humans you see&quot;. Stop deciding <span style="font-style: italic">who to be</span> and let <span style="font-style: italic">your</span> true self come out. Sorry if you were offended but in MY perspective of this world, your problem, whatever it is, is infinitesimal. There's almost nothing you can tell me to think otherwise. (Unless your entire family has passed away, and you have nothing, and nowhere to go, then I am sorry. Otherwise I don't consider much else to be TRUE problems) Also, no I don't think saying I love you is &quot;girly&quot;, I think saying it to someone who you've only talked to on forums for 3, 5, 7, months? is not <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> kind of love. (There's two widely recognized theories about love, one has 3 types and another has 7, none of these types would apply here) You greatly appreciate and enjoy talking to everyone, but you don't LOVE them. That word's meaning keeps expanding and is being used out of context much too much. That's why I wouldn't say it.

You have my Email

Heh, okay then. I understand you all now. I appreciate all of it. Derricktheone, I sent you a e-mail a day ago  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  I don't know where it went off to...
<br />

<br />
All of these arguments are quite interesting. Each and everyone teaches me something. 
<br />

<br />
Anyways, I have decided to stay. Although I am still aware of my failure and I will keep working on it. 
<br />
I have decided that no matter what I experience, I should look at it as a blessing, and learn from it. And that's what I will do. 
<br />

I thank you all for your support, whether it was from the harsh windy side of the mountain or the cool breezy side.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

True compassion is indistinguishable from true naivety. You maybe have learned some lessons, but you still have something to learn from that same lessons if you meditate upon it.

			you know sometimes it helps to realy step back from yourself entirly and just look into your life from another perspective. most of the time you'll find its not as serious as you once thought and you'll relise that if it has already happened then there... its happened and unless its worth fixing don't even bother. sometimes even if it is worth fixing its easier and better to just leave it be. think about it, do you realy think its worth giving so much stuff up over this?
