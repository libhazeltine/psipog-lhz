			im not sure if i made a shield or not. i was sitting contemplating on what my new shield to shied myself was going to look like and i read somewhere its better to have a 3 part shield. so i sorrta made a 4 i think. i made a shield with fire on top, ice on bottom, water in the middle, with a regular energy shield around the out side which i programmed to take on the properties of electricity.
<br />

<br />
im fairly new to this. but ive made shields before but ive never programmed them like this before and it was real vivid and soon as the shield was up my empathy wasnt as strong or maybe it was under control and i couldnt really feel energy surging through my body like i have been it felt like it also was under control and my head aches are going from severe to managable. 
<br />

<br />
guess the question is was i able to make and program a sheild?

			uhm i was programing it to help keep my empathy under control and outside energy from effecting me. also to be able to keep people from being able to tap my energy as well.
<br />

<br />
the fire was to burn any unwanted incoming emotions. the ice was to make it to freeze any unwanted or unwarrented energy from effecting me. the water was the core where all emotions or energys would be gathered to be fed to which ever side it belonged. the electricity type energy was to keep people from taping my energy.

			uh huh, but the elemental aspect of it dont make sense to me.......who dont cha just make it simple? 
<br />

<br />
elemental psionics are more to the combative side......like shields to protect yourself from an opposing elemental attack, blah blah blah......but  for shielding yourself from outside influence, just block all those &quot;fray ends of psi extending from your auric field&quot;

			Wouldn't the fire melt the ice, and the water put out the fire? I know...I'm being picky. All you really need is a good strong shield (all of the energy from those seperate shields combined into one) and then program it to block out any unwanted thoughts and emotions from other people. Should do the trick. I liked the way you made the different shields though, and their uses. Quite solid design actually.
<br />
I would say that it worked, but could be better.

			thanks Psi manipulator thats the answer i was looking for. the shield works and the reason it doesnt cancel itself out is because of the water in between. the reason the water was placed there was so that the fire wouldnt melt the ice. the flame was programmed to be hot enough that the water couldnt put out the flame. and the water was programed to be non-boilable if that makes anysense at all.

thanks for your reply.
