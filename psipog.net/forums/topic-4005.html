			I'm not so sure about this but I recieved massive deja vus because of these.
<br />

<br />
The first one happened when our teacher asked us a question. Some raised their hands and when I was thinking for the answer...deja vu vibe!...I don't know why but the same image came into my mind and then I realized that I dreamt about this scene before.
<br />

<br />
This happened to me twice already!

			Yeah, me too...

Too bad though...

But it sure will be fun if we knew which ones which...

(Starts thinking of the possibilities:
<br />
1. Get to know the newest jokes. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />
2. Get to the answers for the final exams. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />
3. Get to know how you die... <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

			This used to happen to me all the time when I was younger, but was never sure if it was actually predicting the future, or just coincidence. Eventually I think that I just un-tought myself to do this.

Which really is a shame

			I can tell a precog dream from a regular real feeling dream and I had a precog a few weeks ago about something personal. The people in it look about 1 or 2 years older so it's kind of wierd wondering when it will happen. <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

			I think the same thing has happened to me once or twice. One time I had a dream that I was at my friend's house (well, not really much of a friend, I hate him now. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> ). There was an image of him arguing with his mom, and his mom was sitting on a couch. This couch had a pattern that had blue angels in it, which was exactly what it was when I went there. And the exact thing happened, he was arguing to his mom. I faced major deja vu right there.
