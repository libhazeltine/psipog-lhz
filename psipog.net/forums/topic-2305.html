			Hello, at first I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Jarmo, and I'm from Finland. Couple of years ago, I heard a story from friend of mine. It told about some guy who made ring in string to go around his arms [which were like a big circle] [I know, I'm not &quot;the best&quot; in english, but try to understand me <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> ]. I knew my friend [his my best friend] told the truth, and I almost forgot the story, but few weeks ago we had few beers with my friend and discussed stuff what is going on on this world [World Trade Center crashes etc etc..]. I told the story to him, and he amazed <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> About a week ago, I started to google around internet and found something about telekinesis and stuff, after few searches more I found psipog [great site though!].
<br />

<br />
Okay, that's about me. My guestion is about OBE's, I was trying it out last night, and I think I almost fell to it, but suddenly &quot;dropped back&quot;, just don't know why.. It felt like my soul left my body <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> Should it be like that? If I success in it again, what for is OBE? Can I practice telekinesis in it or what can I do. I'm just curious, because I haven't found anything about that in your articles.
<br />

<br />
I'm really newbie, but after a first try in psiwheel [not like one in articles, but my &quot;own modification&quot;] I focused on to it, well, nothing happened, I almost gave up, but then a big bam was in my head and it spinned a little. I really was shocked, it felt really great <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> After that, it haven't moved any <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> Trancing out is the way I'd like to test it now, and it seems to be the &quot;best&quot; way to me atm.
<br />

<br />
Sorry for long post, but I had to tell about my experiences and stuff <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Great stuff it is really, keep up good work.

			You can create psiballs in OBE form, explore, interact with 'spirits' as some people call them. Some people speak of seeing people and things they don't see in the real, also can hear them and what not.

Though OBE may well take a while to get down for longer periods, *sighs* I am still trying at keeping one where im coherent, not just an odd feeling for a short while then a snap back.
