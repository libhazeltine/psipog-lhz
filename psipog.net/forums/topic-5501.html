			I've been reading a lot, and many people say they have &quot;a lot of energy&quot;, or they &quot;ran out of energy&quot;, and similar. I understand they base this on their personal feelings, but I was wondering: is there a uniform quantification of Psi, and a person energy levels?
<br />

<br />
If yes, how is it quantized, what is its unit, how do you determine the amount energy required for something, how do you read a person's energy level, etc, etc.

			the only 'measures' of energy (from the body) that i have seen were for chi
<br />
it is a subsonic (below hearing level) emission from your palm that they measured
<br />
i have also seen it in the form of heat (measured)
<br />

<br />
there is no official wavelength for psi, it has yet to be measured or studied to that extent
<br />

<br />
i believe the form that it emits in can vary, cause people who can flare a psi ball are stepping into visual light spectrum
<br />

<br />
as for getting drained, its like doing pushups, your arms still have the capacity, but your body is just tired
<br />
we may still have the energy, but we have been exerting force
<br />

<br />
hope this helped to answer your questions, with my limited knowledge on both psi and physics

			Science currently has no device to even confirm the presence of psi. It is beyond space and time, hence being able to send it across the world instantaneously. Only we can detect psi.

			We can not messure spacetime to the best degree none less have anything to say about psi being beyond space and time. There are evidence of things that go faster then light such as neutronios during nuclear reactions. Well not even that, its just that, its that neutronios tend to jump (across) space and time itself, its either jumping or going faster then light.
<br />

<br />
Spacetime is relative, gravity and light are relative. There are things in the universe that can detect psi energy besides us. None of us have room to say if we can or can not.
<br />

<br />
So I agree with you, science can't messure it currently

			you guys need to look into the experiments peebrain and others have been doing with scientific equipment. 
<br />

<br />
i don't have a link, but you can use the search engine.
