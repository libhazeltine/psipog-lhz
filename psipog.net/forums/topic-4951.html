			After reading through these forums, ive scared myself!
<br />

<br />
I thought i would try to see if i have any psychic abilities on my sister, and so all of last night and this morning ive been trying to make her have a shit. in my mind i was trying to make a mental connection whilst constantly repeating 'You need to have a turd.' It took about 14 hours of psy-chanting, but at 2.30pm EST i heard the bog flush... and SHE CAME OUT! She could have just had a pee i suppose, but we are really close, and im pretty sure i was mirroring her waves of releif that people have after finishing a particulary meaty shit, as i felt that post-bowl-movement aura of calm.
<br />

<br />
I know you people may be thinking 'coincedence', but it was VERIFIED. She was getting some cereal after lunch (she's fat) and i was chanting 'get milk out of the fridge' in my head, trying to create a similar psychic-bridge, and HOLEE-HELL she did it! I have power! But i promise to use it for good, and not for terrorising small babies at supermarkets.
<br />

<br />
To all you people who havent found their abilites yet, keep trying!

			Oh, gosh. You're pretty gullible. You suggested going to the bathroom for 14 hours? Most people go to the bathroom atleast 2 or 3 times in that time period. Also, she was going to get milk for her cereal anyways.

No, thats a lie. Dont be ignorant of special abilities. I know i have special abilities. Even at school i was way above other people in my class. I know this because i had special tutors for maths and english. And i know that i wouldnt have special tutors if i didnt have special abilities.

1. i take like 7 dumps in that time period
<br />
2. If somebody takes cereal, it's only logical that she takes milk...
<br />

<br />
You still think it was suggestion? suggest me into doing something then.
<br />
I think you are just trying to see if ANYONE is as gullible as to believe you have psi powers, because you could make somebody take a dump after 14 hours of chanting, or the getting the milk when she was having cereal...
