<br />

<br />
Question Uno:: My friend said to do DMILS, you have to know how it works (god, it is DMILS, right? If not, sorry because that's what I'm using for the rest of this post) to use it. SO my question is, how does it work?
<br />

<br />
Question Dos:: Can you lose weight using DMILS? (yes, I am desperate. Damn you people and your metabolism)
<br />

<br />
Question Three:: How long would the above take, and how would one go about doing it? </span></span></span>

			First off. Please, would you stop using that font? It's hell on my and others eyes.
<br />

<br />
Secondly, yes, it IS DMILS. Direct mental influence [over] living systems.
<br />

<br />
Thirdly, it theoretically IS possible to lose weight that way, but it's considerably more efficient to just work out, and it'll make you stronger and healtheir in the long run.
<br />

<br />
And regarding the knowing about DMILS and how it works, it's not ALWAYS needed, but usually helps you visualise better.

			It's mind over matter. If you believe you'll lose weight, if you have confidence that you'll lose weight, you will. But DMILS alone won't do shit. Your best bet is exercise and diets.
<br />

<br />
You don't necessarly have to know how certain things of the body works for DMILS to work. I don't know much about immunity and I've increased it quite well. Really, you mind already knows how to deal with it.
<br />

<br />
Intention, hardwork, and skill makes DMILS happen. Also those three things could be used in many things of life.
<br />

<br />
I'm sort of using this too on my weight, but I exercise daily..not eat right though and I've lost about 5 to 8 pounds in 2 weeks. I think that's grand progress for the fact I eat large amounts of non bad foods.
