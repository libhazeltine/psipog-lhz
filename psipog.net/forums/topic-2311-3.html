			if a friend leave you for something like this or for any other thing even if he close friend then you should know he was not close friend and it is better for you too to leave him or make him normal friend because he dont deserve you . you know true friends from hard situation then what about from that simple situation. (personal experience <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />)
<br />

<br />
no hard feeling you will face that sort of people every where and again and again so be sure from the true friends.

Then i showed him a psi wheel video with a glass over it. He used the same &quot;magnets explaination&quot; then i whipped mine out and showed him.
<br />

<br />
Didnt move that much, but enough to notice that i was the only one moving it. He was dumbfounded. Ill never forget what he said. &quot;man im gonna have to try that, because i just saw you move it!&quot; Great feeling.
<br />

<br />

<br />
What about the &quot;pre-demonstration&quot; feeling. How did everyone feel? I felt confident, which is probably due to me studying it and knowing more than he does about it, but right before i was going to show him, i started to shake. Like have massive tremor like shaking. I dont know what it was and have never experienced it before... did anyone else have this shaking?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I've shown two friends, the first, didn't believe it at all.. After I showed him, he said &quot;if you can do it so quickly, it can't be real&quot; (meaning I've only been at it 2 days). The second, called bullshit as soon as the wheel moved, and when it started to spin, he told me to stop a few times, and then flicked the wheel off the tack, and told me &quot;that's fucked up&quot;.
<br />

<br />
He was playing some games later that night, and I was practicing, I had some sort of tremor feeling in my hands, and my eyes, and the wheel wasn't spinning, it too was having a tremor kind of thing, and then fell off the tack. After that, I couldn't get any movement for a while.

			I am extremely passionate about learning pk/tk and would love to show my friends if i manage to learn. 
<br />

<br />
however, i'd be worried about how they'd react, considering the posts about people who lost their friends over it...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />

<br />
P.S. should i start by trying psiballs? 
<br />
or should i try to learn a specific ability ie. aerokinesis/electrokinesis, etc
<br />
... or do i need a natural ability...?

hmm just practice PK...
<br />
Aeorokinesis is just PK some air into a direction and electro the same but then with electronics.
<br />
Dont use those terms, its all the same: Psychokinesis
<br />

<br />
Start with psiballs and read the articles and learn the skills you like, read and make your own choice

No. Actually, they probably think that it is demonic or satanic or something retarded like that.

ok, i tried the psiwheel last night and it only moved at the strangest of times. for example, i would balance the paper on the pin, leave it for a few seconds and then place my left hand besde it, and it moved. 
<br />

<br />
i think it might have been because it wasn't properly balanced, so my (very weak) powers were just able to balance while gravity was not. 
<br />
is this theory possible?
