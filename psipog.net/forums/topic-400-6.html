			uh... I was simply saying that porphyria creates a vampire like appearance, I.E. Red teeth and eyes, blisters all over, and sensitivity to the sun, all of those are often associated with vampires(obviously blood-drinkers would have red teeth)

Also there is catalepsy, and rabies,

I found this one faq that has some hilariously stupid questions on it, like, &quot;can you really kill a vampire with a wooden stake to the heart?&quot;

But most can't be hurt by showing light on them and flashing the cross.

You can blind them, though.

I still stand by the 99% thing, it's a genetic defect those 1% are.

You can kill humans with those methods, vampires are pretty much humans, just a little different. If you can kill me with a stake, I'm sure you can kill a vamp.
<br />

I think the 99% versus 1% is pretty close to the truth.

@WhiteRaven: I was merely pointing out that there's a lot more to porphyria, so it could be held against vampiric symptoms, and psi vampires btw hardly ever have (much) trouble with the sun.

			Meh, they wouldn't have used the energy anyway, Jeremy. And it's not like glucose energy either. It's apparent sole purpose is to produce psionic effects.
<br />

<br />
Although, if enough was taken, the body might use up a lot of energy to replace it quickly, which would result in fatigue. Small amounts will hardly effect a person though. Unless they're sensitive.

<br />
How could you possibly know that?  I've yet to see any studies that attempt to explain the purpose of auric energy, so unless you can show such evidence it's much more likely that you are wildly guessing at what such energy's uses are.
<br />

<br />
WhiteRaven: Psi-vampires supposedly require stealing energy from others (personally I think that's bull) but regardless of whether you believe in psi vamps or not, the act of psivamping does not have anything to do with need.  It can be done for fun, unconsciously or, in the rather fictitious case of psivamps, out of need.

did you suddenly scream, &quot;I'M ALIVE!&quot;? if you didnt i would say it wasnt being a vamp but one big flaw in there whole &quot;psi for life&quot; story is how did they survive before they used psi? they didnt always use it so therefor i agree with thanatos....

Although, in my opinion, if psi was vital to life, medical science would've picked up on some &quot;unknown mechanism&quot; involved in biological systems.
