			I had a dream which was a lucid dream in which I learned telepathy, it was very real. Then I continued my psi ball practice (I have been on it for a week). Then tried to make a shield, although I don't know if it worked.
<br />

<br />
And then I was eating with my dad, and I felt a vibration on my leg, which I thought it was the celphone since I have it on vibration mode. So I took it out and nobody had called me, I put it back. 1 minute later, someone was calling me.

Precog?

			precog? possibly. 
<br />

<br />
there is active and passive(can be attached to prima instincts, gut feelings etc), as stated above. there are also 2 different forms so far...one is through intentional sight (i.e. willing to see, to use precog) and the other is feeling psionic feedback. hard to explain, ill get the guy who discovered this theory to explain...
<br />

<br />
basically imagine a bats' sonar. it bounces off everything and returns within milli-seconds. its like that but in reverse...like everythings supposed to be...relates to fate. its meant to happen, your feeling the feedback off it before it happens....gah i suck at explaining...

I'm pretty sure that that's called clairsentinence.  I don't know if you use that term around here, but it is when you feel something physically hinting you in on something that will happen, or maybe even something that someone is thinking about.  Don't get mad if I'm mistaken, this is just what I remember.
