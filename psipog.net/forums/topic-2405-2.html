Bout fucking time someone sees things my way... the manly way. Seriously.

You can't stay away from the peeple you know for just a little bit and do other constructive things online? I can understand having one for you know, people like us, because we have to stay connected. I guess it's a good way to do such. All of us come from different areas. But all the idiots I know have a myspace so they can show how boring their lives are in any way possible.

I cant stand attention whores because you know damned well that the average middle school/high school emo would beable to kill themselves if they really wanted to.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

i understand why you feel that way. i know a few people like that and i feel bad for them that they have to do things like that to get attention. 
<br />
the one thing i try not to do is generalize, so i wouldnt automatically come out and say that all of them are depressed. i mean, to some degree most of the world is depressed, they just happen to express themselves more. im not going to condemn someone right off the back because they express themselves. 
<br />
yes it may get a little annoying after a while, but thats how they are. they're not hurting anyone (as far as i know) and they're not fucking up my life or anyone i know so i say let them be who they are.

			Man this conversation is purely delicious, each group attacking one another, mmm the ignorence. I'm sorry but listen to the insults your throwing at people who merely have it? Why do I have one, to keep messages since so many of my friends use it also my Ex-Girlfriend (when we were still going out) kept pestering me to make one so one day I did. Seriously though &quot;pussies&quot; &quot;less manly&quot; lets keep it civil, people can get offended who use myspace more frequently and for more purposes with such direct insults, if not this thread probably should be locked for if not it would probably encourage flaming.

wow ok. do you feel manly by saying fucking goddamn nation full of pussies?
<br />
you just made yourself look like a total FOOL. Why does it matter you to whether people get myspaces? it your life really crippling because other people have myspaces? yes i agree psions need to stay connected, but you know what, people that lives two blocks down from each other need to stay connected. granted i go to people's houses rather than have a whoole conversation on myspace, but thats what makes us human. human in the sense myspace offers people connection to the outside world. to a world where they feel comfortable in because they talk to people they feel close to. it is basic human nature to feel wanted. you may not necessarily feel that way, but you don't have the right to take that away from anyone.

			The only reason I got a MySpace was because all of the on-campus girls here had one. Unfortunately, they blocked MySpace from the school's PC's, so now my MySpace almost never gets used (I can only go there on my dorm PC). But, like PantsParty said, I see most of those people all the time during the week anyways, so it's kinda useless then, and during the weekends, I have Yahoo! to chat with my friends. I did use it to get in contact with a friend from high school though.

			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
Alright, I'm quite sick of hearing the insults. This topic has ran it's course. Please try to refrain from posting personal attacks about each other. Try to express your opinion is a respectable manner next time. I'm locking this thread. 
<br />

<br />
I would like to thank the members who tried to prevent this earlier in the thread. We need more members like you. Thanks for helping out.
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />
- JoeT
