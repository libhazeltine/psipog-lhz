			Hello Everyone,
<br />

<br />
I decided that it would be in the benefit of everyone to hold a regular practice session in the psipog practice room #projection on IRC. 
<br />

<br />
The practice session will be three times a week: Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at 12:30PM - 1:30PM (Pacific Standard Time, which is the same as <a href="../est.php.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">3:30pm - 4:30pm EST</a>). They will average at least an hour of practice with one or two breaks in between.
<br />

<br />
----
<br />
If you don't know how to get onto the chat, please view the chat section of psipog: <a href="chat.php" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/chat.php</a>
<br />

<br />
---
<br />
A client you can use to go on the chat is:
<br />
Mirc: <a href="http://www.mirc.com/get.html" target="_blank">http://www.mirc.com/get.html</a>
<br />
-or if you have a mac-
<br />
<a href="http://www.snak.com/" target="_blank">http://www.snak.com/</a>
<br />

<br />
----
<br />
Since this is in the telepathy section, can you guess what we'll be doing?! That's right, turkeys, Telepathy!
<br />

<br />
If you don't know anything about Telepathy, please read the telepathy articles:
<br />
<a href="../articles.html" target="_blank">articles.html?cat=101</a>
<br />

<br />
There WILL be SOME instruction during the practice sessions, however, Do not expect to be &quot;walked&quot; through everything <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
I hope you can make it out <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.

			<span style="font-weight: bold">BEFORE</span> SheepKing's practice, i am doing a follow up practice as well.  We will do a quick energy manipulation warm-up and then jump right into telepathic practice.  Here are the details:
<br />

<br />
Who: Anyone who can access the chatroom (must be a member of psipog for 2 weeks)
<br />

<br />
What: Telepathy practice
<br />

<br />
Where: In the Projection room at the psipog chat
<br />

<br />
When:  Tuesday and Thursday: 11:55-12:35 (GMT -6 / Central time) I cannot do Saturdays and these times are a couple hours after SheepKing's practice.  
<br />

<br />

<br />
Everyone is welcome.  I suggest you read a couple of the <a href="../articles.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">Articles</a> on telepathy before you come.  I am not there to teach someone who is completely new to telepathy.  I will help with techniques and give tips but i will probably not teach from scratch.  Anyway, look forward to these dates and mark your calendar.
<br />

<br />

			if you guys are lazy, you are wasting your time with psionics.  Practice takes time and energy and if you are lazy, what is the point of it?  Practice once and then forget about it?

			Well, in all seriousness though:
<br />

<br />
Sometimes even _I_ am not there, and at those times I wish I had a gun to shoot myself in the foot. Right now i'm doing a crazy overhaul to many things in my life and am &quot;groggy&quot; becuase of it, so if I don't show up, wait a little while, like 10-15 minutes. If others are in the room follow the link and pick out a game to play until I get there. If I don't show up after that, feel free to leave, or continue practicing.
<br />

<br />
For the most part, I WILL be there every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Slip ups aside!

			The problem wit this is 
<br />
1. some people dont have irc
<br />
2. some people arent registered on the Main Psipog site
<br />
3. some people arent registered on the Main Psipog site for 2 weeks (ME)
<br />
4. Bad time for Pacific  because of school (ME AGAIN)
<br />

			Numbers 3 and 4 are reasonable excuses.  Me?  I want to, I turned up last night and had a go with a few people.  I haven't been able to do it recently because I've had a hard time trying to find a way to keep my family from disturbing me!  It is not a convenient time, but oh well.

			Do you think it would help if I moved it Forward a couple of hours, or if I moved it backwards a couple of hours?

Also, I think most people ARE registered at least for two weeks. And if you are NOT registered, get your ass registered NOW hehe.
