			I did a little experiment, for the last few days been having some difficulty with spinning on the psi wheel, this evening ran across a post on cleaning our energy fields, can't find it again but basically salt is a good energy collecter and a rattle around the body helps to even the fields.
<br />

<br />
I tried this for the hell of it, thinking that it probebly wouldn't help but went what the heck since nothing to lose and possibly gain. Let me tell you, it does work quite well, I put some salt on my hands and all the energy that was sticking to my hands disapeared. Including a couple of psi balls that were badly programmed that just kept sucking my energy. As for the rattle, it cleared up the tangles and I found that I could manipulate energy through my body again.
<br />

<br />
When I felt the results, I tried the psiwheel again, and it was unbelievable the difference that doing those steps made, plus my sensitivity to the energy flow increased by about 10 times. 
<br />

<br />
If you are having problems, I would suggest trying this, it helped me a bunch and could very well help you out.

			I think you just had a placebo effect psi is spiritual energy I don't think it can get amplified or collected that easily.

			Yes but there is a theory that I sort of believ that says pk is made by the electromagnetic pulses in the brain. Pk isn't spiritual. Psi energy is a different matter and I won't try explaining something I don't fully understand. 
<br />

<br />
Anyways...it, in theory should inhance the capability of the brain if certain needed vitamins and what have you are in sufficent supply. This, in effect could make you better at pk.
<br />

<br />
(edit) worth a try, I have vitamins sitting on my bathroom side...

			I was wondering what chemicals have different effects on psi... (btw, I'm new ^_^)
<br />

<br />
I would assume that natural food and water is best (since it's obviously there for a reason) and that artificial chemicals can be quite destructive.
<br />

<br />
If anyone could post their diet in relation to their success with psi, this could be valuable information.

			There are some that say doing pk depletes your potassium, and suggest eating bananas before or after practicing.
<br />

<br />
Aside from that, I don't think it matters that much what you put inot your body, as long as you eat at least some healthy foods. I had Wendy's for dinner and half a bag of doritos for an after dinner snack, and I seem to be doing ok.
