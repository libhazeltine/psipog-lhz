			it is potentially possible but again would need to be a master beyond our elite psions here.

You would be better off having a shield that absorbs the pain of the punch and if your really good, also begin the healing process right then in there, or even better yet just use a cloak and avoid attention.

Its called a force bubble, there is an article in the constructs section on psipog about them.  Very fun to make, you must have skill in macro PK to make them.

duh, i don't think self defence topics break the &quot;no combat&quot; rule, au contraire, it supports it...
<br />
Think about any shield, ok some are used to filter &quot;noise&quot; but youalways need to be preparedfor hostile activity even though it may be cause without express knowing of the actual &quot;attacker&quot; (that sounds wierd...)

The shiled ENtoMT was asking about is known as the force shield. Correct me if I am wrong. I believe pk is required for it.

			and chill out psi_manipulator, ever think of the possibility that we may have different interpretation on what is consider combat. I don't consider straight shielding as combat whether it's to filter out mental noise, emotions, or just plain holding psi in. However, to retaliate in any kind of shape or form would be combat in my eyes. How about your interpretation, lets be logical and reasonable here.
<br />
P.S. Is it just me, or are tempers flaring quite heavily on these forums nowadays?

			whoa, whoa, I think you got the wrong end of the stick. I was just pointing out that shields wouldn't be against the rules because there are articles and topics on them. And a bumper shiled isn't really that much to do with combat. So I don't think I have anything to chill out about since physcial shields have been talked about loads. It's just a force shield, so before you go telling ENtoMT that he can't have this topic, you should have a clear understanding of what a force shield is about. The topic is fine. I don't consider straight shielding combat either, hence the term &quot;shield&quot; to defend, not to attack. I share the same interpretation as you, I just think you didn't read my post right...

As for the punch  and the shield block I personally would think be better cloak or just absorb the force by slowing it down , a complete block would imply having the equivelent of a brick wall around you hence the force bubble and thinking of it as a form of combat because if someone tried punching that, they end up hurting themselves which is where it's kinda like a passive retaliation. I hoped that cleared up where I was thinking combat from, now as just defense and no way in hell can hurt some one in any form or shape then I'm fine with it...

			hmmm... I'm not sure whether that would work for every situation though MarcusT. If a random man came up to your car and hit it with a bat, then put the bat down and punched it with his fist, broke his fist and went unconcious, would that be classed as attack on the person hitting the car? Attack has to be the attacker purposly attacking the victim. In the case of the shield, the person being hit is the victim, so therfore, I wouldn't consider that attacking someone. It's their fault. And, In my opinion, they deseerve a broken fist for hitting someone first, I never hit first, whatever. Its' just bad manners <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
But anyways, that's just my opinion, and I respect yours.

Exacvtly, even more, if someone punchs you in the face, and they hit your teeth, that someone may hurt himself, i don't know, maybe cut his fist's skin, anything, and evidently (sp?) the one that's being hit isn't attacking him, nor is he acting within &quot;combat activity&quot; (of course he is involved in a combat situation, but you know what i mean), he's merely being punched!!
<br />
that's why i don't think force shields are combat material.

the ignorant has spoken.
