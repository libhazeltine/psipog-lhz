			Name calling is immature. Dont call skeptics or beleivers &quot;morons&quot; and hate them. No, my topic title was not your not wasting your time practicing this &quot;PSI&quot; your wasting your time name calling and saying &quot;prove me there isnt PSI&quot; Well, a simple answer to that is, <span style="font-weight: bold">You cant prove a negative.</span> It does not go both ways. Prove me there isnt bombs in iraq. (Rhetorical)
<br />
Above our post it says &quot;Be intelligent&quot; you cant be intelligent calling someone a stubborn moron. And please please dont hold those fake little conversations with yourself, you and the skeptic or you and the beleiver, obviously your going to win... and i respect what you do &quot;PSI&quot;, im not telling you to stop, I am not shoving any therioes down your throat like most of us like to do, including both of our skeptics and beleivers. When you guys say things like &quot;sorry or angry for nonbeleivers&quot; thats just saying &quot;your wrong im right&quot; which isnt very opened minded, if you tell a skeptic to be open minded, be open minded for the skeptic, goes both ways that time, so if you tell a

beleiver to be open minded, be opened minded for the beleiver. Uhh, i tried to keep this short, but i was sick of the stuff getting posted here like that.

If you want to debate, dont call people names, thats childish.

			Hello BFIGHTER,
<br />

<br />
I agree with you that stating personal attacks against someone who disagrees with you is indeed immature. However, please don't neglect the statements made by skeptics towards &quot;believes&quot;. You can't point the finger at one particular group. Also, I don't believe I've seen the majority of our members stating &quot;Prove to me that psi isn't real&quot; it's normally &quot;Prove to me that psi is real&quot;.  
<br />

<br />
Respect should be giving by both sides of the discussion. At many times, frustration takes over and personal attacks occur. It's always good to have an intelligent discussion, just leave the personal attacks out of it. It ruins the discussion. This applies to everyone.
<br />

<br />

			i agree.  But if a skeptic is pissy towards me, im not gonna play a fairy queen and be nice to them.  If they pick a fight with me, i will fight back.  If they make personal attacks on me, i will to them.  They choose the ground.

			Hehe, I tried convincing someone, somebody kept butting in on the conversation saying &quot;YOUR A LIAR AND A BULLSHITTER&quot;.
<br />

<br />
In retrospect, it's kinda funny, cause that's really all he ever said. He didn't give any points as to why psi doesn't exist, why I'm wrong, but just flat out said that I'm wrong and that I'm a liar.
