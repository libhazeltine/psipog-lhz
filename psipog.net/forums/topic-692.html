			When I try to roll/slide things if there is a pencil or something nearby it seems to move and I can only see a movement in the corner of my eye, and when I try to move the object that lokks like it's moving it won't even shake. Is this just my eyes like hallucinating because I'm only focusing on the pencil and my mind tries to remove everything around it? Thats just my thought, I would like to hear suggestions.

			When looking at things through the 'edges' of your eyes (circles can't have egdes, XD) - or, your eyesigt, things tend to wobble a bit...Try looking at people out of the edge of your eye - you'll notice it...

Get a videocamera if you're unsure about it.

			It is most highly probable that it is imagination. I know what you mean, and I've had it before as well. When you are concentrating for awhile, your vision will sometimes play tricks on you. You will see movement, that isnt really there.

			I have had this happen to me too. It kind of helps me because it lets me know that PK is real. Once i was trying to move a straw and the psi wheel

			this has happened to me before. im still stuck on the psi-wheel <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> but decided ot do an experiment. i lined up 3 psi-wheels in a row and then concentrated on spinning the one closest to me, it did eventually, but the other two started spinning abit before... weird. it seemd like i had more control on the middle wheel...whatever.

			i have the same,.. that shaking stuff.
<br />
But only with the object i concentrate on.

<br />
My thoughts about it, i think its indeed that my eyes plays trics about it or its a positive progress in learning pk.
<br />

<br />
Two time my straw rolls fast off the table..towards me.
<br />
I think thats geisting,.. but i'm not sure.
<br />
Maybe its the real pk.... who can tell.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

According to my experience, what is interpreted as hallucination is often a visual perspective of the reality that we are not used to decipher consiously. We don't know to what part or what aspect of reality it refers to so we discard it as junk. Your eyes are telling you something, don't worry about what a camera would revel as your eyes can see things that a camera won't see. If you strongly feel something move, then you shall stop thinking it dosen't and train your vision to reveal what is moving. It's probably not the object himself but around or in the object. 
<br />

<br />
Just a tip
<br />

<br />
By the way, I can see waves, clouds, smoke and tiny sparkle when doing TK. I'am not the only one, It's a perspective of reality that is very helpful for PK.

Really, and I thought I was the only one lol.  Anyways, yeah, I noticed that I see that way too.   Is there anything I can do to make that increase my pk or help with practice?

			Of course, it takes time and practice to let your brain analyse the patterns that correlate with tk movement.
<br />

<br />
Two tips :
<br />

<br />
- When an object move by TK, it's reflection of light is different than if it moves by other means. Try to let your brain analyse the differences.
<br />

<br />
- You can associate visual perception with physical feelings. It helps to be in tune with the target.
<br />

			My friend had a problem with telek. Everytime he focused on one thing something else in his perifferal (Can't spell right) moved. But it wasn't out of the &quot;corner&quot; of his eye. Just something he wasn't looking directly at. If that's the case then just keep practicing. Tell your sub concious that it only needs to move the thing YOU want to move.
