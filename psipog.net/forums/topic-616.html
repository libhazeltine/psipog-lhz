			this technique was an accident but it apparently works for me.
<br />

<br />
if i want to get a temporary boost to your level of psi sensitivity, (just feeling. i have almost no psi vision unless i have my eyes closed) i first draw up the image that my hand is alive with purple fire (feel the flame and the heat). purple's just my colour of choice cause to me it represents power. once the fire is strong to my likeness, i then set the rest of my arm on fire and have it proceed to my shoulders and then to the rest of my body.
<br />

<br />
once i am incased in a fireball, i then start sending out tendrils of fire in every direction. and have them return. kind of like a sun doing sunspots. after about 1 minute of flaring, i extinguish the flame all at once. if done correctly your arms and face will tingle as if you have just got out of a cold shower into a desert. (odd explanation but it works for me.)
<br />

<br />
this sensitivity can last for as long as 30 mins. maybe longer. but you will be able to feel close proximity psi. i had a friend make and toss psi balls at me. i could feel them coming and caught them and sent them back. 
<br />
the most use i got out of this is sensing my shields. i like to feel my psi working. i can rarely feel my shields but with this, they are as clear as day.
<br />

<br />
according to my friend, others can feel the fire tendrils. i've caused a bit of confusion in my class with this. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
one word of advice. the technique works best if the flame is a flame of your favorite colour (or very similar)
<br />

<br />
mine's black but a black flame is very hard to visualize for me so purple works just fine.
<br />

<br />
questions? comments? ask away!
<br />

<br />

<br />
EDIT: i've had a comment that the tingly feeling also is combined with a feeling of weightyness or tiredness. (scuse my bad spelling.)

<br />
I tried that 2 days ago, i just thought it would be a nice exercise to get my hands filled with energy, i felt the flames and my hands were warm.
<br />
my sister (12) felt them but my parents didn't, parents are christians and very skeptical so they dismissed it as body heat.
<br />
I think my sister is sensitive for psi she could also feel pressure when i let her feel a psiball.

Apparently there's at least ONE person in your house other than you.

Maybe you could teach your sister, or just point her in the right direction, and if she needs help, give it

			just out of curiousity - how long were you practicing with psi before you got the flame exercise working?

			Sounds like a good way to get rid of constructs in your field too!
<br />
I wonder how this affects sensitivity...perhaps it &quot;burns away&quot; emotions, thoughts and ambient energy around you, so when they come flooding back in from further away, you notice it more?

But in response to Vladimir, i just think its just another way of extending your shield to sense stuff around you. I'm sure someone could use the same visualization to form telepathy connections and whatnot.
<br />

<br />
Actually, i ought to try that...

			with regards to the_artfuL_dodger's question, 1 1/2 to 2 years. for one year was practicing something similar to this, but called a different name. discovered psi in june of last year. ( i however, don't practice on a regular basis) the one year under a similar style counts to the 1 1/2 to 2 years.
<br />

<br />
to answer the other questions, i really have no idea how it works, but it does. i discovered this technique after a friend and i were practicing sending psi over distances. i tried to send a purple flame at him but with no success. then i had the idea of wrapping my left arm in flame, then sending it to him. THAT worked really well. after practicing with my arm on fire for about one minute, i started to get a tingly feeling in my left arm. my friend, who also practices reiki, was interested and started to &quot;probe&quot; my left arm with psi. i felt exactly what he was doing.
<br />

<br />
i eventually started to experiment with this and tried the whole body fireball. i am still working on it. my current project is attempting to feel psi at a greater distance.
<br />

<br />

<br />
seems that siblings may be more sensitive to psi generated by their brothers or sisters. my sis can feel my energy a room away and she started not a month ago. my cousin has been doing this as long as i have, and he has a hard time feeling it. (then again, he wouldn't notice a tiger even if it bit his ass.)
<br />

<br />
with regards to the hidden, i tried an empathic connection with my reiki friend using the fire tendril technique. he said it burned. that may be because i pushed to hard or something, but my empathy is still in the larval stages so i dunno. it would work. you might have to be a bit careful however.
<br />

<br />

ps. the nac mac feegle rock. read the new book, &quot;hat full of sky&quot;?

			Or maybe your friend is extra-sensitive.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> or maybe i should try this a few hundred more times. One or the other. Either way I love this technique, its the only thing that works better every time I try it.

			Hmmmm this techneque worked well for me, I've been experimenting with making a larger area away from my body though I can only stretch it about a meter away from my body unless i focus it to my arms or one area of my body. I wonder what would happen if you engulfed a classroom at school with it... could work as an early detection system too if you could spread it out that far. ((Please pardon my spelling... I'm not all that great a speller.))

			Actually, one of the first psi exercises I started doing on my own was like this, but I just kept it around my hands and used it to practice gathering energy quickly.  That helped a ton with making and programming psiballs.
<br />

<br />
I just tried your technique, and I'm definitely feeling something.  I can't really describe it, but I've never felt it before.  I don't know if I can sense psi better yet, as I'm the only psion in the area.  I'll post again if it helps with that too.
