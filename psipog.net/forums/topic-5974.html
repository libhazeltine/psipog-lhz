I was just browsing around wikipedia when I found this article about the Pineal Gland.  It is a gland roughly the size of a pea inside our brain which is similar to the eyes, and starts to shrink at puberty.  Perhaps this gland is related to psionics in some way... What do you think?

			Interesting.....seems like good subject for the third eye donest it? I was most interested into its process of making more me metalion. Which is often related to nerve commucation...really well could be. But like any other part of the body I don't think it works alone, other parts of the brain must also give there share for the whole process.

But the vains that let our blood flow can't work without the heart being the center.

			The pineal gland has a lot of unneeded hype around it. Descartes thought that this was the seat of the soul since it was the only thing in the brain that was not mirrored on both halves. I talked to some neuroscientists about it and they said its function was slightly unknown but they think its either some vestigial structure like lizards have to sense light above their heads without actually using their eyes or it has something to do with biorhythm. I doubt it has any relation to psi especially since its just a stupid gland that spits shit out.

Tankdown I think what the neuroscientists told me about the biorhytm was wrong. It makes more sense if it's function is alluding scientists that it's the vestigial structure I mentioned. In that case exposure to light would cause it to release molecules into the surrounding brain causing an optic like perception.

			I'm just began reseaching the brain a little for the first time, so far I learn of the amybala and the thuluman. But its more on a emotional backgrounds, I don't know anythnig about this biorhytm. Not till I look it up anyway. So I just become a little familer with endogenous infradian.
<br />

<br />
Yes I agree on some grounds of it being a vestigial structure. I'm sort of wondering if its more active while being asleep. Like in the thestra stage of the mind. Also I'm thinking about emotional backgrounds mite affect the pinal gland. Also a few other things....
<br />

<br />
Glade you corrected me. (I think I understand anyway)

			That it is more active during sleep is some evidence that relates it to biorhythm. I believe though that it's activity is next to nothing both awake and asleep. The fact that is does increase activity during sleep should not be overlooked though, no matter how small an increase. Atleast we know now it's atleast not the seat of the soul.

			I'm sure it gives its share in some matter. Just like the hippocampus and the amybala are build for recordsing and reacting to emotions. But even though they are both build for the samething one has more power then the other.

			Pineal gland = third eye center
<br />

<br />
Chinese study that studied the third eye and saw that it was harder to open it after 14 because it began shrinking 
<br />

<br />
Old russian data
<br />

<br />
Stargate books
<br />

<br />

<br />
That's the proof. I have no links.
<br />

<br />
Experiences. I know some of you really l33t psychics have a pulsating in the center of your head or your third eye area when you do telepathy. I know some of you are having a sensatoin where your eyes are becoming very sensitive to light at times.

			What I find annoying at times is that sometimes &quot;evidence&quot; is sometimes made up to support someones beliefs. I'm not saying any of your evidence is false, I'm saying sometimes you need evidence to prove other evidence to be real. I'm not really happy about some areas of Asia. I just don't want to call it proof just yet thats all.

			Well I can imagine that stargate can be named just how people use area 51 in there scfi movies. But I guess it does matter which one came first, the movie or the tests. I like to see these experments and reports.

<br />
apparently its Psipog that has got the wrong idea of psi...
<br />

<br />
if u surf the net more and join other forums and read other articles..... u'll realise that psi and chi/qi/ki/mana/prana are 2 different things.... the former is actually brain wave related, and the latter is wad psipog calls psi....
<br />

<br />
if the chinese and russians are noobs at the energy arts..... then the americans are like totally owned over it..... total idiots on psi and qi....
<br />

<br />
the freaking pineal gland is the 3rd eye..... birds use it in flight!!!! as the pineal gland is a eye-shaped organ looking up (as in, its in the brain and its pupil is facing upwards, perpendicular from normal sight)....
<br />
as birds fly, they can look down (pineal gland thus facing forward) and fly normally, avoiding objects and hunting at the same time
