			I made a background/wallpaper for windows. It isn't very graphical but it has some nice philosophical aspects (especially if you can read binary [that is backwards and upside down and stuff]). Anyway it looks fairly nice, it has a trippy background on the transparency (it looks like the water is moving [it's not]). The top and bottom have binary from right to left overlapping binary from left to right. It also goes upside down. The top and bottom binary say the same thing. The binary in the middle is very inconspicous and goes from right to left. It is a poem. The quote to the left is directed to all skeptics of psychokinesis and is very convincing. I wrote it. I did not make the image of motoko kusanagi (with the big gun and the kitty cat). Nor did I make the background (yes the trippy one). My trippy friend found the trippy background and I found the image of the major off one of my cds. This background is called violent symmetry because of the way the binary at the top and bottom looks and also the way the image defies logic in its portrayal of philosophical concepts (for instance: writing them so nobody could possibly understand it). However it is reinforced by the powerful quote to the left (which logic would suggest should be on the right, or bottom in accordance with the English language). However it is obvious that since the dualities of logical and irrational thought are both provoked in great volume in this background it has some sort of alterior motive. Perhaps saying &quot;Life is not as it seems,&quot; or, &quot;Everything is meaningless.&quot; It is for you yourself to decide and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Although I made this background minus the graphics (which some might think would be easy [I am not a graphics person and this was mostly done in paint because of my stubborness]), complete credit for inspiration goes to Lucas V. B. None of you know him but he is a skeptic and a genius in physics. Anyway, Maxus suggested I post the background here so here goes...

P.S.: Sorry for annoying everyone by posting this but I thought some people might be interested... I usually just sit back and pm everyone to death, posting is new to me. I hope I didn't break any rules by posting this or something because I never read rules... ¬_¬ ... Anyways if you would like to know what the binary means just pm me or catch me msn messenger (I am on like thirty hours a day). Also I am working on a philosophy site <a href="http://www.tachikomableeding.net/" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.tachikomableeding.net/</a> so if any of you want to help out contact me... Anyways, I am done talking for today...

It can also be argued that DNA is nothing more than a program designed to preserve itself. Life has become more complex in the overwhelming sea of information. And life, when organized into species, relies upon genes to be its memory system. So, man is an individual only because of his intangible memory... and memory cannot be defined, but it defines mankind.
