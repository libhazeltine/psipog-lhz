			I'm still waiting for my first lucid dream, though during my practise i often encounter what I refer to as partially lucid dreams. They usually follow the same pattern- whenever I, in my dream, make a mistake i become aware that I am dreaming and correct it, which usually includes some nifty time travelling and redoing whatever i made wrong, but then I instantly lose control over my dream , it follows normally and I'm missing all the fun <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  
<br />

<br />
When I was a little child, before I ever heard  about lucid dreaming, I had a somehow similar skill. Whenever my dreams were getting frightening I knew that I was dreaming and could wake up for a second and fall asleep again simply by wanting to do so, but I've never had an actual lucid dream. I've never had nightmares being able to end them before they could start, which was cool <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Have anyone ever had similar problem and have any advise how to remain lucid?
<br />

<br />
BTW it's my first post, so hello yo everyone! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Well, think about it.
<br />
Treading the line between lucid and non lucid dreaming isn't exactly a quick *BAM* to lucidity. there's a transition.

@edhelfear: it sounds like you're nearly there, just keep practicing. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

<br />
I believe that semi-lucid is possible.  My personal evidence is when I have a nightmare.  Usually when I have a nightmare, I become semi-lucid and understand that I'm not sleeping.  Usually, a mirror is created, within the dream, that I look into, and then I wake up.  This isn't a method that I came up with voluntarily or with any deliberation.  The whole mirror thing is probably a sort of reflex I naturally adopted, and could possibly carry some deeper meaning, like the mirror represents the dream (a mirrored world) and when I look into it I recognize that I'm dreaming.  Something to that effect.
<br />

<br />
But I recognize this as semi-lucid because I'm not doing anything deliberately, yet I still gain the awareness that I'm not dreaming.  It could just be a matter of semantics, however.
