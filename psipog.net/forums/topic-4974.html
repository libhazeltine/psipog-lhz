			Lately I've been practicing on how to levitate. It's pretty exhausting and I suggest eating a nice big meal before you start <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
What I do is just shoot most of my energy through my legs and out my feet. And picture myself going up(like a rocket)with my energy. Of course I don't go very high but go up about an inch(or 2 centimeters). Now when you're doing this you're not just sending your energy into the floor, you're using it to lift you up like how a rocket lifts up. Constantly taking up your energy where in the end you'll be pretty exhausted. And don't forget to start out with a lot of energy, it'll take a bunch of energy to lift you up and a little more to take you higher. It's kinda like lifting weights, after you've been lifting for awhile, it gets harder and harder, and when you're done you're bushed. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
If you want me to do it like a step by step thing, I'll try to do that if it makes it easier for ya.

			so do I as I would really like to learn this although I really am skeptical about this only because of how much energy it would really need.  I dont think that anyone has enough but if you give a step by step method and maybe a vid if you can it will change my mind.  Its not that I dont believe that levitation isnt possible but the amount of energy that it would require would be so great.

			I like your idea. I've been trying to levitate for a while without success using a very different method, but this seems simple enough. Also, if a person can produce enough energy to light paper in fire, I think a person can levitate.

			Are you serious???? Not to be man or flame you but do you know how much more energy it would take to lift your body up then light paper on fire.  And anyways, can you light paper on fire..... I highly doubt that you can levitate only becuase of the amount of energy it requires.

			Sorry, &quot;dood,&quot; but you're an idiot. I was referencing John Chang, who is a pretty hot topic recently on psipog. Also, I have no idea why you think I meant lighting paper on fire whilst levitating, that would be excessive. Perhaps you should think before you post mindless drivel of no consequence like you just have.
<br />

<br />
Now back to the discussion topic, I would really enjoy reading an article by the poster explaining this innovative technique.

			Um...no, I said that levitating your self would require much more energy than lighting paper on fire.  I see how you could have misunderstood me so mb on that one.  Anyways, whats your point about lighting paper on fire.   yeah, wow thanks for sharing.  Now back to the topic on hand.  While I think it is possible to levitate the energy required would be to much for anyone to acheive in a lifetime in my opinion.

You only think it will, but it wont. You could move a car with the same amount of energy as a PsiWheel, you just dont think you can, dont think you can, know you can. This is why ive progressed so much in Psionics, i have more experiences of different Psionic events in my life than there are types of dog in the world. So basically, Psionic Events &gt; Types of Dogs in the World. Its the same with levitation, whats stopping you is that you think it will be hard.

			Well, that MAY be true and all, but the fact is, your mind still thinks it requires much more.  You wont be able to change it to the point where yoou think it will be as easy as a psiwheel.  
<br />
I would love to see a video of this to change my mind since I too want to learn to levitate! 
<br />

<br />
Edit: on a last note, I dont believe that it is just as easy to move a  car as a psiwheel.  I know how you think it is a mental barriar but I THINK that  since the mass is bigger it is harder to move with your mind.
