			ok, i think it would fall in here cause i dont see a shield section...
<br />

<br />
anyways, for the past while /something/ has been attacking me, and i dont like being attacked, i know fighting is againced the rules of the forum, but i'm not asking for a way to fight... i need a defence.
<br />

<br />
what is the best way to protect myself from getting attacked? i've tried making a shield to 'stop harmful energy' and it got broken, and i made one to 'hide me from hostile things' and that one didnt even seem to work. 
<br />

<br />
what type of shield would be the best for this type of thing and how do i make it? thank you

			First of all, are you sure you're being attacked? Ask yourself &quot;is there any psion out there I might have pissed off?&quot; If you can't think of anyone that would want to, or be able to attack you, it's likely that you're not being attacked, but being affected by something else. A headache doesn't have to be psychic combat. &quot;If I'm not being attacked, then why did my shield break,&quot; I hear you ask. Well, for one, it's possible you didn't put enough energy into it, and it just collapsed. They can do that.
<br />

<br />
Now, if you actually are being attacked, I recommend reading <a href="../articles.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">all these articles.</a> Also, if you know the attacker personally, I recommend you go find them and give them a <span style="font-style: italic">physical</span> ass-kicking. Nothing says &quot;leave me the f--k alone&quot; like a black eye and a fat lip.

			well, i dont know who i could have ticked off, but i can be an annoying bugger at times... esspecially in games of chance <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
anyways, the worst attack i got so far was one that i suddenly felt hollow and sick, and then started getting a chill, and i felt like curling up into a little ball and laying there for a while.  and that was the latest one, they seem to be getting more aggressive each time.
<br />

<br />
btw, i always program my shields to draw energy from me to stay active untill i dissable them with a trigger so they wouldnt run out of energy on me.

			If you don't know who could be attacking you, then you likely aren't being attacked. Tell your parents that you feel sick, and see if they'll take you to the doctor. Then you can see if there's anything physically wrong with you.

			Well, if you're very sure you're being attacked, try a bubble shield, then on top of that a marshmallow shield, another bubble shield, and on top of them all, a mirror shield.
<br />

<br />
Make sure there are no gaps between the shields.

			If you are actually being attacked, the previous responses pretty much sum it all up.
<br />

<br />
However, it could also be alot of negative energy that was witheld when you created your first shield. I know this sounds a little weird, but it happened to me. Every night, a few hours before I went to bed, I would get hot, ichy rashes all over my arms and legs. They got worse each night. One night, after about a month of this, I got really bad chills for a few days. I then tried a technique I had read in a book. I visualized all my negative energy and commanded it to shrink and, eventually, disappear. The rashes and chills immediately vanished. This may or may not be the problem, but I haven't had any symptoms since. (This technique was also said to help with childrens' nightmares.) Even if this isn't the problem, it does put you in a better mood either way.

			I don't think you are being attacked, your symptoms sound like some kind of virus, do your bones hurt at all? Usually chills and that hollow thing mean something is physicly going on. (Raise in temp and weakness in bones/muscles) You should really see a doctor. Or you could wait it out (I always do)
