			The Schism
<br />
It’s a sad thing to say, but the psionic community is spilt.  There are two types of psionics.  The two types are the skeptical and spiritualists.  Although I’m a spiritualist I was a skeptical once.  So in respect of the skepticals I believe neither type is better for they both have two different beliefs about energy.
<br />

<br />
Most newbies start out as skepticals.  This is not bad it’s actually natural.  Being a skeptical means you view and practice psionics in a scientific way.  You are trying to answer the question how.  How do you make a psi ball?  How does it work?  How do you make a better, bigger, more complex psi balls.  The best site I know that is pure skeptical (and proud of it) is Psipog.
<br />

<br />
Newbies who stick to the training will find there is a certain limit to what skeptical psionics can teach you.  You can learn everything about empathy psi balls, telekinesis and all the others skills in anywhere from a year to five year depending on how hard you train.  You are going to find yourself stuck and bored.  Your creativity will run out and your kills will stop progressing so fast.  Once you stop progressing you risk the chance of convincing yourself this isn’t real.  I have seen it happen to many people. If you are willing to open your mind and let go of the scientific method you will find a whole huge endless field of spiritualism.
<br />

<br />
The whole reason why most newbies start out as skepticals is because they are looking for a solid, visual, reputable, trustworthy proof that psi and the skills exist.  People, in the modern world are natural suspicious of things they can’t see.  We have been taught through years of school and from society not to believe in psi and other energy.  It does not help that many of the spiritualist out there are flakes, which gives a bad name to psychics.  They either know they are faking it or they hate the reality they live in.  they will do anything to convince themselves of anything to make reality seem better.  You may have noticed it is the fake spiritualist that get all the publicity and money.  It’s wrong and unfair.  The public is getting a false feeling for the psionic community.  It was because of this awful reputation that the skepticals become popular.
<br />

<br />
A true spiritualist is one that practices the same skills and methods as a skeptical, but looks for an answer as to why.  Why do we have these powers?  Why should we use them?  Spiritualist don t just challenge reality like the skepticals, but challenge our beliefs and morals.  Spiritualists dive into the muddy and danger waters of religion.  Did god(s) give us these powers and why?  Is it wrong or right to use them?  Are there higher being?  Is there life after death and if so can psi help us get there?
<br />

<br />
Skepticals spend there time and energy on energy manipulation skills.  These include making psi balls, shielding, any type of kinesis, contructs, and programming. These people tend to have a very logical mind.  They do well with math and sciences and tend to lack a great deal of imagination.  Spiritualists tend to focus on the perceiving skills such as empathy, telepathy, precognition and especially astral projection (oobes).  These skills are the less know, hard to do and can work in the most mysterious ways.  The spiritualists have an emotional and artsy mind.  They can be very creative, but without the best sense of reality.
<br />

<br />
It is my opinion if the psionics want public recognition and support the first step is to accept, respect and possible unity the two sides.  Right now the two sides refuse to have anything to do with the other side and spend their time putting down other opposite.  The skepticals say the spiritualists are a bunch of foolish fluff bunnies.  The spiritualists say the skepticals are stupid inflexible thickheads.  As long as we hold to these foul names and never look deeper, we will never get anywhere.  We will never be able to fight the phony, destructive reputation that “psychic” businesses bring.
<br />

<br />
Once again, neither side is better.  Each brings a different and important view into the hardly known subject of psi.  I can not encourage you look more at each side and talk to the extremists as well as the neutrals and then decide which side do you wish to be on.

			Very interesting, I like what you wrote. You should be a bit careful considering the rules of this website though. I am both skeptical and spiritual.

			Careful with the assumptions/generalsations.

I nearly stopped reading after you claimed that 'skeptical' psions(which I what I suppose I would be; as I'm still looking for more proof, despite the fact that I believe it exists, and try to keep myself in the scientific view of Psionics) &quot;do well at math and science&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Very untrue for me..... I barely got through math last year, and can't wait for my Senior year when I won't have to do math; and while I'm interested in theoretical physics, I'm no whiz at my science class.
<br />

<br />
And the &quot;lack of imagination&quot;?  Wow, considering it(imagination) was what got me into Psionics in the FIRST PLACE five years ago.....    <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Seriously, it's generalsations like THESE that are what create rifts in this community and any community....

			Wrong wrong wrong. There are in fact 4 types and 2 hybrids. The spiritualists, the skeptics, die hard psions, and the technical psions who just use it for cool things. The hybrids are spiritual skeptics and technical skeptics.  You are using the term skeptical wrong. Skeptics refers to people that question something not just use it. Spiritualists you are using wrong too because all spiritualists realize psi is not of real importance. Spiritualists move on to things RELATED but not the same, like OBEs.

This is true, but you must remember that <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">it was these same fake spiritualists who made psychic powers popular in the first place!</span></span>  All psionic practice seems to be based off of those of these explotative money-makers, from what I've gathered.
