			I'm on the tech crew for my school plays.  During the last one, my job during the shows was to sit in the dark and open and close doors once every few scenes.  Each play was three-ish hours and so were the dress rehersals so in the end I spent over twenty-four hours in my box.  To entertain myself, I started creating my pet.  I gave him a life-sized humanoid body and by the end of the last play he was quite dense and I'd cpoied my entire personality into him (or most of it.  I've noticed a couple of gaps since then but I've fixed them).
<br />
So to answer your questions, it is possible to make one life-sized (Or any size, I'd imagine), and it took me a little over a twenty-four hours to make mine.  He needs more energy than my other constructs, though, so it may not be wise to make one that's too big.

			If anything was ever wrong with it, how would you know? What signs or feelings would you get? I'm sorry if I'm asking to many questions, I don't want to neglect my Psipet, even if it is a construct. I'm dealing with a prototype now, so I'm free to experiment with it.

			In my case anyway, my pet was very talkitive and active when he was fine.  When he stopped talking, I knew there was a problem.  Usually, that problem is that he's running out of energy, which is simple enough to fix.
<br />
I didn't get any feelings, though.  I just had to notice that he wasn't doing much anymore.

			Are there any risks involved with creating a psipet?  I want to make one, but I want to plan everything out first.  here is what I plan on so far:
<br />

<br />
*It is going to be in the form of a dove.
<br />
*I will program it to do anything I say without quistion.
<br />
*I will program it to draw energy from the Earth when needed, as long as it dosen't harm any plants or animals, or other things that need the energy. But to not take anymore energy than I gave it when I created it.
<br />
*I will program it to be destroyed when I say it's name (which will be Henry) 3 times, and then say &quot;be gone&quot; verbaly.  I will also program it to emiditaly be destroyed at this time and not quistion my word.
<br />
*I will program it to not harm anything, unless I specificaly tell it to.
<br />
*I will program it to heal me with it's own energy if I am injured.
<br />
*I will program it to not be reprogramable.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Does that sound good?  Do you think I should start with somthing simplier?  Is there a chance that somthing could go wrong and it could harm me or somone/somthing else?

			I suggest trying something simple first.
<br />
For example I made a psicat that knows the commands &quot;come&quot;, &quot;stay&quot;, and &quot;good kitty&quot;. When he sleeps he recharges energy.
<br />
Start small, end big.

			Hi, im new to these forums and pretty new to psi, I was wondering, do you actually SEE the &quot;psipets&quot; you create? Please explain. Because, if I would try to make one, how would I be certain the programming actually works?
<br />

<br />
[edit] And I was trying to pour energy into 5555-5555, I don't know if it had effect tough...<img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			About the 5555-5555 construct, I accidentally killed it in my sleep =P. I also reinforced my field and made it resistant to psi, and made a bouncing construct.

I'm a notorious sleep walker.

			I've maintained much of my skepticism, even the unneccessary, so I'm having a hard time getting past the things that come natural to me. The natural includes, basically, energy manipulation and empathy. I've been trying to make constructs, specifically psi-pets, but I'm having trouble knowing if it's worked. I'm guessing that I just need to work on sensing (which I'm horrible at, except for finding only certain people's locations, and even then erratically) and that should fix the confusion.
<br />

<br />
Any other tips?

			I made a crappy &quot;psipet&quot; but it lost it's charm.  I made 2 samll guys to fight eachother, but it failed.  I could only feel them moving not see them, so i was kinda sad.
