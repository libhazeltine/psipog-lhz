			A topic I haven't seen a whole lot of around here happens to be one of my favorites- communicating with your subconscious. I communicate with my sub-c fairly easily, and though there is no definite way to determine whether you are talking to yourself on a conscious or subconscious level, I find it beneficial either way. I thought I'd open this thread up for discussion of odd or entertaining experiences or conversations people have had with their sub-c, the first time you actively communicated with it. Do you call your sub-c by a name? (I refer to mine as T. No idea why.) Do you argue with it? (I do constantly.)  The subconscious is a very interesting thing, and I'd like to see the take some other people have on their communications with it.

Are you calling me insane? <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> I am not insane <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.  Really though, its just one of the many ways I portray to myself on making a decision and me getting angry at myself is just me getting angry about not being able to decide.  Besides, Psycholigists are no fun <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.

			I get that sometimes, except i just interpretite (sp?) as God. I do argue with it too. Was weird when i recentely passed out at the end of my business studies class and i was on the floor when my teacher asked me if i knew where i was and the date and time, and apparentely i said no to everyone of those. Also, i don't remember a thing about her asking me that. It was as if no time had passes from me falling over to getting back up again.
<br />

<br />
 Was this maybe the subconcious awakening and having no idea where the hell it was? Other people who i know have done that said the same thing.
<br />
And no sircubes your not going insane. Some people are just too insecure to admit that they have too done it once or twice in their lives. No hostility meant felix. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I've only communicated directly with my sub a few times. I find it quite difficult to listen to it/hear it.
<br />
Once, I had this strange feeling, the same I get when something bad is going to happen. So, I asked myself &quot;What is happening?&quot;, and all of a sudden I saw an entire event in my mind (within a split second) which spanned about 20 minutes or so. This event was about a friend of mine. A few days later, it happened.
<br />

<br />
It seems each time I successfully communicate with what could be called my 'subconscious', it's a precognitive experience.
<br />
I don't know.
<br />
Any tips on how I might learn to communicate with it clearly on a regular basis?

			I will say that communicating with your sub-c is something that can make you feel very borderline crazy. It really is just a form of talking to yourself- only with the perks of knowing certain things you can't exactly recall. It's hard to really get the hang of talking to your sub-c because usually it's hard to tell if you're just talking to another part of your conscious mind or to your sub-c. Either way, do it. Talking to yourself is, after all, a sign of intelligence. Eventually, your sub-c will start to nose in on the conversations in some subtle way or another. And when you notice it happening, just focus on the tone, the 'voice in your head' that seems more seperate.

			See, my subconscious doesn't <span style="font-style: italic">talk</span>. It just sort of feels. That's the best way to describe it.
<br />

<br />
I talk to it, but it doesn't talk back. It gives a feeling based on whatever I said. I mostly talk to it when I need its cooperation for an OBE.

I should have someone ask my sub-c why he doesn't wanna use TK or something ^^ i think it's a good experiment everyone should try.  Heh, it's kinda like primitave hypnosis XD

			you know when you have a thought and you hate yourself for thinking that. like if you where a firmly religious person and you suddenly think that god isn't real and that you should praise the devil. Know that your sub-consious only reflects you. what ever it tells you must be the truth.
<br />

<br />
PS unless you have extreme schzophrenia or paranoia
<br />

<br />
have you ever thought of if someone was deaf and schzophrenic. they might not even know it. their mother might be saying that they should take a bath but theycant hear her and  think she is saying (what the voices are saying) that she wants to kill someone or something else

			ohhh dear.. if that's my sub-c, then it's brutally screwed up.
<br />
Every once in awhile, I get random impulses to destroy, or do something extremely sadistic.  But my concious is there to block my sick urges. It's as if i'm putting a cage around my sub-c.

			Hmmmmm, I've seemed to merge with what you call &quot;sub concience&quot; I like to call it my otherside or the other me. but then sometimes I have conversations with something telpathicly but not sure who or what it is. Get half-way through the conversation then signals get mixed up. Espeacially when I ask it's name.

			This is something I've been experiencing for quite some time.  My sub-c has been talking to me since around the 7th grade.  I find that the more often you talk to it the more talkative it gets, when I first met it I thought I was just crazy, but eventually I got used to it and named it Righty.  The name Righty wasn't completely random, I kept asking what its name was, going, is it Bill, Ted, and eventually he said yes, thats it (not those words, but you get the meaning).
<br />

<br />
I'm still unsure about it but when I read the article on this website it made me feel alot better.
<br />

<br />
In my experience, your sub-c will be like a regular person, joke around, be pushy, argue, help you out, or be a jerk it kinda depends.  They also have their own attitudes, like Righty will help me out on tests but he is sorta mean <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> and will only give me the really hard questions with 5 minutes left, every time, so I end up having to rush through everything.  Also for me Righty would interupt conversations and make snide comments, he has even made me laugh out loud sometimes...That was awkward to try to explain.
<br />

<br />
Lastly but what people always seem to talk about is he seems to talk to me in images and words, words more often, but images when he is rushed.  Sometimes if we are talking and he says something to taunt me he'll throw a picture of it afterwards, and then flash that picture in my mind alot to keep annoying me.
<br />

<br />
Just thought I should get that all off my chest, thats my experiences with my sub-c.
