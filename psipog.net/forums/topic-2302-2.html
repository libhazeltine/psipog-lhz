			I havn't seen too much on it. Miss Z me thinks. I don't really believe it actually... when I see it in a reputable place I'll believe it. It's just too easy to fake thing these days... I mean... just because she and a few other people say it happened doesn't mean I believe it. Now... if a group of scientists published it in a good journal and it was investigated by other people I'd believe it... but it wasn't and it hasn't

reading the posts after this one, you sound like you disbelieve everything to do with OBE, which wouldnt make you an expert on telling what the experience is. i'm sorry, but i'm looking for ligitamit help, not someone without evidence telling me its all in my head.
<br />

<br />
though if you do have experience regardless of how you sound in those other posts, then i appologise.
<br />

<br />

<br />
you know, thats the second time today i heard that books name lidless, i thought it sounded similar too, just going off the name of the book, it might be interesting to read sometime.
<br />

<br />

<br />
pyro, when i figure out the obe method rather than this visualization method, it might actually be a good idea for you to come along, it'd prove to myself 100% finnally that its really there.

(of course, it is rather obvious that you are in the 11-to-14 age group, so I'd imagine it difficult to get to a psychologist on your own, and you don't want to tell your parents that you are crazy - but I'm giving the advice regardless)

So a skeptic can't be an expert in their field? Because I don't believe in something I can't study and or know a lot about it?

actually, i'm currently 19, but my grammar, spelling, and overall ability to write stinks. you dont even want to see what my handwritting is like

and i think the last thing i want is to see a psychiatrist about this, due primarilly to the fact just practicing psi is enough to risk being put in an asylum if you openly told one that.

			i think it is a dream and a metaphor... like one person said. climb the tower and see whats on the top.

Daniel is right. You can be a skeptic and an expert/have studied alot in the feild where he is skeptical. Reality is only what we perceive it to be. There are some things that force you to perceive one way. (facts if they are true) And their are others that leave it to you to interpret how ever you want. (myths, obes ect) 
<br />

<br />
I have had a vew lucid dreams which both were very very cloudy. I was lucid, i didnt look at any dream signs and notice them in order to take control of my dreams, but i do know how it feels to have a dream so real that you question it the next morning. If thats how an obe feels/ looks/ what ever, then i would have to side with him on it.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The only thing i have found odd, is that you supposedly have to get all your expectations in order. Your fears and ect. And even more strange, is that what ever you fear at the moment, even as far as seeing a shadow and going &quot;hey that looks like a giant wasp or &lt;insert random movie monster here&gt;&quot; then it will be. Now why is this? If obe's were infact real, then wouldnt it be set in stone? Wouldnt the basis of everyones experience (comming out of the body, being in your room, everything they tell us a standard obe is.) be the same? I mean if you climb out of your body, then enter your room, then continue to distort reality as much as people said they have, then wouldnt that just be a lucid dream?

i do play video games, but the ones i play are rpgs that are rich in storyline, and are full of side quests and stuff like that. this is more of a straight run up a tower with one recurring enemy, who also appears to my real life friend in her dreams. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
and, Daniel, one cannot both know all about what a real OBE experience is and feels like enough to tell it from a dream, if you do not believe it can even happen. you actually said you dont, and wont believe in it until there is evidence that satisfies you. which is why i had my responce, before one can truely study and become 'expert' in something, you have to believe it is possible. 
<br />

<br />
@pyro:sorry, just saw your post, anyway, if you get scared all you have to do is think of your body, and your back, so you shouldnt have to worry about getting hurt.
<br />

<br />
anyways, i'm going to keep going up, i'm not going to bore yall with what each floor is like, as its almost identical each floor exept for what is in it. but if something interesting happens i'll be sure to post it.
