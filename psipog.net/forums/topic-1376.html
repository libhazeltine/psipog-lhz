			Hi everybody. I have a big problem with empathy. Since a month I started to feel others' feelings. It was cool at first, strange... But yesterday night I was watching a movie, a very sad one, and since then I'm just feeling depressed and I can't help but think about it. I've tried shielding with many types of shielding but it doesn't help a lot... Please tell me something, your experiences, if it's normal at first, how can I take back my balance? Thank you for the attention
<br />

			Learn to shield more efficiently. You should be able to block empathy with a strong enough shield.

			If you are a beginner( IF ) Then you should probably learn empathy after you can make a pretty strong shield to protect yourself from an overload.  But if you arent a beginner and you can shield <span style="font-style: italic">pretty good</span> then you should probably make sure that your shields are strong enought sill before you try to get into empathy

			Hmm... a quick solution could be to focus all of your empathy on one person, then break the link with a construct and then you can shield without disruption. Personally, I haven't tried this, but it can work.

			im no expert by any means but if your feeling sad becuase of the movie and nothing you do shielding or severing links is helping maybee look on the inside, perhaps you are causing the depression yourelf. how I would test this is concentrate and see what you are feeling and try to feel if there is something imposing on your true feelings. if there is no difference then id say its just kuss you saw a sad movie that had a long alsting efect on you.

			Shielding is for bitches. I'm an empath, pretty sensitive... Overloads aren't that bad. The only time I really get bad overloads is after like I've been in an assembly or something.. And they aren't exactly unbearable. I can handle them without problem, easy. You guys should just step it up and take it like a man.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

			Scorch: Forgive me, but I highly doubt you are an empath. The way you say &quot;take it like a man&quot; tells me that you have no clue what an overload is, and you are attempting to show how &quot;manly&quot; you are. So let me advise you to keep your mouth shut when it comes to discussing matters that require more than blatant stupidity.

			er... If I were you I'd do a bit of research before I talked... I might not have many posts on the forum, but that's because it reaks of fluff, I've been in the IRC chat for about a year now... practicing empathy on and off. I don't claim to be a proffesional, but I probably know a hell of alot more about psionics then you. As for the manly part, yea. I know what an overload is, and it's nothing you can't live through. Deal. Fucking pussy.

			Shielding is a way to deal with overload.  It's a pretty easy way too.  That's like saying, &quot;quit being a pussy and when someone stabs you, just deal with it&quot; - OR you can find a way to stop someone from stabbing you (probably more effective strategy).
<br />

<br />
My worst overload began inducing a black out before I started a shield.  My vision went black and I started to stumble.  If I had passed out, I might have hit my head on the tile floor pretty hard... or if I was near a corner of something, I could have done some damage to myself from hitting it.  I also know of people who have geisted while already passed out from an overload.  Serious overload is no joke.

			If you've done psionics for so long, then you should know that it's a bad idea to hand out bad advice to people. If you want to take it like a man, and feel overloads, be my guest. But if you want every one else to suffer with you, then that is a problem. Different people have different tolerences. Of course you can live through an overload, I'm sure you can also live through a root canal without novocaine. Protecting yourself from problems does not show you are weak, it shows you are smart.

			Overload is bad for those around you too. I once blacked out from it as I passed a disco. My grandmother, nearby, ended up with a sharp migraine. Another time, I was at school, I overloaded and several lightbulbs shattered.
<br />

<br />
And what if you were driving when you overloaded? CRASH! You're dead, your passengers are dead, people you crashed into are dead.

			I don't drive for one... And you can mentally overcome an overload, although it doesn't prevent it, it prevents it from getting too out of control. A bit of mental strength never hurt anybody, and overloads aren't a bad way to build it up... If they get too out of hand before you can control them, and you know that, then by all means shield.. I'm just saying that I never needed to, because overloads aren't that difficult to mentally crush...
