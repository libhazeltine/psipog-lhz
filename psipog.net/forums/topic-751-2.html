You'll find that rather a lot of the teenage girls who are involved in online communities connected with the paranormal tend to congregate in the witchcraft communities, rather than psionics; while guys of the same age group tend to be more inclined towards psionics and/or sorcery.  
<br />

<br />
Why?  I don't know.  When I was a teenager, chatrooms weren't an issue.  
<br />

<br />
As I type, it is being pointed out to me that the fantasy books and games tend to stereotype that way (witches = female, sorcerer = male), in spite of the fact that there are male witches, and female sorcerers (ie, sorceresses) in the real world.  Anime is generally geared to the male of the species, and for some reason, anime is the first major introduction to psionics for many people in online communities geared to novice psionicists.

When it comes around to it, I am the only girl who really believed in PK at my school (when I was there) despite the multitudes of Wiccan followers. Girls always seem to deviate towards clairvoyance and star-gazing as opposed to &quot;normal&quot; things like telepathy and so forth. It's nice to see that there are more ladies that have set the standard for all us youngsters.

The girls in your reiki class may be drawn to the entire &quot;healing&quot; factor of reiki (which I know nothing about; feel free to correct me). We girls always seem to be drawn towards things like that.

Pfft, yeah right. I accidentally stabbed myself in the leg (3/4&quot; to 1&quot; deep), and it didn't phase me (and it did hurt, so it wasn't shock). Ever have extreme Vitamin C overdose, or get a case of the flu so bad you had to go to the hospital? I know none of that can compare to childbirth (don't they inject painkillers into the mother's spine?), but it certainly qualifies me to be more than a baby. Maybe it's that all the &quot;men&quot; you've met weren't real men at all.

It doesn't have to be imagined. They have &quot;Empathy Belts&quot; (I think that's the right name) for just that sort of thing.
