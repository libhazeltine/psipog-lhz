B) Especially when theres a newer thread treating the topic it is generally looked down upon to bring a topic that has been dead for months to the top of the list, it also makes a terrible impression as a newcomer to any forum.

			everyone is entitled to their own oppinion and I think you would do well to let someone with a new theory explain it.  even if you don't agree.  It may turn out that this new idea may help someone else in occomplishing what others can't.  Sence everything is based visualization it could be that someone actually finds the strength they need to move that pencil, paper, or chair.  I would greatly appreciate a little concideration because there are are going to be more 'newbs'  looking for help of somekind than those who know for sure that they can or can't do something.

Thank you

B) *Buzzer sounds* Psionics is based on energy use, visualization, and mental factors, each of which are equally important. You need to have all of them to go anywhere.
<br />
C) I never say that its impossible, I've said that its out of reach and frankly not that important, work on other stuff and worry about novelties like this later, I mean if you ever manage to get this that's what it will be, a novelty, since you'd be draining an extreme amount of energy for each second you wanted to be in the air.

			The paragraph that was posted...it was...it was... it was stupid. Several people could levitate and perform amazing levitating feats DID NOT oppose their bodily needs. That guy is...I mean i can understand where his logic came from but that's stupid. I just don't get it, levitating by not eating and not 
<br />
sleeping? Give me a break. Levitating is just the same thing as moving anything else, it's just called levitating because everybody thinks its different when u move urself... It's the same thing!!! Jeez.
<br />

<br />
It's the same thing as moving a straw or watever.

Let me crack the physics down for you on some things:
<br />

<br />
The mass of a pencil- 0.005 kg
<br />
The mass of a semi average human - 7.405 kg
<br />
</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Sorry to burst in, but wouldn't the mass of a semi average human be <span style="font-weight: bold">74</span>kg instead of 7.4? 
<br />

<br />
So: 74.05 * 9.8 = 725.7 N
<br />

<br />
725.7 / 0.049 = 14810.204 <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
So in reality its not 1,500 times but 15,000 times greater!

			74 kilograms is weight, remember gravity is 9.8 meaning mass is almost 1/10 your weight.

Thats kinda funny. I think about quitting smoking, but I always end up walking to the store and spending my money on cigarettes. So (in my opinion), I believe anything is possible althogh the chances of using that method is highly unlikely.

			Psi acts on two levles, both that of particles, and hence physical, and also it acts as waves (I'm refering to the particle wave duality of matter). Waves have nowhere near the force needed to move something, so the particle form of psi must be used. In order to slide a person who weighs 60 kilos one metre across a floor in a second (hell, we'll do it without friction) it would cost... 60 joules. To do the same thing with a tiny piece of paper (like a psi wheel) would take .0000625 joules of energy... seeing any pattern appearing here? That means that you would have to exert 960000 times the amount of energy that it takes to move that psiwheel to move a person of that weight. Thats without friction. Hence, it is very easily for me to conclude it is improbable anyone here is capable of that as of yet, but, yes, it is technically possible. (yes I do physics, and I used a graphing calculator as well as fairly excat values including measuring the weight of the psi wheel paper to find these values, they are fairly accurate)
