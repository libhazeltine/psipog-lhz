			anyway, me and my friend have been doing the philosophical statement thing, trying to communicate with our subconsciousness. i think it really is great practice and is beneficial in a lot of ways (and i'd like to encourage everyone to at least give it a try for a little while if you haven't already =] )
<br />

anyway, here's one of the sayings we wrote down

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">To expand reality, we must first expand our perception of it. An incomplete reality is a fake reality at best. Once one learns to expand this so called reality and learns that there is really no boundary to this existence, then we can call it a fake reality based on what we percieve to be real.</span>

I would put it in gernal discussion.

Even is our eyes can expand to see the curve of the horzian to see it is round, we still can't learn whats on the other side of it. Indeed your quote has a lot to say but it only goes so far. The sunset and sunrise also has no boundary but we still can't beyond the sun itself. There is always going to be some bounder.

			You're right, but there is something that you just can't put so easily into words. Expanding your perception of reality is like seeing more at one time and seeing it more clearly. From what i experienced it may be described by <span style="font-style: italic">feeling</span> your environment. 
<br />
You forget the split there is between you and the around you. That lets you connect to it easier. If you read this, you might think &quot;what the fuck&quot; or &quot;just bullshit or fluff&quot; or simply ignore it.  The only problem is your mind, because it has a belief system and desires and it doesn't permit you to expand &quot;your&quot; reality or yourself. 
<br />
I think it's cool doing that because you get more control and more knowledge over yourself and your environment. In addition to that you learn what your subconscious wants to say to you through your feelings. 
<br />
At least that's what i experienced. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Wow you think you simply fingure that out of me so quickly? I know you mite be thinking I'm just in denial of your words but I'm seriously don't think that way at all. What I thought when reading your words is that you simply didn't understand me I didn't insult you at all. Infact I encourage questioning, have you look at my own quote?

There is still only so much we can feel, we still live in this &quot;earthly&quot; world of physical matter. So we are doomed to certain experiences, hopefuly our imagination have gotten us farer into expanding our feelings in our dreams. But regardless of some of these things we are still connected to &quot;common sense&quot; of this world. Once in a while I try to feel things in the quatumn realm, to feel things that are not common to our world at all. But regardless of what I did I still feel there are things we are unable to comperhend. A barrior of some kind that may split the really heaven and hell apart. A barrior that creates that 1 flaw in all humans, that one flaw we are unable to escape no matter how much we beg.
<br />

<br />
I believe no manner how far we get there are still things we may never get to. But then again that is the exicting thing about exploreing now itsnt it?

			its weird, because after i thought of that and wrote it down, i looked back over what i just typed. it took me at least 4 minutes to actually understand what i just typed, and it amazed me. i was wondering how i could write something like that. it just flowed so easily when i wrote it, but i could barely even understand it afterwards.
<br />

<br />
it was awesome <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />. if i keep doing stuff like this and try to open up my communication with my sub-c, will it start talking to me more often? (rather, will i be able to hear it more often?)
<br />

Not so sure if I agree with this. in a way our emotions and thoughts are the samething. Often the weak goes with there emotions but I see the strongest of warriors goes with what logic tells them whats right. Even if it hurts them emotional.

			Well i think the problem lies in the ego we have. It doesn't permit you to just feel happy right now or feel any thing you want right now in this moment. If you can shake that off, you'll see more clearly and it's like you practice what you preach. You'll be like one step over all thoughts and all emotions you're sensing.
<br />
I mean all those stuff like speech and this whole society crap is just inventions of humans which are somehow good but they lead to the point that everybody gets used to it and forget that it could be different. It's like a conditioning or brainwashing because of you being too unconscious.

i personally didn't agree with JT's saying either, but figured i'd post it while i was at it incase it spoke to someone. my fav one out of those was the paper analogy (sp)

-its not half bad. it kinda makes me think of some of the articles on communicating with your sub-c. you start off by asking questions and 'waiting' for an answer without making it up. after awhile you start to hear your sub-c speaking, and then you're off for a wild adventure etc etc. i'm only at the beginning stages of communicating with my sub-c, but i can already see that this communication can be very rewarding <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
