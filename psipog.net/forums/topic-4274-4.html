			You do. Unfortunately,  they are your only food. You are lost deep in the woods, about three days from civilization, and you, being a city person don't know how to survive in nature. You're about to eat your last oreo when a squirrel chitters at you from above. You jump, dropping the oreo. As you search for it in the leaf litter, the squirrel runs down, grabs it, and runs away with it.

You've lost your food. You wander in the woods, getting hungrier every day. You finally head across some mushrooms in the woods. In your hunger, you forget all sense and eat them.

Wish granted. However, this pony was in fact a Miniature Giant Space Pony! Miniature Giant Space Ponies are known for their natural telepathic bonds (which occur because their DNA was modified by an alien race) with Miniature Giant Space Hamsters, of which a horde is summoned through their Alien technologies. The Hamsters are vegans (as all good hamsters should be!), and are all hungry. They go around eating all of the world's crops, reproducing like rabbits. The world is out of vegetation. All livestock and wild animals die. Humans have nothing left to eat. <span style="color: blue">Nice going smart one</span>, you made everyone starve. Sheesh.

I wish that George W.

Kekekeke. George W Bush turns out to be Antichrist, so having him die only had him be reincarnated as Satan. (ignore the religion) and therefore beginning the apocalypse. SMOOTH. Ahnold ends up in a huge terminator-esque fight with George W Reborn.

			The next 2 electees into office, in place of George W and Paul Martin, are... Leeroy Jenkins, and Terrance/Philip. Terrance and philip bring Canada down to its knees via crappy fart joke movies with tons of curse words, while Leeroy in his typical fashion runs into everything and getting everyone killed.
