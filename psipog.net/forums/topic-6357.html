			Sounds amazing! But probably if you would've &quot;really&quot; been there, i would've heard of it . I know many people in Berlin. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> I guess you were just being there in your dream (in the dream) and having remembered the city and the people there you made that scenario up. Which doesn't make it any less cool. Probably you were &quot;lucid-dreaming&quot; which means that you were being conscious while dreaming. That would explain why it seemed so vivid to you.

			in astral projection i've put candles out.... so it means there is a physical element
<br />
to the soul...actually more metaphysical....
<br />

			Hi Meta
<br />

<br />
This is the second time someone post a lucid dream very similar to one that I've done.
<br />

<br />
A few months ago, I did my first astral projection. It was early in the night. After that I finaly fall asleep,  I appeared in a street in a big city knowing I was dreaming and in total control of my toughts. There where only one person where I appeared. Someone who were cleaning a sidewalk. He was very surprised to see me and just strared at me without talking. 
<br />

<br />
Then I said aloud looking at my arm &quot; If this is real,this is real too&quot; and I wanted to levitate which happened immediately !
<br />

<br />
We were both very surprised and I said again &quot; If this is real,this is real too&quot; and started to fly at an incredible speed which I tought was speed of light.
<br />

<br />
All I could see was stretch lines of light. After what seemed to me about 30 seconds. I was stoped by a powerfull and invisible force. I had just the time to see that I was in an underground that was lighted by by a kind of huge extraterrestrial base (according to the architecture). 
<br />

<br />
And I was pulled back in my body, and woke up. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
All I can do is believe in your &quot;dream&quot; then. I suppose this kind of experience refers to a part of reality that is unknown.
<br />

<br />
See ya 
<br />

<br />

			Maybe you see possibilities in your dream. Like seeing virtually what will or could happen. If it eventually will happen depends on many things though.
<br />
Maybe you can materialize in different places while lucid dreaming which would be really cool.
