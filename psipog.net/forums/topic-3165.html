Do you seriously think anyone can seriously answer your questions from solid personal experience?
<br />

<br />
We do know that we don't know of anyone who has been &quot;possessed&quot; during an OBE. That's about it.

			Personally speaking, if I was you, I would walk a very carefully and study into this fully. Need to find out if these are friendly ones, or mean ones. Friendly ones would help facilitate where as mean ones would try to possess, most people say that obe is pretty safe but it is full of dangers.

What a wonderful question.  Who here actually is speaking from personal experience?  Or is everyone here just perpetuating the same fears with no evidence to back them up?
<br />

<br />
This is border line religion.  If the topic starts to become overly religious, then it will be locked.

			Peebrain, I am speaking from the experience that I had when I was about 6 or so, was in astral projection and was enjoying myself and felt a malignant force looked back, there was 2 pairs of glowing red eyes. I zipped back to my body and was so freaked out by it that there was a memory block until just lately when I started into psi activities. Believe me or not, but let me tell you it's one hell of a scary sensation because in the astral plain the forces of good and evil are much stronger- it's like we let down our protection barriers. I had a good friend who frequently communicated on the astral plain level and there were times that I had to comfort her and help her to deal with a powerful malignant feelings.

			ok, first of all, it's an honest question. second, i have NO reason to tie this to religion. why would ghosts have anything to do with it?
<br />

<br />
third, if it is such a stupid question, then by all means get rid of this topic. i have no clue about OBEs but i am attemping them so no harm in looking at &quot;possible&quot; risks.

			Ok, I'm going to speak according to monroe's book. There was NO case of possession or bad things while the experiences occured, none of the thousands obers even gotten possessed. Possession is impossible because you are tied to your body until death. The only danger is fear itself, if you get too terrified, it might keep you from doing obe again.  But of course if you have a heart disease or malfunction or whatever, you might die of fright.. but this is all. And to speak about the ghosts, they might react in any way but they can't really hurt you

			That may be the case for those that don't have beliefs regarding this area, it is also shaped by your religious beliefs not converting the thread over, so with each person it would be altered. Now if I was to obe, probebly would be a lot different since my beliefs have altered tremendously through out the years.

<br />
Ah, so where in this experience did you witness a possession?  Nowhere.  Yet you were convinced in an earlier post that possession can happen.
<br />

<br />
Nearly all of the authors on OBEs agree that your fears will manifest on the &quot;astral&quot; plane.  Perhaps you saw a red light, and your mind immediately created two red eyes looking at you.  This happens all the time in real life as well... stay up late, turn off the lights, and watch a scary movie.  If you really get into the movie, then all sorts of shit will start to scare you.  Normal shadows become evil figures, natural sounds become footsteps, and your body becomes hypersensative to physical movements, afraid that the blanket rubbing on you is actually a zombie about to grab your leg.
<br />

<br />
This is why we focus on personal experience.  Your experience has a hundred different explainations, yet for some reason you're convinced that possession is possible because of that one experience.  So you perpetuate a fear because you assume that everyone will look at your experience the same way.
