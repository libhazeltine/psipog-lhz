This technique is used in PK. I find it works best with toothpicks, but thats just me. Make sure to read all the steps, and if it doesnt work or your experiencing problems, let me know. Also... i'd really like a confirmation from one of the psions here in case this technique could be harmful to the body. I dont think it is; i havent experienced any pain/problems while using it. But i want the confirmation to make sure.
<br />

<br />
OK. 
<br />
First thing you got to do is focus on the object (in this case the toothpick).
<br />
Focus till you can feel the toothpick, and when you kinda &quot;zone out&quot;. 
<br />
I find that this step is complete when i see the toothpick and everything else is a jumbled ball of colour.
<br />

<br />
Next, visualize a part of your soul ripping from your body and becoming absorbed into the toothpick. At this stage, the toothpick will shake. Its ok if it doesnt, your still doing it right. Make sure your &quot;soul&quot; is planted securely inside the toothpick, and if you want you can look around from the toothpick's point of view, or feel yourself rolling. You can also add special effects, like sparks or fire but i find that a waste of energy; again, thats just me. Do what works for you.
<br />

<br />
Now, feel it move. 
<br />
Your &quot;soul&quot; is in the toothpick, and you should be able to feel it move and have a distinctly powerful connection with it. If this doesnt work, you can use visualization. I wont go in-depth because i dont have much time to write this article, but i'll explain briefly.
<br />
Feel the toothpick in your hands. Guide it with your mind, just &quot;push&quot; it mentally. Give it a shot of psi, and send it on its way. Focus is eessential at this part. Move it like a muscle in your body. I find this feels like attraction, but instead the object moves the opposite way. 
<br />

<br />
If it wont move at all, then just focus on it. This, i find, always makes an object move. If you focus hard enough, you should be able to at least shake it, and thats the first step.
<br />

<br />
Feedback/Replies appreciated

			Nice article Wolverine <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
However I would like to adress some tips. You say:
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Next, visualize a part of your soul ripping from your body </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />
When teaching people a new method, sentences like these are kind of aggressive. People don't want to <span style="font-style: italic">rip</span> their souls out of their bodies.
<br />

<br />
See what I mean? The sentence suggests something that I associate with an aggresive action against my being. 
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Make sure your &quot;soul&quot; is planted securely inside the toothpick</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />
I would not want to prison my soul in some toothpick. See?
<br />

<br />
So, it may be personal, but as a reader of this new method, as a student of yours so to say, I would not like these aggresive and somewhat dangerous suggestions. I know what you mean by the exercise though, and it can indeed work quite good, however, whatever it is you enter in that object, i can assure you, it will never be your soul. Therefore I would change the word soul into something else, and I would not say: &quot;Ripping this or that out of your body.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
You could for example say: 
<br />
&quot;For this exercise you move your sense of body into the object of choice, and become one with it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Thats what 'bothered'me in your article, for the rest, it is fine <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
You don't need to change anything, that's just what I would have done if I wrote it.
<br />

<br />

			Thanks for this technique!   It's been a long while since i've tried to &quot;become one&quot; with the object, and this really worked well.  I rolled a straw for the first time with this.

As for the aggressive thing, I guess it might frighten away a newbie who had only read an article or two.  But if someone knew anything about psionics, they'd know what you meant.  Putting &quot;put some of your energy/presence in the toothpick&quot; sounds like all the other techniques and someone who was still on the psiwheel and not very advanced might not know what you meant....   So, I like the soul thing because people know what you mean and have a good visualization for that.    Also, most people think &quot;ripping the soul out&quot; rather than &quot;letting the soul flow out&quot;  simply because that's what they've heard before.  So it might be better to say what you did for visualization purposes and because people are familiar with that concept.  I think you get the same result, but it makes it easier for people less experienced with things that involve your spirit/energy, such as RPing.

			I've been using a technique very very very similar to this. Except I don't use my soul.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  Instead I actually locate the object with energy and then charge it with psi. For example: if I'm sitting on a chair and the psi wheel is on a table, I send my energy down through the chair; across the floor to the table; up the table's legs; across the table to the the psiwheel; up the thumb tack; then to the paper. When my energy gets to the psi wheel it's still attached to the rest of my energy, so then I'm able to move the psi wheel as if it were my appendage. I can actually feel the table and floor and psi wheel.

			Check my commonplace topic in general discussion. It shows how buddhism is connected with every aspect of psi. It's good that other people are also making the connection like you just did.

wouldnt it make more sense to shoot the psi through the air?

To you it would. For me it is easier to pinpoint something through solid objects than through air particles. My visualization is not as good as I want it to be.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
