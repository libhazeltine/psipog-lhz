			After experimenting with the Psi Wheel, and wanting to move onto other things, what would you suggest that I try next?
<br />

<br />
I heard that spending too much time on the psi wheel can have negative effects on ur TK later, so im wondering what i should do next?

			It doesn't have any negative reprecussions as far as I know.  If you feel you are ready, go ahead and do some constructs, move some more advanced objects (try a toothpick and work your way up), or try some telepathy or empathy if you feel up to it.  Even though you are moving on, don't feel afraid to go back to the basics.

			UltimaDuck, alot of people now believe that focusing to much on spinning the psiwheel can cause you to create a mental barrier on rolling or sliding everything.  Droshi suggests that you should go onto a pen and then go back to the psiwheel and it will spin much more but dont spend too much time on it, or so I've been told.
<br />

<br />
Good luck,
<br />
Brandon

			I spent about two months on the psiwheel, sometimes practicing other things, but mainly focusing on the psiwheel because it was the only thing that moved.  Now I don't seem to be able to move anything else, so I think spending too long on the psiwheel can cause your subonscious to get too used to spinning or something.
<br />

<br />
Anyone have any suggestions as to <span style="font-style: italic">how</span> to move on to rolling/sliding?
<br />

<br />
Edit: I've just moved a drinking straw on the edge of my desk; it's the only thing I've moved other than the psiwheel, and I'm quite excited.  It spins towards any part of my body I have near it (I think).  I've been practicing rolling a can too, but it's a lot harder.  I'd suggest a drinking straw as the next step after the psiwheel.
<br />

<br />
Edit: Darn, I just remembered straws are static! <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" />

			what I'm using for practice for &quot;life beyond the wheel&quot; is a .25 gram 6mm plastic airsoft pellet. I've had no success so far, but when i am able to move it i can go up to the higher BB weights. I think its a spiffy way to guage your progress.

			too much time on the psiwheel can make you <span style="font-style: italic">feel</span> like all you can move is the psiwheel, but it's all mental.  i suggest practicing with the psiwheel until you can move it in one direction for a couple spins, stop it completely, then move it the other direction...but if it takes you too long (more than a month) to do this, go ahead and move on to what <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> think is the next step (for yourself).  i suggest what WildgOphers said about the BB, that's what i'm focusing on now.  it is light-weight, and easy to move on to.  but you should listen to yourself and move on when you think you're ready, and what you think you should move onto.  all you can do is guide and offer suggestions, you have to fill in the blanks  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
