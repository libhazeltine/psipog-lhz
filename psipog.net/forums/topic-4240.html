			I had 3 dreams similar to this one. This is what happens.  Im in a car driving to sum house to pick up my niece, i pick her up and my nieces friend sister. They get in the car and i look down the block and i see the dawn of the dead people running towards us (scariest thing in the world). This time the girl is driving and im tryin to roll up the windows fast cause the zombies are trying to get in by the window. Anyways for some reason i teleport out of that spot and end up in a mall with normal people.  I look around feverisly and i find my sister, i tell her that everyone turned evil and at that very moment everyone turned at us and they're eyes were red. After that i woke up.  I had 3 dreams similar to the whole zombie thing and me never gettin killed but the fear in the dream is crazy. i over came it though.! peace.

			So far the worst dream would have to be Donald Duck drowning me in a whirlpool. Still creeps the hell outta me.
<br />
Promagic, the movie is called Dawn of the Dead, one of the best zombie movies imo, seems logical that the zombies RUN at their targets, as opposed to slowly walking, begging for brains..
<br />
Anyway, other &quot;end of the world&quot; dreams would have to be just walking to 7/11, when you see a missle come from the sky, land in the forest far away from you, then seeing the explosion of white light. The explosion hits you, you can't think, you can't feel, everything feels mindless, but free. Bleh.

			<img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> i herd that if you die in a dream you die in real life. because it scares you so much you have a hart attack or something, dunno its probably wrong... has anyone else heard that ??

			Well I'm living proof that that's wrong. I once was in a dream where I drowned, and for some reason I didn't wake up after I died. So, it'll just frighten you a bit, I suppose.
<br />

<br />
If you're 90-some-odd years old, you may have a heart attack.

			always when I die in a dream I wake up short before it.
<br />
for example when I jump off a building I wake up short before the impact.
<br />
I supose it is because dreams are basicaly only things that you have experienced sometime in your life but mixed up.
<br />
And I supose you wake up cause you never expirienced the impact from such a distance. So probably if you fell from a high place and hurt your self then you would dream that aswell.
<br />

<br />
Just something I think

			(Yeah I know) I had to come with the weird post but its &quot;wet&quot; dreams.  Espacially in the summer it makes me feel lonely/depressed when I dont wanna feel it either though I know my mood was triggered by a dream.

			Haha. I hate those dreams where your falling or something and right before you die you jerk awake. Those scare the sh!t out of me. I had this one dream there was this cannibal that looked like Darth Maul from Star Wars episode 1 (no Im not a SW fan but I have seen it) except this guy was much more fat. I was running on this roof hiding and stuff I look down and he is running around the ground looking for me I turn around and there he is! He picks me up by my legs (i somehow stay straight in the air) and tries to eat me in a very scary spot first! But right before he takes a bite I wake up. My questions are: WHAT THE FUC?! 
<br />
and: HOW F'ED UP IS THAT?! <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  Trust me if you think you have had a scary dream then that is barney compared to this. (That was the short version) and I was only 12 when I had this dream to. (Im 15 now)
<br />

<br />
I had dreams like that about 3-5 times

			That's nothing.  I had a dream that I was paralyzed and Kermit the Frog was going to eat me, but before he could, he had to turn on his stereo system.
<br />

<br />
I also had a dream that Mickey Mouse came out of the bathroom and killled my brother after he messed with Mickey's mixing board.
<br />

<br />
I had yet another dream where I saw a bunch of soldiers aiming at something through my window.  I turned around and saw some <span style="font-style: italic">thing</span> with sunglasses and seaweed-like hair.  It immediately killed me.
<br />

<br />
There was also one where I befriended a plastic industrial garbage can.  We promptly teamed up to fight against an anthromorphic number one.
<br />

<br />
All of those dreams I had around the time I was in preschool.

			I have dreams in which i die all the time. i had a lucid one once. i was in a train station after i died, and thats where the lucidness kinda kicked in. I made TNT appear all over the place and blew it up because that place was pretty darn scary. After the explosion, i woke up.
