			Ok so i was just remembering about a time wayy before i knew about psionics when i was sitting at my mommies office with one of my kid sisters. We started to flip a coin and guess the outcome as a way to break the boredom.
<br />
Anyways. We did it about 10 times each and got them wrong everytimes. At that point i started saying the complete oposite of the side i was thinking of. It worked so i said it outloud. It worked for my sister as well. It got to the point were it was kinda freaky-ish and by that time we knew we were just pushing out luck. I wanna say we were right about 15 to 20 times in a row. It was alot.
<br />
Slowley we started losing it. Every other 5 flips were wrong then every 4 then every 3 and so on..
<br />

<br />
so im wondering why it worked this way for both of us? why we both had to say the oposite of what were thinking of saying to get it right? has it happened to anyone else here?

			ummm, i guess you could call this &quot;micro pk&quot;.  i cant honestly cant do this, but i suppose you could practice it <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
oh, and i think this belongs in the &quot;psychokinesis&quot; forum,...
<br />

<br />

			yea this is pychokinesis dude, ur kinda doing a subc micro-pk like sayspo said so you think ur not doin real precog, just think u are.
<br />

<br />
i am actually great at micro-pk, i can get a coin to flip on whatever side i want it to, i can flip up to five coins and get atleast 3-4 on the side i want.i can also do the card removal thing and get down to the last say 12 cards.
<br />

<br />
practising this is very fun and it can be very useful, especially if it depends on a coin toss  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> its also a great skill to have in poker if you happen to be the dealer...lol but i suggest moving on to macro-pk afterwards because setting things on fire is so much more fun  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

			ya. easy trick. put the coin on the same side before you begin to flip it. then use the same ammount of force (to the same height = same ammount of flips) to put it in the air and every time you'll get the same outcome.

Why the hell are you even here. All your posts are negative, and your a downright asshole to everyone. Seriously, stop being a dick and respect people.
