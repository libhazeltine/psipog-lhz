			Hi all, didn't know where to post this as I'm new and don't know if ny1 mentioned this.. I was talking to a friend of mine and told me he was doing remote viewing to communicate with aliens.. 
<br />

<br />
He managed to contact a little green alien and was exchanging info with him, when all of a sudden a huge reptile appeared and cut his connection. the reptile was hostile and he came to conciousness as he felt some pain in his head as if someone was scanning his brain.  he went to remote viewing again and the reptile appeared again with the same result.  
<br />

<br />
Upon further investigation he found out about the reptillians.  He was talking to a friend of his and told him she was actually tortured by the reptillians one day.. does anyone know anything about this, concequences, what they are etc...? and has anyone ever encountered them?
<br />

<br />
thanks

First off, remote viewing is a military-devised protocol for focusing attention in such a way that a clairvoyant effect is produced.  Remote viewing would NOT be used to communicate, it would be used to view people/places/things in close or far away areas.  Telepathy is what would be used to contact an alien, if said alien contact were possible.
<br />

<br />
Secondly, your friends have probably been reading too much David Icke material.  For those that don't know, David Icke believes that there is a race of reptilian aliens that currently hold power in the upper echelons of international society, such as presidents and politicians.  If I'm not mistaken, David Icke's belief's are derived from the theories of Zacharia Sitchin who, in his book Chariot of the Gods, put forth the idea that human DNA was tampered with by extraterrestrials to make us the sentient beings that we are today.
<br />

<br />
I would remain highly skeptical of these theories, and of the claims of your friends.

			well, yes, theories, but like i myself, have not read anything about david ickle or whatever, and know reptillians exist... well, i dont call them reptillians, i call them Draconians... lol but the same difference to me anyways.
<br />

<br />
people put too my exaggerated &quot;opinions&quot; on certain things to make them sound fantasy like... or incredibly unbelievable lol... just go by what you know, dont listen to anyone else <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
and when i personally remote view somewhere, i can hear what is being said there. or the noise there... so that in itself is not telepathy, or part of remote viewing, i dont know what it is... (unless of course, somehow the other persons conscience is sending out the noise they are receiving also, inwhich, i would think is wierd lmao)
<br />

<br />
now about the whole politicians being reptillian... eh, maybe maybenot, i havnt seen anything to say they are or are not lol...
<br />

<br />
im not sure about little green aliens LOL... but yeah, i was just putting in my 2 cents and my opinions that draconians are real and so is hearing what is being said or surrounding noise in a place where remote viewing... and i say my &quot;opinion&quot; because, eh, its not fact, its just what i know and cant show you lol
