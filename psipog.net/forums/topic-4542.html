			I've had many many astral-projections over the course of the last 5 or so years. Over that time, I've seen and experienced the wonders associated with this phenomenon. I've met &quot;demons&quot;, spirit ?guides, and energies found in the astral layers. Here's one for you all to check out and comment. I've posted this story on another website. I decided to copy/paste it cause it would be a pain to re-type it all out again.
<br />

<br />
This is a real story, not some made up flight of fancy. This did happen, and I remember it as if it were yesterday-
<br />

<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
The first encounter with an entity happened about a couple of years ago or so. I was sleeping when I found myself slightly woken to my father comming home from work. I usually hear his keys click against one another when he's about to open the door downstairs. Anyhoo, he does his usual thing by turning on the hallway light and then sit on the stairs to take off his shoes. When the light was turned on, I was woken even further to the point of me being able to see the light was turned on, and I turned my attention to my open bedroom door. Apparently I awoke to find myself in an astral state. Totally clear, focused, and consious.
<br />

<br />
The first thing I noticed when I looked at the door was a dotted black mass swirl and take the shape of a person riding a camel, a dromedarie to be exact. When the camel came in my room, its head was bobbing slowly up and down as it started to walk past my feild of view. The entire figure was like a silouette, but I could tell there was someone riding the camel. The camel/figure had a well defined egde, except for the head of the rider, the riders head was vibrating back and forth very fast.
<br />

<br />
Truly an amazing sight to behold.
<br />

<br />
I imagine that if others would have seen the same thing they would have freaked out bad. I on the other hand wasn't scared, it was more like sheer wonder and awe. I felt no evil, or malice from this entity, just a relaxed calm as it passed me by.
<br />

<br />
THEN the entity stopped in it's tracks. It must have noticed me noticing it. It checked me out as I checked it out. After a few seconds, it continued on it's way. and I slipped back into unconsiousness just as my dad was making his way upstairs.
<br />

<br />
After a few days of mezmerizing over my experience, I decided to do some research online. I went to a few wiccan/occult chatrooms and told my story. Someone said that I have came across what as known as &quot;The Shax&quot;. So, I looked it up and seen the image of the demon in question. It sort of looked like what I have saw, but not really. I knew I saw a camel, and a small figure riding it. The Shax's image is a stork with a horse. So I went ahead and clicked randomly on the demon names to see the images.
<br />

<br />
And then I found him, Paimon.
<br />

<br />
THIS is who I saw that night. The silouette matches much better with this image than any other. The camel with the small rider who was wearing a large crown.
<br />

<br />
I wish I would have noticed a forum section on this site a long time ago. I would have been glad to put this for all to read then. Better late than never I suppose.
<br />

<br />
But- I feel that this was a chance encounter and consider myself very lucky to be allowed the privilege to know of entities just beyond our general perception. I would love to have an extended &quot;sit-down&quot; with Paimon, at his own leasure of course. I'm sure he has business to attend to like anyone else and it would be rude to yank him away from his life. Whenever I project, and have the presence of mind, I try to politely call out to him to see if he's in the mood to talk. So far, nothing yet as far as a &quot;sit-down&quot; but I think I saw him a couple more times and even spoke with him on matters that I forgot about.
<br />

<br />
But that is another story all togeather for another post.

			Nice experience, but dont you think talking to a demon is kinda uhhh weird?
<br />
I just looked him up in Wikipedia and it said he is one of the Kings in Hell and some other things that wouldnt want to make me talk to him lol.
<br />
  Just watch out

			Careful, talking about demons, hell, will be labeled as speaking about religion, wich will get this thread locked. Therefore I propose we refer to Paimon as an entity.

			I see what you mean regarding religious references. I didn't mean it that way, but its such a common phrase to use for an entity that has been described that way.
<br />

<br />
From now on I'll describe all spirits as entities.

There is indeed, a picture of Paimon
<br />

<br />
But, what would Paimon being doing in your house.  After doing some research, Paimon is the more faithful servent to Lucifer.  If I knew this, I would definately find out why he was in my house.
<br />

<br />
He certainly wasn't after you, but someone in that house.

			If Paimon had is gang of demons with him I would be inclined to think so. But he was by himself riding his camel into my room and right through. Except for the pause when he realized I was watching him with my astral eyes.
<br />

<br />
I hear that Paimon is also reffered to as a &quot;Great Balancer&quot;. I'm not sure if the written history on his nature is so accurate. Remember that people tend to say bad things about stuff they don't understand out of fear.

			Maybe it's not a matter of how many houses, but how many people are putting off more energy than others? I did some research and the number of people that tend to have a more &quot;elevated&quot; sense of the &quot;other side&quot; or being energy sensitive is about 4% of the general population. The people actually working on improving thier energy skills may be about than 1 out of 500 people.

<br />
Lets imagine that you are standing on a massive floor (1000ftx1000ft) and you are in the center. Now filling the floor up are a bunch of puppies. They all look the same, sounds the same, and move the same and they all remain in the sitted position. Now if one puppy stands up you are going to notice it right away and your gonna wanna see whats up with it and you walk over to investigate.
<br />

<br />
I think thats basicly the same thing with &quot;us&quot; attracting these entities more likely than your average person.
<br />

<br />
I didn't call, summon, or think about Paimon when this happened. It just did. I'm not gonna start messing around potentially pissing off entities just to satisfy my feeble curiosity. Until I know how to properly protect myself and to show the respect to these beings, I'm not gonna do something stupid and tee-off anything that can mess my life up.
<br />

<br />
It's nice to talk about this and get some response. Thanx, keep it up <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
