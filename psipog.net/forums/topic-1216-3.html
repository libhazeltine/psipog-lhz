			I was pretty skeptical of this at first two, but I think it's really worth a look after going through most of it.  If anything else, just listen to it before you go to sleep.  I got such an amazing rest after listening to the relaxation portion and then going to sleep.  I think it might help a little towards PK, but I'll post later if there's any huge change.

			What exactly did he mean by the trigger? When we put our thumbs and forefingers into the mudra position and use the trigger word &quot;psychokinesis&quot;, is this supposed to help us very quickly reach an altered state of consciousness, focus on the psychokinetic action that we want to happen as to make it happen sooner/more thoroughly, or both? If the former, do we focus on PK once we reach that state? If the latter, do we have to assume this position and use the trigger word to perform PK (according to him)?
<br />
   God bless,
<br />
       Alex
<br />

<br />
p.s.-I've been using this program once a day for 6 days now, and while it's too soon to be sure, I think I've noticed some postiive, however small, changes ... I could control the pinwheel a bit easier, seemingly affected some pool (billiards) shots subtly, had very favorable dice-rolling at a group board game, and had an unusually high number of green traffic lights when I've wanted to.

			ya it just seems like things are going in my favor... im done with my week and have a feeling i have reached my natural state of mind.
<br />

<br />
The PK trigger word is just post programming condition response. So when you use the mudra technique and slip into your altered state of mind, just do what he did. 
<br />

<br />
Whats next after the deep breathing? The opening, balancing and charging of your chakras. Do that at a speed you feel comfortable with. After about 6 or 7 days that should be pretty quick. After the chakras, then you put your self in a trance by counting down from 7 twice while invisioning yourself going deeper and deeper. Then you are done with the exception of what you want to do while in that altered state.
<br />

<br />
After a while it will become second nature to do all of that in a matter of 15 minutes and then you can put more of your time towards your activity. The post programming response is just a beleif technique in my opinion. Along with the positive reinforcement and the repeat technique. He is just trying to hypnotize you into beleiving you can refine your pyscokinetic ability and acheive beyond your dreams. And you can!

			I downloaded it and then put it on my Ipod.
<br />

<br />
I listened to it for a while (the medidation tracks) and I thought that they were really good.  I felt very well rested after one track-- The guys voice is enough to get you relaxed.  The medidation part is just extra <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
When it comes to affecting psi activity--
<br />

<br />
I had practiced psi enough a year ago so that I could spin a foil wheel and make a paper one move around a bit...  Since then I haven't practiced at all.  Before the medidation I could barely get the foil wheel to move.  After it however I was able to sort of &quot;connect&quot; one side of it to my finger.  And when I moved my finger a bit, the wheel would follow.
<br />

<br />
I even got it to spin for a bit with just putting my hand next to it.  
<br />

<br />
All in all I think the 30 mins I spent medidating did a lotta good.  I feel as though there is like a state of mind that I can sometimes find...  When I'm in it I can move the wheel very easily.  If I'm not then I can't do anything.  This CD will help you find it  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

Look at the first page of the topic.

Someone put the things that the guy says.  Almost all of the things he says.
<br />

<br />
The other parts that aren't written are just the medidation sequences...

It's normal, it happens to me all the time when i meditate, i think it happens because you somehow get disoriented.
