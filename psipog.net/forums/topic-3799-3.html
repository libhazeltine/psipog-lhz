does sound a little fluffy, bringing back the dead, i can see the movie now, DAWN OF THE ANTS........but on a serious note, you would have to be quite advanced i should think, ive never heard of a construct that could bring things back to life.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />
For a dead physical being, physical systems would need to be rebuilt to restore functionality.
<br />
^
<br />
This would be energy-to-matter.
<br />

<br />
If you ressurected an ant, I'd call you Jesus-Christ-the-second, but I don't see it happening.

			Joshy can i just say that if you have an OBE you enter a spectral form. If you can enter this form then maybe you can see her spirit again. </span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody"></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

			Hi
<br />
I have quite a bit of experience in this field, not that I have personally brought anyone back, but I have seen in happen and I know the details.
<br />
I am not going to go too deep into the details, if anyone needs more details feel free to pm me.
<br />

<br />
First of let me say that if you use the following technique you are on your own and solely responsible for anything that may or may not happen and I or anyone else will not take any responsibility. Please keep in mind that you are dealing with powers far greater than those experinced in everyday psionics.
<br />

<br />
Ok now let me start
<br />
step1: scan the body of the person and see if all the &quot;chackras&quot; are intact, if they are not you can try to revive the &quot;chackras&quot;. If the chackras are intact or you are able to revive them move to step 2 but if not then there is no way to get the person back.
<br />
 
<br />
step 2: OBE , get to the astral plane then broadcast for the dead person to come and see you (use the name that you always used to call them with) also in your bradcast state who you are. then wait a reasonable amount of time, 30 secs should be about enough,.
<br />

<br />
If the person does not come, Scan the persons home, and any place the person used to go often such as friends houses, relatives houses and so forth and see if you can find the person.
<br />

<br />
If you find the person anywhere proceed to step 3 but if you can't find the person anywhere then that person has moved on(to wherever) and nothing can be done about that person.
<br />

<br />
step3:
<br />
when person comes ask if he/she want to come back, tell him/her you are there to help them, etc,etc whatever you think will make the person feel better.
<br />

<br />
If the person states that he/she does not want to come back then thats it, theres nothing you can do.
<br />
If the person shows interest in coming back then tell the person you will come to get them later then continue with step 4.
<br />

<br />
step 4:
<br />
scan the persons body and either find the reason the person died and repair that cause, if you can't get someone who can(like maybe a medical team).
<br />

<br />
step5:
<br />
make sure the body of the dead person is free to move if need be also make sure that someone is near the persons body to help him/her when he/she wakes up.
<br />
go to the dead person as you did in step 2.
<br />
get the person to come and enter his/her body.
<br />
If all goes well the person should wake up. 
<br />

<br />
extra warnings:
<br />
The person may need to be looked after for a few days as the person will most certainly feel weak and sick for at least a few days.
<br />

<br />
In extreme cases where you have got the person just before the person &quot;moved on&quot; the person will have forgotton everyone and everything and will need to be reminded of everything and may take weeks or months to remember everything.
