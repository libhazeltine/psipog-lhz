			WOW Holy hell!  I was experimenting with Pyrokinesis with a lighter.  Had it on for about 2 minutes, when I was able to get the flame to flicker on, and off.  Suddenly, the top of the lighter just fucking fell off.  Either it was a result of me holding down the spring too long or something, or I accidentally did it, no idea, but it was almost as cool as it was agrovating lol.

			I'm sure this is possible, but for me, not yet.  I have only been able to put out a flame on a match (I think I did it like second time I tried) by just cupping my hand to the side of it and visualizing stuff (not sure what stuff..lol) coming out of my hand and onto the match so it would burn it out.  
<br />

<br />
Starting a fire seems like it could get out of hand though...so maybe that's why I can't do it, because of fear <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> .
<br />

<br />
Good luck to you if you try and proceed with it!  Let us know what happens.

			Yeah I'll definitly work on it, after that lil display.  The only thing I can see hindering it, is that actually creating enough heat energy to spawn a flame, would take an enormous amount of...heat energy.

			I'd use a candle though.  I've experimented with matches, it mightve been me but I doubt it.  Sometimes near the bottom they would just burn out because they don't have enough &quot;juice&quot; i guess.

			I recently read a book about Shaolin kung fu and different methods of attaining unique kung fu skills, and one of them was &quot;punching flame art,&quot; or punching at a candle and extinguishing it from a far distance. 
<br />
   It involves focusing on the dantien (that's where psi/ chi comes from, the point in the abdomen a few inches below the navel) whle in the horse stance and punching in the direction of the candle, which, after practice, will extinguish the candle. Once it can be put out in one try whenever you feel like it, increase the distance by eight paces, continuing the practice in this manner until the flame will go out from a very far distance; then, the art is mastered. I takes about a year to master, which is a very small amount of time for the various skills. 
<br />
  They say once it's mastered, you can punch people without touching them, but I think it's some kind of metaphor. You could potentially accomplish the same training in a chi stance, pushing out an open palm, but if you feel like doing it, I suggest you follow the Shaolin training as close as you are able.

			Sounds interesting.  But I don't want to have to be in some crouching tiger wacky position and then punch at the air to put a flame out lol...I'd rather just use my breath <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			You don't have to be in a kung fu stance to do it, that's probably an overlap of leg conditioning in the Shaolin style. I said in the end of that post that you could probably train the same skill standing and pushing out your open palm.
