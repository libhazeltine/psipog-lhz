yes i was thinking that too
<br />

<br />
1) they wont have any conspect of whats &quot;supost&quot; to be posible so they wont have any dout.
<br />
2) i wish i had had the chance to learn from that age so i hope they would
<br />
3) even if they decide to stop practacing psi, starting from such a young age would make it easyer for them to continue if they ever decided to take it back up later on. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

Oh god, The spelling! My eyes! Burning!  <span style="font-style: italic">anyway</span>.
<br />
I would tell my kids, if I have any, But in no way would I force it upon them.
<br />
I wouldn't want anything like that forced upon me, So I won't do it to them.

			I had the funny idea of thinking it's a unique thing only few would have, and they should use it responsibly. I can see a bunch of people nagging at me now on how bad of an idea that is... or is it? If we taught them to use it as if it was apart of them, would that be a forced thing?

			I figure I'll raise my children on Psi, make it such an integral part of life that they don't think it's such an &quot;imposssibility&quot;. That being said, they're also being taught ethics. No Telepathic Leaning (to get teachers and peers to do their bidding), no infringing on others privacy, no attacking people with Psi, and the like. I figure it's not really forcing Psi on them if that's how they're raised.
<br />

<br />
And can you imagine the benefits of teaching them to meditate from an early age? They'll be able to control excess energy and stay still and quiet! The teachers will love them!

Nothing you do is going to make you &quot;cool&quot;. I also do not appreciate your ignorance on this topic. I'm asking you, as a moderator, to please refrain from spreading any hate-filled messages involving any religions and ethnicities as they are EXTREMELY offensive, and ignorant. I suggest that you read into the semantics of what you just said and analyse how and why that statement is so Ignorant.
