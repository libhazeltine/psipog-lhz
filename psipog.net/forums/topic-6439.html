			I joined the forum a while ago to practice PK, then stopped for a while, then started practicing psi-balls again last month, and now I'm trying to OBE. I haven't been practicing that long, but I'm hitting a wall right now. 
<br />

<br />
I meditate every night before go to sleep , and I have no trouble clearing my mind. I recently started substituting meditation for OBE. But when I get to the point where my body is a sleep, and random thoughts just start pouring out. I try to clear my mind, but it only stays that way for a second and then the thoughts come back. It gets to the point where I just get fed up and go to sleep. 
<br />

<br />
Is there any remedy to this?

and practice, and practice some more.
<br />

<br />
It took me about a year of practice to consistently be able to regularly and reliably achieve and maintain emptiness of mind. Now it's second nature to me.
<br />

<br />
If PsiPog were still accepting new articles, I'd write one on helpful hints, tips, exercises, and techniques for OBE... I wrote a post that would have qualified before; unfortunately it's been deleted since then (posts get deleted on this board after a couple of months).
<br />

<br />
Some tips:
<br />

<br />
1) Before you do anything, decide where and in what body position you are going to conduct OBE practice. This may or may not be the same place you sleep. I'd reccomend that, if you do OBE practice where you sleep, try to find a different body position from how you usually sleep that is still comfortable to hold for a long period of time. For example, I practice OBE in bed, on my back, arms at my side and legs straight. I sleep on my side.
<br />

<br />
Always do anything relating to OBE in this place and position. It will create a subconscious link between that place/position and OBE, and will make it that much easier for you to consistently achieve positive results.
<br />

<br />
2) A common mistake (one that I make all the time) is to practice OBE while sleepy at night. The correct physical and mental status for OBE practice is more relaxed than sleepy. If you have the discipline (I don't), a good time to practice is in the morning, an hour earlier than you would normally get up. Set an alarm specifically for this purpose. When the alarm rings, get up out of bed, maybe get something to drink or something, walk around or sit down or something to dispel that initial desire to go back to sleep, then go back to bed (or wherever you practice OBE) and practice OBE then.
<br />

<br />
Your subconscious is much more active at night than in the morning.
<br />

<br />
A couple of exercises that I suggest - remember, always do these in your &quot;OBE place&quot;:
<br />

<br />
A) Breathe in and out normally. In your head, count &quot;one&quot; as you breathe in, and &quot;two&quot; as you breathe out... in &quot;three&quot;, out &quot;four&quot;, in &quot;five&quot;, out &quot;six&quot;, and so on. Do that until you reach 100. Then, continue breathing, but don't count. Keep the silent, focused yet unfocused state of mind that you had after you finished counting for as long as possible.
<br />

<br />
B) Imagine yourself floating in a vast void with no beginning and no end. The void is completely empty. There is no light, no sound. You are the only thing in the void. Make yourself feel as if you are floating in this void. Your mind is in the void. There are no thoughts in the void. Hold this state for as long as possible. If any extraneous thoughts flow in, let them flow out in the same way.
<br />

<br />
Mostly, however, it takes practice and mental discipline to be able to regularly achieve what I call &quot;emptiness&quot;. Eventually, with enough practice, you'll get it.

It does take a bit of concentration at first, but gets easier with practice. Speaking of practice, sounds like you need more of it.
