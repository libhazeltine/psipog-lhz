I had the problem described above, where I couldent move on from the psiwheel because I had looked for so many different types of effect in it. When I would attempt pencils, I could periodically feel that it could work, but the mindset didnt come with the same expectation, and I eventually gave up. Ill practice this state of mind you gave to us, and see what I can make of it in myself. Thanks again.

So he said he moved a car door. I'm not going to argue what I personally think is possible here but cut him some slack. What if he did? If you think he's lying just ignore it.

			Actually, when I said he couldn't move cars, I meant logs. His lack of punctuation made it difficult to tell what he was talking about.

I still don't believe the car door bit though.

			He's only harming himself by posting nonsense. I do not mean to disclaim him, but his claims are rather farfetched, and while I can't say for certain that he's lying, it's definitely a favorable probability.
<br />

<br />
But really guys, who cares? Him and more than likely some other people out there are just living little fairy tales through the chat and forums of psipog.net. They probably would really like to be able to do such &quot;fantastical&quot; things as psychokinesis, but because they view those things as &quot;supernatural&quot; or &quot;inconcievable&quot; or &quot;fantasies and imaginings&quot;, it gets to them, and pollutes their minds. Then they start to lie about it, and in serious cases, they probably even convince themselves it's true.
<br />

<br />
I've witnessed lots of whack sh*t in my time, but i'm not claiming responsibility for any of it. Thing is though, weird things happen all the time, and that's a fact. So I just find it hard to completely discredit even nutbars like Psykiller.
<br />

<br />
Someday, maybe I'll move a paperclip, and i'll be sure to tell you all about it... but if I ever am able to move a car door or a tv set or whatever, I think I'll keep that to myself, lol.

I really appreciate that comment!  Our subconcious seems to be free to direct so much more change than our concious mind.  I would guess that this is because of the years of conditioning we have undergone, which tell us &quot;PK is not possible&quot; or perhaps, that you must physically interact with an object to cause it's motion.  You see it every single day: somebody wants to pick something up, so they reach down and grab it with their hand.
<br />

<br />
We are subject to literally millions of these little clues that our mind gathers and accepts.  If you want to move something, you've got to touch it.  Your subconcious mind is not subject to this training in the same manner, however, and it takes far less work to free it from that assumption.
<br />

<br />
I love the way you've explained it, NI.  The concepts are definately legit, even if the skeptics don't like your snapshots.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Keep up the awesome work!

			NI, it took me some time to learn the &quot;just do it&quot; approach to TK, and I only figured it out after a good bit of *--No effect at all--*  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> It's thanks to the insight you provided that I am now successful at TK, and this post has helped me reach even further. Thanks man.

			Hey NI, this opened up my mind a bit, and I'm pretty certain that I'll be able to finally achieve TK again soon, after I rest my tired and pounding head of course. I remember just letting go a year ago after I gained the concentration, looking at it and watching it do what it did. I didn't care what direction it moved in, I just wanted it to move.
<br />

<br />
But then, I came out of the bathroom one day and it was moving, seemingly by itself. Usually it only moved if I sat in a certain place with my hand around it, so I got suspicious that it was the wind, like I had found an air flow in my room that I couldn't detect but had been moving it this entire time. So I tried to move it under something. That didn't work, so I gave up completely. But now I'm back, not sure why in particular I came back....I just really want Telekinesis  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
My ultimate goal is to move something that cannot be moved by wind, to fully convince myself. Actually I'd be satisfied just seeing someone in person move a pencil, that way I could finally get rid of the mental block in my mind that hinders me so greatly, but I doubt there's anyone who can do that in the Sacramento area. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Thanks NI, hopefully I can move the psi-wheel for the first time....Again.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
