			Well...for martial arts, you'd have to be really good in psionics since...you'd bashing at it with your fists. It's not going to be very stable if you're kicking or punching at it.
<br />

<br />
Sure you can, but I don't know how far the capabilities go, it all depends on your skill though.

just thought i would mention that, the forums moderators will lock this if you talk about that.

you can creat a psi human, it would take a looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time to make 1 that looks like a human and moves like a human and is a complete solid. if you did make 1 and kicked it your foot would probablt go through it or bounce of it.... either way you would look dumb... you'd fall on the ground praticaly kicking a mirage..... lol. funny to think of.

I've been constructing one for as long as I've known. Most of them start off as Imaginary friends. My psi human has is not really an Imaginary friend. Its the voice that comes from my subconscios. For now his body is mental and I can go inside of my head a talk to him and possibly fight him. (I hope that didnt sound like I have split personality disorder) <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

Gaara didnt have a split personality. He was possesed by a raccoon demon. And I chose Gaara because I had a bad childhood also(except I didnt kill anyone). 
<br />

<br />
When I go in my mind I don't do Kage Bushin because its <span style="font-weight: bold">MY</span> mind. But if I wanted there to be 20 of me I would just imagine it. My person doesn't look like me because his form is not definite.

			Actually, in my opinion, the idea of fighting oneself is intriguing. This is because, by fighting yourself, you would be able to view yourself objectively and as an opponent would, and notice things you would never see otherwise.
<br />
It would take a very long time to make, and it would require a lot of concentration, but I think that it might actually be a helpful tool. 
<br />

<br />
I, for one, would love the chance to Fence myself. And see how bad my point control really is...
