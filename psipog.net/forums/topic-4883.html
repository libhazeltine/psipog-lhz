			Ok, yeah I know I've been posting alot of &quot;Losts&quot; in a short period of time. But in all liklihood, this stuff was &quot;lost&quot; for months, and I didn't need it until just recently. In any case, I'd like to find it, and would be greatful for your help in the matter.
<br />
and yeah, I've just begun doing the whole coordinates thing, so I MAY be off, but I've got a strong feeling that these coordinates mean this object.

			Do you have a toy box? Possibly that you keep in your closet? I see a closet and in this closet you keep all your little gadgets and things of interest to you. While you were looking through it, you might have placed your headband in there. Look inside. I might be off, but I see boxes and toys and for some reason a black leather couch.

			well leather couch came in last, some it might have been residue to something else I was RV'ing. Do you or do you not have toy boxes where you keep all your toys? If so check around there and your closet. I'm not seeing clearly though. I'm just trying to be helpful.

			k well like I said I'm new to this so don't expect everything I say to be even 30% accurate. Plus I've been practicing PK all afternoon and I'm spent. Good luck finding it.

			Hey,
<br />
I am relativly new to this but I will give it a shot.

I would have to agree with alot people in saying that I saw a closet.  It had white carpet and was filled with &quot;stuff&quot;.  I saw your object underneath or behind that stuff.   Also was it black or blue.

			coordinates are just fine, but when you RV you get mixed images and you have to put them in order to come up with something. Sometimes it's hard, you concentrate on the wrong image and come up with stuff that's irrelevant, like that leather couch I mentionned. We can't always be right. Maybe I associated the leather and the couch to being a leather couch, but it might also be leather boots near a couch or a leather wallet near a couch.
<br />

<br />
But I saw &quot;leather&quot; and &quot;couch&quot; so I automatically put them together, assuming the couch was made of leather. And I just beat my own record for mentionning the words leather and couch in one post.

I appreciate you trying, I really do, but there's no white carpet in this house. And as for the object, (highlight if you want to read)<span style="color: white">it has a blue band though it's a fairly dark blue, I guess &quot;navy&quot; blue.</span>

I know this is going to be a funny request, but any chance you could draw a quick mspaint image of the box, its location relative to the shelving, and the object I want found in relation to those? It could be as simple as a square, a couple lines (The shelf) and an x for the item. This would help be be able to figure out where in the house you're seeing.
