			Who has done what with DMILS? I'm personally interested in going at it myself, but I'd just like to know what you, the board, have done yourselves!

And no, this isn't a &quot;How do I do this?&quot; topic. I just want to know what you've done.

			I've not done much. I've decreased severe pain a little bit, for a limited amount of time, but that's about it.
<br />

<br />
In other words, someone's arm hurt more than I can describe (don't ask, very complicated story), and I helped reduce the pain level. Still hurt more than anything I've ever felt, but it became tolerable for him.
<br />

<br />
Yes, he has a crazy high pain threshold.

			Thats what DMLS mostly is.  I've healed people before.  I can heal myself pretty good.
<br />

<br />
One note thingy.  Reducing pain in your body but not actually healing the injury is just a type of biofeedback.  VERY handy to be able to do, but not dmls, just mastery of the mind.  Aldo the changing eye color and changing other stuff with yoru body is also a form of biofeedback.  Most people horribly blur the line.

			Well, healing is Direct Mental Interaction with a Living System, isn't it?
<br />

<br />
Also, I wasn't reducing pain in my own body, I was doing it in someone else's body, and he wasn't aware of it at the time. He had his eyes screwed up, and his muscles were stiff with pain. He didn't know I was doing it, and it still reduced the pain, and made everything feel really warm.
<br />

<br />
So I'd say it was DMILS.

			OH yeah I got that, I just felt motivated to say that.  I do that sometimes.
<br />

I'm just talking about stimulating your body to do different things.  Things like changing your hair color or somthing outrageous <span style="font-style: italic">would</span> be DMILS becasue your changing the make up of your body.  But unless your stimulating growth/healing, or changing dna or something.  But reducing pain in your own body is just biofeedback, not that biofeedback isn't way cool.  Worth while learning.

			I say, if you're affecting something within your body with just your mind, then it's DMILS as it would be Mind over Matter.
<br />

<br />
Either way, I've made my immunity better itself. 
<br />

<br />
I've increased my memory, or at least, grew more confident of it and able to memorize much better.
<br />

<br />
Sped up healing process of wounds.
<br />

<br />
I think that's about it for me.
