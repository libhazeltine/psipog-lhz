Yeah, we did get off topic BIG time. 
<br />
I don't think we came to a conclusion as to why females live longer. All I know is that there are many theories as to why. And I am open to most.

			ah, and in my post of X vs Y, i said that male is XY and female is XX, right?

X  is more 'healthy', in as the immune system is stronger.

Just because the males don't create the eggs, they only grow/carry (the eggs) and deliver (the eggs/hatched young) doesn't mean that isn't giving birth.  In the definition above, you see that giving birth is the act of delivery, not creation of the egg, which is known as gestation.  The male seahorses DO get pregnant, and they DO carry the eggs, and they DO deliver the young.  I know that this is off-topic, and apparently already &quot;solved,&quot; but I had to reply (college is making me busy, so I'm never on the computer).  And, I'm sorry for being an asshole, but it is annoying to be told I'm wrong when I knew I was right, especially since I was going to be a biology major, and potentially a marine biologist (now I'm a nurse anesthesiast major).

I wish you don't use that form of logic all the time. But seeing the experience you have right now and that your already going up the ladder makes me want to trust you on this. Just always hold on to your limits, your never know when your wrong, untill you see your wrong. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

I understand your point and all of your links and I too always believed this (I am also educated about many animal species), but I know what I saw. The program described it the same way, but <span style="font-style: italic">explained</span> how it is a myth. This program was aired no longer than 8 months ago, and it was many educated people talking about it. (Many marine biologists themselves). All of the links you gave me were from 2002, 2000 or before. I couldn't find a couple of the years. I'm thinking mabye it was new info discovered, but I know what I watched. (Sadly, I searched for the TV program but could not find it) You have your beliefs and I have mine.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			The last link is from March 2006.  But yeah....I just had a terrible day, and when I came on this site, I saw that someone told me I was wrong (although not as hostile as I percieved), so I got pissed.  Sorry for that blatant display of anger, I'll continue in a more civilized manner  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Ok.  Like I said, the last link is from March 2006.  Which is pretty recent(7 months ago).  And tankdown, thank you for your reply.  I don't like using that logic, but I was pissed.  All the TV programs (all 2 of them lol) agreed with me, and all the articles I search on the internet agree as well.  I dunno, I guess I'm just stubborn.
<br />

<br />
derrick, I think we just have different definitions of birth.  My definition (and the dictionary's) is the &quot;deliverance of eggs or hatched young,&quot; which is what the male seahorses do.  They get pregnant, carry the eggs, then deliver the hatched young.  I think your definition is closer to gestation, (or something similar) where it is &quot;the creation of the eggs or fetus.&quot;  Technically, we are both right since we hold different definitions.  I'll let this off-topic topic drop.  I thank you for replying in a nice manner, even though mine was pretty hostile.
