			I believe that psionics is in its own prehistory right now, and this is because it cannot be proved to have any practical application.  In its own way, instinctive need and science are governed by the same force: practicality.  Back in the stone age, stone tools had a practical application, while writing did not.  By the same token right now, directions for how to scan or other techniques are useful, while a means of standardization is not.  I propose a means of writing a specific construct in standardized, replicable form.  The problem with this is the same which was faced before writing was invented: everyone interprets the intended subject matter differently, and communicating with such an abstract medium is impossible because of it.  
<br />

<br />
Now that we have writing, we can declare that the symbol X means a certain thing, but imagine how it must have worked before such a statement was possible.  This is where psionics is.  Every psion in existence right now uses their own mental methodology to interpret each component of their constructs.  This is the same as &quot;heat&quot; being different between two different people.  When you say &quot;heat&quot; to two people, their interpretations and reactions are completely different.  But they both recognize that the word &quot;heat&quot; means, well...  heat.
<br />

<br />
I am NOT suggesting that everyone do things the same way.  I am suggesting that each person recognize that a certain symbol means a certain thing, which they can interpret in their own way, just like words in any language.  But the symbols would instead have a very specific psionic significance, and be organized in such a way that any psion who knows what they mean, and has the skill to duplicate it, can exactly match the construct described by it.  Tell me what you think!

			I believe I understand what you mean; however correct me if I'm wrong. 
<br />

<br />
I believe that you are saying; currently we have to use language; a thing that is generally used to describe thought to describe energy constructs. However; given that constructs are so different from the things language generally describes we are left to our own devices to choose words for it; what one person sees as an attempt to describe what energy feels like is actually off the mark due to the interpretation of the language; however the person who writes and the one who reads may in fact be feeling similar things.
<br />

<br />
What you propose to do is create a set of symbols (an alphabet; if you will) that when combined will help to describe the subtle nuances of an energy construct. For example; one person may describe a construct as &quot;being warm in such a way that brings the taste of oatmeal to mind&quot; however, when another person feels it it feels &quot;warm like the kind of sun that hits a beach&quot;. You wish to create a way that will make it simpler to describe this in a way that people can agree on more than they do currently yes?
<br />

<br />
I also understand you statements about the difficulties of implementing that system at first? Like... we only use the word 'black' to describe something because it's a word everyone has agreed on, we're at the point of forming popular opinion on the differences between constructs, right?
<br />

<br />
Now after I've tried to regurgitate what you said to me back (I apologize profusely for it) here is what I think: I think that it's a good idea. At first I was worried such a thing would be restrictive; the learning process is different for everyone, afterall and I wouldn't want it any other way. However, as I was reading I saw what you meant; I think this is a good idea because it's not meant to be restrictive, it's not meant to tell people how things are <span style="font-style: italic">done</span> per se but instead is a system that, when implemented would describe a person's own experiences to others; how they did it. Again, I think it's a great idea. Now how do we begin...?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
