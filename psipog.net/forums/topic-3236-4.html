Well, not exactly. When I workout, In the arm curl's, let's say that my goal is to lift 30 lbs 30 times. First I start of with a warm-up, with like 25 lbs and lift that 20 times. Then I would lift like 20 lbs 20 times. That's my warm-up. After that I would start my real exercise with 30 lbs around 30 times. If I didn't do a warm-up, I wouldn't be able to lift the 30 lbs that easily. If you don't warm up before lifting something heavy, your muscles will not be ready to lift that kind of weight, so If you warm-up, your muscles are ready.
<br />

<br />
About Criss Angel's physical strength. I'm sure he can lift that taxi. 1) I saw a person lift a cars front part for like 5 seconds. 2) Criss Angels body physique is good. Have you seen the part when he rips the phone book? That looked real to me. Now, about the tree, I don't have a clue about that, It could be fake and it could be real.
<br />

<br />
It's like the Monks. They can punch 3 times faster then a normal person. Meaning they can move much faster then a normal person. They control their mind and body. That is a great power. And similarly, Criss Angel probably can do that also.

Well in that case, he wouldn't warm up by lifting the taxi, he'd warm up by lifting something lighter first. I lift weights myself and my first set is always the strongest because my muscles are fully rested. However, it's most beneficial to do deadlifts or something to get your arms going first. It's better for your muscles to do it that way even though you are wearing them a bit, however I'd still say your muscles are at maximum potential before you lift at all. 
<br />

The phonebook thing, that's probably real. One of my history teachers in highschool could rip a phone book. He could also pick up one of those chair/desk thingies and hold it flat. He had some pretty massive forearms, hehe.

Yes I think they are too. Warming up doesn't make you stronger, it just gets your muscles ready to handle the weight.
<br />

<br />
Criss Angel didn't just wake up one day and say &quot;today i'm gonna lift a taxi.&quot; He made this plan, and he practiced to lift it, little by little. If i'm correct, I think he said that he practiced around 4 to 6 months. That is probably enough time for him to get that strong enough.

  I know he made it. I also happen to know that the DVD that teaches that trick costs $100USD, and that trick was the biggest secret in the entertainment community until it was released. I'm not accusing you of being like that stupid masked magician guy, just a little impolite. I would've posted a link to the website that sells the DVD, personally.

A) Having people here actually believe that he is using PK and saying that it is &quot;awesome&quot; is pathetic.  He admitted that he is a magician and he is for entertainment.
<br />

<br />
B) Criss Angel is cool to watch but HE DOES NOT USE PSIONICS.  As people earlier have stated, he is an ILLUSIONIST.
<br />

<br />
C) All of this stuff is not directed towards you, Sky_Psion.  I just happened to have quoted it for my next bullet point.
<br />

<br />
D) Look at the 6th post on the first page.  I was not the first one to post it.  I did not waste my time to go search for it and i certainly would not buy his DVD and upload it onto the internet.

If Criss Angel really levitated using pk from one building to another, then why does he need to use a gimmick to do a little levitation from thr ground and up to the chair? Wouldn't he tell us that he is doing pk instead of illusions? I don't care if he really can do pk (that's even better if he could), but &quot;EVERY&quot; trick he does can be illusion.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
So that people like you can stop bitching and having theese arguements!
<br />
I mean that levitation involves special pants and sometimes he does it with shorts. Just let this thread die because seriously I never knew you guys were so into skeptism, I'm gonna laugh when you try to show your family and they tell you your a bullshitting fag.

			The point of the show is to freak your mind, Some things are real and somethings are illusion. So if you think the levitation is fake it could be real, vice versa. Why would someone try to say they really use Pk? No one would believe you anyway.

			He resorts to anger because his beliefs are being torn in half, pathetic. Psionics are REAL. Criss Angel does not use them though. I have proven my psionic ability to everyone that I have known so far. Genocide, a better approach is to explain why you think hes real instead of &quot; OMG Cris Anglez is teh pwnzors coz I saw him in perzon!!!&quot; Give us evidence that he would even be remotely real. To get that good in psionics he would have to practice for years. Id be surprised if he would have that much dedication just to throw it away calling himself an illusionist.

			Y'know, we're getting really redundant here. Yes, even myself and Apollo are repeating ourselves too much. The conversation has become as follows:
<br />

<br />
&quot;He's just an illusionist.&quot;
<br />
&quot;No! He uses PK! He's amazing!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Here's a counterexample. Here he admits he's an illusionist by revealing his secret.&quot;
<br />
*watches the video* &quot;He's still amazing! And I still say he uses PK!&quot;
<br />
&quot;He's just a magician.&quot;
<br />
&quot;He's the next Messiah! He uses amazing PK!&quot;
<br />
&quot;He's on TV, of course he's not real!&quot;
<br />

<br />
...et cetera, ad nauseam (and so on, to the point of sickness).
<br />

<br />
We're acting like a bunch of preschoolers here. We've determined, by overwhelming majority, that Chriss Angel is no more than an illusionist, meant solely to entertain, and happens to make a <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">fat packet</span></span> doing so. 
<br />

<br />
So, I'd like to make a request, that we all drop the subject, and that the next mod to read this post locks the thread. Thank you.
