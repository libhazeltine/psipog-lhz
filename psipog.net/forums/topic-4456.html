			K, to be frankly I don't dream much at all.
<br />
When I was little I had a classical falldream (firstperson) where I were to be smashed at the end of the lion king cliff.
<br />
But as I fell closer and closer my view switches to a fly on the wall and I see myself land on my feet and walk away, dream over, nomore dreams for three years.
<br />
Then after about three years, not sure if it's exact, but I begin dreaming again, like I know that I'm dreaming, and it's kinda funny cuz it's like you're watching a movie or something, dont remember the dream unfortunatly.
<br />

<br />
And this other time, which I dont know was dreaming or anything I was going downstairs to take a leak, I was prolly 50% asleep or something cuz I kept seeing my mom and her friend in bedrobes jumping out from several corners and trying to scare me, the corners was about like 4-8cm wide, so noone could've hidden there, but I surprisingly just didn't care about getting scared or anything, since I knew the mind was playing tricks with me, I guess it was like a hallucination of some sort.
<br />

<br />
I've had lots of smaller experiences, but not that worth to mention.
<br />
But I still remember one lucid dream if you may call it that.
<br />
I had a dream where I went back into the past and to the future in an elevator, and to different destinations in a jiff, I was aware it was a dream. but before I woke up I just like got sucked up into space somehow and went to some star figures. dont remember more.

Yeah, was most about my experience with dreams I'm aware of and stuff like that.
<br />
I've read alot of articles, but nothing much about astral projection, lucid dreams and that stuff =)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Though I wonder what I did actually, did I astral project, or was all that stuff just usual dreaming or lucid dreaming? mixed some of my definitions to begin with I think.
