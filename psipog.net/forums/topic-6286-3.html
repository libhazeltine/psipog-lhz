Fail. It's no stupider than other theories that would create a utopia if people didn't suck. Not everyone who says 'anarchy' are 12 year olds running around spray painting A's on everything while saying 'fuk da gubment lol'.

Wow, I can't believe someone else said it.  I'm usually the one who says that people are the weak-link in the theories of Anarchy, Communism and similarly idealistic theories.  Indeed, people as a whole are not mentally, emotionally or spiritually mature enough for such ideologies to be implemented.
<br />

<br />
And I just managed to link Anarchy's and Communism's success to spirituality, how incredibly blasphemous and ironic of me...<img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

I think you should probably read the definition of communism and compare it to the economic system in russia and the definition of Marx. Maybe you'll find a definition that matches Marx's but the USSR will definitely not match what Marx said. Communism is a form of economy in which all property is owned by the community and not individuals. This is supposed to root out ideas of ownership and currency because those ideas cause greed and corruption in capitalism. Marx was trying to fix these problems by finding the source of corruption in the capitalist world and removing those sources from soceity. Communism would remove these sources. That's the end of Marx having a good idea. After that he tried to make a plan of implementing it. He decided that he would have to ease the soceity into communism through another form of economy called socialism. This is where the government seizes all property and is basically all powerful. Then the government deals out food and property equally to everyone. This is supposed to instill the ideas of communism and then when those ideas or integrated into the soceity, the government dissolves since their job is done. Then the newly formed community lives in harmony and sharing. The rebellion in russia was supposed to follow Marx's plan. Lenin could not raise a rebellion if he told the workers that they would be just switching to a government that was exactly the same as the czars, but in the long run, would be good for the people. He couldn't tell them that they were going to socialism and then eventually communism. He told them that they were fighting for communism, and they were, but he downplayed the fact to everybody that he really had to go through socialism first. The world took this to mean that when Lenin died and Stalin took over that Stalin's totalitarian regime was communist. Then the terms got switched for good. Communism meant the Stalin regime and such and socialism was the soceity of equality. That's world ignorance for ya. 
<br />

<br />
Now, I do not follow Marx past his critique of capitalism. First off, how would the government know when to dissolve? There's no way of measuring how the soceital ideas changed. Second, wouldn't capitalist ideas just immigrate back into the soceity from other places? Third, power leads to corruption, a leader with good intentions, like lenin, will not last long. A corrupt leader will take over and then never move the country into communism. I believe that we should gather like minded people, who believe in sharing everything and ,like LightBringer said, people who are mature enough to hold this soceity and not let someone abuse owning everything. Basically, finding good people who know how to share because they know that helping the community, instead of just themselves, is better in the long run. 
<br />

<br />
In conclusion, do your research before you post and don't listen to soceital ideas always; cause they're sometimes wrong. Always go to the first source and find out what they really said.

<br />
No matter what history books say MARX coined the term and MARX described a form of economy that was in no way what russia was. He did in fact describe a form of economy like the USSR and that was called SOCIALISM. He described this as a transitional stage that would shape soceity for COMMUNISM. In COMMUNISM, the government has ZERO control over economy because economy ceases to exist on an individual level. The people as a whole control the economy. Economy will always control government more than the people, even in a democracy. In COMMUNISM the people control the economy. 
<br />

<br />
Here's a broad definition of communism from wiki:
<br />

<br />
Communism is an ideology that seeks to establish a classless, stateless social organization, based upon common ownership of the means of production.
<br />

<br />
It's all about the workers owning the government and the cogs of the economy controlling the country. I want to take this a step further because this will obviously not work. I want to shape soceity enough so that we can have at least some small communities where EVERYTHING is owned by everyone. Also the soceity in these communities will be shaped in such a way that everybody in it will have the goal of bettering the community. 
<br />

<br />
Johnny, that link is exactly what I believe in. Changing soceity so that personal wealth is not a goal. I have to make it more radical to make it even harder for people to even consider that goal.

			Techinically, it's socialist. Was it formed by people calling themselves communists because they truly wanted to follow Marx's plan? Yes. In that case, it's communist. The form of economy in the USSR was not communism though. The form of economy in Russia now is super capitalism. It's in the final stage of capitalism where the companies take over.
