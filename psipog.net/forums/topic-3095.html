			I've discovered something great recently. For hte past few days, I've been trying the TK method you see in all the videos. You know, the one where you cup your hand around the object you're trying to move, usually the psi wheel.
<br />

<br />
Well, I seem to have forgotten how I discovered it already, but I learned that I'm actually better without the hand thing. Coincidentally, I couldn't do anything with my hand around the wheel to begin with. I still can't do much, sorta just make it rock back and forth. Not even really a full quarter turn. Sometimes it'll go a bit farther than that, but not all that often. But hey, progress is progress.
<br />

<br />
This especially pleases me because I was worried I'd have to eventually learn to do it without my hands, since it's really a bit of a nuisance and would be easier to just be able to glance at something and move it.
<br />

<br />
This is also, I suppose, a good tip for newbies having trouble. I've noticed that the hand thing seems to be a very popular method. Well, if that's not working out all too well, try it without. The results have been great for me, and let's face it, you'll wanna get rid of that later, anyway.

			i think the hand thing is sort of a &quot;mental crutch&quot; that later becomes a &quot;mental barrier.&quot;  you really don't need your hands to perform pk, but it makes people feel closer to the object, therefore easier to move.  i think it's great you discovered how to move the psi-wheel without your hands, and it works for you.  for me, it alternates.  sometimes i'm better with my hands, other times i'm not.  sometimes it goes both ways, so i don't use my hands to give them a rest.  try moving the wheel without your hands for a while, then when you can move it 360 degress, try it with your hands (but don't get used to it!)  and observe the results.

			Yeah it's good that you have overcome that. I had been fortunate to not use my hands from the start. I just never used my hands until about a couple weeks after I could move it as an experiment. It made it harder. Just a distraction...
<br />

<br />
Anyway, a great way to get over that mental barrier of using your hands is to try doing it over the webcam. It kind of makes you realise that if you can do it miles and miles away just by looking at the object, why do you need your hands? Plus it's funny to watch your friends going beserk in  the background and shouting &quot;OMFG, IT'S ACTUALLY MOVING , AAAAAAAAAAH&quot;.
