			Ok so i quit TK a wile back and said goodbye to the forums. while today after i got braces put in my mouth they gave me some sleeping stuff to help my pain, and i had an amazing dream about PK. there was a Phoenix (my favorite animal...even though they dont exist) which was talking to me about what i was doing when i used to do PK, it said that i was amazing that i could move the psiwheel in a few days, especially since i didnt ever try psi balls before my PK practice.  Then it went on to tell me that i need to go back to Psipog and read through how to do Psiballs and totally master them before i move on to PK because then i could do incredible thing in an incredibly short amount of time.
<br />

<br />
sorry for going through my dream (i thought it would help describe my situation) but because im in the mood to type im gonna go over my PK history.
<br />

<br />
So i started when the movie X2 came out. i grew an obsession with the X-men and even more obsessed with Jean Grey (the Phoenix who can do &quot;telekinesis&quot; and telepathy) and had a thought that doing what Jean Grey did was possible in real life (which was odd because I've never had any thought like that before....ever) and decided to do the only thing i new how to do at that time and Google it. What i found was a bunch of bogus sites and fake things. But not giving up i searched more untill i found Psipog.net and once i saw it i felt like this was an authentic site, without even looking through it. I went to the beginners page and read about Psi balls. But i thought that Psi Balls was too boring and decided to skip to PK (at the time i was very impatient).
<br />

<br />
Woah i just read all that i have written and am totally amazed because i noticed that it doesnt really help you to help me. Let me tell you what really happened with it.
<br />

<br />
I started on the Psi Wheel (skipping Psi Balls) and became good at it in like 2 days. i could move it on every try. and within a week i could control it. I thought it was fun and i became confident in myself....actually too confident. What i did was told my supposed &quot;friends&quot; thinking that i could show off to them that i can do PK. What ended up happening was i got laughed at because my &quot;friends&quot; thought i was a complete idiot and made fun of me.  Well after that the news got passed around in a rapid manner. in 2 days people wanted me to do PK for them and pressured me into it. Even my teacher new about it (but i was his &quot;pet student&quot; so he believed everything i said) and told me to bring in my Psi wheel and show him after class was over. Once i did i found out that other kids had to stay after too, and these kids happened to my my &quot;friends&quot;. I was nervous because ive never tried PK in front of people before. And once im nervous i cant concentrate. I could actually feel myself failing at it. I tried in front of these people but couldnt even twitch it (more humiliation). I was so mad at myself, my whole point was to show off in front of people and when i tried i totally locked up. I became strong and ignored the people making fun of me. I continued my PK practice in a successful manner. But after school was out and i had nobody to make fun of me i began to double think my PK practice and think that maybe the heat from my hands moved the Psi wheel. Not to mention i was getting pretty bored moving only a Psi Wheel (i became pretty independent and didnt realize i could proboaly have moved up to pencils or something). So before i quit i figured i would tell someone i truly trust about my ability. so i told my mom, and she said she believed me but acted like she didnt. so i showed her and she said that all i did was breath on it without realizing it.
<br />

<br />
and from there was the end of my TK pracitice.... actually after about a few months i got back on PsiPog and searched then tried a little PK, i failed at it. I tried again later....failed. and thats when I finally came on the forums and said &quot;good-bye&quot;.  And had a lng break till I had my PK dream just this afternoon.
<br />

<br />
sorry about the long story...i felt inspired by something (i dunno what) to type type type and type some more....plus i had a lot i felt i just had to tell someone. 
<br />

<br />
so now on to my actual question. Based on what you read what should i do? 
<br />

<br />
1) Should i continue on PK skipping Psi Balls again?
<br />
2) Should i master Psi Balls like my dream said?
<br />
or
<br />
3) Should i not do PK at all?
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your time,
<br />

			Hey, well I can give you some advice from my personal experience.  I tried psi balls and thought I made them but I couldnt be sure.  However, you dont have to be able to mke a psiball to do tk.   So I started with tk and I can slightly move the psiwheel.  Anyways, I would suggest starting it up again, and continue with tk unless you WANT to learn psiballs.

<br />
Thanks[/quote]
<br />

<br />
I did the method were you tell your sub-c that the object needs to move butit cant on its own. like tell your sub-c &quot;this peice of paper/foil NEEDS to move&quot;
<br />
*repeat till you have success* but after that my methods changed to the &quot;just   do it method&quot;

			from what I've heard dreams are created by your sub-c and usually have a purpose, and considering your sub-c does control your psyhic ability I would listen to your dream.
