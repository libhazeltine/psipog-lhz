			So I woke up at like 5am or so and tried to go back to sleep. You know when just before you go to sleep you can hear things and stuff, well I think that happend. Anyway I heard someone talking to me, trying to lead me into what I think was a lucid dream.
<br />

<br />
He said, imagin any place you want and go there. Now, this was all before I actually fell asleep so it was a little weird. Then he said &quot;Im going to count to 10 and when I get to 10, you will be there.&quot; I remember actually being skeptical of it but as I tried to focus on the room, it actually came into calrity when he got to 10. I was imagining a just a green room and when I first got in it, I saw him. I can't remember his face but he had some type of grey suit on. Anyway, he told me anything I think of will come true and told me to think of something then proccede through the door. So I did and it worked, anything I thought of would be in the next room. It was cool to say the least...
<br />

I was talking to my friend about it cus it was so weird and he was convinced I went to some higher astral plane and contacted my &quot;astral guide&quot;. Anyone know anything about this? Have you met yours...?
<br />

Its still possible it was just an awesome lucid dream tho

			Astral Guide is the same as your Higher Self? If so I know mine on first name basis, nicely done contacting him like that. Ive never had a lucid dream so theres no actual reality exp. on my end.
