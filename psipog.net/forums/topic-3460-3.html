			Wow I think we've gotten the point about his avatar. 
<br />
The topic seems to have drifted and I'd like to congradulate Xiouslaidyn. A lot are struggaling to get to that point and I'm happy you made it that far. Just curious of how long you have been doing tk. From the way you posted it sounds like you started a few weeks ago and had awsome success. Regardless awsome job.

			Thank you Jynx!
<br />

<br />
I have changed my avatar.  It is only so that these kinds of interruptions of the forum do not happen again.  I want to facilitate education, not debate, conversation, not controversy.  It is not kind for anyone here to have their topic drift to such a debate, this is why I tried to end it awhile back in this forum.  Thank you for your understanding.  
<br />

<br />
Sorry that your topic drifted Xious.  Again, Congrats man!

			back to topic, ive also had an awesome occurence such as the one being talked about. One night, i was only building psi around me for like, 2 hours while watching tv. at one point, it got so dense, that it began to hurt. Like little prickes all over. So, i focused on a stapler(normal size) across the room and pointed my hand at it. It pushed like, 5 inches in no time. I freaked. Tried other stuff too. I controlled 3 mobiles in the other room by looking at them. Spinning left, then right as long as i wanted. $ psiwheels too. After a few pencils of rolling later, i was drained. It took about an hour total, but wow what an hour. Ive never had that experience again, and it seems for the past 4 months, i havent been able to do pk like i used to. Maybey ill get it all back someday.

			Thanks for the positive encouragement everyone!

I would like to take this opportunity (before topic lock) to say that K should be allowed to put whatever the hell he wants as an avatar, even two guys kissing. If you take offense from it, too bad for you. Maybe you need to do a little &quot;soul-searching&quot; and discover why you are offended. Or maybe you just need to think twice and realize that K is just expressing his sexuality via little icon thingy. I've seen lots of types of avatars that I considered offensive, and i never said a damn thing, because it's none of my business.

Back on topic, I am much better at controlling the pinwheel now. I gather energy in my hands similar to forming a psiball. The magnetic push/pull gets stronger and stronger, and the pinwheel moves in both directions randomly and at speeds varying from slow to very fast.
<br />

<br />
I am very pleased wsith my newfound ability to pk.
<br />
I have never practiced it on a regular basis, just every now and then. Never had the confidence and courage i now possess.
<br />

<br />
My ability awakened completely randomly. I made bits of tobacco from a ripped cigarette move while cleaning it up. I knew something looked funny so i started hovering my hand over the stuff and it went crazy. From there i move to little bits of foil, and now im up two sizes on the pinwheel (started with a little mishappen peice, moved to a slighter bigger peice from there, but it got crunched up, and now im using an even bigger (medium) sized peice of paper that was carefully folded into a mostly even sided pinwheel)
<br />

<br />
At first i had almost no control, then i had little, and now i have good control (though the strength of my blasts of psi are still very weak) once i gather the psi energy between my hands. I use my hands to focus and control the energy, but i charge it through BOTH my third eye AND solar plexus. I am conscious of the feeling of both butterflied and a slight pressure on my middle forehead.
<br />

<br />
I am loving this shit.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit</span>: I knowe i moved an empty plastic cup too, and a good two and half inch slide at that, but it weas still a fluke... eventually i'll work my way up to being able to control objects that heavy <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Everyone, do not break the rules.  Yes, there might be ten year olds on here.  As Terran said, i came here at the age of ten.  Please keep levels of decency.  A lot of people do not like gays and a lot of people are racist.  It is the parents' choice of how to raise their child.  That is not our job.  Therefore, it should not be posted here.  This is a psionic forum.  A <span style="font-weight: bold">PSIPOG</span> forum.  We discuss psionic things here.  Continue that conversation (if you want) in a PM.  Respect the rules and leave child raising to their parents.
<br />

<br />
Xiouslaidyn, congratulations on your success.
