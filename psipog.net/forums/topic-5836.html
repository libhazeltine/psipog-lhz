			Hello. My name is Chris, I'm 17 years old and I am open to the idea of psi actually being real. I was brought here by reading <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Psion's Handbook: Overview of Psionics</span> written by Sean Connelly a.k.a. Peebrain. I was introduced to this handbook through a friend on another forum that I am a member of. At first I was skeptical and thought that it had to be a trick. But, myself being naturally curious, I decided to tryout the psi ball. After reading through the fist few pages, I began to try to create a psi ball. Being my first time and only having about 30 minutes of practice, I cant be sure if what I felt was legitimate or not. At first I didnt notice much. A tingling sensation in my stomach was first, maybe I was hungy, maybe it was psi, I dont know. Then I tried to make a psi ball between my hands. Then, to my amazement, it was like I could actually feel a ball between my hands, not warm, not could. Again, with only half an hour of practice, it could have been anything. From what I have read, it normally doesnt happen this fast. So, this is why I cant say for sure that it was indeed a psi ball. I will continue to practice and hopefully increase my skill. Thank you to anyone that was patient enough to read through this whole post.
<br />

<br />
-Chris

			Welcome to psipog and the world is psionics. Things I KNOW are real: Remote Viewing, Telepathy, Telekinesis. (Because I have done these).
<br />

<br />
My specialty is remote viewing.

<br />
And if it helps, cause some skeptics might think this, no, I don't have any mental disorders and such.

Hell, I didn't believe any of it when I first came here and I wasn't as open minded either. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			Hey man!
<br />

<br />
Sounds like me when I first tried psionics. Just practice. Practice all the time, practice during school, just get the feel of moving psi.
<br />

<br />
If you're like me, and are skeptical on some level, try getting rid of al lthe variables. Eat alot before you do so you won't just be hungry, try to have ideal conditions before you try, let me know how it goes, bro!

Well, I cant be too full, because then I am bothered by an aking stomach. But, thanks for the advice. Its moderately hard for me to concentrate on anything really. I have to wait until I'm home alone so I can just turn everything off. I could go into my room, but I dont really have a comfortable spot where I can practice.

			That's why I RV (remote view). It only takes me a few moments of concentration then I can get back to what I was doing <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Well, for me, its like I said, moderately hard for me to concentrate. I honestly think I might A.D.D. or something. But, thats another topic.

-Update: Until this point, I had been unsuccessful at creating a warn psi ball. Now, I think I have succeeded. This surprises me in more than one way. One, being that in the beginning, I was a skeptic when first trying this. Two, this is only my third practice session. From what I have read, this is relatively quick compared to most that try to make one, or, anything for that matter. I will update my progress when I have accomplished something.

			Hey man welcome to Psipog, sounds like you have a good first try with psi balls. They vary alot from person to person but you seem to have done it fairly quick. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
 Try just moving around energy along with psi balls so you can get a feel for controlling it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Hey, thanks. I'm taking it a bit slow. I am just practicing on one skill for now. I dont want to rush things like some people may want to do. I want to take my time and learn the basics first.
<br />

<br />
On a side note, I'm just glad everyone thus far has been nice and accepting of me. Thank you.
<br />
