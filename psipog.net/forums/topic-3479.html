			Well, a while ago I read all about OBE's and lucid dreams and some ways to achive them. I ended up giving up on the OBE's but I did have 2 of them (very short tho) and lucid dreams come and go. 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I was just in this dream (didn't know it was a dream at the time) and for some reason there was a small hole at the bottom of my door. I look through the hole and can see down the hallway but then I close my eyes and notice I can kinda still see. Now, the only few times I DID have an OBE, they always started like this. I never got them when I tried to do it (like putting each body part to sleep) but just out of no where I would be looking out at my room when I can feel my eyes are shut. I *think* it was like the start of an OBE, IDK, I woke up directly after.
<br />

<br />
So, while im in this dream I begin to see with my eyes shut. I tried to do whatever I could to make this one last because the other times I would just wake up (as you can tell, I didn't know this was a dream) so I try and focuse on what im looking at. As soon as I do that, I get this incredibly weird feeling over my entire body, every part kinda feels like its numb with tingling vibrations kinda waving through. All the sound stops and I hear something kinda like a voice. It sounded like someone struggling to slowly breath in... thats the best way I can describe it. The sound stops and the sound of my fan kicks in. Then I realize im laying face first into a pillow (I had woken up).
<br />

<br />
I was just wondering if anyone can identify what happend, it was probably one of the weirdest things thats happend to me. It felt kind of eerie though... almost like I shouldn't have been able to do that or something... idk.

			Well just to warn you now my strongest point isn't OBE's or Lucid dreams but i have practiced and attempted them before! From what you describe with your body feeling numb and the vibrations and wierd sounds, it seems to me like it was a normal start of an OBE as whenever i practiced them these were the tell tale signs that i was close and many others experience the same sensations, as for you waking up face down in your pillow i guess there is a variety of ways it could have happened the most obvious being to me that as you were feeling the sensations of the vibrations your body mimicked these and you turned over or maybe even you levitated without knowing it and flipped over <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> anything is possible <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> well theres my two cents on it, moonrave

			Ok, I was just trying to have an OBE after reading some more articles but that was all stuff I already heard. After laying for a while, I ended up falling asleep. I don't remember dreaming that time but I woke up for a few seconds, and fell asleep again. Had a short dream and I woke up once again. Then, I thought it was the perfect opprotunity to OBE. I lay still thinking all I have to do to keep my mind aware. Only about a minute in, that crazy feeling comes back again, the feeling I had in the dream in my first post. I was wondering, are these &quot;vibrations&quot; supposed to be so intense? I don't know how someone could procede through that feeling not knowing whats going on...
<br />

<br />
Well anyway, I stoped it on purpose because I was in a bad position, or at least what I thought was one at the time (laying with my knees up in the air). I was thinking, is it possible to induce an OBE before your body is actualy asleep? and if so, is that dangerous???

			So I tried it again this morning, and got to the vibration phase. The only problem is, what can I do after that? All I see is black and really don't know how to &quot;escape&quot; the body, does anyone know any suggested methods?
