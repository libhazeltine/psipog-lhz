			I am using KJV. Actually, it doesn't say magick, just...
<br />
Divination, witches, wizards, charmers, enchanters, those who speak with familiar spirits (not to be confused with sub-c), necromancy, seers and sorcerors.
<br />
According to my study bible, a witch is someone who uses mystical herbs and such to influence things.

now, you need to think for yourself, ask yourself questions about your beliefs, test them against each other, your ideas, your feelings. your mind should contain more than a single ancient book supposedly written by god. If it doesn't you might turn into a fundy. open your mind. your parents aren't the holders of infinite knowledge, and no offense, but they sound pretty stupid to me. If we were afraid we'd never learn anything.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

 <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> Exactly what I thought it to be. A lower astral(etheric) realm where you go if you are a bad person... One who is ignorant, close-minded and have a bad time with yourself and others. Think about it. I have spent the last years doing so. Warning: Thinking too much about religion/spirituallity like this may space you out! <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Don't forget that 99% of the bible is over metaphors so people at the time the bible was write could understand, and all of it was written by humans. Much of it was written after a long time the facts happened, if it came from facts, much of it where from visions with many interpretations. Yet, there is much to learn from it, just judge yourself what is true just as you do with psi.

At least research what you're talking about before you say stuff.
<br />
Gen.5
<br />
[1] This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;
<br />
[2] Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
<br />
[3] And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:
<br />
[4] And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: <span style="font-weight: bold">and he begat sons and daughters</span>:
<br />
[5] And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.

Your sig comes from a Calvin and Hobbes strip by Bill Waterson, btw.
