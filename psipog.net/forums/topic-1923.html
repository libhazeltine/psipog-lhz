			Hello my friend and I were eighteen blocks away constructing heat psi-balls and when we were playing catch when he made a really intense one and when I caugh it I didn't feel anything but then I threw it back, looked at my had and it had 1 big blister!

			Do you still have the blister, and can you take a picture of it? Are you sure it's a blister from heat? There are a lot of things that can cause blisters.

Wouldn't you just be able to control the sphere of energy with your mind instead of &quot;throwing&quot; it with your hands?
<br />

<br />
Why bother programming a portion of your active force to comply to physical laws that it need to be subject to?
<br />

<br />
Something like chaos modulation would be far more useful.
<br />

<br />
Controlling the roll of a dice is the first step.
<br />

<br />
The next step is controlling the future.

			MetaAlchemy: When constructs abide by physical laws, it's usually due to conceptual programming.
<br />

<br />
For example, if you were to make a construct like a ball of fire, you'd be programming (unless specified otherwise) the entire concept of a ball of fire, according to your mind. Therefore, it would be hot, and unless you watch a lot of anim?, it would just disappear because it's not possible (to my knowledge) to create a ball of fire, just floating there, using conventional means.
<br />

<br />
So basically if he made a construct, it would abide by physical laws, because conceptually (in his mind), everything (including balls) abide by the laws of physics.

genius. i couldn't have put it better myself....
<br />
personally id recommend buying a book about physics and reading up on it. i did it this weekend <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> it really helps with the logicalities of visualization and programming.

			This is cool. painful, yes. But still freaking cool!
<br />

<br />
And I don't know about anywhere else, but in Alberta we have Physics 20, a grade 11 course that teaches basic motion, circular motion, gravitation, mechanical waves (like water and sound), and lastly light.
<br />

<br />
So if you just get your hands on a grade 11 physics text, you should be good. Higher levels would be even better.
<br />

<br />
But this is still cool.
