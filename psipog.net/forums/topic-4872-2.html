			I've heard about this.  Yes, only about 4% of the universe can be seen and is made of matter.  The other 26% or so is made of dark matter and the other 70% is made of dark energy.  It's interesting though, that both dark matter and psi is made of energy.  Some people say that psi has a slight weight.  Dark matter is supposed to have weight.  You can't see dark matter and you can't see psi(unless you flare it).  Interesting similarities wouldn't you say?  
<br />

<br />
On the gene debate, only a single gene seperates a poodle, from a wolf, and we don't know what 95%of our DNA does?  Interesting.

I'm glade someone pointed out the dark energy. I read in a few books it was 5% matter 20% dark matter, and 75% dark energy. I'm no expert but i highly disagree with dark matter being psi. The problem that I see is that the only reason we accpet dark matter is that its gravtiy is causeing some gaxaly to move. If psi was a form of dark matter itself would have gravity, and so then fall into the earth...
<br />

<br />
I think the source of this dark energy of the &quot;missing mass&quot; problem is in a form of Tachyon particles. I also think it's what psi is. It explains the power of time travel and other wierd things that seems to out do reality.

... Scientist <span style="font-weight: bold">make</span> anti-matter in proton accellerators all the time.  If there were anti-matter on the loose... we would notice.  There would be enormous explosions of matter - anti-matter reactions (as seen in Star-Trek.. they got that right...).  It is a 100% effectiveness energy conversion.  1 gram of anti-matter colliding with 1 gram of matter will produce 4x as much energy of 1 gram of hydrogen in the sun being fused with (w/e the other element is... I forgot).  1 gram of Anti-matter could power the whole of the United States for a month.

Hmm, now that you mention it tachyon paticles do sound more reasonable because of how it would fall to earth.  But then that raises the question of why don't you find all dark matter(in the vicinity of earth) on the surface of the earth?(and likewise for other celestial bodies)  
<br />
But if we could find out for sure what psi is, and it turned out to be something like a tachyon particle then we could prove it to science and it could become a science recognized by most scientists.  Since there would be alot of skeptics even if we accumulated mountains of evidence.(which we already have, just not much that they would accept.)

			If tachyons are psi (which I still have my doutes about) we wont be able to really have physcail proof (well enough). As far as I know there is nothing that can detect a tachyon. I heard of one nuclear reactor experment to test for it but it came out a failure.

			I think there's a missing idea in this tread.
<br />

<br />
Scientist have theorised dark matter and dark energy because they can't explain the exponential acceleration of the expansion of the universe. They discovered that what is actualy known about forces in universe can explain only about 4 % of this &quot;unexpected&quot; expansion.
<br />

<br />
But, it dosen't mean that the resulting 96% left is only one phenomenon. Dark matter and dark energy are names that refer to theorical results that could explain evolution of universe, not to a single phenomenon.
<br />

<br />
Imagine all we &quot;know&quot; now represent 4% of the forces of universe. Can you imagine the &quot;number&quot; of phenomenon that could exist to produce the dark matter and dark energy effects?
<br />

<br />
See ya in year 562 482 730
