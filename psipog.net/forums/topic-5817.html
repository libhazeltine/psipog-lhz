			Alright. Using the meditation method here, <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=2233" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2233</a>
<br />
I was able to acheive more results than ever on the psi-wheel. I meditated for about 45 minutes, and a couple of times told my sub-c that I can and will do PK today.
<br />

<br />
Well, after the meditation, I went to the psi-wheel, and made it turn an entire revolution, and even made it twitch without my hands near it! I've learned what subtlties make it turn, so I know it was me. For now, using two hands around it seems to establish the goal better for my subconsious, so I've had the most luck with that method.
<br />

<br />
It definately isn't body heat, because when I don't try to do it, no matter how long my hands are around it, it doesn't move. At all. This has been my 4th day of PK practice, and the only day I did not get any significant results was on the 2nd day, because I was seriously doubting myself, and overall just wasn't in the right mindset. I'm over that hump. I look forward of each day of PK practice, and I'll probably start using other things to practice, like a paper clip and/or toothpick.
<br />

<br />
I really hope psipog gets passed onto someone else, because the resources available here are the most concrete and helpful I've found. Ever. I'll still be going to the new site though. OBE's interest me. Well, I guess this has been a shameless achievement post, but I also hope my experiences will help others who wish to become proficient in PK as I do.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Yay! I've achived 3 revolutions of the psi-wheel! This is getting interesting.

			Do you practice PK at all Martial Artist? I'm just curious on what level you're on considering how many countless hours you've spent meditating. Oh yeah, I meditated for about 30 minutes today. It's funny. I always want to move when it feels like my feet are falling asleep, but they're not... It's weird. I always think I'm cutting off circulation, hahaha....
