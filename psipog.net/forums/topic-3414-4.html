			Kief,
<br />

<br />
You're welcome to stay, although there's really no reason for you to be here (except as amusement for a few friendly psions). You've stated you don't believe in pk (and more or less, psionics), which is funny enough, seeing as how you joined a forum based on the belief and practice of PSIONICS.
<br />

<br />
Not that I mind a little bit of skepticism, but you cannot be reconciled with. Such examples of fools never can be. Oh well, no loss for anyone. I'll just sit down, get a coke, make some popcorn, and watch in great pleasure as Joe rips your soul's essence (or whatever can be salvaged from his previous attacks on you) apart.
<br />

<br />
By the way, not that it means anything to you at ALL Kief, but I know Joe personally and have seen him do his feats, and what you claim &quot;cannot be done.&quot; Hell, I know that him living close by doesn't constitute much of a claim on my, his, or the OEC's part, but at least you can be well assured that he was in the presence of at least one person (2 counting Peeves) who has seen him perform his abilities without the assistance of metal objects, rigged cameras/computer technology, etc.
<br />

<br />
I'd write a whole damned article on this, but personally Kief, you are not worth my time. Time better spent on an energy sensation article is much more practical.
<br />

<br />
Have a good day.

<br />

<br />
Like you or anyone has any bearing on whether I should or could post here or not. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;although there's really no reason for you to be here (except as amusement for a few friendly psions).&quot;
<br />

<br />
I have stated why I am here many, many times. Perhaps you should read my first post in the hello-goodbye section for further elucidation. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;You've stated you don't believe in pk (and more or less, psionics), which is funny enough, seeing as how you joined a forum based on the belief and practice of PSIONICS.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Not everyone here would state that anything paranormal is psionic, that psionics is real or has anything to do with the paranormal, or that an alleged paranormal phenomena or event is psionic or the results of psionics and &quot;psi-energy&quot;. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Not that I mind a little bit of skepticism, but you cannot be reconciled with. Such examples of fools never can be. Oh well, no loss for anyone.&quot;

<br />
Mmmmm, whatever the nub with one post says  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

<br />

<br />
&quot;I'll just sit down, get a coke, make some popcorn, and watch in great pleasure as Joe rips your soul's essence (or whatever can be salvaged from his previous attacks on you) apart.&quot;
<br />

<br />
HAHAHAHAHA Yea right  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Nothing joe could ever do could work in my presence, especially trying rip out my soul (HA) and attempt to &quot;tear&quot; it apart, as if you can do such a thing with souls in the first place.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;By the way, not that it means anything to you at ALL Kief, but I know Joe personally and have seen him do his feats, and what you claim &quot;cannot be done.&quot;&quot;
<br />

<br />
Yep, pretty much means nothing to me, especially considering you have one post, just this one, you have nothing to back up your story, and that all you have is anecdotal &quot;evidence&quot;, which isn't really evidence of anything. 
<br />

<br />
You would probably state that while people can twiddle little pieces of paper with their mind, that they cannot shapeshift into other form(s) or possess traits that are akin to what is traditionally defined as a 'vampire'. I could only imagine why. Typically the people I come across with this sort of thing fall into the latter catagories than the former. Go figure. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Hell, I know that him living close by doesn't constitute much of a claim on my, his, or the OEC's part, but at least you can be well assured that he was in the presence of at least one person (2 counting Peeves) who has seen him perform his abilities without the assistance of metal objects, rigged cameras/computer technology, etc.&quot;
<br />

<br />
That does not mean it still wasn't a magic trick, or that what you are saying is actually true. 
<br />
 
<br />

<br />
&quot;I'd write a whole damned article on this, but personally Kief, you are not worth my time. Time better spent on an energy sensation article is much more practical.&quot;

			&quot;No do u? excpet for my feelings but people counter them bloody wankers like when i say tingling they say the blood ext. u know what i am saying?&quot;
<br />

<br />
The body produces electromagnetic energy and has an electromagnetic field around it naturally, an aura one could say. 
<br />

<br />
The feeling of tingling is indeed blood flow and the feeling of this electric aura we possess. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;and kief what u said just made me turn against you. &quot;PSI IS LIKE MAGIC&quot; WTF no it isnit&quot;
<br />

<br />
Yes it is. There is no difference from saying psi, or magick, or sorcery, or prayer, or chi, or prana, or anything else.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;and chi is real you idiot look at the shaoulin!&quot;
<br />

<br />
You are an utter fool. 
<br />

<br />
While no one would doubt that the shaolin can perform amazing feats, there is no evidence suggesting they are using what is defined as chi to perform their acts. (like, for example, no monk has demonstrated that he can throw a ball of energy he would call chi and have it affect physical reality, like knocking someone over/out or killing them, scorching a wall, moving an object, etc.)
<br />

<br />
A shaolin monk typically undergoes rigid and proven body stregnthing techniques and combat training all their life from near infancy. 
<br />

<br />
They can jump on their heads and stand on 2 fingers because they have practiced all their life. They spend all day smashing bricks against their heads, hardening them to withstand any blow. They do the same with their fingers and nearly every other part of their body. In addition to these techniques, the monks hone their minds through study and meditation, being so intune to their instinctual processes that they can maintain some air of control over them, over emotion, and over physical sensations (like pain).
<br />

<br />
They can do what they do because of physics and biology, not magic or chi. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;sorry kief i wasnt against you but once i read that sorry...&quot;

Ah. One of my relatives friends can apparently &quot;overwhelm&quot; someone with energy until they pass out  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

I have NO idea if its true as he hasn't ever done it to me. But he's an honest guy and I doubt he's lying.

If PsiPog allowed combat I'm sure someone could make a vid or something for it.

			Kief do you mind a personal question ... how old are you? Because by your writing I would say you're about 15 or 16 and you're very frustrated about something in your life and as the result you feel like you have to be a smartass in one place where you can - the internet. I could of course be wrong, but you seem to be a very unbalanced and confused (angry?) person, and I bet that in real life situations you have problems because of your i'm-all-knowing attitude here, in cyber-reality. Don't get me wrong I'm no psychologist and I'm not here to judge you, in fact like most of the people here I'm trying to help you but since you've decided to live in your blind little world, nobody can really help you and this debate could last another century or so.
<br />

<br />
The problem with people like you is that you just don't see through your imaginary boundaries, you engrave some sort of logic into your minds and than yack around about it not even knowing the very essence of what you're talking about. I've read all your replies to this thread along with replies from other people, and I'll have to stick with the opinion of the majority here. Your replies, except for some very rare parts, have absolutely no arguments or scientific background, all you do is go around yelling how you are right and we are not. Well here's my advice: stop being like that because you're only making yourself look silly and besides, everyone that experienced PK, telepathy, or any other PSI-related stuff, knows that it is real, and to us it's a fact just like gravity or the speed of light or anything else &quot;scientifically accepted&quot;, and your silly posts sure aren't going to convince us otherwise, quite the opposite I think you're doing damage to people who're not quite convinced about PSI because you're making them suspicious about the subject. As I said, this is wrong because the very page you're writing on is DEDICATED to PSI-work and if you can't see how much effort was put into it then sorry, you're a dumbass.
<br />

<br />
So tell me, what would you do if we really made up a meeting and someone showed IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE how easily rotating a piece of paper on a needle with PK really is. Or moving pen. Or even better, levitating some small objects. I would like to see your face when all the yapping on this forum you wrote would be denied in a single second. I would also like to tell you that I personally convinced a lot of skeptics like you (if you can be called that) that extraordinary stuff is very possible and very misunderstood in today's world.
<br />

<br />
I hope you can put some pieces together and ask yourself what is your true intention of being such a whining smartass on some pretty unknown internet forum. Though I doubt you will change your perspective, stubborn people like you just don't give up.
<br />

<br />
I suggest you re-read <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=756" target="_blank" class="postlink">forum's rules</a>, because I think you're breaking almost every one of them.
<br />

<br />
No disrespect intended.

<br />
peace ?

&quot;Im coming up with 'silly' posts, you must be out of your mind you hobo, youre talking about moving things with your mind, i mean no-one can do that because its impossible, and i know its impossible cos i know everything..........im only trying to help you, youre deluding yourselves over Telekinesis, it is not real, so therefore, you cannot practice it. Im making myself look silly? Pfff, look in the mirror. Gravity and the speed of light are scientifically explained, telekinesis has no truth to it whatsoever. Go home and learn science you hobo&quot;.

			&quot;Ah. One of my relatives friends can apparently &quot;overwhelm&quot; someone with energy until they pass out  
<br />
I have NO idea if its true as he hasn't ever done it to me. But he's an honest guy and I doubt he's lying.&quot;
<br />

<br />
A relative's friend?
<br />

<br />
Oh geeze. &quot;My uncle's father's cousin's roommate could do this neat trick and make people pass out&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
If anything, he is hypnotizing people. 
<br />

<br />
In any event, neither could work on me. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;If PsiPog allowed combat I'm sure someone could make a vid or something for it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Making someone go to sleep is neither paranormal nor combat.

			&quot;Kief do you mind a personal question ... how old are you? Because by your writing I would say you're about 15 or 16 and you're very frustrated about something in your life and as the result you feel like you have to be a smartass in one place where you can - the internet.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Can I ask you a question? 
<br />

<br />
Why would you end a pointless ranting full of ad homs with the phrase &quot;no disrespect intended&quot;? 
<br />

<br />
If you could read and bothered to do a little legwork, you could easily find out my age. 
<br />

<br />
Judging by your careless and vapid assessment of my posts I'd say you are the one who is a frustrated teenager, projecting his senseless angst onto me. 
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
&quot;I could of course be wrong,&quot;
<br />

<br />
You would be, of course. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;but you seem to be a very unbalanced and confused (angry?) person,&quot;
<br />

<br />
Looks to me rather like everyone else is unbalanced, confused, and angry. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;and I bet that in real life situations you have problems because of your i'm-all-knowing attitude here, in cyber-reality.&quot;
<br />

<br />
If you want to beLIEve so, you can believe anything you wish. Invisible pink elephants, vampiric hebrew god-men rising from the grave, all-knowing attitudes, you can believe in whatever kind of delusion your mind imagines. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Don't get me wrong I'm no psychologist and I'm not here to judge you,&quot;
<br />

<br />
Well you certainly are not a psychologist and are a poor judge. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;in fact like most of the people here I'm trying to help you&quot;
<br />

<br />
You call these vapid, inane ramblings you present to me as help?
<br />

<br />
And on another note, you would be so arrogant as to believe I actually need you or anyone else's help with anything? 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;but since you've decided to live in your blind little world, nobody can really help you and this debate could last another century or so.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Help me with what? 
<br />

<br />
I haven't lost anything here, rather I have invalidated what the opposition has stated. Apparently you are so blind and close-minded that you would rather live in your own little world than actually read what I wrote. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;The problem with people like you is that you just don't see through your imaginary boundaries, you engrave some sort of logic into your minds and than yack around about it not even knowing the very essence of what you're talking about.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Yea OK  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Seems you don't know what you're talking about. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;I've read all your replies to this thread along with replies from other people, and I'll have to stick with the opinion of the majority here.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
That's because you are a mindless drone who cannot think for himself. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Your replies, except for some very rare parts, have absolutely no arguments or scientific background,&quot;
<br />

<br />
Whatever you say, why don't you actually show this though? 
<br />

<br />
Because I have had to respond to senseless, illogical, and baseless tripe that has no evidence to support it nor any sort of functional grounding in reality. 
<br />

<br />
And since, I supported my arguments with actual scientific articles, quotes, logic, links, reason, etc.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;all you do is go around yelling how you are right and we are not.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Yea OK.
<br />

<br />
You're just another parrot. Squawk squawk!
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Well here's my advice: stop being like that because you're only making yourself look silly and besides,&quot;
<br />

<br />
My advice to you is stop being a drone repeating the same debunked and cliche garbage that I slam-dunked last week. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;everyone that experienced PK, telepathy, or any other PSI-related stuff,&quot;
<br />

<br />
You have no basis to call any sort of paranormal event or ability, such as pk or telepathy, psi-related. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;knows that it is real,&quot;
<br />

<br />
Like you know jesus is real right?
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;and to us it's a fact just like gravity or the speed of light or anything else &quot;scientifically accepted&quot;,&quot;
<br />

<br />
Well that's because you are delusional. 
<br />

<br />
Which is your fault not mind. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;and your silly posts sure aren't going to convince us otherwise,&quot;
<br />

<br />
Another problem and product of a delusional mind; not being able to see their errors even when proven wrong. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;quite the opposite I think you're doing damage to people who're not quite convinced about PSI because you're making them suspicious about the subject.&quot;
<br />

<br />
And that's because they should be suspicious. 
<br />

<br />
Nothing that is said about psionics is in any way evidenced or proven, especially scientifically. 
<br />
The scientific evidence actually weighs against the case for paranormal phenomena and even more-so against a case for phenomena so-termed as &quot;psionic&quot;.
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
&quot;As I said, this is wrong because the very page you're writing on is DEDICATED to PSI-work and if you can't see how much effort was put into it then sorry, you're a dumbass.&quot;
<br />

<br />
And this particular forum is dedicated to skepticism of any so-deemed &quot;psi-work&quot; and the actual effort put into the baseless claims people make.  
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;So tell me, what would you do if we really made up a meeting and someone showed IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE how easily rotating a piece of paper on a needle with PK really is.&quot;
<br />

<br />
So long as you can show you are moving it with some sort of paranormal power and can abide by my testing and control standards. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Or moving pen. Or even better, levitating some small objects.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Again, so long as one can abide by some testing standards and controls then let them try and show it can be done and then it can be documented and the findings taken to all appropriate communities. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;I would like to see your face when all the yapping on this forum you wrote would be denied in a single second.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Well guess what - it isn't going to happen, because no one has such an ability to want to come to my location and show they can do it. 
<br />

<br />
And if they did, what makes you think it would work anyway? 
<br />

<br />
Perhaps one of my paranormal abilities is that in my presence, you have no power. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;I would also like to tell you that I personally convinced a lot of skeptics like you (if you can be called that) that extraordinary stuff is very possible and very misunderstood in today's world.&quot;
<br />

<br />
So what? I'm supposed to just believe you?
<br />

<br />
I convince a lot of people to think critically and not accept all the bullshit people type on here. And that is actually true. 
<br />

<br />
If you can convince skeptics as you say then come take the pepsi challenge and come see me and convince me. 
<br />

<br />
 
<br />

<br />
&quot;I hope you can put some pieces together and ask yourself what is your true intention of being such a whining smartass on some pretty unknown internet forum.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I have made my intentions for being on these forums quite clear from the beginning. 
<br />

<br />
You obviously are a nub who doesn't know his ass from his elbow. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Though I doubt you will change your perspective, stubborn people like you just don't give up.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Why should I give up when people like you never offer any evidence for your extraordinary claims? 
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
&quot;I suggest you re-read forum's rules, because I think you're breaking almost every one of them.&quot;
<br />

<br />
No, you are rather breaking the forum's rules. 
<br />
You have failed to be intelligent, you have attacked me with a load of senseless ad homs, you have posted a bunch of off topic rhetorical jargon that addresses nothing I have said, and you have clearly lied about myself and what I have wrote without even bothering to read it first.
