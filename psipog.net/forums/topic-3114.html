			so tonight was my third day of TK training (well any psionic training for that matter). And i managed to get the psiwheel to spin a bit on several different tries. so obvoiusly i'm really happy that it happened and all that, but something is still bothering me. Everytime it moves, i can't stop thinking that it wasn't actually my mind doing it but it was some kind of wind or breath and i'm not accounting for. i was a few feet back with a paper psiwheel and i had my undershirt and my button down shirt over my mouth while i was doing it. So I really doubt it was my breath. But i can't stop thinking that it was something else. its like i can't really TRULY belief that i am able to do this. There is something inside of me that isn't allowing me to put total faith into this and just trust that it actually was me. Obviously, i need to be able to belief in this 100% if i want to get good at this. I'm not sure how i'm goign to be able to prove to myself and TK is possible and that i can actually do it. It seems like the only way i could prove it to myself is that if i had a cover over the psiwheel. i tried that, and it wouldn't move. That isn't surprising because i just started and usually beginners have trouble with a covering. Anyone have any ideas as to how i can let go of my skepticism? Has anyone else this problem? i wish i had people that i could go talk to in real life and have them perform it for me. i think that would clear it up. but sadly, all i have to go on are stories by you people and videos. I&quot;m not saying those are fake, cus i really belief they are real. But deep down, there is something telling me that isn't enough. its really frustrating.

			Well, you've ruled out that it's your breath. Make sure there's no fans or AC on, and that windows and doors nearby are shut. Also, try to make it spin one direction, stop, and spin the other. Think about it, a gust of wind will make it blow one direction, not one and then the other.
<br />

<br />
Also, once you get some practice, try it with it under a glass. I've seen it proven that although a glass isn't any true interference, our mind interprets it as one, which makes it more difficult. Even if you realize and understand this, it still seems to hold you back. At least, that's what I've observed. I haven't tried under glass yet.
<br />

<br />
I'm confident in myself, and I'm sure that it's me that moves the psi wheel. For one thing, mine doesn't really spin yet. It sorta rocks back and forth, like it's really struggling to spin, but can't get over some sort of bump or something. And it's just not the kind of spin you get from wind. It's funny, though, I don't feel like I'm forcing it to move or anything. It's more like I'm purely observing. Yet, somehow, I know that it's me causing it.

			about observing it, i totally agree. I just sit there and stare at it and it starts to spin and i continue to just watch it. its weird.
<br />

<br />
as far as confidence in the fact that its me, idk...i'm sure that will come as i become more proficient with it. its just in my nature to be a skeptic. I like proven scientific facts. So i guess it makes sense for a part of me to be struggling with the whole belief aspect of TK.

If that doesn't work, try music that did it for me.

			try a <span style="font-style: italic">foil</span> one.  At first when i used the paper one, i was a bit of a skeptic also.   now, when i use the psiwheel, i can see and hear the sparks flying from my fingers.  all it takes is a little confidence. <span style="font-weight: bold">Expect</span> it to move.  i think i should get a webcam <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> .  it would boost the confidence of many people.  now, i can switch over to the paper psi wheel and see almost no difference.  im even starting to levitate foil(fun and incouraging, also).  all it takes is confidence from yourself. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			To help, I plan on making a psi wheel video soon, and a good way to get yourself to believe is to beg someone on psipogbb to drain you and make you very dizzy, an anonymous user did that to me once and I almost fainted, he/she was demonstrating to me; how important shields are.
