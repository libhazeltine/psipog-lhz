			what ever the case may be...i am just asked for help from people to create something to help others out inorder to make it easier for everyone to learn.... isn't that why you all joined the psipog forums in the first place to help people and to seek help for your self, it seems that you have lost sight of why your truly here on the forums, or are you only on the forums to just hear yourself talk.... your want to be ass holes and poke fun then do so but a simple yes or no would of done.

			It's true, we are here to help each other out... however, we have a set of rules to follow, and if one person is able to disregard the rules, then all of us would be able to. If nobody obeyed the rules, we would have nothing but chaos on the forums, and nobody would be able to help anybody. So, for the sake of everybody, read the rules and obey them.

			The only thing darknecro1010 did wrong was post all over the forums with the same information. 
<br />
But you guys shouldn't have made fun of him for wanting to put together a giant article on Psionics. 
<br />
Sure, there is the Psion's Handbook, but what's the problem with having something different? 
<br />

<br />
Although I shall warn you darknecro1010, be very careful in the fact of where you get your information for I have seen many get into trouble for stealing other people's articles without permission and I just don't want to see it happen again. 
<br />

I am sorry if I have hurt your feelings man, take care.

Well there is also the fact that there's no way he could possibly produce something of real use.  Helpful books, collections of articles and other volumes of information are all put together by a person/people that know the subject that their collections of information concern.  In fact, they aren't just acquainted with their subject matter, they are EXPERTS.  With expertise comes the ability to edit out the misinformation and thus turn a rudimentary collection of sources into a cohesive, purer, more useful volume.  This guy certainly does not have that quality because he has not cultivated it through experience and dedication.  That doesn't mean he will never ever do what he claims, but right now, his efforts will result in crap.  
<br />

<br />
Moreover, he does not only have an issue with lacking expertise, he also has terrible writing skills.  So he's naturally decided to edit writings?  That strikes me as a recipe for failure and I know I'm not the only one who sees that.  I probably am the only one who isn't nice enough to say &quot;Yeah, give it a try&quot; though, but why should he waste his time and effort?
<br />

<br />
darknecro: Focus on cultivating your own expertise, give it time (we are talking years of dedicated practice that you constantly learn from) and then revisit this goal.  With time will also come better writing skill, and hell, maybe you could even publish your collection if you wanted to.  But right now, you've got a long way to go before you're qualified to do what you want to.

			Although I must agree with some of the things lightbringer said, I still think you should try and write those things you want to write. It will be a learning experience and yeah, it may not become a best-seller, but that doesn't matter. This is where I disagree with LB. You should never be afraid to express your intentions and wishes no matter what other people say or think. It does not matter whether your book fails or not; if you put your heart into it, this project can never fail, no matter the results. You feel the urge to write a book and start something new for the sake of these kind of communities, I think that is a wonderful goal and you should do your very best. 
<br />

<br />
Keep in mind the things LB said about your writing skills and perhaps lack of expertise, however, that should not stop you from expressing yourself. I believe anyone, no matter how small or big, can bring something new, something fresh, something helpful to other people. It does not necessarily have to be helpful to the experts already out there, for they are the ones who can do without help. It can be helpful to the people and friends around you and it can be helpful to those who are just starting out and are not in need of 'high-quality' breakthrough documents. Even if by working months on this e-book, you turn out to help just one single person for just a little bit, it was all worth your effort. Even if this book would help no-one out there, it would still help <span style="font-style: italic">you</span>... in there. So go for it, see what you can learn, don't expect it to become a best-seller just yet, but let it be a learning experience so you can very soon become the expert LightBringer is talking about.

			I read some thoughts and comments for various people, everyone is amateur before they become experts, no one was born master and no one will ever be.
<br />

<br />
Our actions of present will write our future, its a universal truth, everythought is a cosmic flow of energy and if someone has a desire then there will be both +/- forces to favour and supress it, with acceptance, openness and vision even in dark you will see the light, with ego, perceptions etc.. you will see the darkness.
<br />

<br />
It will be your first step to collect the info and write something, you will gradully improve with time, you may not be an expert , but you have a desire to serve others .., atleast some people who can find core articles at one place and so you must go ahead and do it, may be that is the path for you to learn something, that you may not learn otherwise.
<br />

<br />
Dont mind words from others..  i can sense when some were  writing their mind was under the influcnce of excessive (C1-Mooladhar ), if you talk to them today, you will see them much relaxed and open.. again the lesson is ... open your self to accept what the world says but that should not be the basis of self judgement, you are meant to do something and you must do it. 
<br />

<br />
Remember .... . . dont think you are ... know you are.

			See my intent is not to make money off this, it is free, so everyone can read it, and learn when we are passionate about as far as my experience no one knows but myself, and as a writer I choose to write/type differently on forums differently then I would, say writhing a psych paper. If you want to know my background so you don't think I am some yuppie. I am a 4th year psychology student, and I am planning on going to get my masters in psychology, and parapsychology so I do understand the concepts of psionics, the inner workings of the mind, and human behaviour. On that note I have practice psionics for 2 and a half years now. I have only joined the forums to gain more knowledge on psionics. This book I have in mind is going to bring all the articles and all the information ( credited, and reliable ) together, then searching over the entire world wide web for information here or infromation there. If you want to help you will and shall be credited for your work, and helpfull efforts, if you decide not to help then I appreciate you time, and patience.

			I agree with Netrage, however, I would never conclude my book with a negatively orientated chapter. So the vampirism and the dark side section, I would put somewhere in the middle, after people gotten familiar with the concept of psi and such. If would also keep that chapter brief, for what you focus on will grow. I would not even include such a dark section in my book, I would only mention briefly to be careful with some things, and I would provide them with some safe techniques to shield themselves with positive vibrations. I would really not conclude my book with an in depth, negative chapter. That's like watching a reqally good nice and heart-warming movie picture, but the last two scenes are evil in nature and you go asleep with that last bit of information still in your mind. It's not good.
