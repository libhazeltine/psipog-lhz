lol those pictures are the ones that screwed you over my boy not even the most skilled of us can levitate anything. also why would we concider still life as &quot;proof&quot; take a video. I know most digital cameras take atleast a couple minutes of video depending on the memory card you use.

			&quot;not even the most skilled of us can levitate anything..&quot; wrong, have seen and trying to do it myself <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> And if I succeed in it, I'll take video from it and post it for you guys out there. Oh, not &quot;if&quot; I succeed, it's &quot;when&quot; <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Just can't understand skeptics, but if they have nothing better to do, then it's acceptable. Someone just should really give some good skeptisms, which even were true, to get me to stop believing those things I've done, and I'm pretty sure there's over 10000 more practicers who agrees with me.

			First of all, I suppose you got what you wanted. Telling people how they should be conducting themselves. Which, I do not disagree that they should do.
<br />

<br />
However, the point you have been pushing is what Psipog pretty much stands for. In a less an &quot;in your face&quot; way. You now realize, how hard that is to get across to people, and make it stick. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

Some of us take it for granted; we see some demonstrations and hear some stories from a sacred tome and assume it all to be true. Others come into it later in their lives, often with some skepticism. It is that skepticism that is most important in preserving the integrity of your beliefs. I, personally, do believe that there are some forms of energy beyond the sphere of human comprehension. Anytime I see a video on this site or hear some ridiculous claim, I don't immediately assume &quot;holy crap check out that guy's pk.&quot; I approach it with skepticism. &quot;Maybe has a magnet under the table. Maybe that glass is pressurized. Maybe there's been a string edited out of the picture. Maybe he's just throwing that into the air.&quot;</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Welcome to the wonderful world of healthy skepticism.  Although I think how you went about this is incredibly rude and stupid (and it does break the rules, no lieing, do not manipulate others).  If you surf around the forums, I think you'll find that most members do approach things with a healthy skeptical attitude.
<br />

<br />
PsiPog promotes healthy skepticism, as seen by our articles:
<br />

<br />
<a href="../show.php@id=10143.html" target="_blank">art-outline-to-shielding.html143</a>
<br />
<a href="../show.php@id=10165.html" target="_blank">art-outline-to-shielding.html165</a>
<br />
<a href="../show.php@cmd=wp&amp;id=39.html" target="_blank">http://psipog.net/show.php?cmd=wp&amp;id=39</a>
<br />

<br />
And the inclusion of our rules:
<br />

<br />
<a href="topic-756.html" target="_blank">http://psipog.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=756</a>
<br />

<br />
How to be a Good Skeptic:
<br />
1. Recognize the source of information
<br />
2. Understand the limitations of your source
<br />
3. Research evidence without bias
<br />
4. Understand different perspectives
<br />
5. When in doubt, ask for more evidence
<br />
6. Present reasonable ways for others to validate your claims
<br />
7. Doubt everything and ask questions 
<br />

<br />
---
<br />

<br />
Don't you think there is a better way to promote healthy skepticism and make your point without lieing to people?  You've proven that people are human, and can be deceived.  Congratulations... <span style="font-weight: bold">you can do that with any forum on the internet</span>.  To pretend that PsiPog is the only forum with people who are too trusting is silly.  As an easy example, I visit Andrew W.K.'s forums, located <a href="http://andrewwk.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=3" target="_blank" class="postlink">here</a>.  There is fake information posted about Andrew W.K. constantly, and in fact an entire conspiracy has formed over it, some people claiming that Andrew W.K. doesn't even exist (even though countless people have seen him in live performances <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />).
<br />

<br />
You can also get people to believe you if you lie to them in real life (not just the internet).  Go into a market and explain that your sister is having a seizure... then everyone runs outside, only where you stand there saying that people need to be more skeptical.
<br />

<br />
People are willing to suspend their disbelief if there is a person asking for help.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  I think it's very rude of you to imply that the PsiPog forums need to be more skeptical, based on this thread.  I agree we need to be more skeptical - but this thread is hardly a &quot;good lesson&quot;.  You are preying on people's good nature to help other people out.
