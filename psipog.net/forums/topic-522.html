			There is good reason for this being illegal.  Each person has an attentional capacity, meaning that they can only do so many tasks at the same time while putting forth an appropriate amount of concentration toward each task.  We, of course, have the capacity to do both. However, using language (talking on the phone) usually takes up more concentration than driving does, since language is processed at a much deeper level. Driving, on the other hand, becomes an automatic process after a few years of practice.  Therefore, most of your attention will be put toward talking rather than driving.  That could have fatal consequences.

			hmmm...that's a new one, I have never heard about people reading the newspaper while driving, people do stupid things. But I have heard of people driving with their knees. How important could the newspaper possibly be to a person? (don't answer that...it's a rhetorical question)

			right now, i work for the hamilton county engineers as a summer job.  we do a lot of road work, which in most cases we need to shut down streets into one lane.  i help with black-topping and other duties on a list to long to mention.  one of my responsibilities is flagging (directing) traffic while the others work.  knowing this, i have an &quot;authority&quot; in what the most dangerous people driving are doing.  in the 2 months working there, i have almost been hit by about 15 cars.  1 of them was the ONLY asian i have seen driving while i was working, which doesn't help the stereotype.  the other 14 were people on cellphones, or elderly people.  the people on cellphones 6 times out of 10 cause more &quot;near accidents&quot; than elderly people.  i have a lot of problems with the elderly driving while we work, and cellphone users as well.  the elderly must not be able to see me standing in the road wearing bright flourescent green and holding a 6 foot stop sign.  the people on the phones just aren't paying attention, and ignore me completely forcing me to dive out of the street hoping oncoming traffic can react in time to swerve out of their way.  i think talking on a phone while driving is very dangerous, and from my experience at work, very stupid and distracting.  i also think the elderly should be retested, and need to have their liscenses revoked if they fail.  both are dangerous when driving (for the most part), and need extra attention when driving next to them.

That was a good Mythbusters episode, getting off topic....Anyway, Cell phones are illegal because too many accidents were caused when people were using them.
