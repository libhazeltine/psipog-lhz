			Hello everyone.
<br />
I am sorry to request this, but could any of you please scan me to see if I have any abilities whatsoever? I've yet had success with psionics myself and I'd like to know if I've any abilities so I could specialize in that area.
<br />

<br />
If not, I could use some help finding a watch. It's a watch you put on your wrist, I seem to have lost it. All I know for certain is that it's somewhere in my house.
<br />

<br />
If you require any other information that may help, please tell me and I'll try my best to answer you.
<br />

<br />
Thank you for everything, and once again, I am sorry I requested this.
<br />

			Thank you, I'll start working with shields and constructs then after I've gotten some experience with psi balls.

Is there anyone else here who could find my watch though or tell me anything else about me? ^^

			Anyone can be good at any particular form of psionics, if they work hard enough...lemme get to that scan, though.
<br />

<br />
EDIT : Caucasian, teenager, perhaps, though something tells me you're near/or is an adult...as for your abilities, I can't get a reading on that.

			Pretty much correct.
<br />
I'm caucasian and I'm 16 years old, as for me seeming like an adult I've no idea. Maybe I'm more mature than other guys around my age? Well, either way it's pretty accurate.
<br />

<br />
Though, what boggles me is that you can't read my abilities.
<br />
Could it be that I've none, or it's some type of shield I'm not aware of that's preventing you? More info regarding me and/or my ability(s) would be great, if not that's alright.
<br />

<br />
Any luck finding my watch? ^_^'

Thank you,

I also picked up a Model plane it's some sort of 747 and I think the watch is hanging on it's &quot;left or right wing&quot;
