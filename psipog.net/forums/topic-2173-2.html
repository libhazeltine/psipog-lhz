			I've experienced sleep paralysis many times. 
<br />

<br />
I've always thought it was a result of the dreambody being slightly out of coincidence with the physical body. I have read that, when people sleep their dreambody / astralbody /ethericbody goes slightly out of coincidence with their physical body in order to draw energy ( chi ) from the multiverse to recharge. 
<br />

<br />
On top of that, alot of dreams where people are flying are  actually out of body experiences happening while asleep. This is simply the mind's way of understanding these experiences. So, sleep paralysis could be the result of you returning from an OBE while sleeping and not being completely in your body yet.

This led me to an interesting line of thinking.
<br />

<br />
The physological/neurological reason for sleep paralysis is that part of your brain is awake and part is still asleep (spinal cord mainly). 
<br />

<br />
Your spiritual/psionic reason for sleep paralysis is stated above. I neither endorse nor oppose this theory, having no way to confirm or deny it from personal experience. However, I'll assume that it is a valid explanation for the purposes of this post.
<br />

<br />
Could the two be related? Probably. However, what is the causal relationship? Is your &quot;spirit body&quot; out of phase with the physical body because the brain is partially asleep? Or is the brain partially asleep because the &quot;spirit body&quot; is out of phase with the physical body?
<br />

<br />
It might seem to be a chicken-and-egg scenario, but I think that an answer to the theoretical question posed above could illuminate the relationship between psionics and the body, or at least between your &quot;spirit body&quot; and your physical body.

			Your observations are right on target, Felix.
<br />

<br />
Due to the fact that we are encased in these physical bodies that allow perception, or that we ARE the bodies themselves depending upon your opinion, we are subjective creatures.
<br />

<br />
Therefore, it is close to impossible to KNOW whether or not either assertion is true. However, I have had times, as I'm sure others have, when I simply KNOW what is true without being able to necessarily prove it to anyone else. Furthermore, I have found that there isn't much that can be proven to one that wants to find a hole in it.

In sleep paralysis, you are awake but your body is still asleep. Most of the time you'll be able to open your eyes but will not be able to move. You definitely would not see your body, since you are still in your body.

			I get that alot (i think I posted a new topic on it...but it didnt show up..hehe)
<br />

<br />
But. I will wake up and look around the room and try to move but I wont be able to. I can kind of feel where the nerve message cuts off, which is a very odd and bad feeling. Its happened especially when I try to nap, but then I wake up and try getting up, but giving up is the only option. Its horrible.
<br />

<br />
I generally am not comfortable sleeping on my sides due to pressure points and stupid shoulders, and the back in dumb too cause you wake up stiff. The only option is front, which messes up the neck! I love sleep, I just hate FALLING asleep. (or &quot;waking up&quot; without motor function) <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" />

			Maybe you folks who get sleep paralysis should try an OBE exit technique next time you get it and see what happens. I wonder if the physical body actually being deeply asleep would make it much easier? I'd imagine so.
<br />

<br />
Remember to get at least a light trance first. (I know, easy for me to say, I've been trancing for years now... believe me, it's not as cool as you might think, I spontaneously start dropping into trance rather often at random times.)

			The last time that I had (or at least thought) it was dream paralysis I tried to have an OBE.  I had disturbing images rushing through my head at high speed, I couldn't make them out at all though, but still for some reason, the slight glimpses I caught were enough.  Earlier that night I was trying to have an OBE, but when I dozed off so to speak I would see similar images rushing through, although I could make them out.  There were a lot of them to.  So, while I thought I was having the experience, the fearful feeling far exceeded any other sleep paralysis I have had.  I could see my arms grabbing at seemingly nothing and the images rushing through, but it woas like I couldn't see it at the same time.  Once I had an idea of what was going on I calmed myself completely.  The feeling was still there, but I was able to think clearly and I was completely rid of the fear, even though the fearful feeling was still there.  I decided I would try to have an OBE, but I really couldn't feel anything at all other than me trying to move (not my physical body).  After trying for a little while I came out of it and woke up in my body.  It was then I realized that while trying to &quot;leave my body&quot; it felt like I wasn't in my body in the first place.
<br />

<br />
All my sleep paralysis before that experement I didn't think about that at all, I just tried to over come what was there and wake up.

1) No.
<br />
2) WTF do eating disorders have to do with sleep paralysis?
<br />
3) No.
<br />

<br />
Sleep paralysis is essentially when your conscious activity centers of the brain (frontal lobes, cerebral cortex, some others) become active, while the motor centers of your brain are still in hibernation. Thus, you can think but not move.

			I remember having sleep paralysis once, lucky for me, it was short, painless and no hullucinations. I woke up in 30 seconds. Not scared, just confused. I hope I never have a heavy duty one.

			I had this happen to me once.
<br />
I woke up in the middle of the night (about 2am)
<br />
I could not move my body (3-4mins) Every mucsle in my body was like a flexed bow string
<br />
I was VERY scared. I don't know what I was scared of, it was like a deep primal fear
<br />
I felt a pressence. It felt EVIL. (i don't know why, it just did)
<br />
Then I felt very clostriphobic, like the walls were pushing in on me. there was an invisible weight pushing down on me.
<br />
Then I thought, &quot;should I yell for help?&quot;   I could speak though lol
<br />
Anyways This was a 1 time experience, and me being a &quot;scientific&quot; person went straight to medical websites to find out what the hell it is.
<br />

<br />
I found out about Night terrors. Some of the factors listed were stress and lack of sleep.  Another contributing factor was &quot;It can be passed parent to child.
<br />
I told my dad and he said he has had them before...
<br />

<br />
I am not saying this isn't Psi related. For all I know, the medical diagnosis is just the explanation of a psi event told by someone that doesnt believe in psi. They both can have thier own truths; they are just 2 diffrent understandings of a true event.
<br />

<br />
Thats my 2 cents

			Ok, I'm not new to sleep paralysis. Infact, I've experience them on and off every 8 to 12 months for the past 4 years and being the curious person I am, I only tried to reproduce them and rather enjoy when it happens. So anyway, onto the new experience.
<br />

<br />
Basically, I know what it feels like to be in a state of sleep paralysis. I also witnessed the hallucinations and the whole pressure on the chest thing. I just figured that the pressure on the chest was the fact that I was prevented from breathing due to the sleep paralysis (rather curious actually) and snapped out of it right after I started to feel the chest pressure caused by it. So I believe that I had experienced all those same things, but inside of a dream. The weird thing is, most of the dreams have to do with death.
<br />

<br />
You know how when you fall off a cliff and just before you hit the ground, you wake up? Well, I just noticed that I haven't been waking up, I actually hit the ground. The thing is, the second I hit the ground, my body felt really weird (the only way to describe it is like sleep paralysis, but I'm still unsure of how accurate that is. There is an added feeling in that whole dream death thing, every time I experience it there is water involved, I'm either drifting down (usually after drowning in a pool) or falling down (after hitting the ground from a huge fall) in the dream. And the funny thing is, my dreams have found almost every way to kill me except for guns and the gallows. I've been poisened (rather stupid dream plot if you ask me), hung (the first one, back when I thought it was some sort of possession due to the scary pressense in the dream which seemed to look like my cousin who is a year younger than me), and drown (evil pressence in that one was some huge orange spiney fish thing. Like an oversized pahranna.) and ofcourse the most popular one, falling(actually tested after finding a lucid dream. I was in one of those bucket sky ride things you see at the zoo or amusement parks and realized that I was dreaming because the landscape was constantly changing and I just jumped off the side and hit the ground and just kind of kept falling.) So that's about it for the ways it's happened to me.
<br />

<br />
Now the weirdest thing is that it has a controlable intensity to it. Like I can simply relax my body durring one of the experiences and it seems to get stronger. Once I had it to the point of where I could no longer bare it anymore and then I actually became afraid and woke back up. The weirdest thing is that via rumor, if you die in a dream, you die in real life. I'm still here, obviously the rumors aren't true. But I just cant shake the feeling that one of these days It'll happen again and it will become so strong that I'll die or something. Weird, I know. Ok, so if anyone has any ideas of what this all might be, let me know.
