			My granda has always had a bad heart, he finally reached a pretty stable condition with no risk of sudden death. Then about a year ago he went into hospital with trouble breathing, at first they thought it was heart failure but it ended up it was fibrosis of the lungs. I'm very close to my grandparents as my mum was pregnant with me at quite a young age (15) so I basically stayed with them while my mum was at school. When we were on a family holiday he caught a virus and came very close to dying, he survived the night, and returned to a stable condition after several weeks. This woke me to realising that he will eventually die, I now accept that but am still not looking forward to the day. I was wondering if anyone could tell me around how much time I have left with him, not to try and precent the inevitable but just to prepare myself. Also a specific isn't neccesary just an around when it'll happen also how he'll die isn't neccesary but it would be a bonus. If anyone needs any more info just ask, if anyone could give me this information I would be eternally greatful.

			The a common mindset people have when thinking about things is exactly when it will happen. They get so worried and caught up with it that it eventually gets to the point where they forget to live life waiting until that fateful moment arrives be it good or bad. Charish all the time you have with him and don't mark the calander for things like this. It would ruin whatever time you and him had left together.

This isn't really what the Applied Psionics section is for.  Your grandfather's doctors would probably give you a better estimate then anyone here could.  Locked.
