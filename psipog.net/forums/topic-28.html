			I have problems utilizing psi when/where I want to. I can only do psychokinesis with a psi-wheel, types of tinfoil, and hanging objects. (Circular motion)
<br />
I am trying to learn to move objects in different manner than I normally do(spinning vs.rolling/sliding), but am getting no results. What do you do when learning something new and something won't budge? Do you try everyday or try on very small objects to begin? 
<br />
  Next, I cannot move objects when in public except for one circumstance. In my college cafeteria they had foil snowflake decorations hanging from the ceiling. I was very suprised to see I could move them easily and set a bunch spinning at once. It was good practice while I ate, but they already took them down. Does anyone use pk throughout their day? I would find it useful to be able to turn on/off lights, appliances, ect.

			Just because results aren't seen doesn't mean nothing is happening... It's like the old saying goes, the absense of evidence is not the evidence of absense. My point here being, just because I may not see big, or results at all, doesn't I dont try. When you pick up something as your reaching for it try to focus on pulling it to you, when you push something try to focus on pushing it more so. Help your mind out by combining corporeal and psionic, give it a &quot;jump start&quot; in a sense. Anything you do that requires pushing, pulling, touches, or basically interacting with something you can practice PK with.
<br />

<br />
A side note on not being able to do it in other places, consider the fact that often times in other places there are many many distractions fluttering about and if you practice in a low distracting area you get used to not deal with them and having so much focus, but in distracting areas focus is split if you have not trained yourself to better focus. When I practice all Psionic forms I have distractions, multiple distractions infact, on all around my practice area, when I do this it helps me to learn to overcome them and focus on my goal/objective, by doing this I am also learning focus much faster and heavily then one who would just practice in a quiet area.
<br />

<br />
Sooner or later you will have enough practice with things and your abilities will increase to be able to do things at a higher level, but remember go for a challange! No challange no progress.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Good luck out there and practice hard.

			when I try to learn something new, I usually keep trying no matter what, even if I feel it's out of my ability.
<br />

<br />
I don't use psi for anything useful, unless you count numbing pain and speeding up cuts as useful, but I tend to look for random objects to slide when I'm bored at school.

			Really the key to advancement is to keep moving on. You can't expect flowers and sunshine when moving onto a different level... It will take practise, and patience. This is the way you learn telekinesis. Now everytime you get dismotivated, try to think of how far you got, try to think of how much you would regret if you would stop at this point, think what it would be like if you achieve to move it. So really practise and be patient... everybody will be expierencing the moments of being frustrated... it's all part of it... but the goal is to endurance it, and overcome.

I found pushing myself allowed me to move more objects them most people who been practicing longer then I have although I may not be able to move objects fast, but I do see improve ment in speed now.

			I hear from some people that doing PK for the first time, it sort of clicks to them - kind of like riding a bicycle.  What I mean is that it sort of flicks on a light and now you know where you're going and it's easier to do it a second time.  Then from others, I hear that it is hard to start up again, like for me.  I was wondering if there was some way to remember that &quot;click,&quot; or if it's just the same as if it were the first time?

			Thank you very much for your helpful responses. I do realize what its like to lock into psi mode also. It feels like you are strangely connected somehow to what you are moving. What usually happens when I first practice is that I move objects with much more ease and speed. Later through practice(30min) 
<br />
I feel exhausted. I feel that practicing everyday just pushes me too hard with minimal gain.

treat it like muscular exercise, overload but not to much or you get negitive results.

			I think Tk is a subconcious activity, and so i try to comunicate to my subconcious through hand gestures and what not. Gestures that i feel realy communicate my objective to my subconsious. For example I use to make a triangle with both my index fingure and thumb joined together to my other index finger and thumb on my other hand. I placed the 'triangle' over the object i'm trying to roll,and i automaticaly focus on the object, then if i focus on it long enough, it usualy just starts to roll.
<br />

<br />
well thats jsut my experience, hope it helps.
