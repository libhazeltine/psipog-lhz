			Its my second day trying to move stuff using TK. I cant seem to move anything at all. I cant even get really light things to move.
<br />
How many people here can honestly get pens and things to move. I have seen a few videos so i should believe it. Im still not convinced though, especially after reading the thread about phasing.. yeah, i believe it could be possible, but people where saying they had fallen through things etc. I just find it hard to believe.
<br />
So is it really possible to move things using your mind ?

			thats what happened with me, today was my first day and i did it!! but anyway, for me a lot of this is visualization and such, you need to believe it can happen, and you have to visualize it happening, or else its just sort of an empty gesture. but, thats how it worked for me

			Day four for me.  I did it instantly..... if you don't count the weeks I tried to make a psi-wheel spin under a glass a long time ago <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
What's frustrating me is that nothing &quot;seems&quot;  to be happening.  I emphasize seems because I can tell from the small jerky movement on the wheel that for a half a second my sub-c is trying to move it one way and then desides to move it back the other way.
<br />

<br />
While that may seem like self promotion what I'm hoping to say is that perhaps your sub-c hasn't picked a direction, or may be trying to do something you don't intend, like lifting or squishing.
<br />

<br />
That said, when I can get it going in a single direction it does go.  I've manged to move a pin a small (VERY small) distance, as well as a toothpick.  No two minds work the same, so it's a bit premature to begin questioning how real PK is.  What are you attempting to move?  even apperent &quot;light&quot; objects have a lot of static friction to overcome.  Take a pinch of flour and putting it on the table blow on it.  It will scatter, BUT, you will notice that no matter how hard you blow you can't make all the flour go away.  Small flat objects on flat surfaces can be quite difficult to move.  Consider the force your breath is exerting, small doesn't equal easy.  Now the best (so far that I can see) object is a psiwheel made of tissuepaper (yes, you do have to be cafeful) because it rests on a small point and requires a very smalll amount of force.  Trying to move difficult things first will only frustrate you, there is a good reason most people start with a psi-wheel.  Your sub-c will gain more positive feed back and you will be far more motivated from your first success.  Make that first success as easy as you can.

			I actually think a psi wheel made out of tinfoil is better than tissue paper.  Yeah tissue paper is freaking light but the tinfoil reduces the friction (i think).  I seemed to have more luck with the tinfoil one.

			hey mark <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ,if you really want to do tk,then the first thing you have to master is belief.its the basis of everything.Just take it this way--imagine and see everything around you as unstable and vulnerable things.This should help you a lot.A single and slight doubt can prevent you from progressing.So,first start believing.It can be made possible by going through the scientific parts of TK

It is very hard to believe it but i will keep trying and try and believe in it.
<br />
Its just all that talk about phasing has put me off this. People saying they phased through floors and sofa's just sounds like 12 years are making stuff up.
<br />
Ill keep trying though. I think once i move something then it will probably be much easier. I will then know it is possible and &quot;I&quot; can do it.
<br />
So far ive tried hanging a pin from thread and tried moving it. I've also been trying to roll a bottle top across the desk. So far i havnt managed anything.
<br />
I would like to try this psi wheel thing but i have seen someone do it by just putting there hands near one to create a current of air. They said they had never learnt tk and they could make one spin. 
<br />
Maybe i will try one inside a glass.

As long as its in a glass then nothing else could effect it. I just wish i could see some in person or do it myself so i could really believe it! Im just surprised its not scientifically been proven possible yet when so many people seem to be able to do it.

			Tissue paper would depend on type.  I have the kind with the smooth side and rough side.  Foil might work as well or better depending on the size of the wheel.  As you make it bigger metal is going to require more force to move.  You also should consider using a very fine needle or pin rather than a tack.  I've found this works better for reducing friction than making the psiwheel smoother, because it reduces contact surface with the wheel.
<br />

<br />
You can try a glass, but I've personally put my glass on the shelf for now.  I can't seem to make it move through a physical barriar at this point in time.  I used a discarded budgie feather to detect for air currents where I intended to move the wheel to ensure accurate results.
<br />

<br />
Don't be afraid to take what you read anywhere with a grain of salt.  I wouldn't suggest reading too much about harder things to do.  It usually leads people to become impatient, as they try to push themselves to catch up to people who have been doing things longer.  Just take your time and start at the begining.

It just seems strange that everyone on here seems to be 16 or under.. most the people seem to be 12 or 13. Just makes me think alot of people making stuff up to make people think they are amazing. Also loads of people probably think they can do tk but they are actually just moving a psi wheel by heat from there hands. I managed to get one spinning everytime i put my one hand near it and i wasnt even trying to make it spin.
<br />
Ill try one under a glass and see if i can get it to work.

			Why would people waste there time lieing?
<br />

<br />
Also I have a question about the heats from your hand thing. Why can I control which way my wheel goes if it is heat from hands? My hands stay in the same place and somehow I can control which direction it goes. When I try not to move it with my hands around it, it never moves.
<br />

If you dont believe, leave, simple as that
