			As Zeta somewhat explained is that particles come out of a black hole.
<br />
This is due to the hawking theory I think the theory is that if 2 virtual(virtual is an amount of almost exactly 0) that photons appear at the event horizon(the start of the void) that one is pulled in and one shot out because the 2 virtual photons orbiting each other become so close because of compression that they go below the Planck length (10^-35) where the theory of relativity is invalid.  So that means stuff can escape black holes.

			i dont think that a black hole sucks time in but bends time for example i am a huge fan of stargate right and there was a black hole near a planet that was connected to earth through a stable wormhole but because of the black hole the mountain complex the stargate is in time was going slower than outside the mountain so in theory time was bent or distorted causing the time inside the complex to be passing slower than outside but because the stargate shut down the time returned to normal although every ones clocks we behind a few hours.

			I hate to say anything guys but as a quantum and astro physicist major in college, I'll have to bring up a couple points here.
<br />

<br />
One, Photons do have mass, if they did not have mass, there would be no energy. For proof of this, look at light, what is it made of? It's made of Photons. Now look at Einstein's mathematical equation E=mc^2 . Converted to words this equation means Energy is equal to mass times the speed of light squared. If photons had absolutely zero mass, the energy output would also be zero, there for there would be no light. Thus I rest my case on photons having to have mass.
<br />

<br />
Point 2, Regarding BlackHoles, unfortuantly I've forgotten where I had gotten the proof of where black holes exist, but just recently they've discovered one that is emitting energy-an unheard of case, but it's staying within the event horizon and it looks like a type of radiation barrier. 
<br />
If this is the case, therorectically speaking, as the energy build up keeps increasing at tremendous amounts over time, it would distort the gravitational field- by weakening it and that extremely dense pocket of matter that seems to have disapeared would expand back out to where the radiation barrier is. This is how some astrophysicist thinks that nuetron stars might be formed this way.

			Well, if black holes are a large mass compressed by its own gravity, I read that in a book, then why shouldn't they exist?
<br />
If a sun for example has used all of whatever it is burning, that would happen?

OFF TOPIC: I once created a theory that anything divided by 0 is 1 and anything divided by 1 is 0....long story, and I'm 16.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, I thought Einstein said nothing could go faster than light, yet they say the gravity well of a black hole causes this speed as soon as it hits the event horizon.
<br />

<br />
Tossing more in, where does anti-matter come into play?
<br />

<br />
Also, in reference to the above quote, time <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> distorted. 
<br />

This phenomenon has been verified experimentally in the Scout rocket experiment of 1976,[9] and is, for example, taken into account in the Global Positioning System (GPS). Near the event horizon, the time dilation increases rapidly. To the distant observer, a falling object's movement slows down, approaches but never reaches the event horizon. Any escaping photons do not slow down when escaping the gravity well but experience redshifting. From the falling object's frame of reference, it will cross the event horizon and reach the singularity at the center of the black hole within a finite amount of time.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

			Antimatter is made by fusion. I will try to make a detailed explanation on layman terms. 
<br />
Hydrogen atoms, only has 1 proton and 1 electron with no nuetrons. Two of those hydrogen atoms come together in the core of the sun, they fuse, it then becomes 2 protons and 1 electron with one electron disapearing, with 2 gamma particles leaving. This is classified as heavy hydrogen atom. It takes 4 heavy hydrogen atoms to fuse into a hellium atom &quot;which has 2 protons, 2 nuetron, and 2 electrons&quot;. However, 4 heavy hydrogen atoms has 4 electrons, 8 protons, and no nuetrons, scientists are not sure how but it seems that some of the protons convert to nuetrons and the excess electrons are stripped away but this process however, has 2 antimatter particles and 8 gamma particles given off.
<br />

<br />
Also, there are particles that travel faster then the speed of light, I believe the latest one is called the &quot;K Particle&quot;, and Tacyon is still theorectical particle.
<br />

<br />
As for time distortion, I can mention proof for this, ran across a news article about it oh roughly 5 years back.  Take two atomic clocks, make sure they are identical to each other, leave one at the train station and have the other one on a train. That train travels at 50mph for couple hours. Compare the two atomic clocks against each other, the clock that was on the train is minutely slowly then the one that was left behind. It's been proven that the faster you go, the more time gets distorted. For example, John Glen &quot;the astronaut&quot; is estimated to have added roughly 11 seconds to his life span for his high rates of speed being up in space. Comparatively speaking as space speeds go he was just crawling but on earth it would translate somewhere in the vincinity of 17000 mph.
<br />

<br />
Just some food for thought

			well everybody i wanted to make somthing clear and i know there maybe some people around here that know what know multiplied by zillions but anyway
<br />
black holes are some kind of stars that have lived for zillions and zillions of years and before they totally collapse or just spread in the universe they become black coulored and they dont emit light (maybe they overcome light existance with its darkness)
<br />

<br />
P.S i've seen lot of offensive language over here so if you see i am wrong or repeating what others said so just be kind and tell me the right thing  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

			From what I've read, most people have distance-related hangups when it comes to OBEs, so if a person has trouble going out of state in an OBE, I would think it would be ever so slightly (Read as: Infinately) harder to leave the planet in one.
