			My girlfriend has recently been hit with a rock of sorts. She is experiencing pain. Now, previously, i've used our psi-link and a great deal of visualization to help ease the pain. Is there anything i can do to help it, and woiuld be more effective?

			MORPHENE.... that always helps. As for psionic help, empathetically send her the feeling of comfort.

			if she's hurt badly, get her to a doctor and or give her pain pills.
<br />

<br />
if she's not seriously hurt this might help.  have her breathe in slow for four counts, hold for two, breath out slow  for four counts.  Like meditateing and she has to think of nothing until she feels very relaxed and then have her picture herself feeling better.
<br />

<br />
This works for me when I have a headache and I don't have to take asperin.
<br />

<br />
 she doesn't have to do this for hours or anything.  just one or two good visualizations and then she can let go and forget about it.  in a short while she should feel better.

			He didn't ask for medical advice, he asked how to stop pain.  The way to stop pain is by not letting the pain signal get to the brain.  This means either directing that signal along the nerves or by stopping it (absorbing it into a construct).
<br />

<br />
The method I use is the latter, by putting a small construct inline with a nerve as close as you can to the end so as to cut off all the pain while still leaving maximum working receptors.
<br />

<br />
Remember pain is useful, treating only the effect (pain) is just like standard medicine (via pain pills etc), but in cases of chronic pain accupuncture and other psionic methods can be used quite effectively to stop or dampen pain.
