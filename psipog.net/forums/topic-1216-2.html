			Well I tried it again last night and nothing yet for me, although this time I did feel kind of weird to the fact that I felt like the room was slowly moving or something to that degree but I was sitting still on the couch.  I'll keep at it though.

			the point is that you want to want the guy's voice to be boring. You should bask in it and even if your mind tells you that its boring, just let your self like it. And do everything he says to the &quot;T&quot; Dont worry you will get it. And like he said, dont expect to be seriously tranced. You are still well aware of your surroundings.

			Well actually it was my 4th time, I wonder if certain people are not capable of being hypnotized.  I'll keep trying and I'll let you know.  When you guys do it do you start from track 2?

			I am starting from track 2 and I do follow what he says to the &quot;T&quot;, and I believe I do feel relaxed but when it comes to visualizing the light and the various shockra(sp) colors I don't see anything.  I actually don't think I have been able to visualize much for a few years now <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> almost as if that part of my brain went on a long term vacation.

			its not visuals.. its the feeling.... he emphasizes on that alot. I dont see anything either. The only thing i know is that there is a bright energy raining down into my crown chakra which is purple in color. Then i feel stimulation where your crown chakra is supposed to be... same with the brow, throat, heart. ect. Try it one more time...

			I hope I'm not wrong for saying this, but, I'm skeptical about trying it, because, I think it was in the second link, it said something about paganis, wicca, and something else, and I'm kinda worried (religious reasons). Does it really have anything to do with what's listed above? 
<br />
Thank you, and please don't hate me for posting this.

			no no no...its nothing like that..nothing at all. It sounds more scientific than anything. No religion there. Just repeation techniques and positve output such as &quot;With the unlimited power of your mind you can control objects and succeed beyond your dreams.&quot; Its really great and it helps alot.

			Alright basically what happens is when you go to track 2 (skipping 1 unless your a total newb to psionics.) He tells you what he is going to do. He shows you the mudra technique and says that he will put you under guided meditation, charge, balance, and open your chakras (religous i know but i felt something.) Then he will give you some positive reinforcement that psycokenisis is real and puts these in your head. Then he moves on to tell you to imagine a situation where you are successfully using psycokenisis and to be very detailed. 
<br />

<br />
Then comes the repeating technique with the phrase in the post above yours. It would also help to know atleast alittle about how to communicate with your sub-c. For when you say the phrase with him to yourself as he instructs. Your not really thinking anything you just send out the feeling along with him. He says this several times and then again asks you to imagine a situation where you are successfully using psycokenisis and then he wakes you up.
<br />

<br />
Track 4 discribes again how to acheive this mental state, rehitoring (sp?) the mudra technique and what not. Track 5 is where he puts you under again in the same fasion, then while you are in a trance, he instructs you to open your eyes barly and soft-focus them, and to attempt to perform an act of psycokenisis. The he wakes you up. The the breif outro is track 6.
<br />

<br />

<br />
[EDIT:] I just posted, then reread your post and realised i didnt quite hit on your question. I havent been able to move the psiwheel yet, but im still in my week preliminary that he talks about. He says that you should do this daily for a week to get to your natural mental state and then from that point you would have to do the same excersise three times a week to keep performing at your peak. Im just about to give it another go in a few seconds. Ill keep my eyes peeled afterwards incase you post again. Mabye i will beable to better discribe it.

			everytime that you use this program and the mudra technique it becomes more effective... keep up the good work. An OBE is more than what i have reaped from it... and it did the whole CD twice in a row the first time it came up on the boards and i have done it three other times last week.
