			I have been following this experiment's progress for some time now.  There was a documentary on it on the Science channel not too long ago, but I missed it.  (I'm still cursing myself for it.)  From what I did see in the commercials, they appeared to even have a monkey of some kind operating one of those robotic arms with it.  Just think, as the technology improves, and prosthetic robotic arms become more affordable, we'll begin to see more people with robotic arms that operate just as well as a normal arm, minus the sense of touch.  (I honestly think that simulating that isnt too far off either, after all its just an electrical impulse translated by the brain right?)

Maybe its just because I'm a gaming freak but I can see this tehcnology, in its later stages, being used for entertainment.  Imagine a virtual reality type game, where you have a 1st person view form your virtual self, that you control with your mind.  A virtual body you can control down to the finger movements.  Imagine fighting through dungeons D&amp;D style like that.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

All of a sudden, games like EQ, and WoW would acutally involve a level of skill, rather than the winner always being the higher level, or the one with the better stuff.

I can see this happening soon.  In fact, I hope to someday be a part of it.

			I feel the same way. I love to see things like this, just because it feels like we're advancing further, technologically speaking. I saw something similar in a video I watched in Biology. There was a blind man who had offered to participate in a program that could possibly give him his &quot;eye sight&quot; again. They put electrodes on the part of the brain that  is responsible for processing images, or sight (Can't remeber the name for the life of me). Then through surgery a port was installed into his skull and was connected to the nodes. Then, the scientists &quot;plugged&quot; him into a computer, and he was able to see images produced by the computer. I'll try to find more about it and see if I can link it here.

Welcome to Earth <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.  Stop wishing for a virtual fantasy, and start creating a fantasy with the reality you're presented with NOW.

On topic with the first post - that article is amazing.  The brain's ability to do crazy shit like that blows my mind.
