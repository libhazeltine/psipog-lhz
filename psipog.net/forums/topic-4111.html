			Hello all,
<br />
   I'm really interested in fork/spoon/etc. bending, but I've had no (observable?) success at it. I don't know enough people willing to try it in a party setting to have a PK party and try it.
<br />
   Do you know of any free downloadable video or audio that will talk someone through the process?
<br />
   Dick Sutphen has a CD for this, as does Nicole Whitney on News for the Soul. The former is $14, and the latter is $39 for the download ($50 for the hard copies, a bent and unbent spoon, stickers, etc.). Sutphen's CD has good reviews, but I don't want to have to rely on the CD to do it the first few times ... Whitney's kit promises success, but I know nothing of her, the site, etc., and it's quite expensive to a college student!
<br />
   Jack Hauok also has a DVD of a metal bending party, but it's anywhere from $10-$26 (depending on where you get it), and it has mixed reviews.
<br />
   Also, the point is ... I don't want to have to buy anything! 
<br />
   If any of you have any free audio and/or video tutorials/courses/procedures/meditations/etc., please share! (It's fine if they're your own home made ones or something)
<br />
   God bless,
<br />
       Alex

			Maxus,
<br />
   I have, both alone (a dozen times or so), and once with a group of 3 of us. I've never even been able to bend it slightly without significant physical effort.
<br />
   I'm not new to PK-I can move the pinwheel with no hands and make it go in either direction (if slowly), and on a good day, I can make it switch directions.
<br />
   God bless,
<br />
       Alex

			The dvd's and cds are nifty, and have their uses but not necissary.   Also, you could get dependent on them.  For a while I could only move my psi-wheel when listening to Japa.  Broke that.  Well, i dont really touch it anymore, but beside the point.
<br />

<br />
I've taken up the same interest.  Only one succeses.  I'm organizing an Online PK party.  The psipog ones had pretty good results so maybe that'll be your ticket to success.  Jack Houck said that from his 17000 people he's taught, 85% could do it at the party and 52%(something like that) where able to do it after their first party. The rest it took a couple more.  But keep trying! Use fork-you and Jack, those are my picks.  Fork-you has alot of cool links, including Jack's AMAZING site.
