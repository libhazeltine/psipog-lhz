I would like to note that you do not have a uterus. Therefore, you cannot know what cramps are like. I've had stomach cramps too. The cramps women get during menstruation are caused by contracting muscles at the uterus. Basically, utrine cramps are a mini version of labor, eased only by the fact that you don't have to push something out.

			Hey, I'm not trying to get in an argument about who feels more pain. I was simply trying to note that comparing stomach cramps to utrine cramps is like comparing apples to oranges.

			Thanks for holding up the fort while I was gone Eldibs. (I'm not on during the weekend). Sheesh, I am gone for two days and all of you guys are argueing about stomach cramps and female problems and stuff like that. I never new this poll would get this big. (Don't worry Eldibs I got your back) Oh Yeah, I'm fat...I bet none of you girls have experienced the power of fatness. (that'll show them)
