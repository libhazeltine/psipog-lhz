			I serously need some guidance in making a construct that stays alive if I don't focus on it...
<br />
So far I can make a psiball in a few seconds by imagining there's a big ball between my hands and if I keep that up for a few seconds I feel it between my hands. Sometimes I imagine flowing stuff from my arms and through my hands into the ball but that's not alwas neccesary. If I press my hands together slowly there's some pressure between them. If I stop thinking about it the pressure goes away so it's not just some muscle strain <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
How can I make it stay if I stop thinking about it?
<br />
A few times I have succesfully moved my hands away from the ball but kept focus on the psiball and when I moved my hands back I could again feel the ball. 
<br />
But if I lose my focus for a second it's gone..
<br />

<br />
I've read articles about making it hollow and creating the ball inside the other but I can't seem to do that <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
<br />
Can someone give my some tips or personal experiances that might be of some help?

			In my experience, shielding and programming it to draw energy from you seem to be effective.
<br />

<br />
Its made a shield of mine last a long time.

			Well I need to be able to program the psiball for this....
<br />
I can't do that yet <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> Guess I'll have to start learning it....
<br />

<br />
I can only feel a psiball with my hands and not with my awareness yet, so that doesn't really make stuff easier...

			Well, if you don't make it such that it doesn't lose energy (shelling), of course its going to dissapear rather quickly.  It seems to be a rare case in programming, but I am able to just program my constructs by telling them what to do.  You can try that.  If you are like other people however, you would have to try to visualize or feel the programming.
<br />

<br />
Shelling in itself is essentially just programming, and it is the life of extending construct's lives.  Learn to program, and you can learn to have constructs draw energy, thus learning to make long-lasting constructs.

			Bah, I had the same problem, and that's the reason I don't shield... It'd be smart to learn though I guess. I just didn't have the patience. Stupid constructs not living. <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />

			Is there another way to know if the construct is still alive?
<br />
Trying to feel it with my hands isn't exactly fullproof and I don't have a clue of how this awarenes works.
<br />
I don't have other people around to check it either....

			Just a little something to sense the constructs.. Place it in one of your ears! I'm new to making constructs and I've been able to sense it very well this way. You can tell the ear you place it in feels different even if you don't concentrate on it, and if you place both fingers in both ears you can tell the differance <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
