			how long have you been practicing? and you dont need a more detailed version...just fluff out your feild like it said and visualize yourself going through it....and the atoms in your body not collide with the atoms in the objects...you gotta rea arrange the atoms....

			psykillerx, you really have NO idea what phasing is do you?  Ignore his post completely, I suspect he just likes having a large post content regardless of whether he posts nonsense or not.
<br />

<br />
Phasing is an extension of modifying probabilities like manipulating dice rolls.  The only difference is that there are a lot of dice involved and you're attempting to roll a number that these dice have a small chance of landing on.  In this analogy your atoms are the dice and when they &quot;roll a certain value&quot; they cease to exist in our universe.
<br />

<br />
Atoms in general are not always there, their existence is simply a tendecy according to quantum physics.  So if you can affect the quantum phase state of your atoms so that they drop out of existence when they SHOULD be occupying the space another object already occupies, then you're phasing.  Not having to phase your whole body at once to go through an object is key as it means you control the phase state of less atoms at a time.  Basically you want to be able to control probabilities (so practice on dice, or even everyday occurrences, this means you can practice anywhere you go without having to sit down and set aside time in your day for it) and once you can do that, apply that to phase states of your body instead of dice producing certain numbers.
<br />

<br />
Also, even though the number of dice you'll be rolling will be miniscule compared to the number of atoms in your body, this doesn't really matter.  Surprisingly, the mind doesn't really care how large a scale you are working on unless you impose a mental barrier to force your mind to think that way.  So realizing that &quot;size matters not&quot; is pretty key, but that's a bit more philosophical and really isn't something I can just MAKE you embrace and believe.  You need to get rid of any mental blockages in that area yourself, though I suggest using NLP as it speeds up that type of process.
<br />

<br />
Now remember that while this isn't dangerous (ever heard of someone phasing themself into a wall then getting stuck?  It's simply not possible since once you get to that point where you're in the wall, it becomes quite apparent that you CAN phase so getting stuck is a non-issue since you know you can do it), it can be painful.  People generally make errors when controlling the phase of their atoms while phasing and so things are quickly popping into existence still, just a lot less often which still allows one to pass through an object but also means your nerves are briefly being severed and resevered.  Scary stuff obviously, so try at your own risk but I doubt serious physical harm can come from phasing.

			Very well put Lightbringer, I never thought of it like that.  I always thought that it was about moving your own particles through the spaces between particles of solid matter, but now after reading what you posted, and thinking about it, I see that that no longer makes much sense.  I've heard that a physical object never actually makes an contact with another, due to the natural charges they possess.  The particles repel one another to such a degree that they stop just short of making contact. (What the Bleep do we Know)  It really wouldn't make any sense to force your own particles through, because you woudl be fighting the natural resistance of the matter's particles repelling your own.  (sorry if thats not very scientific sounding, I'm no genius in this matter)  Theman01 the part about prticles popping in and out of existence is also true.  Isn't Quantum Physics great?
<br />

<br />
Oh and Lightbringer,  if thats what phasing is, and it involves manipulating the probabilites that the aprticles will be there the instant in which you try to pass into their area, then wouldn't that make phasing an example of micro-PK on a macro scale?

			Exactly Teekay, it is simply micro-PK on a large scale.  And amusingly enough, that explanation dawned on me first while watching &quot;What the bleep Do We Know?&quot;.  Of course, I talked to many other people who have phased and studied phasing to get a concensus of whether the theory fit before expressing it as fact.

			ive read somewhere that if you drive a car into a wall everysecond, from now until eternity. the car will go phase through the wall at least once. thats the only method i know. sadly i dont have that many cars or walls.

Oh my god, that is one of the funniest things I've EVER read.  I'm going to be laughing about this all day, then it's going to pop in my head later at the inmost opportune times (like during a final exam in a room of hundreds of people lol).
