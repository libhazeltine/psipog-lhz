			so i showed my sister this time about what i was doing. but if i explained it to her first or showed her in front of her face she wouldnt believe what i would be saying at first. so i asked to use her camera and didnt tell her what for, and i made a video of me spinning the psiwheel. then i went to her room and at first she thought i was going to stab my hand. until she saw the piece of paper which started to spin almost instantly. from then on shes saying whaaattt? over and over again while just giggling. i then explained what i was doing and how ive been practicing it and she told her boyfriend(were good buddys), and like most skeptical men he thought it was just static electricity from my hand even thought i stated that i can do it without my hands. so im happy that ive told her now and hopefully eventually ill tell my whole family and gain some more encouragement <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.

			I'm going for pencils too. People just think it's wind with a psiwheel. grrrr.
<br />

<br />
Ooooooooh, I forgot about this, today, I was bored in my german lessen and I moved my pen lid!!! And this is no ordinary pen lid, we're talking a full on metal one that belongs to a pen literally twice the weight of a normal pen (my pen if quite hefty). It felt like it was really me, the same feeling I get when I move the psiwheel. 
<br />
I was just kind of day dreaming and lost focus on what the hell my teacher was going on about and I put my pen on my book and just tried to move for the sake of it, and it rolled a bit, then it stopped and rolled straight off the page!! 
<br />
Sorry for changing the subject, I just needed to get that out, because I havn't told anyone about it yet.

			I've told my parents, they think somehow I'm going through an evil spirit to be able to do it but I just don't realize it. I don't care, haha, I'm pretty light hearted about what they think about it, I'm 19 years old and I make most of my own decisions. They're cool parents too, they don't get on me about stuff, they just let me suffer the consequences for what I do, so they're not that crazy one way or another about me moving crap with my mind. My biological dad would definitely be cool with it because he tried for the longest time to move stuff and never could, so he would be delighted to know I can, however, we don't talk much.

			I don't think I ever will tell my family, it would just be too wierd afterwards. I have a mother and a sister that both like to gossip. I tell one of them, and suddenly everyone in my entire family will think I'm crazy. I'm considering doing what PK_11 said and waiting until I can move pencils, baut that looks like a long time from now.

			My ex-girlfriend was the very first person I showed PK to.  We actually just sitting around at her house doing a whole lot of nothing, watching T.V., I think.  She said she was bored or something like that.  Of course, that was her way of basically telling me to entertain her.  I told her I would show her a bit of &quot;magic&quot;.  So I went through this bullcrap routine of waving my hands around and tryed to get a watch on the table to spin.  It didn't.  So after looking like a total idiot, we went back to watching T.V. and I began getting a connection with the watch, which was why I didn't have success the first time.  
<br />
I guess she saw me staring at the watch, because she told it isn't going to move, so I can stop staring at it.  And like the big showoff-guy I am, I made the watch slide.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure, she grabbed my hand and broke ever bone in there, but nonetheless, it was pretty funny. I didn't tell her it was psychokinesis, just magic.  But, she was the first person I ever showed any kind of PK to.
