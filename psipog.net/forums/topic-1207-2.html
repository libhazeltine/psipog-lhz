Wow, it's the complete opposite for me.

If I don't have some kind of electricity on around me I kinda freak out and get all panicky.</span></span>

			What? Its not a gift, my mother and my brother can hear the tv too if they pay attention, as well as the phone charger, but some people notice things more. Some people are more anoyed by noises and can make better observations. Im anoyed by noise, but my mother sleeps with the TV on.

			I am having the &quot;high pitched&quot; sound everytime when there are no heavy electrical devices around me that are on, but I do hear the &quot;high pitched&quot; sound when a TV is on, and maby other devices to that I haven't payed attention to.
<br />

<br />
I do think this has to do with some sort of field you are hearing. When going through the process of an OBE, you could hear the increasement of the &quot;high pitched&quot; sound. This sound could be the sound of the frequency you operate through right now at the moment.
<br />

<br />
It's not really something annoying for me at all. It's really a sound I could just mute by not paying attention to it. Although, I really don't ignore the sound, I rather expirement with it.

			Sorry to bring up a slightly old threat but I have something to say.
<br />

<br />
Heard of those new ringtones adults can't hear? They're at a high enough pitch that only teenagers and young children with hearing still in tact can hear them. People above 20 or so usually can't. It does work, and it sounds just like the buzzing the tv makes when it turns on.
<br />

<br />
Maybe that explains why some people can't hear these high frequencies.
