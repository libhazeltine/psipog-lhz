			I'm 18 atm, going 19 in 29th May. I found myself thinking about psi stuff when I was around 8/9 years or so, thinking it would be pretty neat to do that stuff. At the time, some new age stuff was going on TV, about how to improve your mind capabilities and such. At the time, I disregarded such things as bs, thinking it would be cool to do, but it wasn't real.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, one summer night, about 2 years ago, I found a psi topic in gamefaqs, and found myself reading it. Followed some links, and voil?. The rest is history. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

But it would've been best if I clicked 15 because I will be 15 soon ^-^ (march 9th) I've started with &quot;paranormal&quot;(how society calls it) things when I was 12... or 11

I used to get these headaches, that would dull all senses, and would be able to feel other peoples emotions.  People told me the headaches were just migranes, and the emotions stuff was body language.  After like 5, I guess I developed a natural shield.  Once I got into 4th grade, I thought I had seizures back then, but it seemed to lack simptoms, mainly, the wobbling around.  Someone scanned me afew months ago, saying I had a fairly strong shield, without me even considering shielding at the time.

			14, 15 in about 3 months. Early april, 1-10th, around then. Don't judge me by that, judge me by my absurdness.

You'll see that often enough in a post, like as such, what my birthdate is.

Linked over via topic from another forum...the guy was joking around, but every now and then, he's serious. I guess I got lucky that I was wrong and thought he was serious. And for that specific reason, I'm here today.
<br />

<br />
Edit: I used to be able to do some sweet cryo+pyro-PK stuff with a friend...sadly though, he eventually dismissed it, or forgot about it. I kept believing in psionics, even though I thought they were fake...very delusional world this is. (He's got ADD, so it's hard for him to keep concentration on things...)

(Although, this was while I was 10 or maybe less... Still, we had no knowledge of psi or anything...)

			I'm 16, been involved in this in some way or another for say...6/7 years. Its generally just been an elongated interest in the paranormal. I long to be able to do half this stuff, but, like twig I lack motivation. I got psipog from a friend, forgot about it for a while, and just recently discovered it as my one true love. I'm hoping to be more disiplined starting NOW and getting better at this. As a confession, I can't even make a good psi ball. The only things I have running for me are a slight touch with empathy, and the fact that chanelling runs in my family you could say. Neither of these count for much. As a side note, I tend to run away with my mouth, and I like talking to people, especially about anything related to this site.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I'm 16 and I've been practicing psi for about six months. I've known that it was real for about four years. I &quot;discovered&quot; it when my friend moved her pencil telekinetically. It was an interesting way to be exposed to the paranormal, I can tell you I was freaked out. Now though I ask her whenever she comes down from Florida to &quot;do it again&quot; lol. I've been an empath since I was born according to my mother. I developed a natural shield when things took a turn for the worse in my life. Now I'm just happy that I know about psi because it's a natural part of who I am. I'm also glad to be a part of psipog because it's a sanctuary for me- I feel like I can discuss things openly here ^_^. Sorry though if you guys think I talk to much or don't clarify my questions for new topics enough. Anyway I'm surprised to see how many people are around my age here.

			I'm 19, I found out about Psi(Pog) a few months ago i think it was October or begin November.
<br />
My main interest is Psychokinesis as a kid i had a few experiences with strange telekinesis events and had alot of dreams about those things.
<br />
The first time i was on Psipog i read some articles and after 2 days i had my first results with psiwheel and psiballs.
<br />
Since then i have been practicing regulary and i still practice allmost daily.
<br />
I'm now on the point where i can spin tinfoils (balanced on middle) and i'm practicing rolling pens cups and balls without results(yet).
<br />
I think Psionics is a fun thing to practice and challenging yourself with stuff you'd never think of doing is a good way of exploring and learning to &quot;really&quot; know yourself

Enjoy this mistake for you all shall never see another from me <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.
