Exactly, you don't see any potential at all, because you're just concentrated on yourself and on your own ego. Trust me on this, that will work and that will be cool for a certain time, then you will not have any benefit of that anymore and in the end you'll realise of useless this is, and that you could have done better than just keeping it for yourself and your friends. Have control over others <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> ...great, I'm really happy for you. Sorry, I'm completely against this type of thinking. I respect your opinion, but I find that  really sad. Anyway.....

I'm generalizing, indeed. Do I have the choice?? It doesn't look like... so far though. I'd like not to generalise.... I'm just reporting what I see &amp; read. You have showed many people PSI.... so have billions of people apparently on the internet.

			I'm not talking about the internet, I'm talking about in-person. I'm done talking about this thread though, you simply want to keep repeating the same things, and want to hold the same mindset. If you happen to drop your doubt and ego, why don't you start practicing and find out for yourself?

Fine. There's no point anyway. You think I'm keeping the same mindset, maybe you're right, but why would I suddenly change my mind if nothing helps me to do so. Anyway... i don't feel I'm having a ego problem in here, I'm just trying to understand and convince myself and that I can't do alone, I don't think I'm pretending that I'm right and that everyone else is wrong.
<br />
tx for your time anyway.
