Anybody have any theories as to why a school would block under the category of paranormal? It's just floating around in my head and it's just one of those things that won't go away until I find an anwer.

You know what's really funny?... PsiPog isn't blocked.

My school filter blocks everything, even proxies, so I can't use a proxy. I mean seriously, it blocks everything except maybe 4 school-approved, completely educational stuff. The funny thing is, it used to not block google searches, so people could just turn google's filter off and then look up porn and stuff. It's pretty sad that the school buys $800 computers from dell with dual 2.4ghz processors and kick ass graphic cards only to block all the websites and not let us play F.E.A.R and half life on them. The middle school's technology lab computers were practically never used and they had those specs.

<br />
What are they trying to prevent???  What do they think they are gonna &quot;save us from?&quot;  If someone REALLY wanted to look at porn, then they would just go to THIER computer and do it.  It makes no sense to make something illegal on one place when it is legal, anywhere else.  So thats why my senior prank is giving websense a virus.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

I'm so excited for that.  You have NOOO idea.  Me and my friends are such dorks...and have way to many connections....and are super dorks...and know how to write viruses....bleh

			I remember back in school... we found out that firefox worked to get past anything we wanted, but eventually they blocked firefox. There is always a way around filters, since nothing can be 100% secure. That is pretty funny... yeah, they don't want you to go crazy with tk like in carrie or get ideas like that....  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

			meets and exceeds the minium requirement, which is 1.7 ghz p4. And I said DUAL 2.4ghz processors. That could run fear at a steady pace, with med-high settings, I'd say. But that's just me. I really, honestly, don't know anything. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Hmmm....by any chance do you go to a private/catholic school?  That's an indicator.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Even in public schools it's an issue.  When you think americans (or canadians, or english, or germans, or mexicans, or french, ect...) what religion comes up?  Christianity/Catholism.  And, when you think of those religions, what antagonist comes up?  The devil.  Don't those two religions put paranormal/supernatural things with the devil?  That being said, it makes sense...Even though there is a supposed seperation of church and state (don't get me started on this lol)
<br />

<br />
Anyways, those religions are associated with, well, most of the world.  They want to be sure the majority of people aren't offended when on school computers, or aren't able to be offended.  Parents are also an issue.  They don't want their &quot;little sally's and billy's&quot; to be corrupted by the &quot;evil paranormal devil tools.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Also, it could be as simple as they would rather you do your schoolwork than look up psionics/ghosts and stuff.  There are many of possibilities, be open to them  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
