			If Sean's geiger counter experiments are reliable, I think it's safe to theorize that PK may be triggered by free moving electrons (or protons). Remember, you measure alpha and beta radiation with a Geiger Counter. That means that by doing PK you may actually create a field of electrons/protons (or maybe just change their state/vibration). A radiactive field.
<br />

This said, Apollos theory isn't bad at all.

			I say you're thoughts are very brilliant. I mean everyone that posted in this thread. Though i think you forget something in your theories. 
<br />
According to the view of electrons and atoms and everything, you must consider that yourself is consisting of it, too. So does everything around you. In fact you're brains consist of it, too.
<br />

<br />
Now it is said that the brain uses electricity to transfer thoughts or maybe just electric impulses to some other part of the brain. You're thoughts are therefore just electric impulses. Now, if you could control the strength of those impulses.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> Well you can, simply by thinking.  You do it all the time. But not only in the brains is the electricity. Nerves or something transfer it through the whole body. If you payed attention in physics, you know also that every electricity flowing forms its magnectic electric field. I don't remember the names or the terms for all those stuff, but i hope you get my point though. 
<br />

<br />
So if you have a magnetic electric field and you say you can influence it in voltage, strength of the electric current and frequency, which is the speed of the electrons traveling, then you can in fact change everything around you, considering that everything around you is made of the same things which are atoms with electrons floating around them. The only difference of them would be the density, the number of electrons or photons or whatever else there is, and the speed with which they are moving. 
<br />

<br />
Now if you can change the stuff i mentioned in the last sentence, and i think we come to the conclusion that we can, because many of us seem to be successful in Psionics, then...We can change the state of an object, I mean the movement of it (for example moving a psiwheel with your mind) and we can wipe out the differences between stuff, though that would be much more complicated and difficult, because it would require a very deep understanding of those things.
<br />

<br />
My own theory on psi is a bit different, though i think the theories that include electrons and atoms and all those stuff aren't bad either. 
<br />

<br />
The point is that one could talk forever about how it works. I mean with the molecules and electrons and whatever, because it is !!!SO!!! complex, but the more important point seems to be why you can do it.  I'm sorry for talking very simplifying about atoms and electrons and stuff, but i didn't get too much into it. If i should be wrong somewhere please tell me.
<br />

<br />
I think the energy which is Psi, will manifest once you give yourself reasons for doing it. By yourself i mean your subconcious. (Your believe system which represents the structure you created that defines how things work and why they happen). It will manifest only if you're sure it will and you will only be able to control it when you keep feeling it. 
<br />
It goes back to the principle of just doing it and feeling it so the &quot;how it works&quot; falls into background, though it is very interesting, like we can see in this thread. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
P.S. What i forgot to integrate in this post are the interactions between electrons and other electrons or atoms or whatever. They're important, too. Because they define how things will behave. But the Main point there seems to be that opposits attract and same things push themselves apart. Of course variable, though. For example ++ and -
<br />

<br />
P.P.S. I was kind of confused while writing this, though i hope you get my point.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

I think I should add one more thing, let not forget how forever the electromangtic world is, mangtics are about 10^42 stronger then gravity (or was it to the 41 or 43 power...its alround there) A few electrons from that balloon that got in your hair already has a enough power to out do gravity

Considering those stuff seriously makes makes me aware of the crazyness of it all. At the same time it lets me have respect for it. 
<br />
It's really very impressive. Consider the ideas those crazy scientists have for a moment seriously and really try to get into them. It makes you really crazy, but if you understand them it brings you more possibilities, simply because you understood it. Try to think on your own seems to be most important advice i can give to you now. Don't trust those freaks. They're really freaks. So are we. So is everyone except very few people.
<br />
Don't trust me as well. 
<br />

<br />
Theorist i think you're theory is good, because you're a Theorist and not a Terrorist luckily. 
<br />

<br />
And yes it was a thesis, every logical speculation with the implementing of reasoning is a thesis. My thesis is bullshit though, though it makes sense. 
<br />

<br />
My post is way too long for a normal forum post, you're right there, but i reccommend you viewing forum posts not as normal forum posts except the normal ones.

HOPE YOU GET MY POINT BUDDIES.

			Apollo your theory has major flaws in it pointed out be Lightbringer and others and also it dosen't really explain anything anyway. If your saying psi is free electrons than how do we control these electrons with neurons? Also where do we get these electrons? Also why can so people do it with a different method? Also you did not adress the second major half of psi at all meaning that your theory either splits the two branches of psi into 2 or just sucks.

This is true, but correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't that result in alpha or beta radiation?  I know that alpha rays can be stopped by paper, and beta rays aren't too strong either.  But, when doing something very close range, such as 'charging' or creating a psiball, wouldn't that result in radiation of our hands or the target area?  Isn't that harmful?  Plenty of people have been working with psi for many years, and haven't reported any defects on their bodies...This is one reason I don't *fully* agree with the theory.
<br />

<br />
Also, wouldn't creating this field in electrons (and it would have to be a lot to make the effects some of us are capable of) create some sort of electrostatic shock?  We would at least feel the electricity, and it would be less than pleasant...But, I haven't taken electrostatics (in physics) for a while, so I'm a bit rusty in that field, and could be wrong.
<br />

<br />
I do think it is a good theory, but there are some flaws.  Maybe we could elaborate on this theory, and work out these flaws into something more credible...or true.  But it is good that people (apollo) are thinking about psionics more, and trying to work out what it could be.

			Hey Nightshade!
<br />

<br />
Just like to say one thing. You speak of an electrostatic shock because of creating a field in electrons. 
<br />

<br />
Now i don't care if you believe me. But one day i felt that, an electrostatic shock. I could really feel the electricity, it sort of charged through my whole body and got stronger and stronger. Then at one point it seemed to grow less stronger and ground or something, then it faded out. I don't know why that happened, but this day i was having very strong feelings. They kind of overwhelmed me. Maybe this gives the theory a little backup i don't know.
<br />

<br />
What i think about the radiation is that when you create it yourself, it won't harm you, because it is your own radiation in a way.

Depends, most people don't exactly feel static electricly flow through them. But when they touch something or someone **ZAP** you mite hurt your fingure and the person you touch. My memory is fuzzy but feeling electric shock sort of ranges from a simple formula. The formula sorts of got away from me...but I know resistence is in it. One of the formula can be high with the other side low, which leads down do you not feeling anything unless you connect a flow. But some people have passed out from static electricly.....Or I could be wrong about it all  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

I don't agree with you, Einstein did predict a comsological constant that is puzzling our grestest minds about the laws of the universe. Of cource Einstein called that his biggest flaw...or was it? There was a scienctist who called this element in the universeal &quot;funny energy&quot; from the 5th element Aristotle called &quot;Quintnessence&quot;. Science is already trieing to look for this &quot;funny energy&quot; that is repealing gravity and making people smart as Einstein stay up at night.

Are what we doing connect to this &quot;Quitnessence&quot; is what I think from time to time.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

WRONG!! Radiation has almost never lead to a morphological change in a species. Evolution happens by the NORMAL malfunctions in meoisis which then lead to an organism with altered genes. Also you used the word morphing wrong. Morph means shape so morphing just means shaping.

I believe you, that happens to me when I charge or create a psiball (except the feeling stays until I'm finished).  It could be the energy grounding itself for some reason...try making it flow around you, and don't be passive to it...If it is &quot;self-grounding&quot; then controlling the energy should prevent it from doing so.  But, if that was electricity, I'm guessing I would feel a shock (but, like Tankdown said, resistance does play a factor).  I'm sure if it was electricity, that constant flowing in and around us isn't too good for our neurons.  Also, radiation, is radiation...It's all protons and electrons (i think  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> ) being bounced off of an object resulting in decay...I'm not too sure that the protons/electrons/whatever discern whose &quot;radiation&quot; it is, and who they won't effect.

The formula sorts of got away from me...but I know resistence is in it. One of the formula can be high with the other side low, which leads down do you not feeling anything unless you connect a flow. But some people have passed out from static electricly.....Or I could be wrong about it all.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

You know, I completely forgot about resistance, silly me  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />   But, I do know what you are talking about.  And with statics, you might need that other person or object to complete the circuit...Except, on a damp or humid day, touching a person or object would act as a resistor to static electricity, and you would need a lot to actually feel it jump...Which still doesn't explain why even on humid days, you can still feel it when charging, or manipulating psi...But, you do have a point with the resistance.

That be my bad, I was sort of talking about low rays of radiation such as inferred and radio waves, not exactly deadly to the human DNA strain. Also I sort of wanted to use a different word other then moprhing. But I didnt know how to spell it.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

Thank you for correcting me.

I don't agree with you, Einstein did predict a comsological constant that is puzzling our grestest minds about the laws of the universe. Of cource Einstein called that his biggest flaw...or was it? There was a scienctist who called this element in the universeal &quot;funny energy&quot; from the 5th element Aristotle called &quot;Quintnessence&quot;. Science is already trieing to look for this &quot;funny energy&quot; that is repealing gravity and making people smart as Einstein stay up at night.
<br />

<br />
Are what we doing connect to this &quot;Quitnessence&quot; is what I think from time to time.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

yah....he did predict something....and it is zero point energy....which is not psi....confirm....
<br />

<br />
so....qi is unknown to the lamest guy no on earth, einstein

Theorist's Theory on psi:
<br />

<br />
actually, i took qi for granted and did not bother to &quot;design&quot; a theory for it.....
<br />

<br />
hmm, lets see.... qi is a form of energy that can be easily modified by organisms but not objects...... so.... qi is a bionic energy...
<br />

<br />
also, qi can be modified to produce any and every different kind of reaction desired.... so... qi is a highly modal form of bionic energy
<br />

<br />
eh.... thats about it.... but i dont think that is falls under photons, gluons, x-y-z- particles, or gravition.... so it has to have a different carrier other than the proven 4.... lets call it qi
<br />

<br />
so.... qi is a highy modal form of bionic energy with &quot;qi&quot; as its energy carrier....
<br />

<br />
tada!

would someone debug it for me? appreciated</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">Back your theory up with some proof instead of ejaculating your opinions.
