			How often do you dream?
<br />
I barely have one dream per week.
<br />
Yesterday however I saw a macabre but yet funny, mysterious and vivid dream. It was like the animation &quot;Corpse bride&quot;.

			I had this dream a year ago but I can still remember very well. I was sitting on my couch when I heard screaming, I went outside and there were strange creatures like the ones I made up and they were killing loads of people. then I realized it was a dream and gave myself something to fight them with. In the end I was in my house and they just disappeared.

			I had a very realistic dream, not the best, since nothing really happened, but very realistic nonetheless. I started out in this strange beach sort of place I guess, but only part of it was beach. I remember there was a house behind me, grass then some sort of lake in front of me and a road that looked suspiciously like it came right out of GTA: SA to my right. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> And then to my left was the beach. I'm not sure what I did, but I think I went swimming in the lake and then the dream ended. Very realistic, it was the last lucid one I've had in a long while <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" /> Better start practicing I guess.

			My favorite was one of my few lucid dreams.  I flew around a bit, then teleported and ended up looking at some stretch of jungle.  I thrust out my left hand, and pulled up, and a mountain sprang from where I gestured.  I then preceded to make another one just to make sure I was doing it, then I carved out a river......then I woke up <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			I've had two generally cool dreams that I can think of off the top of my head.
<br />

<br />
In one I was fighting a vampire, and totally lost... but that's not the cool thing. The dream was in black and white... except for the vampire eyes which were ice blue, and the stain glass windows and the light comming through them. My blood was also in color. I just thought the coloring was one of the coolist things ever.
<br />

<br />
In another one I woke up and went outside, then turning around there were huge moutains and beautiful scenery, they almost seemed to be made out of glass because it was reflecting the sunrise. It was extemely vivid and beautiful, I can't even describe it. 
<br />

<br />
Neither of there were lucid... but they were still cool.

			I have had dreams were i was a tiger and i was just walkng through the jungle and the dream ends after I realize i am a tiger. I think I Astral Projected into the Tiger? becuase I think the animal knew i was there and i don't know why she won't let me stay with her, i really feel one with her. Also I also have flying dreams, but one is were I am flying endlessly with no destination in mind, just flying

			Sitting on a bench in the middle of the night with a girl I'd never met yet I knew her all my life, surrounded by strange flowers that gave off light in a park-like place. There was a paved walkway in front of the bench and we just listened to the night sounds and felt at peace, she had long hair and rested her head on my shoulder while I kept an arm around her, never saw her face but the familiarity was strong. Not sure how long we stayed like that, it was a long time, sad when I woke up but who knows, maybe when I leave this world I'll see her again.

			I can't recall any happy dreams (although I have had my share), and few of my nightmares come to mind. However, I do remember a dream that happened prior to my Sleep Paralysis. I wasn't exactly lucid, but it was one of the most vivid dreams I've had.
<br />

<br />
I was on this floating dome that could've seated maybe 50-100 people. A few of my classmates were there, as well as some random children I've never met. One of my classmates looked at me with a distressed expression on his face, and kept looking around the room. I figured we all weren't supposed to be there. All of our seats were arranged stadium-style (half-circles with descending rows, and an open area in the center). The roof had a clear-glass dome, and we were floating through a wrecked city. Vines were intertwined with all the buildings, and we were near the top of a few sky scrapers.
<br />

<br />
At one point a large crystalline structure began to float into view from behind a skyscraper. My vision started to blur, and I heard a faint ringing in my ear. Then this giant shadow figure began to follow it, and I blacked out. I woke up with SP, and the ringing/blurry vision was still present for a few moments.
<br />

<br />
Sorry for the long post, and I know this isn't &quot;my best dream.&quot; I'll never forget it, though. I thought it was some riddle that I had to solve, bothered me for weeks, haha.

My best dream involved things decorum not permit meto say here <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  I'll say it involved some girls and then I woke up to find the hottest one next to me.  That was the best.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Very Similar for me, but I dominated the earth in the process.
<br />
Ironically, this was before I learned about lucid dreaming, ever since I learned, I haven't gone lucid in any of my dreams until i'm about to die.
