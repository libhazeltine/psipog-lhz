			Ok.....really hard question for me.........I don't really look up to anyone. I always dislike some charcterists of anyone. I always like when people correct me (perhaps a little annoyed when I thought I was 100% right, but thats is only human). If I were to look up to anyone...........
<br />

<br />
..............I just don't know........I look into my heart and I can see a few intellect minds in the world but none that I truely look up to................This is a question I never bothered to think of......perhaps I never thought I needed to............. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

			I definitely look up to God. He's the shit! I mean, what bad aspects can you find with the One who made everything, and just gives and gives, without expecting anything except good conduct? (Please, don't answer that question.)

Sorry for the religious talk, but He's the only one I really look up to...

			You have to go back in time to find the man i admire. Alexander the Great  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> Student of the great aristotle and son of all mighty king philip.
<br />

<br />
I just wish he would have lived a tiny but longer to make a much greater impact. He accomplished so much at a young age and was ruthless and yet compassionate which is kinda, sorta but not realy like me. I'm a very pacive kind of guy but with some people i tend to just be plain out mean it depends on the person im with usualy i pick up on the person and react to them depending on their personality. plus he was gay  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  you know i had to point that one out lol

Id say Hitler was the most brilliant strategist and charismatic leader who ever lived
<br />

<br />
Any way, I did look up to one person once (it wasnt Hitler) and greatly respected them, but then they did something that shattered my image of them, so I dont look up to anyone anymore.
