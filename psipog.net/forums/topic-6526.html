			Even basic techniques such as Psi Manipulation have side effects. When you make a psiball there may be tingling sensations at any time. I assume that trying to erase memories takes way more psi than making a psi ball. Since the technique uses more energy, the side effects are more extreme.
<br />

<br />
So I guess....

small energy usage:tingling::LARGE ENERGY USAGE:eletricution feeling

			Except that not everybody feels tingling from manipulating psi. Some people feel pressure, some feel warmth/coldness, the list goes on. Also, I wouldn't consider it a side effect, but just the physical sensation from coming in contact with psi. Sort of like how when you touch your keyboard, feeling the texture of the keys isn't a side effect, it's just the physical sensation of coming into contact with the keys. Now, if you had touched the psi with one part of your body and felt it with another, that would be a whole different story.
<br />

<br />
Good use of logic though. (not sarcasm)

			First question: why on earth would you want to try something like that? 
<br />

<br />
But as to the coldness/electric feeling... It could be your reaction to psi, such as the feeling of energy leaving (coldness) and rapidly entering your body to replace it (electrocution sensation).
<br />

<br />
Or there's a possibility that the other person was defending themselves, consciously or unconsciously... I've been known to send people shocks and pain (before my conscious has time to interfere) when I don't them to do something.

			I can’t really comment on the memory erasing side of things, other then to say that I think it is a very reckless and absolutely stupid thing to attempt for many reasons (for example; our memories are the foundation of our personalities, if you had succeeded in altering this persons memories you could have changed the very nature of who they are).

On to the sensation you felt.  From your description I can only echo the conclusions already posted.
