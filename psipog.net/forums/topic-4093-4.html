This is only because it has a blue-ray player (higher form of dvd) and blue-ray when released ranges around $1,000...
<br />

<br />
Am I the only PS2 fan here?.... O well.... anyways I like ALL of the 
<br />
consoles, they all have strenghts and weaknesses.
<br />

<br />
---nintendo has inovative games and design but too kiddy of line-up, most hardcore game is resident evil....
<br />

<br />
---sony has RAW POWER for the PS3 but thats about it not much stand out games....other than God of War (btw its a great stress reliever ^_^)
<br />
and MGS (which i belive 4 is the last)
<br />

<br />
---microsoft again mostly RAW POWER but one more strenght they have is great online gameing, most advance in online gaming with great servers (when games use them) like sony they dont have stand out games...they are alot of TRIGGER HAPPY FPS  halo is what they got going for them
<br />

<br />
yay for opinions!

Halo was a generic game at the best of times. the only standout quality is the online play.
<br />

<br />
but i'm quite happy with getting FREE online play for DS games like MPH and MKDS. i'd rather have those than a service i have to pay for.
<br />

<br />
also: the wii will include a virtual console. imagine downloading your favourite n64, SNES, NES and master system games. (yes. sega have agreed to put some of their classic games on the wii's virtual console too.)
<br />
Not to mention the future classics like Super smash bros brawl, Trauma center: second opinion, Elebitz and Sonic wildfire.
<br />
the only  defining thing about the PS3 and the X360 is their graphics. and what are graphics if you're only playing a slightly better looking version of a game which concept was thought up years ago (world war games, for example).
<br />

<br />
i think i'll stick to my DS and get a Wii when it comes out some time between october and december this year.

			Psions are cool.
<br />
Cool people like Nintendo.
<br />
Therefore, psions like Nintendo.
<br />

<br />
That's my logic and I'm sticking to it.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I own a PS2 and like what Squeenix puts out, but will definitly be getting a Wii.  Zelda Twilight Princess FTW!!!!!!!!!!!

On the other hand, a lot of Nintendo fans are people who played the NES or SNES and liked it. Then they kept buying nintendo products and now they are preordering wiis. That means that Nintendo fans have had years of playing Nintendo's wacky games, and now our minds are open to some pretty odd stuff, like psionics. A side affect of playing Nintendo's creative and very unusual games.
<br />
    Not saying that it makes a big difference. It just has very slightly changed the way that we think about things, without us noticing the change. And yes, I'm a nintendo fan.
