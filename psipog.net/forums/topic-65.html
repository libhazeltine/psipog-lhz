			Hey guys Im back with my own method to do telekinesis.  I would like to thank NI for hey telekinesis training manual.  It helped me increase my tk skills and helped develope my own method. Thanks NI <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Telekinesis the  psiboy20 way.
<br />

<br />
     I used to think that telekinesis was just a trick until I had succesfully
<br />
done tk on the psiwheel for the first time.  After many attempts using NI's training manual,   I began to experiment with other ways to possibly move any object.  I always use the psiwheel!  Before starting tk obviously, you and I can't have any doubts or the psiwheel isn't moving! 
<br />
First, you must clear your mind and meditate.  Meditation should take about 20 to 30 minutes.  Anymore than this will probably mean you have fallen asleep.   Back to the matter at hand.  After meditation has been done, i take the psiwheel out, lay on the table and get as comfortable as possible and I begin.  I start by surrounding the psiwheel with my psi energy and linking that energy to me but mostly to my head.  I try to thicken the energy around the psiwheel.  Soon i start to feel the psiwheel.  Just like the authors said,&quot; its better to use as many sences as possible&quot; which is true.  I start to get a connection with the object and then i start to lift the energy around the psiwheel upwards!  At the same time I believe that the psiwheel will move.  I begin to whisper in my head &quot;move, go, faster,ect.&quot; remember, I also move the psi upwards but then down again then upwards and so on.  You could say that I am trying to move the psiwheel two completly different ways.  But it works.  Two engines are better than one.
<br />
After a while the psiwheel should start to move. don't worry one which direction to move towards.  I don't and their is no need in my opinion.  Your subconsious should take care of that part.  Important:  don't think too hard just relax and think smoothly or your psiwheel won't go anywhere!
<br />

<br />
If your psi movement is better than your subconsious,  the psiwheel just might fly upward of the point!  It has happened to me and it just might to you!  If your subconsious is stronger than the psi movement, than the psiwheel should be spiining faster.  I have experienced both ways!  Ok guys im done for today.  hope you all try tk in the future or just try my method.  Thanks NI.  Everyone I suggest you all read the other articles on tk too.   Achieving tk won't happen over night.  So practice. Practice makes perfect.  
<br />

<br />
Tired know! Until next time <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			After seeing a few videos, I have convinced my concious mind, and my subconcious mind that its possible. Ive also concinced my concious mind that I can do TK, but my subconcious mind keeps saying: &quot;Well, maybe they can do it, but that doesnt mean you can.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Darn subconcious....... Oh well, im gonna keep trying at least once a day for 30 minutes, and hopefully get it spinning, or to at least move, I always keep it under a clear plastic thing, because I would probably end up accidently breathing on it and making it spin by accident and get all excited just to find out that it was just my breath...
