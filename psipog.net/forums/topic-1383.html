			I call this technique the &quot;pushing&quot; method.
<br />

<br />
First, understand how to create feelings in you head, enough to do this technique anyways, if you can't this will not be effective.
<br />

<br />
now grab any object, place it on a nice platform, nothing that would give false results.
<br />

<br />
Recreate the pressure in your head when you push a heavy object, if you don't know what the pressure feels like, push agianst a wall or try to push something extremely heavy and pay attention to your mind and head then what you are pushing, now when you have successfully created this feeling, direct it tords the object and make it feel like you are tugging on the direction to want it to go, treat it like Tug-o-War if you need to, whatever gets the job done.After awhile, it might cause the object to slide, if not, keep trying.
<br />

<br />
I know it's extremly simple, but as the MythBusters TV show say &quot;Complexity usually fails&quot; well, I don't know if that is the direct quote, but it gets the idea through.
<br />

<br />
This can ,also, be used for rolling objects, but I never seen any great results when it comes to rolling.

			That is a nice technique.  That is close to my technique for sliding.

			Interesting.  I thought of that technique while I was practicing with the psi wheel once.  I recreated the thought of pushing it in my head while visualizing it moving.  Don't think it worked though, but it was weird to recreate that feeling.  Perhaps I should practice it.

hi this is my first post but I had to register when I saw this.
<br />

<br />
I am very new to the techniques on this site, as I only discovered it today
<br />

<br />
but when I was younger, I used to have alot of lucid like dreams and I manipulated them in exactly the same way as mentioned, I always thought it odd that it was very diffrent from how other people described lucid dreams, but this may go some way towards explaining it, but can psi be used while asleep?

No, but if I over do it, like 2 hours or so, I tend to, but I don't use this method as much now, so I don't worry about how long I do it anymore.
