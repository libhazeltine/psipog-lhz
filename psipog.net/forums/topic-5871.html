			Colour Shifting:
<br />

<br />
very similar to shadowing, alows you to change the colour of you or any other object around you. Colour is just a fragment of pure white light. If there is no light in a room at all, colour can't exist. colour shifting requires this white light to function. Also because of the fact that the objects matterials and dencity effect it's colour, we can change it in one of two ways.
<br />

<br />
Number one: you can create a psiball construct to cover the object, and change the colour of the construct.
<br />

<br />
Number two: you can change the very outer serface of the object, by munipulating its dencity and material.
<br />

<br />
remember this is just a theory, i do not know if this will work myself. but i heard people have done simaler things myself.

			still, it is posible. for those who wish to tap into that skill.

if you can think it, you can do it. if you have the right amount of practice. ( a month - an eternety )  &gt;_&lt;

			We lack the understanding of the atomic structure required to alter it in that manner, even with psionics. Even then, it would be easier to simply make a construct that is the color you want it to be... Changing the object itself would be like trying to knock out an entire wall instead of using the open door. There are easier, faster, and more efficient ways of doing such things... You just have to find them. In this case, you already know the most efficient way, and the other method is, in my opinion, next to impossible. So just use some constructs <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Hehe I agree with you Tankdown. It's like seeking logical justification that it is true. Which is in in some way senseless because it makes no difference if you think it is true or not.

I read about a theory that said we subconsiously shape reality. So in this day and age, people think that pk is fictional, so we can only move the psiwheel and sometimes roll pencils. If everyone believed, it would be easier. Just a theory.

actualy come to think of it, human kind knows quite a bit about atomic stucture. what makes an element is just the amount of protons and newtrons in the element, electrons just give off the charge.
<br />

<br />
for example if you wanted to turn simple lead into gold; you would have to remove three newtrons and protons from the lead, changing the atomic number to 79 ( 79 is gold ). The three protons and newtrons you removed can be easily turned into lithium. if this is done with more than one atom, you can easily make a more stable carbon, or flourine atom.
<br />
the electrons you disrupt will try to stablize themselves the best thay can.
<br />

<br />
i know what im suggesting is like alchemy, but it would still be cool if you could do that.
<br />

<br />
so yes colour change is posible with that method, but the psiball method as way way easier.

			pulsar there was so much in that paragraph that dispurt me I amost passed out!
<br />

<br />
Quatumn thoery is called a thoery for a reason...true we know a lot a about it, true we have done so much. Infact I was once told that humanity learn so much over the last 100 years then our last 10,000 years. But a theory still has loop hopes in it. Sure it may just be protons and neutrons..unless you like to go smaller into quarks (not to be confused with sand on a beach or deserts) combind with harbons. Hesihenbreg Uncertainly princple don't exactly support much about us knowing the atom either...
<br />

<br />
Of cource things get more complex if you think about the details of your &quot;little&quot; example of yours that amost killed me. First of all that process may not be SO easy to do...lead has good resistence to corrision. So its not exactly easy to break down like you said. If it is possible.......it sure not worth the price in gold. The atom is far more complex then they told in elementaly school. For example I hear about books that use &quot;the electron circle the atom like planets circle the sun&quot; WHICH IS TOTALY NOT TRUE. Infact the electron jumps about when it gives off a photon or gains a photon. If the earth was a electron we would jump next to jupiter and back without even knowing.
<br />

<br />
I enjoyed your effort really much and perhaps I did over say my opinion at the begining of my post. Wonderful ideas but there are just some things we may never be able to know.....
<br />

<br />
However we can't exactly say we wont be able to know it, if we already don't know it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

no i feel you put that very well. We do have some thoerys on the atomic model, but i dont want to risk spliting an atom and blowing up the city for a simple glob of gold or platnum. i would more like to study it for the knowledge rather then the riches. well unless you think that knowledge is riches like i do
<br />

<br />
again well put, i highly respect your opinion.
