			Alrighty, so I've been trying to meditate and I can pretty much clear my head of unwanted thoughts...BUT.
<br />

<br />
I've been listening to music a lot for a long time and I have trouble blocking it out of my head, does anybody know of any way at all to block it out effectively?

			I heard this complaint multiple times. But in my experience, if you really focus, after you have cleared your head of thoughts, if you really emerge yourself into focus, then no songs in your head can bother you. It might still be there, but it doesnt exist to you, because you are emerged into focus or something that you focus on, so you are not able to be aware of that music. Then the actual sound will go away too, because you stop giving it energy (attention). So after you are done focussing/meditating, the sound is gone also when you try to hear it. (be carefull not to create it again though).
<br />

<br />
Its much like NI's analogy in one of his articles about telekinesis, about the explosion near your window when you are meditating. If it disturbs you, or in other words, if you become aware of it, if you notice it, then the energy provided by that blast, was of a higher quantity that the energy you put into your focus or meditation.
<br />

<br />
So if you are in real meditation and you are well-focussed, then at first there will be no song that gets to your awareness anymore, and eventually there will be no song anymore at all, because you are taking away it's energy source (your attention. Wether it is conscious or subconscious) So if you want to get rid of it, try emerging your focus in just one thing for like ten minutes. In my experience, if I do this, the song stops recieving energy from the conscious and subconscious mind, and it will cease to exist.

			Sometimes before I really get into nitty gritty meditating, I'll often get a song in my head, and what I usually have to end up doing is letting it play out in its entirety before my mind will let it go.  The more I try to force it out, the more it sticks, and the angrier I get with myself which of course doesn't help when trying to relax.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I try to spend a good 10 mins or so beforehand just regurgitating whatever is on my mind so that I my attention won't be constantly drawn to it.

			I feel your pain man, I have literally every Nirvana song damn near memorized including the Korn (Sucks) Metalica and Weird Al spoofs. Its hard to block it out or just stop &quot;listening to music&quot; after awhile of meditating though it subsides like music in a store while shopping you know?

			You're right. I'll try and focus on one thing for a while, then let it slowly fade into nothing.
<br />

<br />
It'll calm me down and hopefully empty my mind completely...just like shopping for CDs, Chiro.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			It helps a lot to actually do the opposite. Think of that particular song, and &quot;play&quot; it in your mind. All the way. From the beginning to the end. But don't repeat parts, if you have it well memorized, you should be able to just follow the flow of the song and play it to the end. After it ends, i usually get a nice empty silence.
