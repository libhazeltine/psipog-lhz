			I made a psi ball with wings who I called Bob that flew arownd me in circles. I wound up getting rid of bob for some reason. I would like to make a cat that follows me around, sits on my lap when I sit down, lays next to me when I sleep, plays with psi balls I throw to him, and destroys stray constructs I tell him to.

			I made what I call a &quot;Psi Guy.&quot; Lol, a Psi Pet &quot;shaped&quot; and programmed like a person. I named him Adam, and he's programmed to act like a familiar like a witch has in the old fairy tales. He started off with a simple mentality and was programmed to get smarter after observing people. Right now he acts like a little brother, and has the intelligence of a second grader. His main functions are telling me I'm dreaming for instant lucidity, pinging me when something important comes up, acting as a note taker at school, and being a friend. ^_^

			I tried making a psi pet called Vica. it was just a psiball with wings (unorigional, sry :/). It was supposed to feed on negative energy, but i think it just plain tried to eat at me. i re-absorbed her energy instead of killing her to make myself feel less sad about it <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />

			Heh, yeah, you made a mistake about the negative energy. For you see, you  yourself have both positive and negative energy and since you created the beast, it thinks you must be the ulitmate source of energy. Therefore he tried to suck away your negative energy.
<br />

<br />
But you can't do that, since neg. energy isn't all bad. It's required for balance issues, you can't be all goody-two-shoes you know.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Anyways, i've been messing around with little PsiCameras. I made one to follow around a person i happen to care a lot about. So i could see her at any time, know her location and communicate with her telepathycally.
<br />

<br />
It's great excersize for remote veiwing, energy controlling and telepathy. Although it's a violation of her privacy, but she doesn't have to know about it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			You just program a construct to do something. If you can make a semi-decent psiball, then that is what you should start with. Make a psiball and tell it to obey you and then tell it to for example orbit your head and don't forget to give it a destruction word, when you don't want it around anymore. I usually programmed my beasts to dissipate into air when i verbally say their name 3 times.
<br />

<br />
Don't go nuts on the programming, if you give it too much or too complex commands, it won't understand them and you'll end up with a retarded pet like i once did.
<br />

<br />
I even had to tell her to use her wings to get around. Honest mistake, yes, but when i talked to it, it kept yelling nonsense like: 'red pants on the hose!'
<br />

<br />
So figure out your programming BEFORE you start making the pet, so you know exactly what you want and can make it understand you perfectly.

			I didn't remember at first, but I have made sort of a psi-pet. It was a few months ago.
<br />

<br />
  I made a Psi-Pikachu (hmm... I could have called it Psikachu .. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ) <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .I just LOVE it(the 'real' Pikachu I mean... not the psi- one). I got it to follow me around for a few days. The problem, is that I forgot about it. Now I think its gone... <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> . Maybe I should make another one...
