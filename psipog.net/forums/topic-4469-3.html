Think of the mind as a normal PC with windows OS.

Anyways, the complicated equation is just total crap which explains nothing and the other equation you don't need an equation for. It's just saying what conditions TK exists at.

We already did, because if he's dumb enough to try quantifying qualitative aspects of a situation and making a ridiculous formula using those arbitrary values (plus people have said that they have little iron intake and yet can do PK), how can any of his work be taken seriously?

			The guy totally neglects to mention vitamin C. During a quick search for foods that contain a lot of iron, I learned that vitamin C increases the absorption of iron. 
<br />

<br />
I'm definitely going to try eating stuff that has iron in it next time I try PK. I've been a vegetarian for a few years and don't do a very good job substituting for meat, and it certainly would be interesting if that were the reason I suck at PK. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
(Also, if there's anyone out there stupid enough to try taking a bunch of iron supplements to do PK: Iron is one of those things that is toxic if you eat too much of it.)

How he explains it, is either you have it or you dont.  And say you can move a book...thats nice...but, your NEVER going to move past it.  bull...
<br />

<br />
And he uses Jean Grey pictures to show telekinetic ability, He doesn't have one video and doesn't even have a decent picture or him doing anything involving PK.
<br />

<br />
I wouldn't trust him

2 days taking vitamins(with iron, i've been a vegitarian for 2 years)...nothings different...only  2 days in though

			So basically the man is saying: &quot;You need iron for pk&quot;. I don't know what to say but I never thought pk was diet related. I think he said that we need iron because of &quot;magnetism&quot;. I think you get iron from red meat, if this is true then it discounts all the vegetarians that do pk.
<br />

<br />
Edit: Alright I have an argument, I believe one person posted on this site an experiment in which a blind person did pk. This man says in his theory that you need &quot;visual contact&quot; to perform pk. BUT we already have evidence of a blind person performing pk. I think it's just because that guy has trouble concentrating when he can't see it. Maybe I'll go and try moving things behind my back or in a different room. It has been done.

Well, this theory can be easily checked. Just eat tons of strawberries, let the iron set for a day and try PK. See (and record) if you are any better at PK then usual. The just try to consume as much of vitamin E as possible and try PK again.
<br />

<br />
But yeah, the article is a bit inconclusive, it doesn't describe the mechanics or what ACTUALLY moves the object. What is our brain generating or doing to make stuff move?
<br />

<br />
Those questions are still unanswered, but it's nice to know what my PK ability depends on. Nuts, bolts and strawberries.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

Pepsiboy, that sounds very interesting, and do you have any idea where we could listen to the 7.81 Hz frequency?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

That frequency is to low to be heard by a human ear. You need special equipment for that.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">[/quote]
<br />

<br />
To listen to the that low of a frequency you would have to have lets say 100hz in the right headphone, and 107.81hz in the left headphone. After a bit you should hear a low woooh.....woooh....woooh every 7.81 hz. And after a while, your brain will cancel out the 100hz as background noise and all you'll hear is the emulated 7.81hz

			I don't think you must look at this formula in a mathematical way
<br />

<br />
f(x) = x
<br />

<br />
But more like, what do you need to accomplish PK, this that this etc...

But I don't believe in this formula either.
