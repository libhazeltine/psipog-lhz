Once i made a psi ball in my dominant hand, and after i felt the tingly sensation, I waved my hand over my psi ball. It felt a lot warmer. I knew it was there.

Well, not in this lifetime. You couldn't make that in one go, no way. It would take more energy than the human body posses. If you were to, it would use up all your energy, leaving you with just enough energy to actually test it out. If you could do that, it would have to be as solid as a brick wall. You would actually have to make it so strong that you can't even punch through it! Not an easy task people... <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Actually, humans never use all of their energy, nor brain power. If you could tap into that, it would be very well possible. But i'm thirteen. what do i know?

Lol, sometimes that's how I feel about all this, but it must be real if all these people beleive it is.  Or they're just bored middle schoolers with nothing to do.

			How about a &quot;pad&quot; of Psi on the gound programmed to shove away its own signature or just your body? That seems alot easier than standing on something. Idk spitballing ideas here...

			Alright...

Let's think about this for a minute.  The vast majority of people here are barely able to spin the psiwheel.  I realize it's fun to sit around and think about how &quot;cool&quot; it would be to &quot;fly&quot;, but we try to be a little more realistic.  If you can't move a pencil with PK, then you certainly aren't going to be able to levitate.  In fact, if you can't move an 80 pound bag of dogfood, then chances are you still aren't going to be able to levitate.
<br />

<br />
SO... instead of wasting time dreaming about how cool it would be to &quot;fly&quot;, maybe it would be better to spend that time on practicing realistic PK... like trying to spin the psiwheel, then moving on to pens or pencils after that.  After you get something heavier than 10 pounds to levitate, THEN I think it would be ok for you to theorize about levitating a human body.  UNTIL THEN... let's try to be more realistic.
<br />

<br />
Aside from that, you really need to work on your grammar and spelling.
