			Hehe, interesting outcome I suppose. 
<br />

<br />
You guys never cease to amaze me. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;I can’t explain the utter hatred I have towards individuals complaining about another without them knowing that you’re doing so.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
This is quite interesting to me, I would of never imagined JoeT can hate. 
<br />

<br />
Roy: Aha! I thought you were still here. I sensed you many days ago..
<br />

<br />
&quot;No offense.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Hmm? Has the phrase &quot;No offense&quot; lost it's meaning? GreenMango did say no offense. And yet, I have seen extreme offense. Infact, I have never seen so much offense in one place before. Heh, I guess &quot;No offense&quot; lost it's meaning years ago. 
<br />

<br />
Although, I would like to apologize. I let my emotions get the best of me I suppose. I am sorry if I offended you Roy, or JoeT, or Daniel. You are all wonderful people that has done much towards this community and many other communities infact. You guys are great. 
<br />
Please accept my sincere apology.  
<br />

<br />
In our last days of Psipog existence, we should not be condemning others, we should be praising them.

			The phrase &quot;no offense&quot; has no real meaning anymore, and it probably never will again. When someone says &quot;no offense&quot; what they're really saying is &quot;What I'm about to say will likely piss you off, but I'd like you to just take it as constructive criticism.&quot; Proper applications for the phrase might be &quot;No offense meant here, but I think you might be bringing that fire a little too close to that gas tank,&quot; or maybe even &quot;No offense, but I think the food might taste better if you cook it before serving it.&quot; Improper usage would be something like &quot;No offense, but I hate everything you stand for,&quot; or &quot;No offense, but you're an asshole.&quot; These days, people tend to use it before something that a person rightfully should take offense to (like, oh, this topic for instance) because they don't want the person/people to get mad at them for being an ass.
<br />

<br />
Also, the last thing the world needs is for people to 'lighten up.' Like the Team America quote I won't be saying here indicates, we need people to be harsh sometimes. If we all 'lightened up' some more and didn't take anything seriously, the world would be in a much worse state than it is now. &quot;Hey! That guy is shooting nukes at us!&quot; &quot;Lighten up, we'll be fi...&quot; *sound of nuclear explosion*
<br />

<br />
Oh, and I've never had any problems with them being harsh to me. Perhaps take their advice, and apply it. You might get somewhere.
<br />

<br />
I feel no need to elaborate further on this, as JoeT and Roy have covered the topic very nicely.

Arguing with you has quickly become a hobby of mine as well as my friends <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. It looks as if we'll have to debate once again. Let the fun begin.
<br />

<br />
If you would have read my statement CORRECTLY, you would have noticed the point I was making. My point was not to stop criticizing other members or communities overall. Just make your issues with them known so they can be brought to their attention and eventually worked out. I have no problem walking up to another and telling them how I feel about them. You of all people should know that. 
<br />

<br />
My issues with you have not ended. I don't like you, I don't like your website. I think that you’re an ignorant child gasping for public attention. Which, I refuse to give you. So, I banned you from several websites of mine including chat rooms. I quickly came to the conclusion that you’re not looking for diplomacy, you’re looking for attention. Which is why, I stray away from you as well as tell my members to. You’re not looking to benefit the members of the psionic community, you’re looking to benefit your reputation. Which, is currently not working out so well, aye? 
<br />

<br />
If you weren’t so oblivious, you would have realized that my problems with PsiStudies have taken a yield. Why? Mainly because the administrator  of that community and I had a civilized discussion based on our feelings towards the problem. You see, I made my issues with them publicly and brought my issues to their front door. I did not talk behind their backs or make my issues with them secretive. Which, is once again my initial point. I think you should read what people have written before you attempt to criticize them. You're making yourself look like an ignorant fool, Apollo.
<br />

<br />
You’re not wanted in this discussion. Although I can’t stop you from participating in this discussion (You certainly have the right to), myself as well as over thirty people have agreed that you’re intentions are not beneficial to anything focused in this discussion. You’re trying to pick a fight. A fight in which you will not win. Please, discontinue your actions and subside your arrogance. For it is not needed nor wanted.
<br />

<br />
Good day,
<br />

<br />
- JoeT

			Let me please point out that you do not like my site mainly because it is hosted on freewebs.  Hmmm, maybe that doesn't affect the website AT ALL.  What truely matters is its content.  Frankly, I don't give a shit whether you like me (or my site) or not.  I get 500 page views per day and I am just dandy with that.  I am sorry that you poison many other websites and, frankly, I think your presence in the psipog forums have destroyed the psipog &quot;nature&quot;.  Newbies come here to learn about psi and psionics.  They come in here and ask a normal, newbish question.  What do you say?  You say they are stupid, ignorant fools who have no life and they should bow down to you because you are being a police officer.  That makes since.  You should come work in Chicago!  You would fit in with the corrupt police department.  I don't really give a shit what your &quot;thirty&quot; (clone) people you are talking with say.  I will respond here whether you like it or not.
<br />

<br />
Also, I believe it is childish to ban someone from a site that an arguement doesn't even take place in.  Isn't that called abuse of power?  As you would call someone, you are an &quot;ignorant child&quot;.
<br />

<br />
I do not wish for a bigger &quot;reputation&quot; seeing as I get about 300 emails per day from people asking me to help them with psionics.  Frankly, I would actually wish for that number to go down.  Of course, I feed my reputation by asking to help mod on a variety of different forums, chats, and websites.  Including owning my own blog, website, 3 yahoo groups, and a couple chatrooms.  But wait, that is all my huge plan to make everyone bow down to me as the almighty being....Oh wait....that sounds like someone I know.......who could that be.....?
<br />

<br />
For godsakes, if you respond, don't quote individual sentences of mine like you do in the other forums.  It just clogs them up and it is hard and annoying to read.
<br />

<br />
My &quot;thirty&quot; people agree.
<br />

<br />
Have a good night.

Firstly, I'd like to make one point perfectly clear:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">I am sorry that you poison many other websites and, frankly, I think your presence in the psipog forums have destroyed the psipog &quot;nature&quot;.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
You haven't been around PsiPog long enough to make that statement nor stand behind it. You've been around for perhaps a year, that's it. Please, don't undermine that statement because the moderators of this website as well as other intelligent individuals who have been around PsiPog long enough can certainly agree with me that you have an entirely wrong perspective about PsiPog than the rest of us who have been around PsiPog for several years.
<br />

<br />
I have been around the Psionic community for over seven years. I was here since the birth of PsiPog. I can certainly tell you right now that you weren't. The &quot;nature&quot; in which you're claiming I'm poising is the nature that you've been exposed of! You have no idea how PsiPog used to be back years ago. So don't claim you have any perception of what the true nature of PsiPog is. You don't have a damn clue!
<br />

<br />
To move on, you’re once again incorrect. You really need to stop assuming, Apollo. The reason I have for not enjoying your website is not because it’s an freewebs owned and operated community. Although, I can say it doesn’t help. My initial reason is simple: You like to advertise your community everywhere, invite and annoy members by private messaging them (Either in another’s chat room or on their forums) to join your community. Also, the criteria on that website is ridiculous. The poor grammar you and your authors have shown diminishes the intelligence of that article, post or any written material that website shares publicly. It’s one thing to claim that you’re intelligent but it’s another to claim you’re intelligent then show low standard informational reading sources in which are suppose to be benefiting your members. No one likes to learn from someone who shows low graded material. It makes that student feel as if he’s learning from a child. But then again, you are a child. 
<br />

<br />
Another thing, I’m quite sick and tired of my occupation being criticized. Being a police officer is an honorable occupation in which I’m glad to work in. When you sit there and tell me that all of Chicago’s police force is corrupted tells me two things: You’re obviously going through your rebellious teenage phase where everyone’s secretly out to get you and that you have a seriously corrupted view on what police work actually does. Please, let’s show a little more integrity in your statements. You’re embarrassing yourself.

I’m somewhat interested in how you could sit there and preach about my actions when you’re doing the same. I banned you from UPC for several reasons. Those that took place in UPC. However, you retaliated by banning me from your ridiculous community. Please, don’t be a hypocrite. Before you preach about anything, please have an understanding of that statement. You’re being quite hypocritical. Although I can careless about the banning itself, I find it humorous that I was indeed banned when I rarely stepped foot into your community. Like I said, I’d rather not see nor hear from you at all. I avoid you. I don’t like you. I’m being very serious when making that statement. Please understand that.
<br />

<br />
I find your corrupted perspective about me humorous. You claim that I wish for people to believe that I’m almighty. When in actuality, that occurs whether I have any input or not. The reason why people look up to me is simple. I’ve helped people in almost ever field of psionics and have been doing so for several years now. I’m productive. I help scientific studies in universities. I show apparent skill. Very few have and that’s quite understandable. The psionic community as of now is full of role players that when members actually find someone who has the capability to produce results, they wish to learn from that individual. It’s understandable. Please, you’re acting as if you’re jealous. Like I said, I don’t like you. I don’t like speaking to you. I never enter your chat room nor your website because I avoid you. You tend to lurk for me. People have seen and pointed that out. The funny thing is, I’ve placed you in your respectable place several times now and you persist to fight back. You need to stop. You’re wasting my time. 
<br />

<br />
This concludes this worthless thread. Once again, I’m clearly stating that I do not like you. I don’t think members should follow you nor continue you visit your ridiculous website for it’s a dead end learning wise. Please, do not try to continue this argument with me. I don’t wish to. I’m just going to ignore you. Please take my general advice when I say that you need to take a good look at yourself and where you’re headed. You’re disrespecting people that have been around for years. Although it’s quite understandable, you wish to make your mark in the book, per say. However, please, discontinue your disrespectful path. It won’t get you anywhere. 
<br />

<br />
Once again, I severely wish that members take my advice that PsiLinks is not a legitimate learning environment. I hope that members choose the learning path instead of the political path. You will not benefit yourself by learning from a community that is based on role playing.
