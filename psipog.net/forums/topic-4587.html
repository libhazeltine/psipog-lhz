			Through personal experiences I've discovered that people are &quot;stupid&quot; because they don't understand something. I also have discovered that it is very hard to explain my ideas about the commonplace (don't ask) to people because of how none concrete it is. Things usually get convoluted, confusing, and come out the wrong way. This also happens when I try to explain some purely mathematical physics like 4D things/ Einstein type stuff. I have this idea that schooling could be telepathic and empathic and work much better. Someone could come along who's like a great professor/psion a program a self feeding construct with a whole year's lesson plan in it. Then students could be taught psi at an early age and use these constructs that would just broadcast lessons to the students and I think everybody would understand it better. In elementary, middle, and high school I think this isn't really needed but in some college courses that deal with the highest level of things humans know I think this would really help spread knowledge. This would also work for like political speeches. Instead of televised speeches they would just do a country wide broadcast. It would really help people understand the ideas being talked about now. What do you guys think about this?

			Have you read 'The Midwich Cuckoos' (filmed as 'village of the damned')?  In it, they discover that the Cuckoo children have a collective consciousness, although the boys and girls can't communicate to the opposite gender.  So when they decided to school them (in the village) they needed just one child to be taught something and then all the others would learn it automatically.  It worked brilliantly.  My only concern about doing this in practise is that children love telling their other people about what they have just learnt which might be undermined by the technique you suggest.  On the other hand there have been times where I wished I could have sent the concept by telepathy...  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

I meant using telepathy to express ideas that are non concrete. Ideas that use feeling more than thought. I read a book once where some mutant humans set this thing up over a hundred years to destroy the non mutants because they had precog. Make a long story short, some people went to Jupiter, found it was pure bliss, came back, couldn't describe it to people so nobody would ever go there, the mutants gave humans the ability to say what the really meant and everybody would understand them perfectly. Thus all humans went to Jupiter. The point is the thing the man who went to Jupiter had he couldn't describe because it was like nothing he had ever experienced. I am saying that this would be a good idea in the spread of ideas because most good things don't catch on because of non-concreteness and misunderstanding. Imagine if buddhist nirvana existed for a second (not sayin it dosen't). If a buddhist monk who had reached nirvana could broadcast this feeling and thought to the rest of the world and they accepted it, wouldn't the world be a better place with everybody striving towards a perfect mindset? So maybe I don't really want like psionic schooling. I just want the world to accept telepathy and empathy so that the idea transfer can become more streamlined.

			I can see the use of this. (I might somehow understand your wierdass theories) To me it's almost like a more pasive version of TPS because people oppose things because they don't quite see it the way the other party does. This would make it harder to have our own personalities because we understand everyone else perfectly...

			Are you implying that this could be used so there would be less misunderstandings between communications?  I like the idea, though  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .

i could relate this to crack cocaine if i wanted to. if i belive its a speechless experience and brainsignal everyone else cause i cant describe it in words so they all go try crack cocaine? wtf?

you're right, half the wolrd is too dumb/ignorant/careless for these non-concrete ideas in the first place. most peoples brains are already 'made up' on majority of subjects. like life on Mars some its a 'yes' to others its a 'no way in hell you crazy spaceufomofo'

that would be just a shortcut, a cheatcode if you play games, this would cause even more havoc cause all of the sudden the world will feel peace (if it works)  and more than likely overreact to this feeling of tranquility. everyone needs to discover inner peace for themselves.
<br />

<br />
it would be great to grasp a complicated science subject by staring at the proffessor/dr. while they make a construct to teach us... but majority of people that are interested in these complicated subjects that are so non-concrete already have a fundamental understanding which allows them to learn it via their own brain

			From personal experience I have found some things cannot be explained with our current means of communication. These are the highest level &quot;ideas&quot; anyone could ever imagine and go beyond science and math. At some point language is going to become obsolete because of humans evolving into these new ways of thinking. Even when I am trying to explain these new meta-thoughts now it's hard. I think that at some point we really will have to communicate telepathically and empathically because our minds will grow out of language. We have limited time though because some humans in power have the intent to blow everything up. So what do you guys think, will the human race evolve into these meta-thoughts fast enough (if the exist) or we will blow ourselves up?

They wouldn't have to go try cocaine if they had that feeling that was shared to them. They could just recall it whenever they wanted to experience it. That would solve drug problems, as they wouldn't be needed to create &quot;euphoria&quot; or getting &quot;high&quot; and such. And since it's invoked by the mind, you would be able to come out of it at will when you needed too.

If you have inner peace, then one wouldn't overreact because; A). They're at peace with themselves, and B). If they were shared the inner peace, they wouldn't overreact because they'd be at an understanding and peace with themselves, seeing that overreaction is irrational and an unnecessary reaction to being given such a state of being. They would have the wisdom to see that there's no point in overreacting and causing havoc. Inner peace isn't just a feeling, like cocaine does. There are feelings caused by inner peace, but it's not specifically about the feelings; it's about the wisdom and the balance.

I see what you mean. I think even those without a fundemental understanding should still be given the opportunity for such information. It should be by choice, but entirely available, like a library. Someone who has never read anything about science, let alone having a fundemental understanding, might want to go to a library to start and learn. Just my two cents.
<br />

<br />
Also does this topic remind anyone about &quot;The Giver&quot;? That's the first thing I thought of when I read the first post...
