			Awww damnit. It turns out that there is a school related activity which I must attend that day. I guess I won't be able to participate. I have noticed a lot of people are going to be idle-ing for the logs, so I was wondering if peebrain was going to post the log of this online?

I'm inviting a few friends who aren't members of Psipog, but are interested in psi... the more the merrier! Maybe if we have a lot of people and good, distracting conversation, we'll get better results.

But I cannot stay.

I'm just going to say that I loved this place.

I loved the community, and everything about it.

I'm so sad to see it go, but I guess I have to.

I'm glad that there'll still be archives, but I'm sad cuz I won't get yelled at by Neveza anymore, or be able to talk to any of you fellow dorks. ;D

<br />
[21:01] &lt;peebrain&gt; ALRIGHTY!
<br />
[21:01] &lt;peebrain&gt; thanks everyone for showing up
<br />
[21:01] * BlackShadow (slick1288@dm-7946.hsd1.ma.comcast.net) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:01] &lt;peebrain&gt; hi BlackShadow, just in time
<br />
[21:01] &lt;peebrain&gt; this is the game plan:
<br />
[21:02] * Mattz (matthewheb@dm-26723.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:02] &lt;ErikJDurwoodII&gt; it's always time for BS
<br />
[21:02] &lt;MadHatter&gt; haha
<br />
[21:02] &lt;peebrain&gt; 1. PK Party, this will probably last maybe an hour
<br />
[21:02] * Vulcanis is now known as Vulc|Desktop
<br />
[21:02] &lt;peebrain&gt; 2. I will talk about my new site and the ideas that I'm working with
<br />
[21:02] &lt;peebrain&gt; 3. Erik will talk about some science stuff that has to do with psionics
<br />
[21:02] &lt;peebrain&gt; 4. Everyone can hang out and spam after that
<br />
[21:03] &lt;peebrain&gt; then eventually, 5. I close the chat
<br />
[21:03] * Vulc|Desktop is now known as Vulcanis
<br />
[21:03] &lt;peebrain&gt; so, let's get started with #1... the PK Party
<br />
[21:03] &lt;peebrain&gt; <a href="http://www.fork-you.com/how05.html" target="_blank">http://www.fork-you.com/how05.html</a>
<br />
[21:03] * Vulcanis is now known as Vulc|Desktop
<br />
[21:03] &lt;peebrain&gt; <a href="http://www.fork-you.com/how06.html" target="_blank">http://www.fork-you.com/how06.html</a>
<br />
[21:03] &lt;peebrain&gt; if you've never bent silverware, then use those two pages to help you learn how
<br />
[21:03] &lt;peebrain&gt; if you've bent silverware, then do whatever works for you
<br />
[21:04] * Eldibs is now known as Eldibs_saving_logs
<br />
[21:04] &lt;peebrain&gt; I'll outline the basic method here
<br />
[21:04] * FluxPK (flux_pk@dm-25274.dyn.optonline.net) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:04] &lt;peebrain&gt; basically, you hold your piece of silverware
<br />
[21:04] &lt;peebrain&gt; (do not use knives)
<br />
[21:04] &lt;peebrain&gt; hold it loosely between your thumb and pointer finger
<br />
[21:04] &lt;peebrain&gt; then you slow yourself down, and get into a relaxed state
<br />
[21:04] &lt;peebrain&gt; get real relaxed
<br />
[21:05] &lt;peebrain&gt; fork-you.com's method is to visualize a golden ball of energy
<br />
[21:05] * NinjaKitsune (demondogmc@dm-11683.eastlink.ca) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:05] &lt;peebrain&gt; wherever this ball goes, it makes you feel relaxed, and warm
<br />
[21:05] * Psillama (confucious@63.201.152.6538) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:05] * BlueSprite (kvirc@208.191.158.18656) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:05] &lt;peebrain&gt; and all mushey inside
<br />
[21:05] &lt;peebrain&gt; this golden ball of energy never runs out, and you can draw as much power from it as you want
<br />
[21:05] * Vamp (wootez@dm-16091.5-203-24.mc.videotron.ca) has joined #psipog
<br />

<br />
[21:05] &lt;peebrain&gt; 97 people...
<br />
[21:05] &lt;peebrain&gt; welcome
<br />
[21:06] &lt;peebrain&gt; we were just going over fork-you.com's fork bending method
<br />

<br />
[21:06] &lt;MadHatter&gt; maybe if you set it as the topic
<br />
[21:06] &lt;peebrain&gt; we haven't STARTED yet... but we are just reviewing it
<br />
[21:06] &lt;peebrain&gt; good idea
<br />
[21:06] * Retrieving #psipog modes...
<br />
[21:06] * peebrain changes topic to 'PK Party: Read these: <a href="http://www.fork-you.com/how05.html" target="_blank">http://www.fork-you.com/how05.html</a>   <a href="http://www.fork-you.com/how06.html" target="_blank">http://www.fork-you.com/how06.html</a>'
<br />
[21:06] * peebrain sets mode: -b *!*@203.81.148.20234
<br />
[21:06] * DamianM (mr_damian_@dm-20707.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has left #psipog
<br />
[21:07] * DamianM (mr_damian_@dm-20707.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:07] &lt;peebrain&gt; ok, after we visualize that golden ball, we visualize it moving to our finger
<br />
[21:07] &lt;peebrain&gt; (where our silverware is)
<br />
[21:07] * Elija (darkmyst@dm-28371.proxy.aol.com) has left #psipog
<br />
[21:07] * Elija (darkmyst@dm-403.proxy.aol.com) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:07] &lt;peebrain&gt; then we imagine the heat really picking up
<br />
[21:07] &lt;peebrain&gt; then, on the count of three, we all shout BEND BEND BEND at the silverware
<br />
[21:07] &lt;peebrain&gt; if you can, shout out loud
<br />
[21:08] &lt;peebrain&gt; if you can't shout out loud, then think it really loud <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />
[21:08] * DamianM (mr_damian_@dm-20707.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has left #psipog
<br />
[21:08] &lt;peebrain&gt; after that, we all relax, chat, and have a good time
<br />
[21:08] &lt;peebrain&gt; and check our silverware every once in a while to see if it's bendable
<br />
[21:08] &lt;peebrain&gt; ONE more thing...
<br />
[21:08] * Choodooloo (john@dm-16467.202-68.tampabay.res.rr.com) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:08] &lt;peebrain&gt; if you haven't already seen the video, check out:

<br />
[21:08] &lt;peebrain&gt; <a href="http://fork-you.com/" target="_blank">http://fork-you.com/</a>
<br />
[21:08] &lt;peebrain&gt; they have a video of a fork being bent
<br />
[21:09] &lt;peebrain&gt; now, to me, it looks like they are using a lot of force with their fingers
<br />
[21:09] * Endrecoterius (Hero@dm-33926.dial-up.telesp.net.br) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:09] &lt;peebrain&gt; but if you actually try to bend silverware, it takes a LOT MORE force than what they're using
<br />
[21:09] * DamianM (mr_damian_@dm-20707.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:09] &lt;ErikJDurwoodII&gt; *and we officially broke the previous chat record*
<br />
[21:09] &lt;peebrain&gt; ok
<br />
[21:09] &lt;JoeT&gt; <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
[21:09] &lt;peebrain&gt; so, I'm going to unmod it, and we are going to start the meditation
<br />
[21:09] &lt;peebrain&gt; no one talk
<br />
[21:09] &lt;peebrain&gt; let's see how much self control we have as a group
<br />
[21:09] &lt;peebrain&gt; meditate for about 10 minutes
<br />
[21:10] * Bob_stew (whatever@dm-2579.net.nc-systems.no) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:10] &lt;peebrain&gt; get that nice hot golden ball going
<br />
[21:10] &lt;peebrain&gt; get it on your silverware
<br />
[21:10] &lt;peebrain&gt; and keep it there
<br />
[21:10] * somefatguy (somefatguy@66.53.157.37393) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:10] &lt;peebrain&gt; we'll meet back here at 9:21pm
<br />
[21:10] * MorfeuV (MorfeuV@75.42.2.9872) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:10] &lt;peebrain&gt; and shout bend bend bend
<br />
[21:10] &lt;peebrain&gt; sound good?
<br />
[21:10] &lt;peebrain&gt; good
<br />
[21:10] &lt;JoeT&gt; I'll inform everyone who comes in not to speak and meditate.
<br />
[21:10] &lt;peebrain&gt; now - do not talk, and start meditating
<br />
[21:10] &lt;peebrain&gt; ready set go
<br />
[21:10] * peebrain sets mode: -m
<br />

<br />
[21:23] &lt;peebrain&gt; ok for all that don't know...
<br />
[21:23] &lt;peebrain&gt; your silverware doesn't HAVE to bend right now... in fact, in normal PK Parties, you just shout for a little bit, and then you just chat afterwarsd

<br />
[21:23] * neveza (neveza@dm-17235.ipt.aol.com) Quit (Ping timeout)
<br />
[21:23] &lt;peebrain&gt; that means that you are somewhat distracted from wanting to have a bent spoon
<br />
[21:23] &lt;peebrain&gt; but it's in the back of your head
<br />
[21:23] &lt;peebrain&gt; that way it gets into your subconscious, and the conscious mind stays out of the way

[21:23] * Mlink (masterlink@dm-7946.hsd1.pa.comcast.net) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:24] &lt;peebrain&gt; and the subconscious mind bends it at some random time
<br />
[21:24] &lt;peebrain&gt; so right now:
<br />
[21:24] &lt;peebrain&gt; the goal is to just chat and have fun
<br />
[21:24] &lt;stony1205&gt; I can do that.
<br />
[21:24] &lt;ErikJDurwoodII&gt; the &quot;charged&quot; intent will be let loose to morph the metal in the utensil.

[21:24] * maddok (hfhgfh@dm-20266.ns.aliant.net) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:24] &lt;peebrain&gt; if you think your silverware can bend, then give it a push/pull, and see
<br />
[21:24] &lt;peebrain&gt; otherwise, just have fun
<br />
[21:24] &lt;peebrain&gt; if you do bend it, then post a picture online
<br />
[21:24] &lt;ErikJDurwoodII&gt; Then the metal will become easily pliable by hand
<br />
[21:24] &lt;peebrain&gt; imageshack.us is good for that

[21:25] * neveza (neveza@dm-17235.ipt.aol.com) has joined #psipog
<br />
[21:25] &lt;JoeT&gt; One thought:
<br />
[21:25] &lt;JoeT&gt; Focus more on actually bending the fork, spoon, whatever rather than typing.
<br />
[21:25] &lt;AFX&gt; yeh
<br />
[21:25] &lt;JoeT&gt; I saw a lot of members type pretty fast.
<br />
[21:25] * peebrain sets mode: -m
<br />
[21:25] &lt;peebrain&gt; good tip
<br />
[21:25] &lt;Lit3&gt; gf
<br />
[21:25] &lt;Brento&gt; Yay! I'll eat my cheesecake with the spoon!!
<br />
[21:25] &lt;Wraith777&gt; Question... Does this work at all for plastic utensils?
<br />
[21:25] &lt;peebrain&gt; resume
<br />
[21:26] &lt;Zanarias&gt; So should we be holding it the whole time? Or should we push it out of the way?
<br />
[21:26] &lt;Mattz&gt; well, I can hold the fork/spoon in a way that lets me type fast and not let go
<br />
[21:26] &lt;Oipo&gt; Btw, does silverware imply the object to be of silver? Or does any metal suffice?
<br />
[21:26] &lt;binary&gt; .
<br />
[21:26] &lt;Tankdown&gt; testing..
<br />
[21:26] &lt;RodrigoHarrtamn&gt; WAIT
<br />
[21:26] &lt;Vulcanis&gt; typing onehanded sucks, but typing this fast requires little thought
<br />

[21:26] &lt;Bobrobyn&gt; Chatting with one hand sucks, lol.  I can't type fast at all.
<br />
[21:26] &lt;Vulcanis&gt; Oipo, no
<br />
[21:26] &lt;Mattz&gt; And we don't let go, right?
<br />
[21:26] &lt;Lit3&gt; PEEBRAIN!!!!!!!
<br />
[21:26] &lt;Oliveman&gt; But how can you hold the spoon while typing?
<br />
[21:26] &lt;GroovyGnome&gt; For the sake of clarity, is it safe to let go of the silverware? Typing with the silverware in hand is probably annoying for a lot of people.
<br />
[21:26] &lt;gravy&gt; can i bend a PENCIL?
<br />
[21:26] &lt;Zanarias&gt; Wait!!! Should we be holding it the whole time!?!
<br />

[21:28] &lt;gravy&gt; yeay
<br />
[21:28] &lt;stony1205&gt; My tip: For those who are unsucessful with the fork-you &quot;forced inattention&quot; method, there is another way I have found sucessful. Used forced attention, and good melting visualizations. Things like lava, gallium, or mercury can sometimes help you if you're a visual practitioner. But try the fork-you method first! PM if you would like some help, i'll be glad to help you.

<br />
[21:41] &lt;JoeT&gt; Slowly
<br />
[21:42] &lt;JoeT&gt; Alright, now: Put your fork/spoon in front of you and stare at it. Remember to pinch the fork using your thumb and pointer finger. 
<br />
[21:42] &lt;ErikJDurwoodII&gt; back
<br />
[21:43] &lt;JoeT&gt; Then, I want you all to visualize your body on fire.

<br />
[21:44] &lt;JoeT&gt; Imagine the flames of the fire covering the spoon/fork.
<br />
[21:44] &lt;JoeT&gt; See the fork begin to melt.

[21:44] &lt;JoeT&gt; Stare at the fork/spoon
<br />
[21:45] &lt;JoeT&gt; Now, see that fork/spoon folding downwards.
<br />
[21:45] &lt;JoeT&gt; Now, yell mentally or outloud &quot;Bend!&quot;
<br />
[21:45] &lt;JoeT&gt; Slightly put pressure on the fork/spoon.
<br />
[21:45] &lt;JoeT&gt; Repeat until you've done it.
<br />
[21:45] &lt;JoeT&gt; It's a decent technique.

[22:08] &lt;peebrain&gt; ... <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />
[22:08] &lt;peebrain&gt; ok... now about my next project
<br />
[22:08] &lt;peebrain&gt; I know I said before that I wanted to work soley on OBEs
<br />
[22:08] * Bloodbath (Bloodbath@dm-38099.tampabay.res.rr.com) Quit (Client closed connection)
<br />
[22:08] &lt;peebrain&gt; but, in the past 6 months, or however long it's been, I changed my mind
<br />
[22:08] * Bloodbath (Bloodbath@dm-38099.tampabay.res.rr.com) has joined #psipog
<br />
[22:08] &lt;peebrain&gt; in fact, about 3 ago, I was done with paranormal stuff all together
<br />
[22:09] &lt;peebrain&gt; believe it or not, running psipog can take a lot of energy out of you <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />
[22:09] &lt;peebrain&gt; it felt good to be done, and I didn't really want to do anything paranormal
<br />
[22:09] &lt;peebrain&gt; but I ran into a problem
<br />
[22:09] &lt;peebrain&gt; reality didn't really care if I wanted to stop experiencing paranormal things
<br />
[22:09] * UltimaRage (p15v300007@dm-16778.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #psipog
<br />
[22:09] &lt;peebrain&gt; reality just kept giving me weird shit day after day
<br />
[22:09] &lt;peebrain&gt; I still had OBEs
<br />
[22:09] &lt;peebrain&gt; I still predicted things
<br />
[22:10] &lt;peebrain&gt; I still read people's minds and emotions
<br />
[22:10] &lt;peebrain&gt; I still heard voices (maybe I'm crazy on that one...)
<br />
[22:10] * thegeek (caleb@dm-34186.ph.ph.cox.net) has joined #psipog
<br />
[22:10] &lt;peebrain&gt; so... while it did feel good to take an extended break from psipog and talking about paranormal stuff all the time, ultimately...
<br />
[22:10] * WingedWolf (wingedwolf@dm-554.chy-wy.client.bresnan.net) has joined #psipog
<br />
[22:10] &lt;peebrain&gt; I do paranormal shit, and I enjoy the paranormal
<br />
[22:10] * blackbeard (yask@dm-16851.ipt.aol.com) has joined #psipog
<br />
[22:11] * DrFrankenstein (doktorfran@dm-11803.dsl.bell.ca) has joined #psipog
<br />
[22:11] &lt;peebrain&gt; but... like I said before... psipog is going to be archived
<br />
[22:11] * gravy (darkmyst@203.177.155.15157) has joined #psipog
<br />
[22:11] * thegeek (caleb@dm-34186.ph.ph.cox.net) has left #psipog
<br />
[22:11] * thegeek (caleb@dm-34186.ph.ph.cox.net) has joined #psipog
<br />
[22:11] &lt;peebrain&gt; I still stand by that decision because psipog has it's own image
<br />
[22:11] &lt;peebrain&gt; I don't control the image of psipog, it has a life of it's own
<br />
[22:11] * DamianM (mr_damian_@dm-20707.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has joined #psipog
<br />
[22:11] &lt;peebrain&gt; and what I want to do next does not fit in the image of psipog
<br />
[22:11] * blackbeard (yask@dm-16851.ipt.aol.com) has left #psipog
<br />
[22:11] &lt;peebrain&gt; what I want to do next is to tackle all things paranormal
<br />
[22:12] * trumpam (dsg@86.29.14.37747) has joined #psipog
<br />
[22:12] &lt;peebrain&gt; instead of just psychic abilities, I also want to branch out into ghosts/hauntings, and UFO/aliens, and basically anything weird
<br />
[22:12] * Ikaway is now known as sucksthatisfoundthissitesolate
<br />
[22:12] * sucksthatisfoundthissitesolate is now known as ika
<br />
[22:12] * Shablulz (Shablulz@84.228.7.16260) has joined #psipog
<br />
[22:12] * neveza (neveza@dm-5907.ipt.aol.com) has joined #psipog
<br />
[22:12] &lt;peebrain&gt; and instead of taking a scientific perspective, I want to take a different perspective
<br />
[22:12] * nfield (nfield@staff.darkmyst.org) has joined #psipog
<br />
[22:12] &lt;peebrain&gt; science is great, but I feel it shouldn't be the MAIN focus
<br />
[22:12] &lt;peebrain&gt; it should be something we can use now and then to help us along
<br />
[22:13] &lt;peebrain&gt; the MAIN focus should be just to have a good time - to have fun, and enjoy ourselves
<br />
[22:13] &lt;peebrain&gt; I think the reason psipog was successful wasn't because we focused on psionics from a scientific perspective
<br />
[22:13] * trumpam (dsg@86.29.14.37747) has left #psipog
<br />
[22:13] &lt;peebrain&gt; there are lots of sites that do a much better job at that than psipog
<br />
[22:13] &lt;peebrain&gt; and they are:
<br />
[22:13] &lt;peebrain&gt; boring
<br />
[22:13] &lt;peebrain&gt; why?
<br />
[22:14] * Sabre is now known as BECAUSE-WE-LOVE-PEEBRAIN
<br />
[22:14] &lt;peebrain&gt; because, science is great and all, but shit... reading an 800 page document about crap I can't understand or internalize just isn't fun
<br />
[22:14] * BECAUSE-WE-LOVE-PEEBRAIN is now known as Sabre
<br />
[22:14] &lt;peebrain&gt; the paranormal is something that needs to be experienced
<br />
[22:14] &lt;peebrain&gt; then, if after we are done experiencing it, we may choose to look at it scientifically
<br />
[22:14] &lt;peebrain&gt; or we may choose to use religion
<br />
[22:14] &lt;peebrain&gt; or we may just to just say &quot;wow, that was fucking weird&quot; and move on
<br />
[22:14] &lt;peebrain&gt; so
<br />
[22:14] * Daniel is now known as I_Must_Go
<br />
[22:15] &lt;peebrain&gt; my new site is going to be focused on everything paranormal
<br />
[22:15] * Number1Fan is now known as PEEBRAIN-I-LOVE-YOU
<br />
[22:15] * Bob_stew is now known as lmao_at_Sabre
<br />

<br />
[22:19] &lt;peebrain&gt; amygdala - probably not a section on it... science will be more just part of the bigger picture

[22:20] &lt;peebrain&gt; harman - lucid dreams qualify under &quot;weird&quot;, so I'll be talking about them
<br />
[22:20] &lt;Sabre&gt; I'LL BE THEEEEEERE
<br />
[22:20] &lt;EnKi&gt; peebrain, i like the idea of simply experiencing weird shit, rather than trying to understand it scientifically. although i think science CAN eventually explain everything...

[22:20] &lt;Brento&gt; Peebrain - Will you be dabbling into Ouiji boards? I hear their paranormal...but dangerous.

<br />
[22:22] &lt;stony1205&gt; Peebrain: I am glad you are persuing what you want to you. However, I feel that mixing this many paranormal things into one area could get very messy, very quickly.  If it is as popular as PsiPog, then there will be circle-jerks and arguments everywhere, becase everyone is comming from a diffrerent background. 
<br />
[22:22] &lt;Oipo&gt; Har har, the moment I have been waiting for <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />
[22:22] &lt;BlackShadow&gt; PEebrain, can you send a Psipog newsleter to tell of the Grand opening?
<br />
[22:22] &lt;NinjaKitsune&gt; Peebs, you are doing stuff about aliens - do you know much about the shared motifs with alien abuction stories and older fairy abduction ones?
<br />
[22:22] &lt;powdered_water&gt; peebs, uhm... so will you be so strict on views on the blogs, as long as they aren't offensive?
<br />
[22:22] &lt;peebrain&gt; stony - we shall see <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
[22:22] &lt;Zanarias&gt; Yea a few questions here
<br />

<br />
[22:22] &lt;etree8&gt; I'll wait, but it probably won't be patiently.
<br />
[22:22] &lt;Oipo&gt; Of course, I assume there are going to be enough mods and the like to handle it all.
<br />
[22:22] &lt;Firestorm&gt; peebs: permission to PM?
<br />
[22:22] &lt;peebrain&gt; pw - you'll have to see how it ends up - it won't be structured how psipog's article system was though
<br />
[22:22] &lt;Zanarias&gt; How will the site be split? Meaning like sections dedicated on this or that or what?

<br />
[22:22] &lt;Float&gt; With that many different topics, it will be far more popular than psipog could have ever been
<br />
[22:22] &lt;neveza&gt; GOD, what are you talking about?
<br />

[22:44] &lt;peebrain&gt; so in conclusion, all that scientific stuff that 99.99% of the population doesn't understand, Erik DOES understand
<br />
[22:45] &lt;peebrain&gt; and he can build shit to help us
<br />
[22:45] &lt;ErikJDurwoodII&gt; Peebs, you should know that you and your community was pivotal in creating the future we want

<br />
[22:46] &lt;ErikJDurwoodII&gt; well &quot;don't need to know&quot; was very general and probably poor word choice.  What I mean by that is that you may not need to understand it to be capable OF it.

<br />
[23:08] &lt;Oipo&gt; Psipog has done much for me, in psionic terms really.
<br />
[23:09] &lt;Oipo&gt; These days I can just switch my telepathy on and off at will.
<br />
[23:09] &lt;EnKi&gt; Me as well.
<br />
[23:09] &lt;AyuleAway&gt; Thought you thought I was too much of a kid. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
[23:09] &lt;Bobrobyn&gt; peebrain, thanks for making psipog.  You have helped me become a better person, directly and indirectly, by doing so.  You helped me challenge my world-views, philosophy, and discover realms of possibility that I never thought possible.  your site was the first I found...and if it wasn't for it, I probably wouldn't be the person I am today.  Thanks, Sean.
<br />
[23:09] &lt;EnKi&gt; err...on the 1st comment, not the 2nd
<br />
[23:09] &lt;neveza&gt; Everybody wonders where ESS is at, but nobody thinks of Mannen.

<br />
[23:18] &lt;neveza&gt; Not good?
<br />
[23:18] &lt;somefatguy&gt; Everything paranormal.
<br />
[23:19] &lt;Sabre&gt; it's not just focused on one thing
<br />
[23:19] &lt;peebrain&gt; Psi Ninja - I'm focusing on everything paranormal, and dropping the obsessive scientific mindset
<br />
[23:19] &lt;Sabre&gt; it's everything magical, like Disney and Peter Pan.
<br />
[23:19] &lt;Sabre&gt; =P

<br />
[23:20] * Ayule gasps.
<br />
[23:20] &lt;Bobrobyn&gt; peebrain - Curious:  When did you become interested in stuff that was paranormal besides psionics and OBE's?  
<br />
[23:20] * Solet raises glass to pog
<br />
[23:20] &lt;Psi_Ninja_&gt; its still going to have psionics, right?
<br />
[23:20] * Zanarias raises glass of psi to pog
<br />
[23:20] &lt;JoeT&gt; Yes, Ninja.
<br />

[23:20] &lt;peebrain&gt; Bob - about 2 months ago, watching Sci-Fi investigates on TV, and realizing that the show really sucks, when it could really be awesome if they just did it right
<br />
[23:20] * Solet drinks
<br />
[23:20] * Ayule raises glass of psi to pog as well, and then looks around for a bottle to break.
<br />
[23:20] &lt;Roy&gt; Oh god, that show is horrible.
<br />
[23:20] &lt;peebrain&gt; I know
<br />
[23:20] &lt;peebrain&gt; but they have a good idea
<br />
[23:21] &lt;Melia42&gt; Honestly, where do aliens fit with the paranormal thing? They're extra-terrestrial, not spooky and mysterious.
<br />
[23:21] &lt;Roy&gt; It is a good idea.
<br />
[23:21] &lt;Guardian_Of_Death&gt; I MISS ONETA T.T
<br />

[23:22] &lt;Melia42&gt; Nev, their secrets seem to involve the asses of humanity and the stomachs of cattle. They can't be all that brilliant.
<br />
