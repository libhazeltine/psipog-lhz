			He wont view the videos because the videos have nothing to do with the competition JoeT, the competition is held in a research facility with scientists, randi is just an observer to check for any deception. Kramer said specificly: We do not want your videos, please read the rules of the competition.

			Just so you know, Kramer edits the emails before posting them on the message board.  In fact, sometimes false emails get posted that &quot;no one&quot; knows where it came from.

How do I know?  Well, it happened to me.

The emails he posted were not the same emails I sent him.  If you'd like more information, I can provide it.

			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
I was talking to a friend of mine, Dane Spotts, earlier this year about the challenge. Psi Tech DID apply for the challenge however Randi never responded! What does that say about him? That he's a fake, horrible skeptic and a person who?s afraid of the truth that he &quot;so wants&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Sean, I read the thread you posted (six pages). Very interesting, of course Randi admitted he was wrong. I'm wondering, did you want to apply for the challenge or did you just want the information and terms for the challenge?
<br />

			Well, everything in the yoyotk thread by Kramer was reasonable. the other guy was being unreasonable.

The thing with peebrain was just misunderstanding turned into frustration on both parts. Although I dunno why peebrain didn't just apply.

			About the psychic side and their side, all I can say is... both sides are right in their own way.
<br />

<br />
We're here because we practice psi and we believe it exists, or, on other cases, people trying to make their mind about psi.
<br />

<br />
Over there, they're trying to prove that paranormal is just a legend made up from almost the beginning of times (even though they say they aren't trying to debunk anything), with no intention whatsoever of proving or disproving psi.
<br />

<br />
It's all a matter of opinions.

			I have no problem with opinions.  I have a big problem with &quot;the end justifies the means&quot; mentallity.  I agree with a lot of skeptics and consider myself a skeptical person - however that doesn't give me permission to lie in order to force my beliefs down other peoples' throats.

I know what you mean, from what I read in that thread, only two or three people try to have what might resemble critical thinking and an open mind. Gamefaqs has the exact same problem, close minded skeptics just go there to joke about the paranormal and whatnot, and just can't take the truth even when it's right in front of their face. Most claimants in there don't try to shove their beliefs down anyone's throat, and, on contrary, close mind skeptics try to do just that.

			I was just wondering, since we recently just learned about this in school; does anyone think this could just be related to the Focault Pendulum? It was just a thought event though to see the effect that the Focault Pendulum produces it would take an hour for the pendulum to change direction by 11 degrees. If you read up about this subject, you will understand what I am talkng about.
