			This one time I was at a friends house with a bunch of people and we were all stood in the lounge while some of them had gone upstairs for the toilet etc. Anyways, just chatting I casually glance to the side at one of my friends and behind her I see another one of them coming down the stairs in the hallway. I turn away then suddenly my mind goes *click* hang on a second...i look back and the solid wooden door is closed, but a moment later the friend walks opens the door and comes through (I'd say walks through the door but around here that could be mis understood).
<br />
I asked somebody if the door had been closed the whole time they said it had been. So what skill is that, freakin x-ray vision???
<br />

<br />
Also, I guess this is similar I was at my cousins house and up in their room, her little bro had been annoying we didn't want him to come upstairs again. I got an urge so went stood by the door and put my hand on it. Closed my eyes and got a clear mental picture of the other side and her bro walking up the last couple stairs at the end of the corridor. I said he was coming and a few seconds later (about the right time to walk that distance) he opens the door.
<br />
Again...what is that?
<br />

<br />
Thanks for reading that long-ass post, sorry I didn't think it'd be so lengthy.Any ideas welcome.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			It was definately a form of clairvoyance... but no x-ray vision as you would have seen a skeleton and nothing more...

			David Icke had a story about that.. The fact is that everything is made out of atoms right.. and if you look at the atom and scale it up &quot;abit&quot;, you have some protons and nevtrons in the centre, than a whole lot of nothing, and than some electrons circling around.. if you scale the core of the atom to be as big as marble, than the space between the core and the circling electrons would be something like the football field.. and even the core is empty! So you have everything made of a lot of space, how come we dont see through it?
<br />

<br />
well david icke told a story on that. When he was Visiting a friend in itdoesntmatterwhere, there was this hypnotist at this friends' house. And the hypnotyst told him under the hypnossis (to this friend) that he will not be able to see his own daughter when he snaps out of it. so here goes the snap and the guy wakes up. his daughter is standing right in front of him. The hypnotyst standing in front of this man, and behind his daughter so she was inbetween them; and he says, &quot;can you see your daughter?&quot; And the guy says NO! starring through his daughter, at the hypnotist. The hypnotist holds up a watch behind his daughters back and asks the man, &quot;can you see what i have in my hand?&quot; The guy a bit confused, says &quot;ofcourse!&quot; Even reads out the inscription on the watch! he could clearly see through his daughter, as there was nothing there..
<br />

<br />
and perhaps this is what you did for a split second..
