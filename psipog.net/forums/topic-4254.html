			I think I may have found a way to increase your ability to shut out the outside world while performing PK.  When I'm watching TV, I usually have my Nintendo DS out and play it as I watch.  Naturally, I'm paying more attention to my DS so I must focus.  After about 3 years of doing this (before DS I used my GBA), I have built up an awesome base of focus.  What I'm saying is that multi-tasking on something you focus more on helps with PK.  I hope this helps!

			focus here mean think of nothing , people like to meditate but for me it is not easy focus in meditation but easy to look at 1 point at anything then clear my mind .
<br />

<br />
other method but need sometime untill you get all thoughts out your head , try to concentrate on 1 thought and get it out of your head and then go to the other thought and get it out untill you kick them all of your head and try to stop any thought that will come to you , after practice you will not need to stop thoughts 1 by 1 , you will stop them all at once. with focus state you can think but not too much but you can think with relaxed thought or you will be out of focus because of alot of thinking or strong thinking in 1 thought.

			There are a number of different ways to approaching pk. Some find it easier to not focus at all, so I, personally would practice clearing my mind via meditation. If you focus too much you will overdue it and clearing your mind would get you better results because the extra stress caused by too much focus would mess up your whole practice.

			I always have music going since I always have a song stuck in my head, it's easier to listen to it....the one time I moved the psi wheel was when I had been up all night and my friend was gaming across from me so he was talking to me on the strategy he should use(war game) and I was trying to spin the wheel at the same time and it spun a quarter turn clockwise then counter-clockwise...

seems that you were distracted and it moved to where you wanted it to, but when you glanced back it said &quot;nuh-uh&quot; and moved back to the original position.

			i think that bladeslinger created strong emotion with the song that is in his head because song always in his head mean he like it too much and produce emotion enough to move the psi wheel.

			ya i usually find focus better when im multitasking.
<br />

<br />
as funny as it is, but depending on who it works. I sometimes go back to the articles and read over to make sure i didnt miss anything or just decide to read for fun. while im reading ill find myself doing what it says while im reading. sometimes things will twitch. 
<br />
kinda cool i think. its all about getting the foot in the door i say.

			how about trying to clean or eat or excercise while trying to do pk.. it will increase focus and concentration... when you can concentrate and focus easily while doing something it will be easier when you're doing nothing.. just a suggestion..
