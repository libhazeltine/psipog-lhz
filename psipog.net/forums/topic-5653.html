Great movie. Seen it a couple of times.Other Tk movies I know of are Carrie (original &amp; remake).Might also want to take alook at the film Matilda which is about a girl born in a family who neglects her and she realizes she has the power to move things.
<br />

<br />
If your into fire, check out &quot;Firestarter&quot; which is about a young girl and her father who have special abilities to control people and start fires, while on the run from people who want to observe their abilities.
