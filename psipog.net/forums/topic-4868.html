			I would like to hear some peoples views on DMILS, not just changing eye colour, or increasing your strength or anything like that. I mean DMILS on a massive scale (as the Topic Title suggests, suprisingly), here are some example of what i mean:
<br />
1. Turn Blue and grow feathers.
<br />
2. Turn into mythical creatures, I.E werewolves.
<br />
3. Or even go as far as becoming 'the Hulk'.
<br />

<br />
Do you guys reckon something like this would be fluff, or do you think its actually possible, even in the long run. I can tell someone is going to say, 'But why would you want to'. Well, my answer to this is because i can.
<br />

			I would give myself black-feathered wings and act all cryptic.  I'd also turn my eyes red and my hair black.
<br />

<br />
My only belief as far as DMILS is that you can only do as much as your body would be able to do by itself.  I'm not so sure about extreme things such as growing more bones.  Maybe you could accelerate the repair of your bones.
<br />

<br />
Psionics are evolving as fast as or even faster than science, so who knows what humans will be able to do in the future?  Remote controls will become obsolete because everyone will be turning on TVs with their minds!

			Indeed, i think i will change the meaning of this thread to a game instead of a question.

So, if you could extreme DMILS, what would you turn yourself into, be descriptive.

			Fine then, I'll give this a shot:
<br />

<br />
I would make myself taller (at least 6' 7&quot;) and make my right ear like my left one (my left ear is slightly pointed.  sometimes, jokingly, I call myself a &quot;half-elf&quot; lol).  Next comes the hard (and possibly painful) part: growing wings.  I would make the feathers on my wings black like a crow's.  I would turn my irises red (I'm already attempting this) and make my hair black.  The only downside to this would be I'd need slots in the back of all my clothes for my wings.
<br />

<br />
I'd never need any type of vehicle; I would fly everywhere!

I wonder if it would be possible to use DMILS to split yourself. Two black Me-Spheres causeing havoc...Nice.

			That would most definately be very cool, but you'd have to split your consciousness aswell, or your conscious mind controls one dark sphere, and your subconscious controls the other. Interesting....

			I would have a black wing and a white wing, one eye red and the other blue, and a purple spiked hair. My muscles would have increased elasticity and strength, allowing me to move faster and maybe jump higher. I would have no scars... I would not wear eye-glasses =p... I would have doubled voice  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> . And, I would be able to regenerate myself at a surprising rate.

But what if your sub-conscious is evil?  You are then locked in an eternal battle to gain control of both consciouses and your soul.  Has anyone here read &quot;The Dark Half&quot; by Stephen King?  Things could get freaky.....

Actually, my sub-c is neutral. My concious mind is good, however. My sub-c would probably turn evil once liberated though. My concious keeps it in check...
