			and besides becoming a popularity contest, mods aren't gods.  They do disagree, and say some mod A says to me, good job on that new theory. But mod B says it a bunch of bull.  Confict...would I get the extra posts or not??

It wouldn't work, and cost even more money probably, and it would be hard as hell to track.

			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
Alright, I'm sick of hearing you guys bitch and complain. If you do not agree with the rules we've set for our community, then leave. These are the rules that we would like you all to follow. Until future changes are done, deal with it. No one is forcing you to be here. Feel free to come and go as you wish. I don?t want to be mean, but enough is enough.

			Joe makes a good point.
<br />

<br />
Does anyone have any other points to make other than &quot;wow this sucks&quot;?  Even if you think something should have a one word reply... then go for it.  You have 5 posts per hour.  If you want to use one of those posts on a one word reply, I'm not stopping you.
<br />

<br />
I'm not really seeing any sensible arguments against this idea.  If someone has a legitimate complaint, then feel free to reply.  If you're just going to regurgitate the same arguments (that we keep addressing over and over again), then you're wasting your time.

			I guess it does make you think before you actually post but sometimes people come back to edit the post. Editing still costs posting points, and I was wondering if someone could tell me why it's like that.

			Ok, I know that the mods are a bit annoyed at all the complaints about this new rule, but I have to have my say because i'm in a bit of a situation. Firstly, I havn't been on psipog for approx a week. Then I come back and see that the amount of new posts are 3 quaters down the bloody page. This makes me angry, especially if this is just the general discussion section. I am basically screwed right now because there is no way on hell I am going to be able to crack up enough time to answer all the posts I want to by having only 5 posts per hour. Again, just the general section, I havn't even gone into the others yet. Call this bitching if you want, but I am entitled to my opinon, and my opinion is that the rule sucks...in the situation that I'm in now.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I think that I make good, long posts. The only posts I have spammed on would be the game threads such as the jail one, however, I can't afford to post in there right now because I simply don't have enough posts. Furhermore, isn't this just restricting freedom of speech? If someone is asking me for help on a thread, I want to answer them and help them, not sit around waiting for my post count to reset and then finding out that someone beat me to it.
<br />
Going back to the new posts that I mentioned, when I log out or merely close the window, all of those posts are gone meaning that I have no idea as to which topics have new posts on. This gets me seriously pissed. Apart from that problem, I'm ok with the idea because I don't post in all the topics or read all of them. Most of of them I have seen a billion times before on the older pages of the forums. 
<br />

<br />
Just my 2 cents on this new rule.

			hmm... :/ idk maybe depending on your last login date to present the post limit increases to accomodate people in 3000's shoes, as for the limit on posting as a whole, it doesnt phase me all that much. I mostly just read the things people post. Just a point to bring up, if you can rescript this forum without dissesmbling it i have no clue but anyway my idea, if the word &quot;game &quot; is included in the topic title more posts than the normal are allowed? Just throwing my ideas out there.

			Bad idea, i think it should be the serious threads getting more posts then normal. The game threads get lots of spam, and isnt this rule supposed to stop the spamming?

			The posting limit is a good idea, in my opinion. it stops unessesary threadwaste and spam.
<br />

<br />
if you have something to say. but don't have any more posts for that hour. just wait. the whole point of these restrictions is to make people make their Post's count. not bump up their post count.
<br />
The limit will mean that you'll have to THINK about what your posting and thusly make this forum a more bearable place.

			Whining about it here isnt doing that limit good either, so i suggest everyone to stop your bellyaching and just wait for the next hour. 
<br />
A very helpful quote from a sig: Its not the post count, its making your posts count! Would be helpful if the game threads werent so addicting...
<br />
well, im gonna be in other sections trying to help people.
