			Many of the things taught on this site could be beneficial to the entire human race. Remote Viewing only useful for military applications? What about kidnappings, finding murders, what if entire rescue teams could remote view? Also, if you become proficient enough at it, you can move, say, couches with PK.
<br />

<br />
Maybe you could use it as a way to defend yourself, or even help others defend themselves from a distance? There are limitless uses for all of these if the person is skilled enough at them. Hell, we could save money on batteries for remotes and just turn on televisions with our minds. That would be helpful for the enviroment, so a lesser amount of batteries are thrown away in landfills. I really don't see how being telepathic could benefit, maybe exept for way better lie-detector tests.

Or maybe not. But if i look at what is going on right now, things are very fucked up in the world. Humans are just too dumb to realize themselves

and their lives. The world today is ruled by evil people that are addicted to power, control and money.

The other problem is the behaviour of masses of people, just look at history to see how people act in crowds. In addition to that many people are neurotics or too attached to material stuff.

So, i think it would be very hard to establish understanding in all those troubled minds.

I think the world is TOO ready for it, and you are simply insecure about your belief in the existence of psi.

And no, saying &quot;I don't know&quot; isn't really an answer -_-. Or, a viable one, instead.

&quot;Magic isn't real&quot;

&quot;Telekinesis isn't real&quot;

This stuff is labeled under Fantasy in the library.

Here's an example.
<br />
Today, In English, we read a story and one of the words was &quot;Telepathize&quot;.
<br />
So, then, the teacher was like &quot;This story is fiction, because of Telepathizing. That's not real. -laugh-&quot;

I was about to jump out of my seat, saying &quot;IT IS REAL!&quot; But i couldn't prove, and it would ensue laughter.

			Hi
<br />

<br />
What i think is that people are being conditioned these days. Or at least they try to do that. They try to enslave your mind and therefore you, by making you think what they think. By &quot;they&quot; i mean everyone, but especially politicians, militaries or maybe bosses of big companies too.  I don't want to generalize either. Not everybody from them is like that, but many are. Some of them are simply deluded and don't know what they're doing but that doesn't make it any better.
<br />

<br />
Mass media helps them a lot, telling you sweet sounding lies helps them a lot, making you get into dependance to them helps them a lot. Actually the most important thing I seem to have figured out is that you have to go your own way in order to free yourself.
<br />

<br />
If you go into public with psionics, and you really come through to people 
<br />
i say everything can happen. Of what i'm sure is that some will try to fight it, but some will try to fight for it too, some will laugh at it and some won't even care, because they knew or because they just don't care.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  Of course there are billions of more reactions but it doesn't matter. 
<br />

<br />
But Psionics is only a part of it all. In fact i think if humanity would realize Psionics, there will come thoughts that will change the Image of man that is common these days and therefore the definitions of &quot;You&quot; or &quot;Me&quot;. This would change many things. But at the same time many things would stay the same, though on an other level. When i speak of humanity i mean the &quot;masses&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
Well i could go on forever but i'm sick of typing now. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
