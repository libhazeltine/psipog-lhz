			I have just preformed PK for the first time.  I have been practicing for about a month, but have had no great success before now.  I only got about 1/2 of a rotation, but I was bubbly as ever!  I'm going into the stage of exhaustion, but it isn't half as bad as I thought it would be...  Anyways, I have some questions...
<br />

<br />
     1.  I had an energy drink right before I attempted.  Do you think this gave me the energy to concentrate, or do you think it dulled the effects?
<br />
     2.  Do you think the drink had anything with me not getting strong exhaustion, or do I just have a naturally good stamina?
<br />

<br />
     You can answer my questions, or talk about some tips and ideas you came up with.  Please dont wander too much, or fight, I don't want this to get locked.  
<br />

<br />
                                        Thanks for listening!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

<br />
Keep practicing  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Energy drink to help concentrate? It kinda does the opposite for me..I get really hyperr and can't sit still  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />
I hate energy drinks..They dont help me at all really <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" /> heh..
<br />
Im not sure about the exhaustion thing though..
<br />

Nice work  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I got exhausted after my first success, and I still do every time I move on to bigger objects - I had to endure the whole of the next day without PK, it's so addictive!
<br />

<br />
Keep up the practice, and experiment with energy drinks - It'll be really interesting to see what effect they have!

			Yeah, my theory is that it put me in a good enough mood to preform PK.  It sais on the articles that if you are sad/depressed, you will not get as good results, and that the more confidence you have, the better your chances are.  By making me slightly hyper, the drink made me feel happy and confident about it working.  Though, I don't know how an energy drink made me happy or confident feeling...
<br />

<br />
     I would definitely keep experimenting with energy drinks, but I don't keep any at my house, I go that one from a soccer game...
<br />

<br />
     But for now, thanks for the compliments, and I will keep practicing.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
