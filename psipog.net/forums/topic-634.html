			Hello, first I guess let me tell you some background info ( sorry i gotta lol)
<br />

<br />
I used to practice psi balls for a small time, never advancing very much because i never really actually commited that much i guess. Then I tried telekinetics and shielding for awhile...off and on for a couple years, and finally Im back into it and convinced im gonna stick with it and continue with my abilites so I will stop losing my knowledge and progress.
<br />

<br />
Ok, so today I was reading on shielding and such, then I made a psi ball, (only like my 15th or somthing but more like my first one since I haent done this for awhile) then I took it to my dog to see if he could since it, he just licked my hand and went back to sleep lol.  Then I was sitting on the couch wondering about shields and such and I ad like a spontanious idea about levitating. So I went into a mindset that I was like on a diffrent planet, and I was like, &quot;hey, I wonder what it would be like to be on a planet with lower gravity&quot;.
<br />

<br />
I just convinced myself really fast that I was on, like the moon. Then I got up, visualising  that it was NO problem because my muscles are so strong from earth, then I jumped off the balls of my feet, and I swear I jumped higher than I usualy do. I felt alot lighter and i dunno.
<br />

<br />
I think its somthing with recreating things in your mind, or convincing you sub-concious that your somewhere else...
<br />

<br />
I really dont know but I will keep trying to advance my skills on this and I will tell if it worked... I think it does, maybe someone with more skill in TK, Shielding, and I guess visualizations and psi minipulation could do it better.
<br />

<br />
Im really not trying to sound all fluffy, Im serious, dont flame me too much lol, but i think this could be somthing cool to try.

			My opinion is that you probably just tricked your subconscious into believing that you were on a different planet or whatever you were doing, and when you jumped, you really jumped the same as you usually do, but your mindset caused you to feel that you were lighter. 
<br />

<br />
That's just my opinion though

Now is that nice? I don't think so. Lets be a tad more polite when talking with other members <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />. Please do not tell people what to do either. If a moderator feels that their should not be any replies then we will lock it. 
<br />

<br />
Now, to stay on the subject. There has not been prove that a person can levitate or fly with using PK or any psychic functions. However, this does not mean that it cannot be done. Although I myself will be a little skeptic until I see it, I will not doubt that it could not be done. If I went back too the 1800s and said &quot;One day we will be able to visit the moon and send machines to other planets!&quot; how do you think the people back in that time period would respond?
<br />

<br />
My point to all this is, what may sound crazy now may not seem to crazy in the future. Time will tell. Again I myself would be a skeptic to hearing about it. However, I again would not doubt that it could not be done.

			well i think a powerfull shield might do the trick just program the shield to protect your body from gravity,im no good at shields but i tryed standing on my feet closed my eyes imagine a shield around me, doin that i just felt a bit lighter the problem is people are too attatched to the ground you should &quot;let go&quot; that was my probelm, i felt an enourmus force on my feet like i was forcing them to stay attached to the ground(it hurts) while i should be doin the opposite forcing the feet to let go, and when you do that you lose balance.....sort of and fall on the ground(just dont brake a leg).
<br />

<br />
i'll keep practicing cause i belive there is a way to do it...space godzilla is HUGE and he can float *here i am basing myself on tv stuff* but so you wont say that i watch to much TV after all is a monster not a human...back on topic keep practicing &quot;let go&quot; of the ground completly ignore it see this gravity was discovered when some guy droped an apple, well make the shield do the opposite with your body

Nope, two things:
<br />

<br />
1) Shields/Constructs cannot do what you yourself cannot, so you would still have to be a master in tk to pull this off
<br />
2) Learn how energy consumption fits into things, really, shields and constructs would be actually a very bad way to do this because you'd drain out all the energy in the shield before you got close to levitation.
<br />

<br />
I've said it before and I shall say it again
<br />

<br />
Is levitation *theoretically* possible? Yes
<br />
Unfortunetly, the amount of skill and energy makes it so insanely difficult that it is currently out of most of our reach to do it.
<br />
I did a little physics math with it in another thread, you know how moving a pencil is considered advanced?
<br />
It takes around 1500 times the force of that just to lift a person, then you have to maintain that force for as long as you want to stay airborne.

			i agree, but in order to float your defying the laws of gravity, the point is in order to do it you need something that nullefies this law,i thought of energy because basiclly i draw energy from out side i dont us my own energy and i've heard of people that can program contructs to draw energy on its own
<br />

<br />
as for movinga  pensil im no good on moving pensils im still with the pinwheel the fact is people take pinwheel in a wrong way,lik the pinwheel is easily manipulated by the smallest air,a small shake, or anything like that.
<br />

<br />
that makes it spin well all you should do is try to counter spin its movement if the pin starts spinning to the right you should force it to spin left,thats what i do, i force it to change directions.
<br />

<br />
i dont do math in fact im no good at math i dont go for details normally when i want to do something i jsut do it

			Nope, in order to float you're merely generating a force that exceeds the force the earth's gravity is applying on you in order to provide a net accelleration upwards.

			Not to flame or act as a moderator. But the point of the future, and we can fly has nothing to do with this post. And a shield, wow that was interesting. I think im going to try this. You could've been using astral projection. I think im going to try that, sound fun. Good idea.

			ok,hmmm try the shield then tell us  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> i just said in future psionic generation maybe we can fly cause present ones cant... or just like me dont know how to or never tryed or whatever...
<br />

<br />
you can fly in the astral i think i never had an astral projection,try to fly in teh astral then  try to remenber the feeling of flying then do it back in the physical...bah just throwing ideas to the wind

			lol, i didn't plan on trying the shield. i think that is a bad idea. you can do whatever you want to do in astral projection. it is quite fun read up about it. don't see what the use is but it can help your visualization and relax you.
