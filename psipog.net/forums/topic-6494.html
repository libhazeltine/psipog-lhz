			Well, with another OBE attempt last night, I was surprised to get the numbness in my body quickly, and even more surprised to get the vibrations very soon after. Normally, my chest tightens up during the vibrations, so it gets harder to breathe, and that normally ruins the vibrations. However, that didn't ruin it this time, and the vibrations kept on going. Suddenly, my arms... well, I honestly can't even describe the sensation, it was like having my arms resting in cold water. Same thing happened to my legs. I think that my spirit body detached from my normal one... but didn't actually come out, if that makes sense. Anyway, I tried my hardest to project myself out entirely, but I just couldn't. I could feel myself try to go out... but then something weird happened. It was like I could faintly see my projections coming out of myself through my closed eyes, yet there was a ring of... ghost-like people surrounding me, all looking down at me, from a distance. My projection would reach them, and just disappear, then another projection would come out of me, and the same thing. That happened about four times until it disappeared, the vibrations died down, and that was the end of that. So... what the deuce just happened?
