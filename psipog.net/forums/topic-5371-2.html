			Dark Energy Warrior, thank you for the idea, that didn't even cross my mind. It's a very good idea. I've been trying to phase all day no success, although at one point I felt like I was in a vaccum and heard throbbing sounds like a heart, and another time I heard a loud whistling sound.(it was in my head because when I plugged my ears I could still hear it) But tomorrow is another day, and I'm going to try phasing some flies, I hate flies.

 If you hate them, you hatred may cause some damage to the fly. Somewhere deep in you subcouncious theres an idea &quot;i hope that fly gets hurt while being phased&quot;. So use someone you don´t hate, if you want the results to be same as using your own hand.

<br />

<br />

<br />
i have to say im naturaly drawn to this skill. many times when i bored i've wanted to walk through a door and closed my eyes and said &quot;nothing there, nothings there&quot; only to bump into it a couple minutes later.

The problem is that he would like to know if phasing damages the object you phase. And if he phases a fly and damages it without knowing it, then he will come to the conclusion that phasing can damage objects...or organisms.

			I'll seriously going to look into this. I think I have phased once before, I woke up, put my hand at the wall, and pulled it back, and had an extreme stinging in my hand, like all the nerves had been effected. I dunno, I will definetely start research on it.

			Hi again guys, sorry it took me so long to get back on today, it's been pretty busy for me. Anyways, I got a blog up and running to keep track of any results we come across. Not much on it right now. You can find it at<a href="http://www.psipogphasing.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.psipogphasing.blogspot.com/</a>. I tried to phase some flies today, and then, getting no results tried to phase my hand again. No results, but it's only the second day so I'm still very hopeful. Although I think I'm facing a slight mental block thanks to reading Rainsong's article, but I've been talking to some people I met on other sites that say they've done it and it only hurts if you have a notion in your mind that it will so I think that should take care of that fear. But, I'm  still going to be careful and try and proceed as scientifically as possible. Thanks for all the support, I had no idea so many people would be interested in this. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
