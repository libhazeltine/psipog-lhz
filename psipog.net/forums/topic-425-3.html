			What about when you move to a new state and you have this feeling?

<br />
As in, I moved to bellingham,WA a couple of years ago and I felt like ive been there before.
<br />
Now, I didn't know the area or anything like that but some scenes of the city were 'familiar' to me.

			I get Deja Vu quite frequently (about once a month) but I don't really have much to add to the topic. I suppose I could right about my deja vus though, so, here goes.
<br />

<br />
1. This is my most vivid one. Get this. When I was nine (I'm 14 now), I didn't like wrestling much. I started watching it and I liked it. Anyway, I bought the latest wwe game at the time, and played it.
<br />
About a week after purchasing the game, I had a dream where this unknown wrestler walked to the right, exited the ring, and got out a weapon.
<br />
I thought it was a weird dream, but dismissed it as what it was.
<br />
3 YEARS LATER, I bought Smackdown: Here comes the pain. I started a match, and the EXACT SAME SEQUENCE OF EVENTS HAPPENED! Not only was it my first match on the game, but the &quot;unknown wrestler&quot; was none other than Brock Lesnar, who at the time was the biggest thing in wresting, becoming the youngest wwe champion in history. Coincidence? Nah. I think it lies somewhere in the mental, the pschicological. I've had loads before and since, but this one sticks in my mind.
<br />
This is one of the reasons I joined this website. I found it on the Playstation.com forums, and people were making a joke about it. But I visited and loved it. So here I am. Thanks for listening.
<br />

<br />
Sorry for telling you all my life story, but I get carried away when telling stories on forums. I guess the staggered interaction makes me run wild lol. Better get back to making psiballs...

<br />

<br />

<br />
your brain, even while at a birthday party, is looking for danger. its job is to keep you alive. so when you are anywhere doing anything, its assuming that whats going on could hurt you and scanning your memory for similar things in the past, that way it knows how to deal with it and what instict and first reaction to give you should danger show up.
<br />

<br />

<br />
when it sees the EXACT event in long term memory, nothing in short term, but the eyes are telling it the long term memory is going on, it blanks out and doesnt know what to do.
<br />

<br />

<br />
THAT is deja vu, your brain putting the present into the past then looking at it, and blanking out.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
What i am talking about with the dreams aint deja vu, because i KNOW what is going to happen before it does, but not until im 3-10 seconds from it happening. If i dreamt that WTC would fall, i wouldnt know when, but if i was in NYC at the time, id know about 5 seconds before the planes hit. because id regonise the dream and recall what happned soon after.
<br />

HA! you can't prove that he/she can't prove that he/she can't prove it!
<br />

<br />
... But I think that a deja vu is just what you think it is. It's just another thing that we gave a name. It might not be the same for everyone... I even think that maybe if I say red, you think of the exact same color but see it in another color... I mean that I say red and you see blue and everything that I see red, is blue to you. Blue firetruck thingies and stuff. So what we might see as colors can be other colors to other people. (I wonder if anyone can still folow me)</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />

<br />
I've given some thought to that... And it wouldn't work out because if you see red, and I see blue, but in my perspective red _is_ blue, then camoflauge wouldn't work. Think about it.

			I saw a movie once and my mind automaticly forced me to think that it was the way how the world will end, it's impossible that something like that will happen though... well anyways not now like in 5 years or so
<br />

<br />
This has only happened to me for one time though so i guess we can call this a prediction or a deja vu from my previous life

			I have also experienced deja vu but it's not that often..<img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />
<br />
but i hev read that it has something with hippocampus(right spelling?)
<br />
in you brain to do.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />  
<br />
when i had this once i knew exacly each movement of the persons close to me..so i think it's close related to pre-cog.

			yeahh i get it alot too, like twice a month....novnia said something similar to this but deja vu is supposed to be (explained by scientists haha) just a brain signal that gets sent again so it seems very familiar to you...i think some of it might be that because i have had some very non important deja vu(s?), everyday stuff where i get that feeling...but theres some cases where u just cant explain it...like big events of ur life...
