As Sheep said, if you hold the intention, &quot;I want my eyes to safely heal so my vision becomes clear and percise&quot;, then you are sending a safe message to your body.  Your body hears your thoughts - express what you want, and let your body find a way.
<br />

<br />
However, let's say you read about how the eye works, and you learn that bad vision is caused by imperfect sphere shaped eyeballs.  So you send the message, &quot;I want my eyeball to flatten on the left side&quot;, reasoning that it will fix your vision.  Well, that's where Bio-PK becomes dangerous - because you've just told your eyeball to flatten on a side based on your research.  Don't try and interrupt your body's processes - instead, tell your body which process it should use.  The process of healing is already programmed in your body - you don't need to tell your body how to heal - just tell it to HEAL.  It will choose the pre-programmed process that accomplishes your goals.  The body understands.

Think that would help with things that the body cannot naturally repair? Such as a damaged retina(sp)? Alot of people who spend time infront of TVs/PCs slowly develip Sun-Spots in the form of a dim TV fuz. This cannot be fixed in anyway other then retina transplatation which is not worth it.
<br />
 Thus, could Psi heal the eye where your normal body fuctions cannot by telling yourself to heal in such a way?

That was in relation to the &quot;contact&quot; light warping idea not bio-pk.

I agree with Peebrain's reasoning, but note the unlikely (I'm not trying to pick apart his argument I used almost the same words myself when I talked about this a while ago on another community), its still dangerous, you're better off with a medical professional when applicable.
<br />

<br />
And Confusion its possible, some injuries that seem to be irrecoverable might instead just be that it takes a lot of time and determination to get the body to do it, best example is Christopher Reeve, before he died he was starting to get some very limited movement back in his legs. Its not easy though, this guy never gave up and was doing all sorts of stuff to try and recover over a very long time.
