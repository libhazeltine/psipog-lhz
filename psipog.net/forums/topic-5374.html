			So I haven't been around PsiPog long enough to know the stories, but what happened between PsiPog and the other psionic communities? 
<br />

<br />
I just started checking the other communities out and they seem to be a lot like psipog; they help others learn psionics. 
<br />

<br />
I'm guessing there was an agreement with ideology, but it's just a guess.

Well sometimes it also seems like poggers are the only people not dumb enough to fall into the &quot;hefty name trap,&quot; ie, something someone based on psionic skills, but then prettied it up with useless banter (Ki Blast comes to mind here... kinda...). Know what I'm saying? Keep it simple. No need for big stupid names that only &quot;sound cool&quot; (but most of the time, don't).

			I figured there would be some difficulties between communities because 1) generally speaking (and I am not pointing figures at anyone in particular or saying that the whole forum is like this) but it seems to me that there are some very outspoken poggers that feel they know everything and are well quite arrogant. I figure this would be a problem because the whole topic of psi is very open-ended and there is much we don't know so I would think overly assertive people would seem too zealous because they feel their opinions are correct when in fact some of it can't really be proven because of our limited knowledge.
<br />

<br />
2) Since PsiPog has a strict no combat rule and since I have seen other communities who openly discuss combat that this would be another heavy hitter. I think it goes back to community arrogance; a lot of the communities I have seen sound very arrogant and this means if you don't agree with them you are just stupid and get offended and since combat is a pretty big issue, I figured there would be some friction.
<br />

<br />
Psipog always seemed to be the community geared more towards the science aspects as well as teach. I think that since there is this heavy mindset of being articulate and questioning other ideas that the communities that have come up with their own theories about psi and have turned them into dogma would, like I said, find it offensive because we don't jump on the band wagon and believe everything they say to be true. 
<br />

<br />
On a side note I have heard people complain about psipog because we say that we're open-minded but they believe we actually aren't. I wouldn't classify the whole forum as a narrow-minded forum just because a few members are narrow-minded.

			I am grateful that both communities exist differently.
<br />

<br />
It has already been proven that science and the metaphysical cannot coexist widespread. That although balance, <span style="font-weight: bold">(EDIT)can</span> be found, it is often not.
<br />

<br />
Thus, two communities exist. Each having their strengths and weaknesses one not being better than the other. 
<br />

<br />
If you want a little of both than you can go to them. If not, then you can go to one that suits your beliefs.
<br />

<br />
Seems preaty convient to me.

			Agreed.

I have just discovered Veritas and I like to go there because it's more of a spiritual perspective and being spiritual is something I concentrate more on than anything else.

So it's getting the best of both worlds and I like it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I dont like Veritas at all because when i first joined their forum, i got a PM from the moderator threatening to ban me for posting false articles (the ones that i wrote).  Other communities either love psipog or hate it.  The reasons vary but every site &quot;wants to be like psipog&quot;.  Everyone always says &quot;I want my site to be as active as psipog&quot;.  People hate psipog for that reason too.  They think that psipog takes away activity from their site.  Pretty much, a lot of people are stuck up and idiots.

Not to start a flame war since I go to Pog and a couple other communities bur first off, some of them *don't* want to be like Pog and follow different focuses, and and reasons for disliking psipog (I won't comment what they are or whether or not I agree - trying to keep the chance of flames down), are thought-out and legitimate. I've actually *never* heard anyone complain that Pog is just taking activity away.

I'm not saying it's the case, but I wouldn't be surprised if other communities were jealous because they aren't as active as Pog, even though you say you've never heard other communities say that.

<br />
I no you don't want to start an all out argument Fire, but I wanna know why other sites aren't very tasteful towards pog. I'm not saying I want to find dirt on Pog and bring it down, no I like Pog. I just want to know why other communities feel differently than I do.

			In my experience really not many of the community people have been concerned with the numbers as long as they're getting enough to do what they want.
<br />

<br />
As to why some people dislike Pog like I said I really don't want to go too much into it, some people have private issues with a mod or member, and others don't like the style or philosophy taken with 'x' thing on Pog.
<br />

<br />
No more prodding about this would be appreciated, I like all of you guys so I don't want to either piss off people here, or get my other friends angry by revealing an opinion they didn't necessarily want broadcasted.

well, with the great activity that psipog has also comes a great number of fluffs, asshole skeptics, trolls, ect...i'm glad that the other site i belong to doesn't have this problem...it's not a biggy, just a little annoying.  there have been instances in which psipog and (i'm not going to say any names) were hostile with each other because of unneccessary banning on pog's part, but disobedience of some (somewhat triffle) rules on the other site's part in the chat rooms.  and believe it or not, but poggers is seen as arrogant to other sites as well.  it may even be something as stupid as the webmasters don't like each other.  but just to be clear, it's not all the other sites' fault, it is also poggers.  each side is at fault, and i think we ALL need to come together in interest of the larger good...hopefully you all know what that is.

			PsiPog does have more idiots to deal with, but that is the price for being popular. I still like small communities though, becuase they're a completley different atmosphere. You feel like you know a lot of the people, and needless to say, there tend to be less idiots. 
<br />

<br />
From the huge amount of information a big forum offers to the more at home feel a smaller one offers, both are good in different ways.
