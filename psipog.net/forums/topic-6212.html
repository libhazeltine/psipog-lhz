			I think my Sub-C is using telepathic suggestion to make things go &quot;my way&quot;.

My brother got a lot of candy this haloween, so I asked him if I could have a sucker, I had my eye on an orange one that was completely different from the other ones and then he handed it to me, it was a pretty good one too.
<br />

<br />
And this one evening, I really felt like going swimming, and then my dad suggested it, and the pool was going to close in 2 hours, we usually spend more then that on average.

			so, on my way to physics the other day, i was walking down the hall trying to see if i 'knew' where people were psychically... so i was completely unsuccessful for about a minute, and then i figured.. whatever i'll just give up. then i started thinking about random whatever, and thought of my friend. just as i thought about him, i look over and see him walking right next to me (and he turns and looks suprised to see me).. coincidence? both of us were thinking about eachother and didn't see eachother there beforehand (i have no idea if he practices psionics at all.. i don't think he does though)

			I sometimes have problems with my subconscious as well. It's like a whole other person living inside me, telling me what to do. I feel that my subconscious is composed of every other typical person's influence on me and it's getting harder and harder to not do something just to be like the others. It's gotten so confusing that even sometimes the things I WANT to do feel like the wrong thing. Even though sometimes I know that it's the right thing. And even if my intentions are good, they feel like negative ones. I know this might be confusing to some of you.
<br />

<br />
This isn't a pleasant feeling, all I can do is tell the rest of you to never ever let other people's ways influence you for better or for worse, just do things your own way. Do what you would do without thinking otherwise. Above all, just be yourself and don't feel bad about it no matter what.
<br />

<br />
Even bad people have feelings too. Even good people have their demons.

			Do you find that things go better when you pay attention to your subconscious rather than ignoring it?
<br />

<br />
Mine makes me do the randomest things sometimes, taking detours that lead straight back to the route I was going along, or calling people when I've no reason whatsoever. And yet it always makes sense in hindsight...

			My subconscious can get really annoying sometimes, but he's still very important I guess. I guess I'll just have to learn to ignore him when he tries to make me do things I don't want.
