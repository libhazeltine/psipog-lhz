			I have been thinking of this subject for some time now, many years to be exact. There are different levels to be explained of this. 
<br />

<br />
The first thing I will explain towards this statement is where we are. How would life be without intelligence? How is life with intelligence? As much as I have seen, I think we would be in a better boat. Do you see greed in intelligence? Do you see the tool towards our desire? Without intelligence, we would not have desire, how could we? Desires are meaningless things that we seek. Look at the greed that has come up in this world. Look at what is happening to the world. All because of intelligence. 
<br />

<br />
Now you may be saying “Wouldn’t we just be cave men/women?” I cannot fully say, but in my view, no. There is a fine line between intelligence and wisdom. Wisdom has no bias, wisdom has no opinion. Intelligence does, and intelligence fights with these two meanings. These two things are the sword and shield for intelligence. This is one reason how I have grown to hate intelligence and what humans do with it. 
<br />

<br />
Here is the main thing I have always pondered though. Look at the smartest person you know of. Keep in mind not to look at the person who has the most wisdom though. Now what do you see? Do you see ego and actions from them that look down upon others? That’s what I see at least. Something happens to us humans that makes us fill up with this power, and we like it. We start to go around judging the other beings on the street and then act upon it. We look down upon the one’s who are less intelligent than us. We act like apes. 
<br />

<br />
“No one is smarter than you, they only know different than you.”

Hmm, I have never really deeply thought about emotions. But, this technology you speak of, do you think it is all for the best? If you haven't noticed, the world is being destroyed steadily but rapidly. In yours and my lifetime we will be greatly affected by this. We as humans cannot just keep on &quot;fixing&quot; things as Bladeslinger put it, things just get worse after worse. What we have done is terrible. Technology seems to be good, but I see it only as a front.

Are you kidding me!? Did you get that form startrek by any chance? Emotions are our greatest power. But it can indeed be our greatest flaw, so I do agree with you that far.
<br />

<br />
I like to give a example but it comes from the bible but can't so I'll stop right there.
<br />

<br />
Emotions and intelligence are infact truthful. It only because we are humans that we make mistakes. Mistakes in logic and emotions that cause impureitlies to create our destrution. As in emotions, the mistake I often see is selfish control that leads them to use there intelligence only around themselfs and because of that they lead to wrongful answers.
<br />

<br />
Lets look at some of our worlds greatest minds. Did you know that Einstein wrote poems? So did a england scientist, Eddington who wrote a poem about light being bend by the sun while testing Einsteins theory. 
<br />

<br />
There are other greater minds like this. Not just logical but emotions. Far that I know, our greatest minds are so great because they seek out emotions and logic. I can go on but I wont for now.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
The problem with intelligence is that its flaw only because of emotions.

			It true, emotions are probably humankinds greatest achievement ( dont know how thats an achievement, it just happened). There is a profound difference in intelligence and wisdom. Intelligence will get you through school, and wisdom will get you through life.

			Humans are greatly flawed, but we were never perfect in the first place. As for the greatest flaw in humans, I think, IMO, it's ignorance. Failure to see their veiw in other's eyes...

All in my opinion, of course.

			Is curiosity an emotion? Without curiosity we have nothing. Intelligence got us to where we are today, and although it seems like we're on a downward spiral because of it, every journey starts with a single step. Wisdom did not create math, a lightbulb, or a phone, intelligence did. We need both. A utopian society cannot instantly be reached with current human characteristics.
<br />

<br />
What is the most commom human characteristic; Fear or laziness?

			Neat, all of your responses are very good and interesting. 
<br />
I think you are right Tankdown, maybe intelligence is wrong because of our emotions. I think the reason humans are the way they are is because their emotions use their intelligence...
<br />

<br />
You guys certainly have me beat on this though, I have not yet had the chance to deeply think about emotions, so I cannot really give you a good answer about it. 
<br />

<br />
Derricktheone: I think the most common human characteristic is fear, but laziness is quite common as well...

BelovedWater: Yes, ignorance is quite a large problem.

			Intelligence is the amassing of knowledge effectively in my eyes and using this information usefully. Wisdom is learning the insight and reason behind information. Also, desire is the opposing force of intelligence. Desire is the most basic emotion that pushes as to do things impulsively. The ability for the human brain to amass information and use it is the epitomy of evolution and life itself. We are the product of the machine called life and the brain is our leading feature. Saying that intelligence is our downfall just because someone was rude to you is very bad. You didn't think it out far enough. 
<br />

<br />
P.S. Felix, when you say things like that it makes you seem... fluffy sort of. I do believe in &quot;love&quot; though as a powerful emotion that most of us never feel. We think we do but only when we experience it for sure do we REALLY know.

No, that was the original reason, but not anymore. 
<br />

<br />
We use our intelligence to fulfill our desires. Let us say that I want to eat a steak. How can I do it? Well, I'm going to have to use my intelligence to find out where to get a steak and such. Even so, then I must think of how to eat it. 
<br />

<br />
Maybe I am not pinning this right. But intelligence has created chaos in this earth. We created factories with it, but those factories created pollution. That pollution is destroying us and this earth. And we obviously had greed to do such a thing without caring for life. The people who started it only thought of themselves. 
<br />

<br />
The level I was describing earlier about intelligence in humans and what they do to other humans with it is not to be directed on one person that I have noticed in my life. Look at a young child. This child is considered bright or intelligent if you will among his colleges. He wants the playground to himself, but how is he going to do it? Simple, he will use his intelligence to gain more power over his friends. He will out smart them. You can also see this behavior in war. We use this intelligence to kill other humans in order to be seen with the most power.

I'm guessing only because &quot;love&quot; has been hijacked by the idiot New Age crowd.* I'm no New Ager. Their &quot;love&quot; is utter bullshit; I've seen meaningless expressions like &quot;universal love&quot; and &quot;projecting love&quot; and in New Age writings.
<br />

<br />
 I'm talking romantic love. If you think talking about (romantic) love makes me fluffy, then I think it reflects more upon you than upon me.
<br />

<br />
Have <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> ever been in love?

			I think its being selfish is the most powerful emotion. Simply because people think more about themselfs then others that things fall apart for everyone. As fluffy it may seem, love may be the most powerful emotion to save us. True as living creatures its natural and perhaps even a law of nature to fear death and act on to our selfs to save ourselfs. But when people work togather. Things tend to stand up better.
<br />

<br />
I guess a better way to put it is this way. In a building you need material to give its share to hold up the weight. But if a few don't give there share. A few walls just come down.
