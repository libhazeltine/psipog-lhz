			when i first tryed the wheel thing i tryed for about 2 weeks... not sure if i got results or not but i stopped trying for about 3 months and completely forgot about this site... anyway, i was searching through my favourites and came across this site again... thought i might try again... but didnt get any results... well anyway i went and had a shower... in the shower i used shampoo and got bubbles on the glass... after i washed it out of my hair, i saw the bubbles on the glass slidind straight down... well anyway, i tryed absent mindedly to make it start goin to the right while sliding down... and it worked! i thought it was just a coincidence, so i tryed to the left and it worked again... so i thought that, when stuff slides down glass it usually swerves, so i tryed again and it just kept gfoin where i wanted it to go!! so this may have sparked my liking for tk again lol... and i am gonna try it again when i have my next shower...

			It's hard to determine if it really was psi, a shower has alot of interference factors that you should keep in mind...
<br />

<br />
It isn't impossible but it's also hard to prove, I suggest starting with the psiwheel because if it really was psi then you should also be able to do it on the wheel.
