			Hello,
<br />
I just wanted to let you know about something I requested the other day.  Yeah, I know its a link but I don't think it should go in that section, because it is not really a link to any big website, just to a request I made that I didn't feel like rewriting here.  
<br />

<br />
If you feel like responding, please use my e-mail address, <a href="#">BrandonMagic@gmail.com</a> or Pm me!

Thanks so much!

Man, why does psipog have all teh assholes?  This forum is infested with the most assholes that I have seen on any forum.  Nothing against psipog, but WOW. I am kinda glad this place is closing down, it has definetly run its course!

Freedom- In my mind, all I am doing, is living my life the way I want to.  If there is anything wrong with that, then I don't want to be right.  I would be sick, working 8 hours under someone, doing something you don't want to do.

second, by living your life however you see fit regardless of right and wrong is just ignorant.  Children eat mud pies until they realize the mud is full of parasites, just because they want to doesnt make it good for them.

Assholes are everywhere, not just here... but when you sound like a self-absorbed teenager, trying to sound like a mature teacher (and people can tell the difference),  then you just bring out the asshole in all of us, even me.
<br />

<br />
and lastly, ive read your blog... it sounds to me like you are looking for someone to praise you, and tell you how awsome you are.  Your not looking to broaden our horizons by teaching everyone a true skill.  Learn how to be humble first, then, when you succeed at your own business, your employees will respect you, instead of thinking your nothing but a self-rightious a-hole with a serious ego problem.

What? Hm.... maybe my teenager mind can't understand what you're saying.  O right, doing something I don't want to do is better than doing something I want to do.  Thanks for clearing that up.  I was so confused.  (sarcasm) I don't know if you just misunderstood my post or not, but what I meant, was that alot of people live life doing something that they don't necessarily like or want to do. All I was stating, is that I want to live my life doing something that makes me happy.  Is that selfish, I'm sorry.  It may sound that way, but really, it is essentially my life,,,,, so yeah....

I never said that there were only assholes here, it just seems like this forum has more than others.  I can understand the skeptics, but people like you and others, who only bash without being helpful, well, it would be better not posting at all.  I've been on many other forums, but, like I said, this has the highest asshole:helpful people ratio.  In other words, psipog=more assholes than most forums!

Ha, yeah, your exactly right.  All the articles on my site don't really teach anybody anything.  They just talk about how good I am. How could I have ever made that mistake. O wait, you mean they do actually teach methods?? When did that happen? (and they work for alot of people to) And also, if you would reread or actually read my blog, it tells you the main reason I am writing it!!! To share my experiences and successes and failures. That means, I am SHARING my SUCCESSES with everyone! This is because, back home, there is noone to talk to, because alot of people I know are close minded.  My blog is more to get my experiences off my chest, if you will. If you don't care to read it, then don't!  Also, I said that I would like to WORK WITH someone, I'm not looking for praise....and I haven't gotten any yet.

Believe me, I should have to work 8 hours under someone.  I come from a middle class family, and were definetly not rich.  Maybe even lower middle class.  Big woop, it makes no difference!  I don't think I am better than anyone.  Infact, in many aspects, I feel that many people are better than me, and that I  haven't made the wisest choices.  All I want to do, is live a fun life.  Wow, what a concept, and how selfish.  I don't think it is that selfish, because any one could do it!  O well, maybe I am conceeded and egoistical (I'm really not  <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" /> ) All I wanted was someone to work with or some experience, not praise.....
<br />

<br />
Thanks anyway for writing back, but next time, if you have nothing nice to say, please don't say it at all.  You'll notice that the people who are helpful and nice, and the people that psipog has come to trust, are all nice, and they never flame someone like you did.  I hope you're not trying to make a good reputation for yourself. 
<br />

<br />
I relize that I might have been a bit to sarcastic, and that's not usually how I act. But, alot of the things you said were pretty mean, and I have to retaliate somehow.  And since I can't hit you lol JKKJ, I thought it was the best way.  I hope that you have a deeper understanding of what my original intention was, and that any misunderstandings were cleared up!
<br />

<br />
Thanks

Thanks for posting....  I feel I now have a better understanding of everything.  Infact, I'm gonna go commit suicide for being so selfish (JK ofcourse) Thanks for all the help..... Not.  Wow, you guys are pretty stupid, to say the least.  For the last time, read my post and my blog and you will understand that I was not being selfish in the least.  Is it really that hard for you to understand.   I would really encourage you to read the article in my blog that shows why I started writing it in the first place.  Please do your research and then start shouting for nothing!

			The thing about lies is that there often said. Even when we don't know ourselfs. I think we all lie in some way. You could be saying your not selfish but knowing the truth would require deeper knowledge then simple words. But I don't care about any of that, not right now anyway. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Its good that your trieing but I sure hope you know your limits. Like Wind_drifter said to you before is pretty much true (on my grounds anyway). We all been there (Or so I experience and heard) you may do it now without even knowing. As for this Communism deal, it did sound to be prefect, I don't know much about poltics so I'll try to stay out of that seaction but I believe one of the problems with it is that it don't have that &quot;check and balance&quot; that the U.S had. But then again evil knows no bound even that was coppurt on some grounds. Or I could be wrong. lol <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

I don't feel like saying anymore

			I still am not understanding how you guys are saying that I was selfish.  I guess I can't yet seem to comprehend that.  I thought that I was living my life....hm....you guys make it sound like I am sinning by trying to do what makes me happy.  You know, we could all do that... so how is it being selfish?

I don't believe any of us said we didn't do the same. I'm happy that your dong what makes you happy, but happiness can have a price (such as killing your girlfriend and wearing her skin as a coat for chirstmas) You need to know your limits. As sam with us.

Who knows you may be telling the complete turth like I said We don't know from your simple little words. But the fact that you sound like this makes us think this way. We only trying to help (or lest I think so)
