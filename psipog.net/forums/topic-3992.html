			Thats 'experiment' is BS, its programmed to randomly move from side to side, slow down, and speed up, i tried it, even when i wasnt focusing on it, it still kept hitting the sides, and when i was focusing on it, it kept hitting the sides, i went to go get a drink of water, and it was still hitting the sides, as i could hear it downstairs. Utter rubbish, there was a different test like this, but this one is even worse.

			I still think its programmed to sway whichever way it was programmed to. Micro Pk cant change programming, it can only influence 'free binary code'. That pendulum begins to swing even before you start to focus on it, therefore, it was already programmed to speed up, slow down, hit the left side, hit the right side, stay in the middle for a while, its already been programmed with those commands, so micro-Pk cant affect it, like say if you were playing warcraft for example, you couldnt just change aspects of the game like what scenery youre in, what weapons you have, or what enemy you face by using micro-Pk because those commands are already embedded into the game files, same with the pendulum, basically im trying to say that its fooling you into thinking you have micro-Pk. A better micro-Pk test would be a random number generator, or a random dice rolling application, or hell, just get a dice, and roll it for yourself, im just saying that pendulum test is bogus.

			No, that experiment, and the others on that site all use real random numbers generated from an external source (based on matter breaking down or something), so it's not embedded in the code, you just affect the chance of it being a 1 or a 0.

unlikely, i tried 6 times to see if it was me doing it.

<br />
1st go: 27
<br />
2nd go: -17
<br />
3rd go: 12
<br />
4th go: 3

5th go: 21

6th go: -2

I consider it completely random, and therefore, a completely useless test for micro-Pk.

That's the point, if it wasn't completely random it <span style="font-style: italic">would</span> be useless, but how is affecting a 1 or 0 any different to affecting a die/dice?

			It's not programmed for it to move from side to side (or stay in the middle) and then swing narrower. I myself was a little skeptical of this, and five times I let the program run by itself. I even left the room and did something else, and each outcome was the same; A negative score. But when I actually applied myself to it, I could make the pendulum stop moving, and when I stopped and turned away, viola; it stopped staying still, and resumed swinging back and forth ( I had it set, so that you're supposed to make it swing narrower).

			i have no other way to explain my two consecutive high scores as theyre only about a few minutes apart when my concentration was strongest,
<br />

<br />
 i try to  visualize the line that connectts the two balls as a straight line between two of my fingers as if im almost squeezing it still and it usually slows down for a while.

			That's pretty cool, I'm going to have to try that way. I can usually attain 27-34 for a few seconds, but sometimes my concentration slips then goes to hell, and I'll go into the negatives. I do a lot better on the clock one than on this pendulum. I don't have a method or way, I &quot;just do it&quot;. At this point when I try visualizing it just messes up my focus.
