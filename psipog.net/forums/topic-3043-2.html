			If teleportation is possible (which i, myself, do not think it is), think about what you are doing.  You are doing 1 of 2 things.  Either taking appart your body cell by cell, eliminating it, recreating it somewhere else, putting it back together.  Or you are breaking down the cells, transporting them all somewhere, and then rearrange them back into the correct place.  Either way, you are technically killing yourself and then bringing yourself back to life.  Does anyone else see a problem with this?

			It doesn't have to be one of those two things. As mentioned in the article, the subjects could be in other planes of existence as they're moving. Maybe things we haven't discovered yet.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  Just my two cents.

			if it was possible it would take many lifetimes to learn to move every single cell of your body.
<br />

<br />
as for starting off small how about detaching your finger and not being able to re-attach it.  Not moving a few feet as thats a huge task.

I won't say that it's impossible, but I do believe there's a higher degree of difficulty. 
<br />
Personally I believe that everything is made of energy - keeping in tune with Einstein's theories, and based on that teleportation would essentially be changing your body into energy, moving it, and then changing it back. Moving energy can be as fast or slow as we like (illustated by moving psi balls). I would say the hardest part are the conversions to and from the energy state.

Stop thinking so 1960s, dude.  That's Star Trek's method and it's old news.  Use quantum entanglement or wormholes or transport yourself as energy that can travel through the 6 other spatial dimesions predicted by string theory.  All would be far easier although some would carry the risk of dying but thankfully I don't believe my consciousness would just disperse when my body briefly teleported...because I've already done it lol.  Wormhole method would be my best guess though I can't say for sure.  Twas lacking in sensation, to the point where I had to stop and think about what just happened.  Your method would require the pain of phasing, and so obviously that's out since I felt zilch and I've yet to hear from any colleague with experience in this area that teleporting hurt them.

			ah yes, as I recall correctly , lightbringer has mentioned this once before. he even said that he showed a (girl)friend of his how to do it. Isn't that right , lightbringer? or am I talking about someone else? Anyway, at that time alot of people were asking you how you did it but you didn't want to tell because you thought it was too dangerous or something. perhaps you changed your mind?

			Why would you take apart each cell and rearange it? If you can teleport a coffee mug, then why not a person? Everyone always thinks that when they do it to a person, they will come out all mixed up and in the wrong place. I would personally try it on animals first, and then on myself. If they don't come out screaming in pain, then it's fine. And why would the particles rearange if they travel through time and space? It's the intent; you don't need to know a shed load of chemistry for this, or Pk would be much harder. You would have to move every particle for pk otherwise, wouldn't you? Think about it. I am intrigued to see what nothingness feels like...

How do you teleport a coffee mug?  You say &quot;If you can teleport a coffee mug, then why not a person?&quot;.  how do you know it is possible to teleport a coffee mug in the first place?  For PK, you can focus on the whole object because it is right there in front of you.  Pyro-PK, you consintrate on the molecules moving faster.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">consintrate on the molecules</span>.  How would you go about teleporting something?  Just make it disappear and reappear somewhere else?  Where do all the cells go? 
<br />

<br />
Some of you will respond by saying &quot;How does PK work then?&quot; (or something more snobbish).  Well, PK is not making something disappear.  Think about it.  You move something.  Woopdi damn do.  Now you are literally making something disappear and reappear somewhere else.
<br />

To Lightbringer:

<br />
....You have teleported before....?  Prove it.  Not with videos (if you even can).  Teleport right next to me.  I highly doubt that you can.  Hell, i even highly doubt that it is possible.  Yeah yeah yeah, you dont <span style="font-style: italic">need</span> to prove it.  I guess everyone is entitled to their own imagination...

			I'm not sure if it's completely possible. but I've been trying to teleport a marble from one place to another. I hold it in my hand and focus my energy down my arm and &quot;mingle&quot; it with the objects energy. By this time I can feel it vibrating in my hand, I guess I'm feeling it's energy, anyway then I just either visualize it disappearing and reapearing where I want it or visualize it turning to dust and reconfiguring where I want it. Still unsuccees full but I've only been working on it for a few days.
