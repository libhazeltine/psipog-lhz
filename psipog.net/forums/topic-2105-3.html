I will admit, you have a point there.  Most &quot;flaws&quot; that people have are simply differences that they see as unacceptable.  Though there are some things that are universally unacceptable.  Not many though.

I used to call myself agnostic, but that was mainly not to offend others.  My own line of common sense tells me otehrwise though, but I'm not going to get into that, we're already on the fence as it is, lol.

<br />
And I don't think psionics is my religion, its jsut a hobby for me.  Just something I do during my spare time when no one else is around, nothing more.  I certainly don't devote my life to it.

			Kief,

<br />
Let's assume for a minute that TK is a conciously practicable and trainable ability.
<br />

<br />
Let us also assume that beginners are only able to move something as small as a psi-wheel, and therefore it should be something they practice on.
<br />

<br />
You claim that disturbances caused by heat and static-electricity can effect the pinwheel making one believe they spin it. (And they can.)
<br />

<br />
I'm not saying if you would accept video proof, but if one were to set up a controlled Psi-wheel experiment, what would be what you would want to see out of experiment that would almost be undeniable to the practitioner they he/she performed TK?
<br />

<br />
(Edited for an unneeded assumption)

You've so obvioulsy broken the rules that I don't even have to rant about it to prove my point. It's just too obvious.

P.S. Chris, how much do you want to bet that he's going to take my post and put some sort of personal attack into it? LoL
<br />

<br />
Edit: Here's a better analogy.
<br />

<br />
Fighting in movies can be easily faked. So easy, that they do it all the time on WWE.
<br />

<br />
Does that make fighting fake, by your fucked up reasoning?
<br />

<br />
I bet you... 5 dollars.

			nice analogy... even after this fucking cactus jack lands on barbed wire, his face all cut up and shit, he can STILL fight? Can you say &quot;blackout due to loss of blood?&quot;  ya... if the WWE is proof for, or even aganst fake fighting, then it lost on both ends. because that shit is faked.. and horribly faked at that.

			Rofl, and your bullshit claim on me not researching topics in depth, then quoting me saying &quot;BTW: It falls off&quot;
<br />

<br />
isn't unresearched.
<br />

<br />
There's a 16 and a half minute video by me, up here, somewhere.
<br />

<br />
Go find it, kid.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I don't care about what you say, I only took the discussion here because I could not rightly continue it in the proper thread that it belonged in. You locked it because you want to censor discussion. Meh. Lets see if you censor it here.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Chris said to move the discussion to another thread.
<br />

<br />
You did not move the discussion to another thread.
<br />

<br />
Chris locked the topic.
<br />

<br />
It's simple, see, this 'using your brain' thing.
<br />

<br />
You don't have to be so stuck up, you know.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Because censors wanted to move the discussion here and not keep it in the rightful place. I didn't want to have to move it here either but meh. &quot;
<br />

<br />
Because mods wanted to move the discussion where it was applicable, and keep it away from the wrong forum, dumbass.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Only when others have attacked me first. Then again, I haven't really attacked anyone. If I state the truth about someone when they are being immature, or are wrong, then this is not an attack, yet people here seem to think it is. That's their problem, not mine.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Pfft, stating the truth with insults is attacking someone, dumbass.
<br />

<br />
Oh wait, look right there. That's an attack. See it? Good, now learn.
<br />

<br />
&quot;&quot;(Oh, and to save you the trouble of all that clicking and page hopping, Kief, I'm 19. I'm just nice like that And yes that makes me a &quot;kid&quot; by your standards. Proud of it too.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
No, that makes you an adult. 
<br />

<br />
Which means you should know better (yet, it appears you don't...)&quot;
<br />

<br />
See, this is a PRIME example of how to be a stereotyper.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Only for mattz and apollo. Their continued nonsense and insults were on the level of a 14 year old's. And my estimate was correct, they are just immature kids. 
<br />

<br />
If I wanted to do that for the lot of you I would, and I imagine I would find the same thing with those others like you who continue to pseudo-attack me and what I say, wrongly claiming I am being insulting. 
<br />

<br />
Funny, I bet that those who agree with me, and there are quite a few of you out there, are older.&quot;
<br />

<br />
And wait, lemme guess, the have the exact same opinions as you on everything else? Oh, no WONDER they'd agree with you on this.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;&quot;What I don't understand is how someone can be so close-minded.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
About what? You apparently do not know anything about my position. 
<br />

<br />
What I don't understand is how someone can be so gullible and willing to decieve themselves. &quot;
<br />

<br />
What I don't understand is why you love personal attacks so much.
<br />

<br />
Hm, proving your videos are fake?
<br />

<br />
First of all, I can see the string. Second, when you 'pull' it towards you, it doesn't roll, as it does in the other movies. An obvious case of FAKING. Third, it slides along, in a 'dragged', rather than 'pushed' manner. It's obvious, because you can see it bump around a bit.
<br />

<br />
I could quote every single post of yours and point out EVERY rule violation you'd have, but I'd end up quintuple posting, therefore beating the current record for spam yet.

			What proof do you need kief? Do you need them to fly to your f'ing house and spin a psiwheel under a glass right in front of your face? Even though you would still find something about it that supposedly proves it wrong. Go to the topic called &quot;NI needs to see this, and so do you&quot; and go to page, I think its either 2 or 3. Theres a psiwheel on there thats basically everything proof, do you need to see somebody to spin that right in front of your face?

<br />
&quot;isn't unresearched.&quot;

Yes it is, my videos prove you entirely incorrect. 
<br />

<br />
You simply cannot accept it so you ignore the evidence. Too bad it's still there proving you wrong.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;There's a 16 and a half minute video by me, up here, somewhere. 
<br />

<br />
It is up to you to prove your own claims kid. Go find it yourself. You got nothing and you know it. 
<br />

<br />
My videos not only prove you wrong but a liar as well. Your video shows nothing except that you can fake pinwheel videos like everyone else.

<br />
&quot;Chris said to move the discussion to another thread.&quot;

I don't care. The proper thread for the discussion was where it already was.

No, it was in the right forum. There was nothing wrong with the discussion, certain mods simply wanted to censor the truth. If there was a problem with the thread, then it should have been moved here, not locked. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Pfft, stating the truth with insults is attacking someone, dumbass.
<br />
Oh wait, look right there. That's an attack. See it? Good, now learn.&quot;
<br />

<br />
But I didn't insult or attack. Stating you are an immature liar is mere truth, proven through the discourse of these threads. It is not an insult labeling you what you are. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;See, this is a PRIME example of how to be a stereotyper.&quot;
<br />

<br />
No, it is legal fact. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;What I don't understand is why you love personal attacks so much.&quot;

No, you love personal attacks. But it is hilarious of you to try and lie about me continually.

<br />

<br />
The string in what video? I posted a whole bunch, moving numerous objects in numerous fashion. You don't even know what your talking about, because you can't see any string in any videos. 
<br />

<br />
And I can see the exact same things in every other video. Apollo's videos are ridiculously fake. Rolling around is not indicative of anything genuine, it's an effect caused by pulling on the string or blowing on the object. Nothing in any video anyone has posted here looks in any way genuine. Objects look pushed or pulled by nothing but natural tricks. 
<br />

&quot;Even though you would still find something about it that supposedly proves it wrong. Go to the topic called &quot;NI needs to see this, and so do you&quot; and go to page, I think its either 2 or 3. Theres a psiwheel on there thats basically everything proof, do you need to see somebody to spin that right in front of your face?&quot;
<br />

<br />
A pinwheel moving is proof of nothing, except for one's desire to be self-deluded. 
<br />

<br />
There is no proof of any pinwheel videos in that thread. I can move a pinwheel in front of someone's face too without any apparent trickery. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;I'm not saying if you would accept video proof, but if one were to set up a controlled Psi-wheel experiment, what would be what you would want to see out of experiment that would almost be undeniable to the practitioner they he/she performed TK?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Agreeing to those assumptions for the sake of argument (though I normally wouldn't)...
<br />
From a pinwheel, nothing short of levitation. A pinwheel is so succeptable to outside forces acting upon it that no movement outside of lifting it off a surface is proof of anything paranormal. A heavy truck driving down the street could rumble the ground enough to make a pinwheel move in an abarrent way. Any number of factors can affect a pinwheel, which makes it useless for most purposes, including gauging any sort of paranormal ability.

			kief, your right.  all 12156+ of us are just making all of this up.  How could we ever fool you?
<br />

<br />
In case you missed it, <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=2062&amp;start=75" target="_blank" class="postlink">HERE</a> are all the rules <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> broke.  
<br />

<br />
&quot;HAHAHA yea sure whatever you say kid&quot;
<br />

<br />
Your just proving our point.  You <span style="font-style: italic">do</span> check the ages.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes it is, my videos prove you entirely incorrect.&quot;
<br />

<br />
No, you just prove what we said.  We know all videos can be faked.  To prove to us that you are bored, you make fake videos.  Hence, you prove our point.
<br />

<br />
&quot;No, it was in the right forum. There was nothing wrong with the discussion, certain mods simply wanted to censor the truth. If there was a problem with the thread, then it should have been moved here, not locked. &quot;
<br />

<br />
The thread was fine.  You were just poluting it with super long skeptisism replies.  That is why we have a skeptics part of the forum.  I tried to make you post in here but you didnt comply (you didnt even respond).  Skeptics' threads go in the skeptic forum.  Its not that hard of a concept to grasp.
<br />

<br />
&quot;And I can see the exact same things in every other video. Apollo's videos are ridiculously fake. Rolling around is not indicative of anything genuine, it's an effect caused by pulling on the string or blowing on the object. Nothing in any video anyone has posted here looks in any way genuine. Objects look pushed or pulled by nothing but natural tricks. &quot;
<br />

<br />
Show me proof that my videos are fake.  Dont go into &quot;oh, my videos <span style="font-style: italic">completely</span> proved yours fake because i can use a string!&quot;.  I was cold, hard proof.  I bet you that you will find none.  Do you think my goal in life is to sit around and create fake videos?  If so, look who actually did make fake videos (a lot of them) and who is continually argueing against us.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Take your flames elsewhere, cause you can't do jack and you know it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
yeah, take <span style="font-weight: bold">your</span> claims elsewhere where people will worship you.

			And here we have it again, folks!

<br />
Kief denies breaking rules again, then tries another personal attack xD
<br />

<br />
Hey, look, I can predict the future. Kief will respond with a personal attack about how I'm 15, and that he's ageist.
<br />

<br />
Ok, maybe he won't SAY he's ageist, but it's obviously inferred.

			I agree, Kief so ageist. I would love to see someone his age argue against his claims. Better still, one of his amazing and clever know it all scientist friends. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />
