			Hey guys <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" /> I need motivational help.It just clicked to me that i havent practiced in almost 2 weeks <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> .I dont seem to be motivated.I think it is because I still cant move anything besides the psiwheel and straw paper balancing on an edge. I am starting to lose hope.it seems pointless, like I cant do it and I never will.( I never thought i'd say that <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />)

			I have gone through this stage. I didn't practice for a week. But think about what you can do just with what you have now. It's not for just for conventional means. It's a phenomenom. Also, try making psiballs and progress with them, then you will feel that you can do more with pk. Gather psi daily. If you try out different techniques you will progress. The more you practice, the better you will become. I know it's a pain in the ass, but it's the only way. 
<br />
If you really don't want to, then fine, no one is forcing you to do it. Don't do it anymore if that's the case. To keep myself motivated, I day dream of what I can do with it and what I could do when I'm better. When, not if. Also, if you really hate some people, imagine what you could to to them if you were good enough.

			Let me ask you a few things. First, why did you decide on trying PK? If you say, &quot;Because it looks cool&quot; or &quot;Because the ladies dig it&quot;, those aren't very strong reasons. Anything can look cool, and the ladies vary in what they dig. Ask yourself why you chose to practice PK; to discover and learn more about yourself? Maybe to learn more about what you are capable of? In order to have motivation, it needs to be important and have meaning to you. Your motivation has dropped because you've hit a plateau, so to speak. But refocus on your goals, and realize that this is just a part of PK, like anything in life. Find a solid reason to be the foundation as to why you do PK. And when you still feel down and you lose hope, try this; what or who makes you the most happy in this world? A sport? A special someone? What or who can instantly brighten your mood from apathetic to emphatic and ready for challenges?
<br />

<br />
Also, come to the understanding that this happens, and that it's not all going to be as ideal as we all hope it to be. You lose hope because you can't move anything else? Well, you'll probably scream and want to kill me for saying this, but it's the truth that prevails time and time again; Just keep going, just keep practicing. You can't expect to get better by not pushing yourself. The thing to realize is that it's possible, but it's if you allow it to be so. I'll leave you with some quotes that help me when I start to lose motivation;
<br />

<br />
&quot;<span style="font-style: italic">Excellence is not a skill; it's an attitude</span>.&quot;
<br />
- Ralph Marston
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Success means having the courage, the determination, and the will to become the person you believe you were meant to be</span>.&quot;
<br />
-George Sheehan
<br />

<br />
&quot;<span style="font-style: italic">If the going seems easy, check if you're going backwards</span>!&quot;
<br />
- Author Unknown
<br />

<br />
&quot;<span style="font-style: italic">The most important question to ask on the job is not &quot;what am I getting?&quot; The most important question to ask is &quot;What am I becoming'</span>?&quot;
<br />
-Jim Rohn
<br />

<br />
&quot;<span style="font-style: italic">Perhaps I am stronger than I think</span>.&quot;
<br />
-Thomas Merton
<br />

<br />
So, there you have it. It's up to you as to what you will do. You can wallow in the hopless feelings, or you can gather yourself and meet the challenge waiting for you, because you may be able to delay a confronation, but you can never avoid it.
