			It is within the relms of possibility.
<br />

<br />
But concider, manipulating physical things requires TK, in this case blocking a physical blow. And being able to move things that are at a stand still and arent very heavy can be very difficult.
<br />

<br />
Stopping a blow that has a fair bit of force behind it would require a massive amount of tallent with PK.
<br />

<br />
My advice, buff up and take some martial arts lessons. It will take a while but will still be quicker than learning the TK involved to stop punches. Learning TK at that level (assuming you have average potential for TK) would take years.

Do you mean stops the punches or attacks, do you mean doing away with the pain that gets inflicted? Maybe get the person to back down from physical attacks.
<br />

<br />
A little more description could help get an accurate answer.

			I don't think a shield could be possible to do that, it would take some extreme Psychokinesis to acheive the stopping of a punch since if they are punching to attack you it wont be lacking in force and power. From what i've read the shield can be compared to an energy shield (which...well it sort of is), Psi is the energy, the energy deflects the energy, but the energy does not deflect the kinetic (Corporeal, tangable things like fists). It would take extreme focus and prowess in Macro-PK to pull off what your impling.

			i dont use a shield in a fight, but when i was on camp i had no sleeping bag (coz i gave it to a girl i liked, long story) and i was very cold, so i used a shield to reflect my body heat back to me. the camp guy said i should of experienced a mild moderate form of hypothemia but everything turned out alright.

			Hybrid constructs variously known as &quot;tk shields&quot;, &quot;force bubbles&quot;, and such can indeed defend against physical impact, such as a punch.  I wouldn't consider it an efficient method of defence against that sort of thing, however.  Conventional dodging, deflecting, and/or blocking methods are generally easier.

			Don't force bubbles shatter? If so, wouldn't it be a bit like a glass shield? Sure, it might protect you from weaker blows, but if it shatters, then you may get injured by a sharp piece of it.

Yes this works but I do not know if it is because of shielding or because i was very cold and numb when i tried it.

Again, it would take massive amounts of PK like a lot of other people said.

Exactly.  For example, you can put up a cloaking shield to have an attacker glance over you... would you consider that protection?  I would.  Do you mean a strong enough shield so that when they try and hit you, their fist deflects off of it?  I have no clue.  It might be possible, but I think it's a little far fetched.  I think it's more productive think about things that are closer to our grasp.  While it might be possible to deflect punches with a shield, the reality of the situation is that very few people have the ability to deflect just a wad of paper <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.  So start much smaller.

			I'd assume it would be easier to redirect the attack by giving it a little nudge to the side, but it would still be hard to apply enough force to actually make it miss.  Still better than deflecting it entirely, but I haven't actually tried this myself, so I'd just go with another form of protection.

			this is fun. my friend and i have been playing with this for one or two years.
<br />
i don't know about doing it with TK but you could telepathically short circut them.  the main hard part is staying calm enough to project it clearly and powerfully.  i've known a kung fu teacher that although he said it had to do with chi and stuff, was probably similar to telepathyic projection. he would tell a person to hit him as hard as they could, but for some reason when you go to throw the punch your muscles don't work right and you end up hitting him very softly.

			I see a way to combine aikido and psi...I like it. Couldn't you have the shield reach out touch them as soon as they threw the punch? I've heard psi moves almost instantly and if you could program it so that the second somebody attacked, it focused on them, perhaps hit them in the face in a dense form or something, and distracted them. Like an atemi in aikido... It wouldn't have to be that strong, all it would have to be is tangible, but the more force the better. Becuase if you've ever tried to hit somebody and had something you didn't expect happens first, it kind of ruins the punch (unless you're REALLY focused, most people aren't)  I hope this isn't too close to combat, but it is defensive...
