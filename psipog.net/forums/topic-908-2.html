			I remember having had one or two lucid dreams. The most memorable one lasted about five seconds; in the dream, I was running and all of the sudden i realized that i was dreaming and it was truly amasing how real everything became. Unfortunatly my line of sight in the dream seemed to be comming from my lower chest rather than the &quot;eyes&quot; that I had in the dream. My arms were swinging about a foot above my line of sight and my legs seemed like they were almost hitting me in the face (I did mention that I was running right?)

			I tried it last night and was in it for a bit but do you know what happens to me....well I realise I'm lucid but than in half a second I forget again and as events occur I'm totally gone.
<br />

<br />
When I have a LD I try to feel out for my body (its inevitable) and I wake up....its fucking annoying.

			I'm going to try lucid dreaming tonight. Hopefully I don't just fall asleep. I absolutely hate it when that happens. Maybe lucid dreaming will help me relax for once and let my imagination live.

			Thanks for the help JoeT!

I know progress varies between people...but how long on &quot;average&quot; would it take for WILD to succeed? Like if a person practiced every night not taking into account psi experience
