			On your main page, you spelt 'controbutions' incorrectly, its spelt contributions.

<br />
And why waste your time making a website that is obviously noobish, whats even worse is that you take Articles from other websites then put them on your own page...The point?

By the way, visit my website <a href="http://www.DrMax.piczo.com" target="_blank" class="postlink">www.DrMax.piczo.com</a>

If you decide to cross that fine line, you will be banned. Posting one topic on your site is good enough. Posting two topics is really pushing it. Posting 18 of the same freaking message will get your threads deleted, and you banned. 
<br />

<br />
Another great way to get banned is to say that I recommended something when I didn't. Putting false words in my mouth is a great way to get my attention, and motivate me to ban you.

If they didn't find PsiPog, then they probably won't find your site. BTW, it's OK to be a referral site for a while until you get your own shit. STAG was referral for over a year. Then I published my Free Particle Theory on it, and now we're a sizable, unique site, with original information on our pages.
<br />

<br />
BTW, check out the &quot;Particle Theory&quot; thread in the Modern Sciences forum. I'd like as much positive feedback as possible. If you contribute, give me your real name, along with your problem AND solution regarding part of the theory, and I'll factor it in, naming you as a secondary contributor.

			Most of the time, I think responses like Joe's are a bit over the top.  This time, however, I'd say he's being very polite.

<span style="font-weight: bold">You have stolen the Pendling article.</span>  Saying &quot;May all credit be given to the writer&quot; at the beginning of the article is NOT giving credit.  Where is the author's name?  I can give it to you.  I can even give you the date.  I also know that you did not receive permission to use this article.
<br />

<br />
Your site has a box on the front page stating &quot;Please don't post art online without giving credit to the artist.  Support your favorite artist by respecting their copyright!&quot;  You are immensely hypocritical.  I was quiet at first because people can make mistakes.  However, you are not making a mistake.
