I know Question 1 and 3 seem to be the same so...question 1 is like when you started to research.

			1)  I natural empathic and precog ability from as early as I can remember, which is about age 3.

2)  I figured out that others couldn?t do what I could at about age 6, I guess.(though it could have been later)
<br />
3) The first time I would say I ?used? psi was around age 14, when I started making psi-balls and stuff.  I don?t think of my childhood empathic and precog abilities as ?using? psi, as it came naturally to me and I didn?t realy put any effort into it.

			1: You started to pick up on psi.

Officially: 12.

Unofficially: 7.

2: You figured you could do things others couldn't.

6-8. Unsure about exact.

3:You first knowingly used psi.

<br />
I think I've 'silent jinx'd' people before during sports games, while being present at them.
<br />
If that counts, about 7-9.
<br />
If, first being coming to terms with psi and knowing more about it and what it is, and knowingly tried to do it (as with blindly forcing people to fail), then 12/13

You're stuck in the abyss!

I voted for 15 cause I'm turning 15 in less than a month, and this vote will be in effect for longer AFTER my 15th birthday than before.
<br />

<br />
I think under 14 should be interpreted as 14 or under.

			1) I started researching psi when I was 8 I think. Various books of my grandmother's mostly.
<br />
2) Around age five.
<br />
3) Well, when I was a baby, I &quot;sort of&quot; actively used psi. I wanted to see the video camera on the stand, so I brought it over to me with PK. Good thing with that, is there's proof on video =P. First time I actively used psionics where I knew what I was doing was about age 5 or so. Up until then it was all passive.
