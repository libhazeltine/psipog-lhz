			ok, until i discovered this website, i've been calling the energy 'chi' or 'ki', which i believe now is basically the same thing. martial artists call it chi or ki, and being one, thats what i usually called it. but on to the main point. ok, me and a friend were sparring one time, no pads, just down in his basement. but the thing is, we had stayed up all night learning as much as we could about 'chi'. so we decided to try it on each other, seeing if we could perform some of the awesome techniques like making shields and energy balls. ok, so i notice him begin to ground to take in a bunch of energy at one time, and then he jumps into the air at me with a flying side kick, and at this time i'm like 'uh oh, do something'. and then something just snapped, i moved my hands, which had been gathering energy from grounding for some time now,  and slightly pushed in his direction. his foot never touched me. he fell right on the ground in front of me, and i said 'dude, what was that?!?!' it was like so much energy was coming out of my body at once to stop him, and it did! i hope i'm not the only one out there to have an experience like this, or i'll just sound like a fool, but i hope this is looked on as real, cause it's no joke, if you believe in it, you can achieve it, this i strongly believe. my goal is to figure out how i did that, how to control that much power, and teach it to those who want to learn. i'm not talking about simply knocking someone out of the air, if we could harness that energy behind it, we could seriously advance ourselves and our community of believers! we could perform so many other things with that much energy.

I also practice Martial Arts (Judo, Taekwondo, Ju-Jitsu, Nunchakudo)

			Yeah, for some reason psi seems able to increase strength and endurance in a certain body part.

Possibly the foot did hit you, but you didn't feel it through pain suppression (which occurs when manipulating psi in martial arts)

I study the martial arts, more than your average person- and I can tell you Qi and PSI are related, but not the same... PSI would be known as 'Jing' in martial arts terms.

No problem, I thought the same thing awhile back <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Related, but not the same... PSI may also be 'Shen'(spirit), but from the effects of it I've experienced personally, I'd say Jing is the better of the two of what it is.

Bone or blood washing technique? I prefer the 'blood washing' myself, I find the bone washing isn't as effective with me.
<br />

<br />
and please, don't tell me that book said, &quot;just focus on your chi really hard and compact it and then it's jing&quot;- if it is, you found the wrong book, my friend.

			Well, chi to me seems to be psi used in a certain way, i.e empowering your body. It seems that you were trying to use chi, but your mind used psi instead. Or jing. Whatever you want to call it, you seem to have used psychokinesis in an extremly powerful, or unusual way. You could have stopped him in mid-air physically using PK, if so he would have felt something either hitting him or holding him back. This generally requires a lot of practise and power, so it may be more likely that you somehow took away his kenetic energy instead, so that there was no momentum for him to keep going. If you felt more full of power afterwards, this may be the case.

			to cryodude, not sure about the technique it described, but i don't remember it saying anything about compacting chi into jing. what i remember is it saying that, through the development of your chi, that through practice it would eventually turn into jing.    and to sabscope, i was actually a bit drained after i did it, cause i remember taking like a long break after that, of course we were both really freaked out, so we just kinda stopped there for a while, lol
