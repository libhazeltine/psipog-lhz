			well, ive been building my pk and elementalism, so ive been meditating in hour to two hour sessions, a couple times a day (i have nothing else to do, my schedule is fairly empty) well, with these meditations, i forgot the feeling of hunger, since i came out of each one feeling so refreshed, it took me 33 hours of not eating to notice, also, ive been awake for quite some time, (its 5 am and i have not slept yet) because i have been so refreshed by my meditations
<br />

<br />
so my note to you
<br />
BECAREFUL
<br />
remember to eat and sleep, this might have some harmful effects on your body that you might not notice, so please, stay aware

			Or, if controlled consciously, can save the one who cooks alot of time and you can still be healthy and save. But only if you know what you're doing and if you are not forcing anything. If it comes automatically, like it happened with you, then I believe it is ok. You just weren't hungry because the quantity and quality of your meditations provided your body with energy, but you did not force your body not to eat, you just didn't feel the need anymore. If it comes automatically like this, I believe it can do you no harm, it will only do you good and your body will lose alot of toxins and become stronger, fitter and healthier.
<br />

<br />
I agree that you should not overdo anything. Forcing something is hardly ever beneficial. Though, When things come automatically to you, you should have no fear because it means that you are ready. Let things come, let things go, don't pull or push things away or towards yourself. When something comes on it's own, it means you can handle it.

			yea, i wasnt even hungry after the 33
<br />
but this isnt too harsh, people do fasts for a good month of just juices and water, so im sure ill be ok
<br />
but once my friends invited me to get food, the realization was quite a shocker
<br />
it was like wait, when was the last time i ate, oh, wow, i should probably do that

couldnt agree with you more

			Yeah, I'm kinda like that.  I'm almost NEVER hungry.  Dont really know how it happened, but it was after is started meditating too.  I barley eat at all, and i dont eat meat.  Everyonce and a while my stomach starts to hurt, then i know i need to eat something.  Todays meal....2 peices of toast and one boca burger, 2 dr peppers and a glass of milk.  It's usually less.  It's been like this for a year and many months so it cant be too bad.

   One month seems to be the limit that everyone reaches and gives up in. I'm wondering, do you actually do anything? Do you get off your chair and exercise? Why did you give up?

			One month of fasting is hardly proof of safety. Disciplined people can go for a month without food. Undisciplined people can go for a month without food with supervision from a highly trained, disciplined individual. Anyone with reasonable bodyfat and muscle can go a month without food and live.
<br />

<br />
However, what happens if you go longer than a month? Maybe three months? A year? Your body will be feasting on your organs to sustain itself.
<br />

<br />
I side with Dan. Do not proclaim expertise in something you are not trained in. People die from stupidity like yours.

this is my final reply
<br />
that month was done during school, yes, i did exercise during it, yes, there was much mental activity done during it, i maintained good grades while not eating, i stopped at one month for two reasons, first, there were about 4 family member's birthdays around that time and it is very awkward to refuse food at a birthday dinner, second, because one month is all that i felt necassary, i wanted to test myself, and that was the goal

   No, I'm not a doctor. I'm not making bullshit claims though. A quick search says that he only fasted for twentyone days sometime. Do you have anything longer?

			Hey guys...enough with the flames. While DanialH may not be particularly nice with his skepticism or enforcing of the rules, he is enforcing what the rules say. Also, while I actually agree with MartialArtist and the whole energy as a food idea, it isn't unreasonable to ask for proof of such an amazing feat. I remember reading a while back about a guy who went for sixty day increments eating virtually nothing. (He experimented with small portions of one food to study the effect) Sadly, I can't remember where I saw this, so I'm not presenting it as proof. 
<br />

<br />
Just remember, proof is a good thing to have for extraordinary claims.
