That's quite fine &quot;Randi&quot;. However, if people merely post stupid comments about how you should join the Web-Based chat program, how does that further your Debunking fantasies?

			Does it really matter if the man personally attacks you? If he did, and I'm not saying he did, then it would just say about his personal character reflecting on the organization as a whole.
<br />
Point 2, addressing Randi himself. I seem to recall an incident involving a representative from the Yellow Bamboo Society correctly proving an occult skill in labratory settings, and the organization not paying up. Care to shed some light on this?

			Hello James_Randi
<br />

<br />
On behalf of the PsiPog staff, I welcome you. I'm sure the majority of our members have heard of your infamous challenge towards the supernatural. There have been a fair amount of threads based on your challenge.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps you'll remember me, we've spoken before. As I've stated previously, I would be more than willing to participate in your challenge. If you've viewed the media section, you'll find some of my material using psychokinesis. I would be more than willing to participate in your challenge using psychokinesis as well as remote viewing. 
<br />

<br />
Although I would be more than willing to participate in your challenge based on testing psychokinesis, my main skill would be remote viewing. I am a professional technical remote viewer. I graduated from TRVU which is owned/operated by Psi Tech. I know you've heard of them. Which leads me to my next question, why didn't you take Psi Tech's challenge towards you? I've personally spoke with both Joni and Dane concerning your challenge and from what I've heard, it's not worth my time. 
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.psitech.net/news/tsl_090502.htm" target="_blank">http://www.psitech.net/news/tsl_090502.htm</a>
<br />

<br />
If you are indeed the real James Randi, I would like to hear from you. You can email me at <a href="#">JoeT@PsiPog.net</a>. If you're willing, I'd like to discuss what the testing will include and what I should expect. From there, I'll make the appropriate decision whether or not I'll participate.
<br />

<br />
I look forward to your response.
