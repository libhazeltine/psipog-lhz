			Just to stay on topic i own proof of master fighters using psi (or whatever you'd like to call it) when striking a blow. My father has an old video that shows some jujitsu, judo, sumo and a couple other fighting techniques and the trainning they go through and let me tell you, some of these guys are not normal...Someone said something in this post about breaking the tops off beer bottles without even tipping them over. Thats on the video (and they're actually still full) along with many other feats i strongly believe aren't even possible to achieve UNLESS the use of psi is incorporated (there are many others)...go ahead and try that one..doesn't seem too difficult but i bet you'll never do it

About a year ago I stopped tricking; I had been tricking for about 6 months. I could do a front, and back flip, double leg, butterfly twist and kick, 360 crescent, 540 kick, and a few other basic tricks. 
<br />

<br />
Now I'm conditioning to get myself back in the groove. I can't really do anything right now.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

what about the elementals? it's not easy to master the elementals and i dont understand why you would want to JUST practice the elementals anyway. you might as well just learn PK and apply that to whatever elements you happen to want to move at a certain time because if you wanted to use these skills to help you in a physical hand to hand combat fight, it's much more efficient to learn pk because you can do more with what's around you at the time.
<br />

<br />
learning just the elementals automatically puts restrictions on your power.

I've started writing an article about pyrokinesis (in turns of JUST heating things and not necessarily starting a fire.) and cryokinesis. Let's take water, it's a compound that is form as a polar covalent bond. That means that if if you send negative charges toward water as it runs down in an even stretch, the water will bend towards the negative charges because of it's positively charged polarity. 
<br />
So, if someone can learn to create static electricity and send them towards the water, then one would be able to 'bend' water. I don't know if this equals PK, but it's the closest explanation I have.
