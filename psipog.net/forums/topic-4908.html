			Does anyone else ever experience that they see a skill happen a little bit then they suddenly have a really great grasp on it, even if only temporarily? I know NI mentioned this in one of his pk articles I was just wondering if anybody has had this happen.

			Like, the first time I managed to get my psiwheel moving, I freaked out and leapt to the other side of the room...ok more of a slide along the floor on my butt really....I'm lucky I didn't get splinters....but all it took at that time was that first bit of movement and I was able to control it - from the other side of the room- to stop start change direction to do all but jump off the pin and fly around the room. It didnt last but I'm sure it was that first bit of movement that gave me the temporary uber skill.
<br />

<br />
See what I mean...?

			I think he's saying that he got it to move from across the room, and that he practically did everything <span style="font-weight: bold">but</span> make it fly around the room. I think what you're describing is fairly common. I have had and heard a lot about telekinetic bursts. In fact, thats usually how it works in sliding. Look at the TK vids. The objects jerk, then stop.

			mad hatters right, i could make it do everything but fly across the room...and slide it but i hadnt thought of that at the time more concerned with the anti laws of physics movement infront of me. it was cool.i thought it might be quite common, especially cause of NI's tk article,I was just wondering if anybody had an experience with it

			Well, think of it like this: Your brain knows how to do everyting all the time. Your conciousness doesent. When you finally tap into your sub-c, it all works flawlessly. But after enough stimulation, you disconnect, and it all turns off. Basically, once your in the zone, theres no stopping you, but after you fall out of it, its just another thing to work on.
