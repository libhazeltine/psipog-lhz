			A lot of people like to make splinter groups off of PsiPog, and while this in itself isn't bad, all too many of these lack a specific purpose, or they directly copy PsiPog's. I think that perhaps a few of these may be because people want to specifically help others on a smaller level (Although the majority are because of people looking to become Admins through the quickest way possible) A few of the people that start these groups are actually somewhat experienced. Now I know that at this point I'm down to about 2% of these groups, but this train of thought lead me to thinking that maybe PsiPog should have a section pertaining to Teachers/Students. Maybe there is a policy against this kind of thing on PsiPog, because otherwise I don't know why it hasn't happened. Maybe simply because there aren't enough teachers, or that it?s all text over the internet anyways. However there is a more personal level when communicating with an individual, and I think some people could benefit from that. That being said, this would have to be a pretty regulated thing, and it would be user beware. The basic idea goes like this:
<br />
1: Mentor posts qualifications in a sticky thread. (Again, we're taking them on faith, but the forum already goes by that)
<br />
2: Approval granted or denied by a moderator (Would likely be somebody rather advanced, or at least somebody who knows a lot about psionics)
<br />
3: If approved, the mentor starts a thread detailing what they're teaching, and how many pupils they will be accepting. Again in this topic, the mentor posts their qualifications. They may also post requirements for their course.
<br />
4: Students apply to the topic, giving their experience with psionics to give the person beginning the course some idea of who's where.
<br />
5: Mentor accepts or rejects until full.  
<br />
6: Course begins.
<br />

<br />
I was just thinking this could be a nice system for helping people if the particularly advanced psions feel generous with their time. Tell me what you think.

			I suppose that reaches the same end, but this is a little more regulated instead of just meeting somebody in chat. I don't know, I suppose in the long run it isn't too different, but I meant for people signing up for classes with a specific person based on their qualifacations and specs. Kind of like a directory.

			the main thing i wanted you to read was peebs' post.  Here is the important stuff (in bold):
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Peebrain wrote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Teaching people in an online class chatting system is very ineffective.  <span style="font-weight: bold">We hold seminars every once in a while, but even those only help maybe 100 people.  In comparison, my psi ball article gets around 114 reads PER DAY. </span> After a month, the one article has been read 3420 times.  It's much more effective to post the majority of the information in the form of articles, and then help people when they have questions about the articles.

There are a bunch of other reasons online classes aren't a good idea.  We ran telepathy classes a while back, and with only 10 students, we had <span style="font-weight: bold">a lot of schedule conflicts, lazy students, lazy teachers, and bad results overall</span>.  It's <span style="font-weight: bold">one of those thigns that sound great on paper, but actually DOING it is something else.</span>

			ah, spell it out for me eh? I just figured if you had an open system that wasn't quite as massive as a seminar and could be for more personal help and learning kind of thing. But yeah, It would probably be fairly hard to put into practice...but I still think it would be interesting.

			I generally like this idea. But agree that it has some trouble. The idea, not your plan though, Like Peebrain said about the ineffective thing...
<br />

<br />
But classes are still &quot;fun&quot; when everything goes good, and what people can learn from them. 3-4 years ago I took &quot;classes&quot; on Psi with another organization that had them, but no longer exists, and they greatly helped me out.
<br />

<br />
But, like was stated teaching through classes are ineffective... And I think I have a better proposition... PRACTICES. Everyone at Psipog has a lot of great information at their finger tips, it must only be APPLIED. Through practicing you learn the different feelings/sensations, and discuss possibilities. 
<br />

<br />
Not only that... But if you leave the practices OPEN then the people who are self-motivated (Ultimatly the ones who will succeed) will come and practice, and learn, while those who are not will simply stagnate and not grow.
<br />

<br />
Currently I am TRYING To keep my schedule with Telepathy practices, Only recently have I put up my efforts again in the Psipog chat room and #projection.
<br />

<br />
The numbers have never reached more than 8 people, out of a couple thousand that visit psipog. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.

			I, too, used to run classes.  
<br />

<br />
Those which were &quot;open to the public&quot; rarely had more than five or six people show up, in spite of prior notice in several communities.  These weren't spur-of-the-moment things.  60-90 minutes of class, in addition to an average of an hour's preparation, plus whatever effort and time it takes to post the resultant log, adds up after a while.  
<br />

<br />
By contrast, closed classes (ie, with prior registration, and no-one permitted to join after the first class started) ran thrice-weekly for anything from two months to two years or so.  These involved a pretty serious commitment from both the instructor (me) and the students.  I probably should have made some attempt to keep the students motivated, but I did not.  
<br />

<br />
In any case, for a combination of reasons, these classes were quite successful.  Learning to make constructs consistently can be easier when there are several people playing with them together.  If nothing else, psionic paintball is more interesting than making psi-shapes ad infinitum, and then squishing them again.  And, obviously, telepathy practice requires at least one other person.  For these things, though, organized practices outside of a class situation can be as effective.  Impromptu practices _can_ be, as long as you don't spend all your time figuring out what you're going to do and who's going first.
<br />

<br />
One-on-one tutoring, which I have also done, is very time-consuming and draining.  It's one thing if a student comes with a specific question, but that is the exception rather than the rule.  Usually, it is a case of spoon-feeding and &quot;making sure they practice&quot;.  In the latter case, it is a supreme waste of time for the &quot;instructor&quot;:  for the most part, a combination of a calendar with practice times jotted in, informal practices and chats, and a three-ring-binder with notes and print-outs of instructions will fill the same need, except for the &quot;pushing&quot; part.  
<br />

<br />
As for the pushing part, folks who need a &quot;reason&quot; to keep exercising/jogging/etc arrange times to meet with a friend regularly.  So, for example, arrange with an online aquaintance to both be online to practice at, say, ten in the evening your time on Wednesdays and Fridays, in a specified chatroom.
<br />

<br />
All that said, if you _have_ kept such practice arrangements for a few months, potential teachers are more likely to take you seriously, if you request tutelage.
