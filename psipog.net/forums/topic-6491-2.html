			Ninjistu is fucking fluff shit. They're all spiritual. Sure they probably can move silently and slit my throat before I could piss myself at the sight of them, but they couldn't fly if they wanted to or do any of the sort you speak of. It's bullshit. they're over hyped. That's how they survive. Most ninjas in the past didn't do much shit but dressed as peasents with modified peasent tools and killed their target, and only their target, then coward away.
<br />

<br />
Ninja's or ninjistu is nothing of the fucking mystic or anything. Their just a martial arts class with huge myth behind them.

And one more thing I wanted to ask you neveza....its just that you keep telling the people here not to respond to any freaks and why do you keep doing that ?I mean you yourself are saying abusive words like 'Fucking&quot;,'Shit&quot; etc .Well,even if there is only less moderation here,please behave yourself.No threat nor offence,but a request.I am just a peaceful psion.

			To think that ALL the mythic abilities of ninjas are fluff would be ignorant.  Sure most of the almost immaculate abilities of ninjas are mainly myth and misconception, bred by propaganda, trickery, and word of mouth.  Also most of the others are dynamic feats of concentration and mental ability.
<br />

<br />
Though, as to whether ninjas could perform feats such as those that were talked about in this discussion, I'd have to say it's very possible.  Keep in mind that a ninja's main goal is to gain mastery over their mind, body, and spirit.  Similar to the goals of everybody on this forum, they also aspired to gain psychic abilities.  
<br />

<br />
Other evidence towards this is as was stated in a previous discussion from  someone who practiced ninjitsu.  He stated that for his fifth dan test he had to &quot;sense&quot; the intent to kill, and therefore dodge the incoming attack.
<br />

<br />
And neveza it's good that you have a healthy skepticism, but beware the dangers of a closed-mind.  For those who don't flow with the winds of change, fall down.  Peace <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

Don't give me some wisdom bullshit. I fucking know this, I also fucking know that if you keep your mind too open you're going fall to ignorance. I have a filter. If I do not see this by experience or textbooks, history, or any other liable information, I'll keep a skeptic idea on it.

			I don't know anyone who is knowledgeable enough to lecture on Ninjutsu except for Soke Hatsumi and/or Stephen Hayes. 
<br />

<br />
Ninjutsu used to be my passion and I researched it's history for fun. The sensing of the intent of someone who is willing to harm you is called &quot;Force of the Killer&quot;. Students are often tested by sitting down while the teacher takes a wooden sword and holds it on top of his head in a ready thrusting position. At any point the teacher must maintain a constant desire to kill the student or the student has nothing to sense. Whenever the teacher desires he may thrust the sword down and hopefully the student sense and reacts quickly enough. It may seem like a ridiculous exercise because serious injury can occur but then the teacher will say that the real thing is required because that is what you are learning in Ninjutsu.
<br />

<br />
As for levitating and flying etc. It was doutable that active ninja would employ such a tactic because a majority of their study and practice was devoted to stealthily entering or perhaps faking identities to enter by the most simple means. A lot of the activity of the ninja were purely psychological such as maintaining positions and plans according to 5 elements and leaking information etc. But still there were several mystic arts attributed to the ninja, perhaps to the yamabushi and the sohei (mountain monks and warrior monks whom several stories and rumors circulated about their supernatural powers). The warrior classes of Japan are basically a very confusing study. 
<br />

<br />
What you have here is basically a rumor. Since the Ninja and Yamabushi were shrouded in mystery, mysticism and ignorance people were led to believe they could levitate, walk on water, transform into animals etc. Where in reality they were using handgliders, special boots to trasverse rivers and when people followed the footprints of a ninja they might seem to go both ways at once but this was only because he used a special walking technique or they might seem to turn into tiger's footprints but this was only because he domesticated a tiger at a certain point would ride it for the rest of the ride. So you see, samurai, and peasants made up such wild stories for amusement while samurai did so to escape punishment because who could kill a person that could transform into a tiger.
<br />

<br />
So basically what you have is just another rumor. Some rumors were reinforced by the fact that the sole dedication of a yambushi or shugenja was to develop spiritual powers through ascetic practice.

			Well,I agree with psifi.The tricks may be just illusion but the fact of concentrating the entire body weight is tru.Anyone who meditates long enough will be able to do those things.Let us take an example from our everyday life.When we work hard and really concentrate and put our whole on our work,we become succesfu in it.This is a general fact.When we achieve such a position,our mind works faster and we obtain more focus and awareness of our surroundings.Thus,we feel time moving slower than before.And,our actions become faster.We may not realize that,but that's actually what happens.Others might feel us faster and more capable than ever before.
<br />
This ability of doing things more fastly and with more capability is not the result of a hurry.It comes when we work hard.Or......meditate long enough.Thus,by meditating more,we gain focus,concentration,awareness and speed.And when we attain an even more advanced state of this,we can actually concentrate on our physical such as weight and can converge all the weight into a simple single point(external or internal).
<br />

<br />
This is the technique.And,flying is the supreme stage where we become totally weightless and we merge with the nature.This is actually a siddhi that MartialArtist has spoken before.You can find more info about these siddhis in <a href="http://www.swamij.com.I" target="_blank">www.swamij.com.I</a> think thats the address.Its really cool to read those stuff.
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
And a special message for neveza,intellectualls don't support stupids and  persons who are .....Well,I am not that stupid to say as you do. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I must apologize to anyone here who may be intent in their falsehoods before beginning...
<br />

<br />
 Neveza is correct. The ninja, shinoubi, are the assassin warrior class of feudal Japan. They were much like secret agents in the movies and could basically be characterized as a <span style="font-style: italic">wolf in sheep's clothing</span> type of group. They most definitely were skilled killers and were very stealthy, but their public image was totally hyped for the purpose of gaining a notoriety that might as well be mystical.
<br />
 As for the technique, that is also correct, to a point; it is called hing kung in cantonese, qing gong in mandarin, and it means the lightness skill/art of lightness. It contrasts with yin gong (art of hardness- you may have seen the video on TV of the chinese master being stabbed with a sword that just bends when it hits him. This is yin gong), and is developed entirely through physical dilligence.
<br />
 I see no connection between that technique and the ninja, who did use a similar technique borrowed from shaolin kung fu, but it was not mystical either. The training simply constisted of jumping with weights on out of a pit whose depth was increased regularly, along with the weight. This performed the function of increasing their unweighted jumping height, which was useful in the built-up architecture of Japan.
<br />
 There is little esoteric content to the true ninja practice, although challenging their public image is almost insulting to the Japanese culture. 
<br />

<br />
I hope this helped.
<br />
