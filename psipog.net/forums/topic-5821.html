			I am new at psychokinesis. I have tried to move pinwheel only a day now, but i cant understand does I move it or it is just a air or something. Is there any opportunitys to find out what makes it moving: me or something else? Or I have to just practise and see what comes. Maybe I feel some day something what tells me that is me what making this little paper to move.
<br />

<br />
Sorry for my maybe bad english, my mother language is estonian.

			Well, if you were asking the question of am I moving it or is it the wind, then you could try putting a small glass bowl over the top of the wheel and then move it. This can be hard for some people though because of mental blocks.
<br />

<br />
If you were asking whether or not you are simply moving the air to make the wheel move, or whether you are moving the wheel directly, it really doesn't matter. The wheel is moving anyway. You could always try investigating that though, so feel free.
<br />
You'll find that if you practice a lot and come onto moving larger things, you will see that it can't be the air since you would feel a light breeze.

			You need to control your enviroment. Learn what makes it move and what doesn't before trying to move it with your mind. Once you have that out of the way, the best way to get results is to know you can do it. There is no room for doubt in this skill. If you doubt, you will get no results. Once you have your enviroment controlled, everytime it moves, even if it's from some outer source, start convincing yourself that you were the one moving it. It will help you progress a lot faster. Try medtation aswell. Check out my thread on the topic. It'll give you a link to another on how to do it. It helps. Immensely.

			Sorry, to post in an old thread but I didn't want to create a new thread(something I'm sure the purists on this forum will agree with). 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I've just begun my PK practice again about a month ago... with no success unfortunately. But let me tell you of when I practiced about 4 years ago and my results. 
<br />

<br />
The way I did it was: I imagined that all the energy in my body would flow ( in waves) through it, through my hands into a psiwheel in front of me. I did no visualisation or connection (be-one-with-the-psiwheel vibes). I did this for about 3 minutes. Anyways, I decided to try to make it move with my mind but no success. But when I brought my fingers close to the psiwheel, the closest corner would move towards it closest finger. When I moved my finger around, the psiwheel would follow it.
<br />

<br />
I was surprised so I moved my hands away to observe the psiwheel more closely. I was even more suprised that when I moved my fingers closer this effect would still occur.
<br />

<br />
And a few things that I thought I might add:
<br />

<br />
1.The psiwheel was made out of tin foil.
<br />
2.My fingers did not touch the wheel.
<br />
3.All the windows and the curtains wee closed so thre was no wind and if thee was i would be able to see it.
<br />
4. It was not my breath as my mouth was closed.
<br />
5. I moved my finers slowly slowly so no wind was generated by them.
<br />

<br />
Well this is it. i think I might try this method again sometime. Just posted this so that the theory makers might have some material to work on, or anybody interested could read it.

			If it's wiggling then there's probably wind involved, when I spin the psiwheel it goes very smooth.

When I first placed my hand near the wheel after I had made it it did nothing. I mean before it moved on its own I was sometimes repositioning it or sometimes just touching it and it didn't move. So if there was static electricity then it would have been constantly moving.
<br />

<br />
And it was also summer and I did not have shoes on so, I do not see how much static electricity could have built up.

No, it was smooth. I'm not too sure whether the windows were open or not; but I do know that the curtains were closed and not moving so there was not any noticeable wind. 
<br />

<br />
And besides my hands were covering the psiwheel and they were not moving fast.

Did you try observing your psiwheel?
<br />
Grab a book, get some distance and if it still moves then there probably is wind involved.
