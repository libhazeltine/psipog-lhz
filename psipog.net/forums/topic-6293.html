			PK, Psychokinesis is what we call everything from TK to 'manipulating' things to heat or cool them. Thats ok I guess... But in my opinion miving a psiwheel or any other object uses or creates some sort of kenetic force or energy in order for this to happen. But to me it seems aparent if you were to controll electricity by pulling it out of the socket you would be using your energy in a difrent way, as in like a lightning rod or some sort of thing to create pull on the electricity or a 'circuit' for the energy. Also I think PK can be done as what some call 'pyrokinesis' like starting a fire by vibrating a candle wicks molecules or pushing the fire by pushing teh air around it with TK. But what if someone created fire not that way, but by using there energy itself as a fuele sorce instead of say the wick and candle wax or instead of lighterfuel ect... basicaly what im getting at is...
<br />

<br />
is it in anyway posible to use real Pyrokinesis and make a fire not by vibrating molecules but by using your psi to directly creat heat and sustain a fire by using psi energy as a fuel thus the fire would be floating and not on anything but the psions energy and completely controlable by the psion?
<br />

			They're still not sepparate skills because everything you described still falls under psychokinesis...controlling matter is the general definaition of psychokinesis and startingor stopping or drawing out any kind of matter with your mind is still psychokinesis. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			Psionics follow science. Fire doesn't just happen out of nowhere, a processes is a must. Virbration of the molecule is the only way. (At least, I'm only know of heat being produce from high vibration of molecules.)

thats exactly what were saying... you are keeping your mind closed to 'it has to be this'  well you can manipulate light... even if its not matter... and i know least about teh sciences behind fire then anythign else... but i dont think its a matter... the point is we arent talkign about 'manipulating matter' we knwo that falls under PK... thats liek saying you cant manipulate electricity since its an energy.. .so now you are saying that doesnt exist or that its not PK... you are answering the wrong question

edit: light is part matter part wave.. i.e. part photon(particle) part energy

I do not think it is possible because we do not know what psi is yet. We cannot create fire without any combustion material/chemical yet. (I've never heard of it being done.) Fire comes from the excitement of particles to a point until combustion happens. Theoretically, you would need to excite the &quot;psi particles&quot;, and keep them excited in order to maintain a fire. However, some think the sensation of psi is all in your head, others think its not even part of this &quot;reality plane&quot;, and some think it's simple energy. With so many unknowns it's impossible to come to a sure conclusion. 
<br />
It not being possible is just my opinion.
<br />

<br />
The rest of the posts are right about everything being PK with &quot;sub-classes&quot;, I guess you can call them.

Blade, seriously, use some fucking logic.

You say you can't manipulate light with psychokinesis....yet you can with a construct? It's all mind over matter. Hell, energy of psi might cause psychokinesis possible, not our mind alone.

Thats exactly the topic... like i said, you asnwered the wrong question, your the one off topic, i would know im the topic creator. The topic IS indeed that manipulating something BESIDES matter isnt PK... also its ben said a construct cant do anything if you cant do it...
