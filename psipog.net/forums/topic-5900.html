			NOTE : If you dont want to read this post, scroll to the bottom. Also, I know doing PK without hands is better, but I'm at the stage where I feel like I still need them. =)
<br />

<br />

<br />
After reading through all the articles multiple times, and about 1 month of practice, there's still one question left for me that hasn't really been explained.
<br />

<br />
I can move the psiwheel rather fast - in both directions - and I am just now recently having some control over the rolling. The question is this :
<br />

<br />
When using your hands, do you try to build up that &quot;pressure&quot; in your palms/fingers and try to direct it towards the object? The pressure could either be caused by concentrating too much on your hands and feeling the blood coursing through, or perhaps some sort of energy (psi). I'm leaning towards the former, although I can build up that feeling in my hand instantaneously.
<br />

<br />
This method seems limited in the fact that as you build the pressure, the object will sometimes come to a stop, or not move at all. The only other method I know of is just staring at it and waiting for it to move (sans pressure). Both have worked for me, but I would like some feedback. I dont feel comfortable with the latter method, because, when we were younger (and even as adults) we might've stared at an object and imagined it moving on its own. Why weren't we successful then? (assuming Pk is available to all of us at any age)
<br />

<br />
Sorry for the long post. I've hit a &quot;PK Block,&quot; and so require this wonderful community's help once again. =)
<br />

<br />
Summary : Is it better to build pressure in one's hands and direct it at the object, or passively stare at it with your hands near the object and hope it moves?

			its different for everybody.  i do both one day one works better then the other i dont know why but most of the time simply staring at an object doesnt do much for me.  one of the articles i believe from NI said theres a certain way to look at an object, not just by staring at it but stare at it in an observatory state, its inbetween, its hard to explain but the article has helped me a great deal.

			I use pressure but it's rather tiring, the passive methode doesn't work too good for me and if it does then it's weak.

			I use the energy direction method by Gonzo. This has always worked for me since the staring methods didn't do anything!

C'est exactement ca. I have the same thing happen to me as well.

Thanks for your input guys. I guess I'll just do grunt work for a few more weeks and find out which method works best for me.
