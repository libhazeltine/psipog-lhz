			I personaly would never belive a pyschic, mainly becouse I live in Serbia, and during 90s, there were hundreds of them here speaking all kind of stuff, and that was realy annoying.
<br />
They are forbiden now, but I still remember those times, and personaly think that almost everyone who wants to make money using his PSI skills is fraud....
<br />

<br />
And about girlfriend stuff....I'm 17, and I think that I met my soul mate and love of my life, and I think that there is no better person for me than her, but we broke up after 6 months, and it was hard time for me, but I got over it...live moves on, don't stop it becouse things like love, just enjoy and have fun, or it will end up too soon, and you will be wondering what you have wasted your life on at the end.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />
Just be positive and optimistic <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			&quot;Precognition is the prediction of a PROBABLE future. Our mind calculate all the factors and chooses the probable one.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I think so, too.
<br />

<br />
&quot;the future isn't fixed,&quot;
<br />

<br />
bullshit, the future is fixed, our thoughts on the future change, but history, past, present, and future, it's all written in stone. if I went back in time and stole some artifact, history would say that it disappeared until my present, that's not that hard to figure out, if I went back to 1943 I was already there in the present. duh. I don't see any reason the future would work differently.

			I also think that future isn't fixed, and thats why I don't belive future-telling
<br />

<br />
But I belvie our mind can analyse what could happend in dietals, so it looks like future-telling to us... <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
But there were some prophets like Nostradamus trough history, but most of them was telling stuff than can be understood in several ways... <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />
