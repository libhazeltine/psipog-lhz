			ok i found this on rotteneggs.com i'll copy and paste the paragraph here it is:This way is very hard, and needs alot of patience. Since you are trying to defy the laws of gravity here it has alot to do with physics. I asked my highschool physics teacher about it. and i found out there is such thing. Now when you want to do something your mind does what the body wants to do. In order to levitate you have to reverse that. you have to make your body do what the mind want, which is called mind over matter, in everyday life matter takes over the mind but a very few amount of people have the ability to reverse this effect. This is like trying to get to quit smoking but on a larger scale, your mind wants to stop but your body doesnt. 
<br />
now, i researched a little about this. what you need to do is when your hungry dont eat, when your tired dont sleep(of course dont kill yourself.)keep trying to oppose what your body wants with what your mind wants. Gradually over time keep making the challenge harder and harder, and im not making any promises but if you keep oposing your body with what your mind wants you can levitate off the ground. Bees have this control, if you ever look at a bee it seems as if its actually hovering, thats because its defying the law of gravity, bees are too heavy to fly with wings.
<br />

<br />

<br />
ok so this is the paragraph i copied and pasted........

			lol. just to be picky, bees fly by rotating their wings really REALLY quickly. a sort of psudo flapping. there's a couple of articles on it.
<br />

<br />
but, back to the mainstream, yeah. levitation can be possible with enough concentration i hope...;(
<br />

<br />
meh. in my experience, anything is possible.

			I know a large part of psionics is belief, but let me illustrate something, belief will not let you do everything, it can't be currently explained fully but that does not mean reason does not apply to psionics, energy concerns are still important (I like to think of the Force of a psionic activity is psi * focus/belief).
<br />

<br />
Let me crack the physics down for you on some things:
<br />

<br />
The mass of a pencil- 0.005 kg
<br />
The mass of a semi average human - 7.405 kg
<br />

<br />
Now to levitate a pencil you'd need greater than the force keeping it down by gravity, which would be F = mass * gravity. 0.005 * 9.8 = 0.049 N
<br />

<br />
Now to levitate a human:
<br />
F = mass * gravity
<br />
7.405 * 9.8 = 72.57 N
<br />

<br />
72.57 / 0.049 = 1481.0204
<br />

<br />
So you would be required to provide a force nearly 1500 times what you would need to levitate a pencil, and a pencil would be considered somewhat advanced tk.

			Forgot to mention that thanks for reminding me. I implied it but let me say directly, that's crap what they're saying, you are not defying the laws of physics, you are merely acting with a force that isn't defined yet. As far as we know psionics still plays by the rules, we just don't know how.

			Lol Plays by the rules??? What do you mean. I don't see psi being pulled down my gravity. I don't see it moving to a path of least resistance. It doesn't follow electricity OR a physical element to the universe. Hell its more like light. Yet we can move things with psi, but not with light. Psi DOESN&quot;T follow the rules. When was the last time you were in physics class and they stated that humans were able to levitate objects with their mind? And how many newtons of that takes. NEVER because we don't have a damn clue.

This is psi, not magic, it isn't some thing that just amazingly defies all reason, and for the point of what you said we can't be sure about 90% of that since we cannont detect psi our measure it, but as to the first thing you are wrong. When I was reading various things about force bubbles in the psipog articles, you can &quot;drop&quot; them on stuff and they'll fall, roll around, and affect stuff while doing so. And while we're on force bubbles there is also that it is a physical element of the universe, as it has to be in some extent to effect another physical element. And for the point of argument light is effected by gravity, but only on a collosal scale i.e. black hole.

They do that because you believe they do that. Psi does what we believe it does. We think that its a ball so it will roll. SOO it becomes a ball, and rolls...

Levitation would be in the realm of either Energy Manipulation or PK, depending on which method you would use to levitate.

(Note that that is just my opinion, I never tried levitation before.)
