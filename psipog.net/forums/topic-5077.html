			I was wondering if chakra manipulation is possible. I've been watching Naruto and reading the manga for a long time now. I'm not saying that if chakra manipulation is possible, I'm going to go around breathing fire or imprisoning people in water, but I would think that clones would be possible if you had enough focus. Another question would be is this possible to do with psi?

			I'm not sure if I'm correct but isn't chakra like seven different  energy things in your body like, &quot;Heart, Mind&quot; stuff like that? But if you're talking about Chakra as an energy, then it's all the same stuff. Just with different name.

1) Chakras are not real.
<br />
2) You cannot clone your body using psi no matter how hard you try. Nor with any other of these &quot;energy&quot; things

			Daniel, will you stop acting like you know everything.  How can you prove that Chakras aren't real.  Many, Many people believe in them.  What leads you to think they aren't real if you have psi (energy) running through your body?
<br />

<br />
By the way, I also don't believe it would be possible to clone yourself with chakras or psi.

   I don't act like or say that I know everything. What do you consider a chakra to be? I need to know. Why don't I believe in them? There's no reason to. I don't believe psi is running through my body much either.

			o well then mb.  I thought that since you were on this site, you beleived in psionics but I guess it is good to have some skeptics who are actually willing to listen.  Anyway, a Chakra is said to be an energy center.  They are SUPPOSEDLY going through out your body and too much or too little can cause discomfort to the person.  I believe that there are energy centers bt it is ok to have opposing veiws, I guess.

			See, I know that we have lots of nerves where chakras are. I believe that we can draw more energy from those points because (And only because) of all the nerves there. I do not believe they always have psi in them. I do not believe they really mean anything. I don't believe you can &quot;open&quot; them. So on and so on.

			Naruto is a fictional story, and hence is to not be taken too seriously.  I doubt that it would ever be possible to create a physical clone using psi, or chakra as they call it in Naruto, but I don?t see why it would not be possible to convince someone that they can see a ?clone? of you using tp projection.

But I would suggest steering clear of topics like this before this forums become filled with 11 year old anime fanboys wanting to know how to be as powerful as Itachi so they can pwn the lunch line bully.

The supposed &quot;chakras&quot; also correspond to several glands. I saw a list a while back, if I find it again I'll post it.

			My thought on clones:
<br />

<br />
Don't they say &quot;shadow clone&quot; or &quot;water clone&quot;? So why not try using some random object, such as water or even another object's shadow, and use the opposite of hedging (can't think of the word right now) on the object?
<br />

<br />
And to the answer of chakras:
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakras" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakras</a>
<br />

<br />
Chakras just explain, in different detail, the energy inside us that makes us tick. It's the same thing as the Big Bang and the Creation story- two different thoughts (although my examples are quite close) yet on the same subject.

			okay, on Naruto, they call the energy &quot;chakra&quot; and call the Chakra, Chakra Centers.
<br />

<br />
and... it's odd, many things ancient cultures believed are oddly similar to recent discoveries. for examples, the belief in the twin serpents. two serpents coiling together is like a double helix, which is the shape of DNA. and some believed that volcanoes had fire gods that fight each other, and the loser goes to the bottom of the sea, and of course, tectonic plates cause volcanoes to fall to the seafloor
<br />

<br />
&quot;It's the same thing as the Big Bang and the Creation story-&quot;

<br />
I think you'll find that the big bang has much more evidence than Creationism.

			I guess it depends, I highly doubt one can clone themselves. And as for what it's to be called,  different practices or karate, psionics and ect. have different names for it, certain chinese martial arts  calls energy &quot;Ki&quot;, others &quot;chakra&quot;, and in the case of psionics- &quot;Psi&quot;.

First of all, I didn't want to bring in religion, but you just did. I'm talking about two stories that are exactly the same but completed along different descriptions, regardless of evidence. That was an example, I wan't trying to prove anything. You tried to, and that's a no-no.
<br />

<br />
As for tectonic plates, that's still a theory, and isn't fully proven, FYI.

Actually I can actually FEEL a difference between chakra energy and psi. For me, psi feels like like icy cold water flowing through me or it just feels like pure heat (like sunlight hitting you;on a side note, someone told me that this means I have two types of psi energy which, according to him, must be attained somehow). What I can only assume is chakra, on the other hand, is only unleashed by itself in the right conditions and feels tingly and very intense (usually accompanied by intense emotions as well which is what seems to set it off in the first place). The major trigger for unleashing my own chakra so far is music that &quot;touches&quot; me spiritually/emotionally or whatever you want to call it. Apart from that my &quot;chakra&quot; only springs up randomly for reasons beyond my understanding. And the reason I think it is chakra is because it seems to radiate outwards like shock waves from the areas known as the chakra  centers. But I have a contradictory theory that chakra may just be extremely dense psi because I once felt a little tingly feeling as I was gathering psi between my hands once. So perhaps it was a high concentration of psi in a small area. It thats true just imagine how much psi must be in the chakra centers! When my own chakra is emitted it must be 20x more intense than the tingly feeling I got in my hand. Any way, back to the other area of discussion; I do not believe clones can be made with chakra (by normal means at least). If a clone were to be made it would have to be through advanced biokinesis or materialization (which I was told is made possible by the chakras). That's my opinion so by for now.
