			I don't know if any of you are sort of 'suffering' from the same problem I am right now with telepathy, but it's really bugging me.
<br />

<br />
I have gotten to the point where I can scan other people pretty easily. The thing is though, now when I think of someone or start talking to someone I will start to connect with the person and sort of scan them. It's really annoying because it's almost beyond my control. It's not a habit because I wouldn't make it a habit to scan people like that, but it's something that just happens automatically.
<br />

<br />
I have thought of the possibility that it's actually just empathy and that I should do some shielding, but I haven't had time to experiment. 
<br />

<br />
Ya but does anyone have any ideas on this or the same experiences?

			(IMO, telepathy and empathy are almost the exact same)....
<br />
Start with a shield. Hopefully it'll block all unwanted 'signals'.
<br />
Also, practice more. Create almost a sort of switch that you can flip at will to turn your scanning on/off.
<br />
Just a suggestion. 
<br />
After a while of doing the same thing over and over (as in practice) it becomes habit. Perhaps you've accidentally made your brain think that you want to scan people whenever you contact them, and so it does.
<br />
dunno..

			Ya I've noticed that I make connections with people very easily and when that happens I start to scan and stuff. 
<br />

<br />
I don't really like it just because that opens up ways for people to hack me and shit (because I make connections naturally and easily).
<br />

<br />

<br />
I'm not very good at programming though, that's why making shields is hard for me.

			Alright, I don't know what you mean by scanning, because there is about 7 different definitions for &quot;scanning&quot;. If you mean linking and picking up their thoughts, yeah, I do that all the time. I can do it better on accident than if I actually try, lol.

			Usually I do more just linking and picking up thoughts. Sometimes if I want to say something to them, I accidently ping them and stuff.

			I think that a desire to use your abilities and connect with others is part of being telepathic. I find sometimes that if i don't actively use my telepathy for a while, or I try to ignore it, it will come out when it wants to and I will end up projecting, or reading the thoughts of whoever is closest to me without realizing it. Or it comes out in my sleep.
<br />

<br />
Also... I always have a little bit of &quot;noise&quot; from other people's thoughts in the back of my head... its a kind of static or hum, sort of. Its hard to describe.... kind of like hearing a really crowded room of people talking all at once, but you are far enough  away so that its quieter and hard to understand any one person. I've gotten used to it, and I hardly notice it anymore. Shielding helps alot.
<br />

<br />
I would recomend reading the articles here on shielding, they're really good.

			You already knwo the answer to stop this before I even begin.
<br />

<br />
1.) Shield.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Now ending that. Sounds interesting. You've gotten rid of all conscious barriers and a certain telepathic skill has become subconscious. 
<br />

<br />
Good job. Seems just like some good development to me.
