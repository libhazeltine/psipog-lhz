			&quot;The XBox is not heavy at all! The only thing wrong that i see is the brick sized power adapter. If you have trouble picking it up, then you would have trouble picking up my school book.&quot;
<br />

<br />
360 isn't heavy, I was talking about X-box... the original one. If I were talking about 360 I would have said 360, X-Box weighs about 15 pounds, either that or my cousin's scale is messed up, or someone put a force bubble on his X-box.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I (and others) would rather have a comfortable controller than a very small, squished one. The controller is not very big and it feels good to hold. Size isnt everything.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The 360 controller is okay, I think the gamecube controller rocks though, X-box controller is enormous, and I have rather large hands, in inches:
<br />

<br />
length- 6 inch
<br />

<br />
width- 4 inch
<br />

<br />
depth- 1 inch
<br />

<br />
not that big hands I don't think, but still fairly large
<br />

<br />
 &quot;I see that you probably suggest Mac over Windows, eh? When you want a mac to shutdown, hit the save button.... The reason Windows has more viruses than Mac's (and yes, there are a few Mac viruses out there) is because Windows has been the leading PC and that is what virus programmers aim for. Soon, there will be just as many viruses for Mac.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Actually, yes, I do think mac is somewhat better, but Unix or linux is the best operating system by far, unfortunately my family wouldn't know what to do with linux, because you need programming skills to use it, hell I'm not even that great at programming
<br />

<br />
&quot;People dont have a want to learn programming. If all they want to do is type up something, they should not have to learn how to program.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
I don't know anyone who gets a computer just to type something, most people I know got one to get on the internet.

			thanks guys,

<br />
its just that revolution is optimized for standard definition tv's, where as the new xbox and playstation are both optimized for hdtv's.  i believe, although not sure, that when a company designs a game to be optimized, the have to go in and code a half done version so it works on standard definition tvs also.  if the companies developing for wii dont have to come in and code for both definitions, we can possibly see better(fun) games that <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> look better on the wii than than a ps3 on standard definition.  or, maybe ps3 or xbox 360 might look a <span style="font-style: italic">little</span> better, but, in my opinion, not worth the price difference.

			hey nintendo fans! This is an article from ign about the new Smash Bros. game:
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red">Nintendo just pulled a fast one on us. At an after-hours press briefing a mere minute ago, the company pulled another ace out of its sleeve: Super Smash Bros. Brawl -- the next installment in Nintendo's popular Super Smash Bros. series. 
<br />

<br />
Shigeru Miyamoto himself has confirmed the following playable characters: 
<br />

<br />
# Pit (Kid Icarus) 
<br />
# Solid Snake (Metal Gear Solid) 
<br />
# Zero Suit Samus (the blue &quot;no-suit&quot; Samus from Metroid: Zero Mission) 
<br />
# Metaknight (Kirby) 
<br />
# Wario (Wario) 
<br />

<br />
Under the direction of series creator Masahiro Sakurai, Super Smash Bros. Brawl will feature classic, GameCube-style combat -- not Wii-style motion-controlled combat. That means players who prefer to play the game with the traditional control setup can look forward to using the GameCube control-style they're already accustomed to. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;We found that trying to implement too much motion-sensory functionality can get in the way of the game. We're looking at keeping the control simple, as it has been,&quot; said Sakurai. &quot;The Wii hardware has sockets for the GameCube controller, too. So I'll just say now that you may not want to throw away your GCN controller yet.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
The game also features a range of new nasty toys, such as the ability to unleash a puppy from Nintendogs that will run up to the screen, put its paws up and obscure the view of the action. Mario, Kirby, Pikachu and Link have been confirmed as returning characters. Sakurai confirmed that Wario actually has a fart attack and that Solid Snake can use his trusty cardboard box. In the video trailer, Snake gets out of the box and says &quot;It's showtime!&quot; 
<br />

<br />
&quot;We thought a lot about what to do with Snake and his moves in Super Smash Bros. Brawl,&quot; said Sakurai. &quot;As you all know Snake walks around with a gun, but with Super Smash Bros. I didn't want to bring in a lot of real weapons. So that was a real challenge. But conversely, if we could use things like rocket launchers and other explosives, not only would that be fitting for Snake, but it would work for the other characters. But who knows. Maybe Snake will exclusively use explosives throughout the game.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Sakurai said the decision to include Solid Snake when Hideo Kojima himself practically &quot;begged&quot; to include the Metal Gear character in the last Smash Bros. game. When asked about the possibility of Sonic the Hedgehod appearing in the game as well, Shigeru Miyamoto said: &quot;There are probably possibilities for other third parties as well, and it maybe that even know there are corporate discussions going on about including some of these other characters.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Even better, the game will be fully online playable in addition to featuring a robust multiplayer mode. &quot;My plan is to include Wi-Fi connection compatibility and online functionality. One of the primary reasons Super Smash Bros. Brawl was created was that Nintendo, when taking Wii online, wanted to have Smash Bros. to do that,&quot; added Sakurai. 
<br />

<br />
The bad news is that Super Smash Bros. Brawl will no longer be a Wii launch title, but will instead be released in 2007.</span>
<br />

<br />

we were talking about XBox before, not 360, and since XBox sucks so much, I don't expect a lot from 360.
