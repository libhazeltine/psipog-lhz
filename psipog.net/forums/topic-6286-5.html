Okay, so rather than giving valid counterpoints because you obviously have none, you've decided to try to simply bully me and hoped that you can sway me with your sheer massive willpower?  Are you serious?

<br />
And frankly, while I normally avoid this because it's often seen as snobbish or elitist, I'm going to have to simply play the education card to give you a little perspective and humility.  Both of which you could use a healthy helping of.  So quite simply, what grade are you in? Grade 8?  10?  12?  How much education on the topic of 20th century history do you have?  Because from what I'm seeing, you haven't even taken a high school history class that focused at all on major world events (for example the Russian and Maoist Revolutions).

			hehe did anyone see the omen? i saw it over the weekend and it just popped back in seeing all the conflict this coused. I can't quote the movie but it said something like &quot;the devil child will derive from the river of blah blah&quot; and some eterperated it as that the evil kid would be born into polotics and i can see that wouldnt be too hard to believe after seeing what a simple question about polotics does to people.

I wish someone would just say &quot;this are my opinions...(insert opinions)....but i still fully respect and honor yours&quot; rather than trying to bring everyone to your side by senceless arquement

			Eldibs, please don't start with me again. I am not argueing for the last time. I am simply stating my opinion. Now stop shoving shit down my throat about how I'm argueing.

LightBringer isn't argueing with me. He's asking a stupid question like, What grade are you in? 9th?, just to back himself up. That's not what I call argueing.
<br />

So just remember, I'm not argueing. I'm stating basically a fact.

As far as Zemeon goes: Is it just me, or did this guy just pull a full 180 when his points got shot to shit?

I'm not going to say this again. Like I've told you, I don't need to prove that's it's a bad thing to a loser like you. I just don't need to waste my time doing that for you. I have one point. Not more, just one. So when you say the got shot to shit, you should be saying it got shot to shit. And it didn't anyway. You were only trying to prove me wrong. I'm not reading your long stupid posts. So you're basically argueing with yourself.

Stop doing this useless bantering. This all starting with me saying I thought communism was wrong. Then LightBringer insulted me. So don't go off defending yourself. Now go practice your shit psi that you do.

This is backing up your statement with the same statement. Actually, its basically just saying becuase I said so. Also, the whole point of a fact is that you don't need to have an opinion on it, it is fact, it is not to be challenged unless you can prove it is wrong with: more facts.
