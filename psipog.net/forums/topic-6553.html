			Today I woke up from a....bad dream. A dream about zombies and a mad cow and stick horse people....but that don't really matter it what happen when I was awake.
<br />

<br />
When I woke up...I lay there in bed...still and everything. I started to hear voices, of different tones and everything in my head. Each one talk about random things. One about a sweater or something and all that. For a moment I thought I was toying with myself seeing I was in a dream state still. But the thing is, I couldn't get them to stop. I forcus on emptying my thoughts but it didn't work. I tried some calming skills and other methods I use during meditation to maintain in control. But nothing worked. They still talked. It wasn't till I got up and move around that they gone away.
<br />

<br />
So I say to myself....am I going crazy here?

You are crazy, but not cause of the voices. A lot of people get them, and if you search for them on the forum, you will probably come up with a few things.

			I get that, and I hear it’s quite common.  My guess is that it’s a result of you still partially being in a dream state of mind, which you don’t completely leave until you initiate an action that forces you to fully awaken, getting up and waking around for example.

			I had that too. Then i figured out what it was. 
<br />
My mind. Not a state of mind, but my mind itself.
<br />
So just listen to the voices, because what you will hear
<br />
is yourself. You'll be amazed!!
<br />

<br />
Well...sometimes the voices i would hear were the voices of
<br />
others, but it depends on you, how much you have mastered you're
<br />
mind and it depends on the people around you.

When I talk to my subconscience it always different from this. And the dream that I had before I woke up with them voices don't really match it...However I will give it thought as I have with everything else.

I think it's thoughts that you might have suppressed that are trying to come up. Maybe its thoughts from other people entering your head. Do you recognize them?

			Well it's just thoughts, if it is memory or not. The point is that you thought them unconsciously, so you had no awareness that you even had them. But it still might be thoughts that are entering your head in the same moment, being unconsciously thoughts from other people sort of broadcasted and/or picked up by you unconsciously because of being very sensitive.
