			The test really dont work.  they are kinda nice, kinda.  Shows one part of the chakra pretty mediocre.  And, like in my case(personal reasons) the questions would be way thrown off, almost wouldn't apply to me at all.  So really just find someone who can see them, or feel them.
<br />

<br />
For over active or underactive chakras:  Google chakra healing.  Do reaserch on your own, make your own opinion/tech.
<br />

<br />
more reasons to beleive in chakras:
<br />

<br />
Even if they aren't real if you beleive they are, great way to heal yourself and your personality flaws.  Good for visualizing it(did i say this already?)
<br />

I'll think of more, just got back from band camp, my mind is tired.

I don't really feel very proud of this, since the test doesn't really seem that insightful on an energy level, it was very psychological. Although, I do seem much more powerful than the other me members in here.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

			Hello Arcadus,
<br />

<br />

<br />
(<span style="font-style: italic">Note: in this post, I am assuming that you believe in chakras in the first place. If you do not, then don't bother about what I say.</span>)
<br />

<br />
It has everything to do with energy. Because your personality is just a bunch of conditioned ways/patterns in which the energy moves. The way in which your personal energy expresses itself, is what we call personality. Everything = energy. So chakra's cannot have nothing to do with energy.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">How could we picture those chakras then?</span>
<br />
The way I see chakras, is like bridges. They funtion like a bridge. Like a porthole between the non-physical (unmanifested) reality, and the physical (manifested) reality. At the most fundamental non-physical level of existance, everything consist out of one energy.(http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/zero_point.shtml) 
<br />
Just picture this as one giant ocean of energy. All the same stuff. Now chakras are here to manifest this universal energy into different shapes and forms. Chakras form the unmanifested into manifested energy. That is why they function like a bridge. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">So why are there different chakras then?</span>
<br />
Well you got the lower chakras that have the lowest vibration, you got the middle chakras, and the higher chakras. Each chakra vibrates at a certain level of speed. Therefore each chakra manifests energy at a different level of reality, at a different vibrational level. The Lower chakras are more about the physical, dense and material manifestations, while the higher chakras have a much higher vibrational level and manifest the much subtler energies.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">So what do chakras have to do with your personality then? </span>
<br />
Well chakras manifest your personal energy and the way it expresses. If you open your chakras up more, it will influence the way you think, act and view the world. On the other hand, if you change the way you think, act and view the world, you also alter the state of your chakras. So you can choose to either open your chakras through meditation, and by that, alter the way you view the world, or, you can change the way you view the world, and by that, alter the state of your chakras. These two aspects of personal progression, are inseperatable. They walk hand in hand.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">And how do they relate to psi then?</span>
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">The way I see it</span>, they manifest and regulate the psi running through, and around your body. Like I said before different chakras manifest energy on different vibrational levels. That is why the third eye chakra is often mentioned when it comes to paranormal phenomena, because it is one of the highest chakras. These vibrations have a closer match with thought waves from other people (telepathy). But they also have the power to alter the Electro-Magnetic energy-fields of for example objects (Psychokinesis). So each chakra has it's own level in which it operates and manifests reality. In other words, they manifest and regulate/alter/influence energy at different levels. Therefore they manifest and regulate/alter/influence Psi. For as far as I am concerned, Psi is just that same energy.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Hope this answeres your questions and perhaps gives you a better view on chakras and the way they work according to me and many others.
<br />

<br />
It is actually pointless to give a link as a source to you, because there is tons of sources to what I just explained. Just type &quot;Chakras&quot;in google. But since it is expected from me to give some sources of what I say, here are some: 
<br />

			wow thanks heaps martial. my disbelief came from my belief that chakras only influence the kind of person you are. i knew that chakras had to do with energy as they are located around nerve clusters but i thought that in order to get the most out of them, i would need to drastically change myself (im not a very emotional guy, ive had problems iwht my mother and pretty much everyone i have loved has rejected me, so for me to say that i care about other people and am able to openly express my self is a lie), and even then, judging from the questions, i thought that it would only affect psi through my personality. for example how it is better to practice when ur excited. 
<br />

<br />
well thanks now ima-gonna-open em up! oh and reading your information, i think that the particular test is not a very effective tool. for example, what i am on the inside is much differrent than what i show to others, hence answering the questions will limit my results; i have a very very strong belief of psi and have never seen an type of psi manipulation as 'difficult', only needing greater understanding, such as people saying it is impossible to levitate/ very difficult to do it need to understand in order to control. do you agree?
<br />

<br />
PS im not trying to say that the test is crap, it is good but like i said, is limited because of the understanding of chakras. but anyways in only 17 and still doing HSC so i dont get that much effective time to practice so i dont really know much
