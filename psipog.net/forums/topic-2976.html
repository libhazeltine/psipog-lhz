			Spare time
<br />
I dont expect results while practicing at school, but it surely isnt wasted effort.
<br />
In house I train until I get really tired of it, then I rest few hours and try again. When I walk, I try to move trashes on ground etc.
<br />
Just everytime
<br />
I dont expect results, if I have to practice an amount of time, It just is how it is, I cannot change it, all I can do is not to whine how slow I learn.

			I've actually stopped...I've been training physically more then ever, never have time to do any psychokinesis or psi manipulation for that matter. My skills doesn't seem tarnished from it though, I can still slide objects, tried with a bent Glow Stick yesterday and it was nice, moved faster then normally.

			I don't have a set schedule, mainly because life is pretty hectic lately.
<br />
Generally I practice at night between 10:30-11:00pm for privacy, though that can flex and I will put in a bit of time when I have it at other times of day as well. Not as much as I'd like, but it'll do.

			i dont like practice in morning it is realy hot and get me nerves so i practice at good time when weather is good ( it is in night ) , because if you get disturbed by anything even the bad weather it will effect on your tk . 
<br />

<br />
if you looking at good time they say at night is good because tk is stronger ( i thought that night is better for strong tk before but morning or night all are same only take care from the disturbing things morning more disturbing - family,friends,phones,doors,noises -)  and try to practice when you feel comfortable and practice for 30 minutes .

The heat affects me too Ahmed1, I can do PK alot better in the winter or anytime when the temperature is below 80?. I also agree when you say that it is best to practice at night when there are less disturbances. Thanks for your input <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> </span>

			just recently i've been practicing aprox 3 hrs during the day, I haven't seen any difference on day versas night on pk abilities. However i'll frequently feel like i'm burning hot so I'll take a moment to think of myself in freezer which cools me right back down and back to practicing :O. Tend to practice in 30 min segments with 15 min breaks here and there.
