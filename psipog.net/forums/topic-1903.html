&quot;I think pantsparty would be in jail for just being so incredibly awesome.&quot;

All kidding aside, I think PantsParty will go to jail for being drunk in public.

Also, for the next person to post, I've already been to jail, though only for an hour or two (stupid rent-a-cop thought he was so cool arresting a minor for something he didn't do).

			I'm sorry, your mention of squeky clean just provoked me. *wolfy smirk*
<br />

<br />
Anyways I can already tell you how i'll be arrested.
<br />

<br />
I'll be arrested challanging the system for some injustice they are trying to pass, the system will label me automatically as wrong, or try to find any reason to arrest me after I take a stand and eventually frame and/or get something stupid on me, more then likely frame though.
<br />

<br />
But I want to see what ya'll think i'd be convicted of.

You asshole! Ditch my post and get yours commented on! Didn't you read the instructions on how to do this?

I think GreatWhiteNinja will go to jail for passing my post! Wait a second...unless...you were writing at the same time as me! Yes, then I finished first and you finished second so they got mixed up...well then someone other than GreatWhiteNinja can comment my jail-ness.
