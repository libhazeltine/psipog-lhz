			So you've possibly conjured up a psiball, but you're not really sure if you did it or not. So here's an easy way to test, program the ball to be magnetic and put it near you monitor. I just tried it out and got a little color distortion, that's proof that the ball exists.
<br />

<br />
You try it out whenever you're not sure. And remember kids, magnets are not good for you monitor so degauss often. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			That sounds interesting. I have started yesterday, so I am practising the basic stuff first, but when I am able to form a psi ball I will try it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			hmmmmmmmmmmmmm this makes nadnil think..... lets say we do make it magnetic, what if we could make the ball release some sort of electro magnetic pulse (Emp)? this could help prove psi excistance by knocking out electronic devices

			I got a better idea, Find a magnet, or some steal. See if it moves it in stead of scewing up your moniter.

			I'm pretty sure that the bigger, metal magnet would just yank the magnetic psiball out of your posession and if you don't know even if you made one, i'm pretty sure you don't realize if you just lost it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
And short term exposure to magnets doesn't do anything to a monitor. I used to have huge speakers, the speaker was 30cm in diameter, next to my monitor, the screen was purple all over and each time a lower frequency sound (base) was played, the screen flickered.
<br />

<br />
A quick degauss and everything was normal again.

			That was pretty sweet. The only other thing I've ever done to prove to me that I've made a ball was a tempture drop of about 7 degress C. And now my screen when I got near it had the monitor colors change. Sweetness.

			Hmm, I never knew something like this could be possible. I always tested my psiball by putting my fingers from my other hand into it and seeing if they got warm.
<br />

<br />
Next time I make one, I'll try to make it magnetic and test it on my monitor too. I've never made a magnetic psiball before though. Heck, I could barely make mine cold the one time I managed to do so.

			the only way i've ever tested a psi ball was to try and close my hands. if i felt some sort of resistance or pressure i would stop and think ok i just made one.
<br />

<br />
i guess this isnt a very good method if you're a noob because you can trick yourself and make yourself believe that there's resistance but there actually isnt. now all i do is sense it and its all good.

			Well yes, eventually you'll learn how to scan your surroundings for energy, and you'll just know when there's a construct near you.
<br />

<br />
Words of warning: If you scan around you and find constructs you didn't make, i'd advise to destroy them since it's not polite to spy on someone. If you're good, you can also find the creater of the construct and telepathically yell at him/her or something. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			The big problem i see with this is that people knew to psi manipulation probably wont be bale to make a psi ball magnetic.
