I'm not going to go into detail as I'm tired, but I just want to let everyone know that if you think PK will be useful to you in your life, go for it.

			Yeah, I find it hard to keep practicing TK just because I mostly do it in secret and I have 3 other people in the house most of the time.  They wanna know where I am all the time too so I usually wait until their gone.  Yeah, I agree that it's a &quot;useless&quot; skill, but I want to persay figure it out.  I know there are some really advance individuals on here.  If I ever get as advanced as them I might someday be able to teach it to others without fear of embarassment.  Good luck with your other practice though <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

This is a personal issue. But you forget that something doesn't have to be useful. I personally practice it because I like it. So it's not always 'best' to stop something when it's not useful in your life. I wish you luck with your further psionic developments.

			If you want to get personal on psionics I think they are almost all useless and retarted.  But, I happen to love psionics and most of all pk.  It just depends on how you look at it and how you plan to use it, obviouslly what you thought pk was for, was nothing so you gave up.  I happen to think of more useful things to do with pk and practice it because I like it.  Anything can be useful as long as you think about good uses for it.  Let's see, oh lame example, a stick... wow no way I could use that for something.  Hm, I could wack things with it and nock things over, or I could use it as a walking stick.  Everything is useful whether you like it or not.  Deal with it.

			Heh, I love the ignorance of people. Did you know that you can move people with telekinesis. Guess what...you can actually get people to do anything you want with telekinesis. It's even way more useful than telepathic suggetion. 
<br />

<br />
Next time, do some research before you talk. Telekinesis is not just moving objects. You can move much more than that.

			Well, PK is only useless until you get good. Until you get past sliding things across desks and you start making things float, <span style="font-style: italic">then</span> it's useful.
<br />

<br />
When you can make things levitate and move through the air, PK becomes useful. At this point, you can bring things to you that're physically out of reach. But if you're sliding pens across a desk, then it's pretty much useless unless you've got a BIG desk, and keep your pens out of reach. 
<br />

<br />
But hey, baby-talk is useless on its own too, right? And that's absolutely essential to learning how to talk, which is, in turn, essential to effective functioning in any society.

While I agree with this, your still thinking of PK as a way to move objects. That's only the tip of the ice berg. All these psionics sites display telekinesis as a way to move objects. While that's true, that's not the only thing. You can get people to do stuff way easier than telepathic suggestion.

			No offense, sure it could be possible and probably is ... I just well hmm forcing someone.. well pk is physical in a way so it would have to push them and what not.  Like tripping someone.  You'r not doing a good job convincing any of us that it is easy and or possible.

			Nor am I trying to convince you. See, where have you learned everything you learned about psychokinesis. The internet? Well, from wherever you learned it, I'm guessing that the only type of telekinesis that you were taught about was the moving of small objects right? Sure, that is one aspect of telekinesis, and is definetely the most popular/used part.
<br />

<br />
However, there are other uses of pk. And no, it's not physical. However, I'm not going to try to do anything to convince you. All I am saying is that it is not a useless skill if you delve into the deeper aspects of pk as opposed to just moving objects.

			Like I said, I'm not here to try to convince you. I understand that most psionic sites teach the aspect where you move objects. That's fine... But think, what is one of the most important laws when doing telekinesis. &quot;There is no such thing as seperation&quot; Right? We are all connected. Seperation is an allusion.
<br />

<br />
Now, that means that not only are we all connected to all objects, but we are also connected to all people. So, therefore, we should and can move things besides objects. However, since these people or organisms have consciousness, they are more difficult to influence, however it is possible.

Psychokinesis is mind over matter. If it's matter, you have the skills, you can manipulate it, in theory so far. Therefor, it's really all the same. No different from moving an object to making something combust.
<br />

<br />
Depending on what is useful and what isn't is all debatable, although I find DMILS of psychokinesis the most useful as healing is needed in many of our time.

I can't believe how ignorant you all are. You don't physically move people. You move them into action using thought vibrations assuming their on the same &quot;frequency&quot; as you. 
<br />

<br />
I know that most of you guys have only been taught that telekinesis is moving objects and that's it. That's the most popular form of tk and I'm glad you learned that. Go have fun practicing with your little ignorant minds moving small uninfluential objects and sitting there like idiots. 
<br />

<br />
Or, you can actually do somethign useful and learn more about some important and useful aspects of pk that you weren't taught about on other websites. Just becuse not many websites teach it, doesn't mean it's not true. 
<br />

<br />
Keep an open-mind.
