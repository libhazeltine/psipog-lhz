			This is a feeling that I've had before, but not lately.
<br />

<br />
  So, I'm in bed, right? I'm sort of drifting between awake and asleep.  Just relaxed.  My mind feels peaceful and dark.  Then, all of a sudden, it feels like my leg has slammed into something, like I've slammed back into my body.  It's extremely painful, and my head is buzzing.  But I eventually fall back asleep.
<br />

<br />
   I'm confused.  The last I've had this experience was maybe half a year ago.  I didn't even know about OBE's or lucid dreaming.  Anybody know what this could have been?

			yea this is kinda whats happened to me b4, ive actually had a dream where i was having a heart attack and it hurt like hell my chest felt like it was being crushed by knives. i woke up in sweat(which is weird im cold when i sleep) and my chest still pounding.
<br />

<br />
but thats probably not directly related to what you experienced. you werent in a dream i was, although i was actually lucid dreaming(ive discovered i am able to every  once in a while) but im sure theres some relation to pain in returning from a obe or ld, cuz im always in pain when i come from a lucid dream.

			I have had this happen to me a lot. I feel just like that, im trancing, then i snap back to reality. I slam on the bed, and feels as if someone has dropped me onto my bed, even though i am still covered up, but usually they are a horrible mess, and they are sideways on me or something. Either I was out of body, or i was levitating (i know, sounds like BS, but it felt just like it).
