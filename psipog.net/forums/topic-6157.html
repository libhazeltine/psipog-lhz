			Lol, well yesterday when I saw my dad get his laptop out, I watched him type his password in. I had no clue what his password was after I saw him, he types too damn fast. So then last night I dreamed the exact scenario that I saw. My dad got his lap top out and he type in his password. But this time, in my dream, the password wasn't all *'s it was actually letters. And when I woke up I wrote the letters down &quot;v-i-n-n-y-1&quot; heh thats our dog, vinny. Anyway just out of curiosity I asked him if that was his password....and it is. FREAKYYYY. I'm assuming my subconcious some how saw what he was typing and replaced the *'s with the letters. Lol.

			Of cource it saw it, but it gone to fast for you to see what happen for you know yourself. Your subconcious had the information but it didnt know itself as well, its when you demanded it and thought it through your own memories that it gave it to you.

			i wonder if you could learn to tap into your subconcious because this is my story....
<br />

<br />
i remember long ago this extremly lucid dream i had with chad michael murry. I was in a kind of prep school with the guy and the whole day i was flirting with him. Durring lunch he told me to meet in the bathroom so we did. By this time i saw alot of personality in the guy which is very rare for my dreams. He walked into the stall and i unzipped his pants and saw a short poem or something tattoo'd in the pubic hair region. Before i read it i looked up at him and smiled. He looked back down and smiled. I looked back down and just skimmed it as i was so eager to something else down there. right when i was leaning in a woke up and it was just one of those dreams that makes you look at your own life and wish you could go back to sleep.
<br />

<br />
sorry guy's i tried to keep it as G rated as i could. the thing is that i feel that that short paragraph had something very very meaning full written on it and i realy realy want to know what it said. I wish i cold re play that damb dream and not for personal pleasure if thats what you all think lmao

I know how you feel on some levels, when I wake up in the middle of the night when having a good dream, I just tell myself to contuine it and it happens. But dreams like this i wish I could contuine......glade you try to keep it G rated.
<br />

<br />
About little over a few weeks ago I gone through meditation. During this my own quote jump in my head (before I change it with to add simple turths). I heard many thoughts of my own...many emotions of my own....countless numbers of words and feelings jump through me. I tried to make my next action. But not a simple part of me could make a choice. All the voices questioned each others words...a dissicion could not be made. I felt the emotions behind each one of them, I felt each knowledge behind them. I was one with these thoughts,....but it started to hurt. So many thoughts jumping through my head, none of which could agree...I jump from happy to sad to anger every few seconds. My stomach and body started to hurt. 
<br />

<br />
My head started to hurt, I couldnt get myself to relax, many parts of me didnt want to relax, a after side wanted to find a new opinion. My body huddles itself on the chair while I contuined to battle myself. After a while I broke out, I contuined to lay down in pain. It was one heck of a experience, I gave it thought while I laid in pain. While I laid down I felt stronger, parts of me still thought as many, but not as many. I came to the solution that even the easist answers must hold the simple turths as there fountains....simple turths that are abosult....but simple turths are never that easy to find now are they?
<br />

<br />
I done a few more experments since then, but this one impact me the most in a while. As painful as it was, I must admit while I think on it now, I enjoy the power behind it.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
How do you think of one of my thoughts?
