			Have anybody read the article at :-
<br />
<a href="art-fire-and-ice.html6" target="_blank">art-fire-and-ice.html6</a> (if you don't read it you will have no idea what i'm talkin about)
<br />
It deals with subcon communicating but did anyone try it ??
<br />
i've tried it but i think i was just replyin myself,
<br />
 well here are some questions that i've asked my subcon and answers
<br />

<br />
Q:What is life ??
<br />
A:Some questions we ask ourselves without ever knowing it's answers
<br />
another, A:those little few centimeters between miles of hell and heaven
<br />

<br />
Q:What are women ??
<br />
A:it's a man heaven coming to him if he didn't just walk through it's hell
<br />

<br />
Q:what is Subconscious ??
<br />
A:it's somewhere between life and death
<br />

<br />
okay was that wise it's supposed to be wise , but maybe i've just made it up , I Don't know what is talkin is it subcon or just my mind ,And what makes it harder for me that usually think alot and have answers from myself,or maybe it was my subcon before i even beleif in it
<br />
so I'm really confused ,any help would be useful
<br />
by the way if you are goin to reply me just consider takin the poll ?? could anybody say answers like this (without the help of Mr. sub-con ofcourse  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> ) ??

<br />
In my opinion, an answer from your subconcious doesn't necessarily need to be wise. It is just an answer. When I spoke to my subconcious, I just knew that it was it speaking. So, what I am saying is this: when you are communicating with your subconcious, you will know it. I found it didn't exactly give you an answer, but more a <span style="font-style: italic">feeling</span>. This feeling I found was rather distinct from me just answering myself, while attempting to sound wise.

<br />
I had this whole thing on grammar typed out for you, but decided against posting it. :)

(I just made a psiball). Not everyone is a master at English and it's grammar.

<br />
And they seem like good and wise answers. Maybe you can try asking your sub-c some other questions, see the results.

Hmm...that answer &quot;Love cannot be taught, it must be lived&quot; sounds like a quote I heard from somewhere so no offense but I don't seem to believe you. 
<br />
As for the person who made this thread: I don't believe your were talking to your subconcious because a few of your answers had to do with the word &quot;Hell.&quot; I don't think the subconcious would repeat or even use that word. But hey, that is my opinion.

One must translate the Sub-conciounce message, so that's probably what he translated it into to.

			Q: Are these kids correctly talking to their subconscious?
<br />

<br />
A: Oh boy.  Well... yes and no.  The good news is that they're trying.  They'll get it eventually, so don't worry about helping them so much.  As long as they keep at it, they'll get the feel for it, like you did.  You didn't get it right away, did you?  Of course not.  So let them figure it out.

That's my subc's response to this thread.

			If you want to directly talk to your &quot;subconscious&quot;  (directly referring it to as you, subconcious, or any being just shapes your perception of it) 
<br />

<br />
Like when I asked my subconscious who are you when I first started it was
<br />
&quot;I am conscoiusness personified in a way to communicate with tho consciousness that makes I. I am i and you are I. we are one in the same we communicate with each. But at the same tiem we donot. In this way we are different, in this way we are the same. In this way drama is created. In this way turmoil is created. &quot;
<br />

<br />
But in anycase the mots effective way to do this without meditiation or any having to focus energy or doing anything hard is to
<br />

<br />
a.) Learn image streaming. Technique create by Win Wenger. Allows you to directly strema answers from your subconscious. 
<br />
Same technique is also included in the product &quot;Genius Code&quot; by Paul Scheele that can be found at learningstrategies.com or a torrented off the internet. 
<br />
Also can be learned from a book
<br />
also can be learned from his site
<br />

<br />
b.) Talk to your self in a lucid dream. Always a gansta conversation.

I dont think it would be a quote because i have never heard anything like that before. And yes neveza it was a translation like you said. There were other factors then just words making up that response.
