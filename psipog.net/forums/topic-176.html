			I have read of an interesting subject called 'Eyeless Sight', in the book &quot;Psychic Discoveries: Behind the Iron Curtain&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Now, the interesting thing about this so called &quot;eyeless sight&quot; is that you are able to read text by merely touching the paper they are printed on. It does not involve brail or physical contours of any kind. 
<br />

<br />
Has anyone ever given this one a shot? 
<br />

<br />
I think I might try to learn this skill.

			Can you do it to see colors/text and stuff that is flat on? Or to see contours on stuff? For example when I touch an object, a person face, or whatever when I have my eyes close I can easily get an image of what I'm feeling, as if I where looking at it it.

			What happens to me is that I see a bluish hue outline of an object and sometimes I see everything but it is all bluish. This can be what you see, or it cannot. But it sure is fun to walk with your eyes closed.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			I thought Bronnikov taught blind people to see by teaching them how to cure their own blindness -- for instance he showed them how to reduce the pressure behind their eyes.

			opening and stimulateing of the brow chakra, also known as third eye, can resualt in clarevoint sight, remote viewing, and astral sight. I have seen through closed eyelids before on several occasions. in two of them I also saw through my big cowboy hat while it was down over my eyes.

			I saw a documentary that had some guy that was able to see pictures perfectly by touching them... it seems that being able to see abject with touch has a name of itself but I dont remember it, he was completely blindfolded, that might have something to do with learning it.

			hey i heard about the same thing,  i was like hey thats kinda cool ill give that a whirl so for two weeks i would blind fold my self and try to do exercises like tell cards apart and walk around etc.  i would shower in pitch black to see if i could develop some sort of alternitive sight.  
<br />
(showering involved stuff like grabing soap and shampoo etc. without my eyes)
<br />
It seemed to yeild some sort of success but i could by no means see.  i came the the eventualy conclusion that the sucess was just me getting useto functioning without my eyes.  
<br />

<br />
hehe kind of a silly experiment but bronikovs method is expensive! haha

			One question I have for you SheepKing. Do you believe that it needs to involve you physically touching the object, in this case a book, that you are trying to read?

			That's a great question Yokusa and I really wish I had an answer.
<br />

<br />
I think a good way to answer that is to actually practice &quot;reading&quot; with eyes closed even if it's just telling the difference between colored paper. And then slowly increasing the distance between your hand and the object. 
<br />

<br />
Aside from that, I'm not sure if it is even possible to distinquish colors on paper/text on paper with just your hands. 
<br />

<br />

			I've tried this ability a couple of times.
<br />
My attempts were basically composed of me closing my eyes and trying to 'extend' my presence around me.  I could sort of make out objects and people, but I haven't tried anything further than that.

			I'm also able to do this. It's actually unbelievably easy (for me). All I really do is close my eyes and look at things. I can clearly tell people gestures they are making and logos and stuff, and even pick stuff up off the ground after I throw it (not meaning to brag or anything, just saying it's an awesome skill). I only recently realized that I was actually seeing, though; before I thought I had a very good spatial memory, but now I realize I can tell how things change as well...
<br />

<br />
Try just closing your eyes and drawing a card out of a deck. If you see it, say it out loud and check your accuracy. I'm practically 100% except for things like ad cards and Jokers, which I can't recognize with my eyes closed.
