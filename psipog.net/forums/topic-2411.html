			Greetings.
<br />

<br />
I've been writing about a burncast theory.
<br />

<br />
The premise:
<br />

<br />
Behavior of matter can be slightly altered and programmed by human will, touch, belief, etc.
<br />

<br />
Matter can then be burned, and the burning process releases the energy, but the program and the quantum entanglement still exist even after chemical reaction.
<br />

<br />
Origins:
<br />

<br />
When reading about certain spells requiring the burning of the spell-page/scroll and burning of candles, I began to wonder about the exact mechanics of the process.
<br />

<br />
Later practice:
<br />

<br />
Order of images, symbols and word upon page, then setting of rolled up page into oil lamp, then burning of page. [or just buring the page without oil/wax].
<br />

<br />
Theoretically--the page shares its program with the burning oil.
<br />

<br />
(and then, later on in the theory)
<br />
Herbs also have been added to the oil.
<br />
Flame set upon ZeroPointEnergy aluminum plate. [ZPE=qwn]
<br />

<br />
Etc.
<br />

<br />
This is a brief example of the burncast.
<br />
It's only been a few days for me but I've read about magick of all sorts, as well as trying to figure out quantum mechanics and psyonics in some ways.
<br />

<br />
I came here today looking for a few friends who could help me test my theory.
<br />

<br />
If you are able to sense or &quot;see&quot; energy clearly, or would just like to try it out--maybe we can talk more about burncasting.
<br />

<br />
Basically, try programming something like a candle, lamp or block of wood, then burn it and see what happens.
<br />

<br />
I suggest trying things like protection, purification and healing with this.
<br />
[Energy attacks: no attacks please].
<br />

<br />
Example of wordcast page program:
<br />

<br />
*Draw image of head on top center of page.
<br />
*Draw arrows pointing at it, and a start around it.
<br />
*Bottom center of page write words.
<br />
focus on the will of the even also, as you write.
<br />

<br />

<br />
(word order)
<br />
*Description of energy and code. (Description of the force that will be sent.)
<br />
*Direction of energy and code. (Target of spell.)
<br />
*Reason/logic of/for energy and code. (Motive of the energies action. Logic of why you cast the spell.)
<br />
*Event/process of energy and code. (What shall be done to something.)
<br />
*Effect of energy and code. (The effect of what was done to something.)
<br />
*Return. (Does the energy come back to you, or disburse itself?)
<br />

<br />
Example of words on page:
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">&quot;The force and the code
<br />
Of this energy.
<br />

<br />
Enter into my mind.
<br />

<br />
This energy wishes to inhance me.
<br />

<br />
I wish to become more pure, focused and balanced.
<br />
Give me insight and purity.
<br />

<br />
Amen.&quot;</span>
<br />

<br />
Okay, that's the basics.....
<br />
I hope I have been able to express myself properly.
<br />
Any comments?

			burncasting ey?
<br />

<br />
well might aswell give it a try, iv done something like this but with blood before.
<br />

<br />
to be honest im not quite sure about the point of it. surely you could just will it?
<br />

<br />
BUT
<br />

<br />
on the other hand, if you had a booklet of burncasts and then set the book on fire, that could be quite interesting....
<br />

<br />
add me on msn and we'll chat

			Nice Theory, I can see what your getting at but isnt it easier to disperse the energy yourself instead of relying on candles ?

			i use a similar theory for healing... and it works fairly well. look for a descrepency in their energy, and fix it.

<br />
There is more then 1 sort of blood.
<br />

<br />
The blood of a plant is what I prefer [chloriphil].
<br />
^ IMO, far easier to work with, still contains high amounts of organic energy.

I've added you to my msn, genjo.

			This makes me think of anchoring heavily. To relate to temerature, or how solid the object is, texture, etc; you can recreate the energy much more effectively afterwards. Do anything to relate to it, even if it's writing it down on a piece of paper everything about fire, emotions, feelings, and then burn it.
<br />
I'm not quite the alchemist person you are, I don't know anything about how there is useable energy in objects, plants, and anything else, for me I just sense the energy anywhere and everywhere, and I like to think I can use it infinitely and always.
<br />

<br />
Please correct me if i'm missing the point because my mind is still skeptical of quantum physics and zero point energy, maybe it's just a terminology problem -.-
