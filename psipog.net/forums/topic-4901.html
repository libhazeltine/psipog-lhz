			Since I remember, I can create a lot of unorganized soft energy, I believe its a stuff of what the psi-balls are created.
<br />
Its pleasant, warm, obeying, soft, like you'd close your eyes and let your hand in water full of primordial protoplasmatic beings. When I write this, it emanates from my hands or just from air, dances around my fingers and so on... Also I have no problem with sensitivity, I sense how the energy is but elastic, shapes are specific, softness is various on different parts, I think I sense it pretty exactly.
<br />
But what if I want real psi-balls, which would be solid enough to make someone sense them, maybe visible, cold, hot, programmable, and such advanced stuff.
<br />
Maybe my psi-energy would be better for making some constructs, like shields, because its very easy to shape it, even to very complicated shapes (a golf player on playground? no problem).
<br />
But I have an experience that people may be peevish because they sense a resistence of such psi-shield.
<br />

<br />
So... I have a lot of psi-energy substance, but quite useless and unorganized, when compared to guys interested in playing the magic wars, as I have read here. 
<br />
I'd wish to meet such person, because I have no template, how a real solid psi-ball should be like. Of course good guys can send me some, I hope it wouldn't be like a talking to wall.
<br />

<br />
Basically, I think I have problems with keeping the one psi-ball. I got loads of energy, so how to work with one, when all these clouds around are ready, wanting to be worked with as well? This creates a great mess, without a needed result, what is one, dense psi-ball.
<br />
Also, all that seems to be attracted by my body, I don't know if I have send a psi-construct to space, when I feel it. It may be a copy.
<br />
These are my thoughts after practising with some psi-games.
<br />
I think that after 18 years of playing with psi-energy, I should be more able, eh?

			You should probably be more able by now <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. But if you have had no &quot;Goal&quot; it would have just been a little game to make the sensations and what not.
<br />

<br />
Try mimicking physical objects as your template for something more substantial. For example:
<br />

<br />
If you want to form it into a ball, think of the shape of a tennis ball or softball (I like the smaller ones), and then think of a physical sensation you have experienced to give it that sensation. For example, if you run your hand under some warm water, memorize the feeling and impose it on the Psiball.
<br />

<br />
Same can be said for any feeling. It'll just take a little bit of practice, and creativity.

			I do the same thing that SheepKing said, it really helps relating and connecting to things like that. I tend to think of a balloon when I make a psiball because it has about the same feelings as one. When I think of putting my hands near a fire, my hands heat up, vice versa with touching ice.
