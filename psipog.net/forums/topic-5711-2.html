			lol wow Fakiti all I can do is laugh. I can't even tell if your serious or not. Please explain to my why cats differ from any other animal. And YES sloths sleep more than cats. Try up to 23 hours a day jackass. Cats up to 17-18 go look it up. And why would whiskers make energy channeling easier. THEY'RE FOR BALANCE!...you don't believe me go and cut a cats whiskers off and see what happens. There tail is the main source of balance but the whiskers assist in it. And how do you possibly know that cats meditate and sloths, or any other animal, doesn't=complete B.S

What does ancient Egypt have to do with cat meditation? Cat meditation is a survival tool. They wouldn't need to have to try to survive in ancient Egypt because they were worshipped. Everything was served to them on a gold platter </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

ummmmmmmm you don't understand what I meant.....I'm saying BECAUSE they were worshipped is why he would think they're special for some reason...and they're not.....it had nothing to do with survival. Wow you talk as if cat meditation was proven or something. I honestly can't believe people can be so naieve. They're brains are proven to not even have a conscience. It's all instinct. Yes they can learn but that has nothing to do with the matter. Like do you understand how small they're brains are. Why don't you go read some SCIENTIFIC FACTS. If you want to believe that cats got more power than you go right ahead but these ANIMALS got nothing on me.

Actually, they're mostly for feeling their way around in the dark. Also, since they're so sensitive, cats can feel minor airflow using their whiskers. So mainly, whiskers are for getting around when a cat can't see well. Which is almost never, unless it is absolutely pitch black. Not to mention, since the whiskers are just sticking out there, cats have easy access to air energy.

And why would I cut a cat's whiskers off? <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" />    You sick bastard.

I couldnt agree with anymore then I do now (maybe later). The whiskers are not for balance at all. Cats are explores, they use them whiskers to tell them if there body can fit right back out. Sort of like a grown on messureing tape on your body. Whiskers have a large sort of nerves in them so they can react to the pressure they give on things. I knew a cat who was able to join around balance and had his whiskers burn off (no one emitted of doing it.) but he had trouble fitting in places.
<br />

How about think before talking? You already made yourself look a little dull.

Once again whiskers are not for that. The tail is, so I completly agree with you. I surpose you could use whiskers in some sort of balanceing tool but the liquids in there ears sort of does that for that.

<br />
How often do you look at scientific facts? First off there are not a lot of FACTS are there. Most scientific studies are theories and are open to question. Even some FACTS and LAWS are open to question. 2nd of all you don't need to have a big brain to be smarter. The Neanderthal had a bigger brain then we did and were smaller then us on a average scale. They also had larger muscles and stronger bones. Funny how we won. Perhaps it was due to our larger numbers perhaps? Fate is bitter sweet.
<br />

<br />
Instinct? I often find the cats I play with have certain personalities. As kind and gentle I made each cat, each one only seems to hold certain actions. There all loveble but only a few like to lay in laps no manner how much I try to get the others to like it.

			I apologize for the whiskers thing, I know they are for searching as well, but i did read it in one of those BRI's bathroom reader books (which are supposed to be scientific facts) that they assist in balance also. 2nd having a miniscule brain doesn't help their case either. Thats fine if you guys want to believe cats have more power than you. They do not have more than me...I do not want to continue arguing over something so stupid so sorry if i offended anyone...buh bye  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

P.S i cannot remember where but I did read something that said cats (as well as almost all animals, if not all of them) have no conscience!  them laying in your lap and having different &quot;personalities&quot; makes no difference. Some are not comfortable in a humans lap, some are. get over it

Any of you who live with cats have probably seen them sit with eyes closed and their thought-processes fairly still.

There are many things aspiring psionicists can learn from cats.  This is one of them.  Focus is another.  Intent is yet another.  And, of course, napping is something at which cats excel.  Naps are good.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

			Cats are true Zen-masters. They are always fully in the here and now, without any thought form ( I assume?). At least, they have no rational and calculating thoughts that go like: &quot;What shall I do in ten minutes from now?&quot; They just have an intention or an instinct, and they execute it. They truly live the principle: &quot;Just do it&quot; all the time. Not just with tk <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> but they apply it to everything they do. They dont think about it, they just do it and are focussed and centered in the Now. Therefore, I would have voted for: &quot;when awake, cats meditate all the time.&quot; Unfortunately enough, I dont have any cats, and neither was that option available.

			Man Cats rule! Watch they hunt or just watch they prawl around. The control they have over their bodies is amazing. They can move so beautifully and gracefully. I find them really impressing animals. 
<br />

<br />
I can't understand derricktheone's statement to have more power than cats. What is the purpose of saying that. Do you want to proof anything to anyone by saying that? Why not just accept them as other living creatures like yourself living on the same planet in the same world. I find it scaring that humans always want to control their surroundings, living or not living.
<br />
Consider yourself just for a moment being the rat with which is made experiments in laboratories. Pumped up with drugs and then cut in pieces.
<br />

<br />
I can understand why Egyptians worshipped cats. When i watch them laying around and gazing with their beautiful eyes at their surroundings with a kind of arrogant glance sometimes they seem like kings (or queens) to me. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I find what MartialArtist says interesting, too. Cats live in the here and now, Humans do not. It seems like the only being that doesn't live in the here and now in nature is Man. These stupid thoughts will take humanity down one day.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I think cats meditate all the time on the day. I see no other possibility how they could be that cool.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

			Yes, cats are awesome. My cat used to nap with me when I was little (no sick jokes, plz) and pretty much just protect me from neighborhood dogs and crap. If I fell and got hurt, my cat would go get someone. Back when she was an indoor kitty, she could jump approximately 8 feet straight up onto our entertainment center and she could walk our banister on our stairs, which is like 7 feet off the ground and only about 3 inches wide. Plus it's really slick and smooth and polished and even rounded on the corners. Did she ever slip or fall? Nope.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />
