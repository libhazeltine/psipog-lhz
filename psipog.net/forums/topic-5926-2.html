			Eidolon, you don't have to focus to use psi. It's called geisting. No big deal, just learn to control your pk better by practicing. Or let off some steam by making a couple more psi balls than usual.

			That one chick, Nuna Kulgaria, whom the russians studied, had a heart attack during one of her PK sessions when she exibited significant anger. They tested her, and her blood pressure, and various other things rose to dangerous levels when exibiting PK in this fashion. The results may be interesting, but you don't want to hurt yourself, which you can easily do.

			Yeah, it's a thing called geisting, like psi_manipulator said. It happens when your emotions, consciously or subconsiously, start to interact with the portion of your brain used during energy manipulation. I actually used to do it quite a bit before I got my empathy under control. Shielding can be quite effective against geisting, so that would be my recommendation. Either way, it's not really hazardous excepting when you start to break things. Nothing to worry about.

			Geisting happens when you don't try to do PK at all. Geisting is usually completely out of someone's control, happening at random times. It's similar, but a little different.

			Ultima, geisting is characterized as any unintentional PK event, whether you have been practicing recently is irrelevant. If you do PK you can still geist, and it is normally caused by excessive emotion. Any form of random PK is considered geisting, whether the person is a practicing psion or not.

			What I meant was, it usually isn't categorized when you are trying to perform PK. What she experienced falls under the category of unfocused PK. Like, someone is practicing moving the psi-wheel, and a pencil next to it moves.
<br />

<br />
That is not categorized as geisting, as she was <span style="font-style: italic">trying</span> to expend psychokinetic force. Geisting would be more like, lets say you're watching television, no thoughts of PK on your mind, and your blinds violently shudder, or your alarm clock falls off your dresser. That is what I meant.

SunTzu : &quot;The phenomenon that you are referring to is the one of &quot;poltergeists&quot;. &quot;Poltergeisting&quot; is a phenomenon referred to around here as being any <span style="font-weight: bold">unintentional</span> use of psionics (for example, getting angry and having things move about the room). Most of the time, such events are harmless, but this is not always the case.&quot;

Well sorry but I still don't believe it.
<br />
My mother was into all kinds of new age stuff, it's hard for me to believe such things if I don't experience it myself.

			I think Nuna Kulgaria had her heart attack during an extreme trance state. It was said she slipped into a state of &quot;controlled anger&quot; which <span style="font-weight: bold">significantly </span>raised her heart beat and in turn, her breathing and blood pressure. I believe I've slipped into this state once before because their descriptions of the state could not have been more like what I experienced. If I was ever to have had a heart attack in my whole life, it would've been during this state. In an instant after 30 min of meditating my heart beat like it never has before, and it was truly scary how fast and hard it was pumping. It truly felt exactly like what you would think &quot;controlled anger&quot; to feel like. (Just so intensly focused) There couldn't be a better term for this. I'm only posting this because I believe it's what caused her heart attack and it's completely different from &quot;geisting&quot;. She was intentionally trying to perform PK in this state, and isn't geisting the unintentional use of PK? Also, I do not think geisting has anything to do with raising the blood pressure and any of the other affects stated.
<br />

<br />
P.S The state significantly raised my &quot;psi power&quot; for the time I was in it as well. I felt the energy all around me and the paper I was trying to levitate was curling and twisting like crazy, and also a spoon on the floor beside me bent. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> [/b]
