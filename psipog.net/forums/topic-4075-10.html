1. You subconcious wills the msucles in the eyes to change the way they reflect. Simple as that. 
<br />

<br />
2. Possible side effects here are permanant colour disfiguration.
<br />

<br />
3. Eye colour is determined through two things Pigmentation and muscles. Thats why you will notice at certain times of your life or day your eyes will be a different shade or what ever. This is because the muscles have relaxed or tightened changing the amount of light that goes through to your eyes to the retina then off to the brain. Bottom line here is that the colour is a result of mucles positioning themselves in such a way it reflects light. It happens naturally and thus, with practice you can will it.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I'd love to have rainbow eyes, and I don't think it's gay. Rainbow is the color of Greenpeace and ecologists: I don't know why the gays tried to take that label, but gay has always been pink. Anyway, I don't think you can have them red and orange, though. You'll manage to do from yellow to violet, but  people in the forum already said they couldn't do red, they got hurt. You won't be able to get white either: beware, white pupil is a sign of blindness. Beware of what you do with your eyes. I think pure green is the most rare eyecolour... Maybe extreme light brown, almost yellow, is too. I'd try with one of those, they are bound to be the most impressive.

Though first, I'll try to heal my short-sightedness.

			Well, as you could (barely) see from the picture of my eye, it used to be a somewhat rotten shade of grey/green.
<br />

<br />
On holiday, around 6 weeks ago, they went very grey, with a few slight patches of brown, tiny bits of blue too.
<br />

<br />
I woke up a week or two ago, look in the mirror, and they were the old shade of greyish green again, but with a ring on the outside on both eyes of the same colour, but darker.
<br />

<br />
Today, they're back to the original shade. Last night ,they were dark turqouise.
<br />

<br />
BUT STILL NOT VIOLET. Actually, they are. (wink, wink, psychologically speaking)

Your sub-c, i believe, controls the amount of melanin depending upon what you want your eyes to change to, so you dont have to know the amount of melanin you need, just what you want your eyes changed to.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

not necessarily true. your eye pigment is determined by what certain proteins and enzymes you have in your eye. proteins and enzymes are made through transcription and translation, so technically you are somewhat altering your genetic code. you're not altering your DNA, but you're using your DNA to create a genetic code that will code for the particular proteins and enzymes that will give you the eye colour you want

			No, Kenshin, it's not.
<br />

<br />
That's what's happening to me, right now. Very subtle shifts between blue, green or grey.
<br />

<br />
It's not good enough, I want this shade of violet.
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://img235.imageshack.us/img235/9459/eevioletps2.png" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />
There are times, when I think it's starting, incredibly slightly, barely noticably getting there. 
<br />
Then it goes back to grey, my new dominant eye colour since I've been doing this.
<br />

<br />
It's frustrating, if anyone has had success with this shade, private message me with any particulat tweaks to the exercise you made.
<br />

<br />
If this fails, I'm going for cyan eyes.
