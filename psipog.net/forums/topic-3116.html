			Why don't you try to sign yourself up for a scientific study? I'm new here, but from what i understand you are one of the best here when it comes to PK. Don't you think the scientific community would be thrilled to be able to study something like this? I think if you go to a local university, and get a chance to show your abilities to these people, they would be amazed and instantly want to learn more. This wouldn't be to get attention. This would be to further everyone's understanding of what is actually going on when a person perform's PK. 
<br />

<br />
I&quot;m not sure how you would go about doing this, but i assume you would call up the university and try to set up some appointment maybe? idk...i think it would be a cool opportunity.

			Yeah, if you became famous or summit, it would be hell. Everyone on the streets would ask you to move something. But it would be worth it though. That measn it may be taught in schools when it's been confirmed that it's not fake.

			Maybe it would have to be in secrecy... Maybe they would think PK is really creepy and dangerous to other humans and they would start an enormous PK hunt(like the witchhunting)... It could be possible, that they'd be too afraid to understand...

			i highly doubt there would be a witchhunt. this isn't the 1700s. Once it has been proven as a science fact, people wouldn't freak out about it. I just think it would be beneficial to everyone if science was able to study this throughly
