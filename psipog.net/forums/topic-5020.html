			Hey Everyone
<br />

<br />
I have a few questions about something...It's about your third eye (charka) I was reading about it at <a href="http://www.astralsociety.com" target="_blank">www.astralsociety.com</a> and people say that you should beable to use your 3rd eye to beable see hidden parts of the earth? I dont know what else they said but im just curious if you need to use your 3rd eye to do TK?
<br />

<br />
Also ive been trying TK for almost a week.. I'm wondering (because for some reason i just cant make a damn psi-wheel) What else i can use to begin with for TK.. I've done the candle Idea and had some interesting things happen..Ive also done a styrofoam cup with water and a piece of paper that i made sink on command--which I cant determine if it was TK that made it sink or was just a strange coincidence that it sunk on its own, but at the same time i was trying TK..
<br />

<br />
So i'm just looking for other, easy things besides a psi-wheel and a candle, that i can begin with...
<br />

<br />
I've had 2 dreams that I used TK in, and it was wicked..I'm a well experienced Lucid Dreamer and Have used TK in my dreams..Now my subconcious can do it in my dreams while I'am aware of it...So the next step is to make my subconcious do it in reality.....How do i do that?
<br />

<br />
Thanks
<br />

<br />

			You could try making the piece of paper move in all directions in the water, then sinking it... would be a very wierd coincidence.

You do not need to consciously use it. It is probable that you use your third eye alot whilde doing tk, so you use it anyway wether you consciously activate and use it, or just perform tk. You do not need to know much or even anything at all to perform tk or view the edges of the world. Chakras are just tools that make it possible, but you do not need to know anythign about them. Your intention and attention can make these chakras do whatever you want without you even knowing they exist. 
<br />

<br />
About TK in reality, it takes time for your mind to get accustomed to tk. So I would say: Keep on dreaming about it, as the experience will help your mind get used to the idea of TK. And keep practicing tk in the physical dimension also. Try making a psi-wheel again... it is not that difficult is it? Or if not, then balance a large straw on something round.
<br />

Goodluck,
