I'm not saying that psionics are entirely useless.  Most of the techniques that allegedly channel psi seem to have a very relaxing effect on the body.  It's a nice method of meditation and stress relief.

In my opinion quite the oppsite is true. Your beliefs, your experiences are very subjective.

A possible area this is happening is in the quantum that you refer to.

I'm just curious Pants....Have you ever read &quot;the holographic universe&quot;?...if so what did you think about it...if not I think you should because it has all kinds of info about quantam manipulation and says that it is true, to a degree...also johnny I don't believe reality is concrete...How can it be..do you not believe in ANY phenomena or &quot;supernatural&quot; occurances in the world. If you believe in ANY of them, that science cannot explain, and there is many as I'm sure you know then how can reality be concrete if we don't understand what's going on. In any situation where science had no explanation is where &quot;concrete reality&quot; really doesn't exist does it. Unless we know and understand EVERYTHING about reality how can you say it's concrete?
<br />

<br />
P.S I think the placebo effect would fall under this category would it not? People were not given anything to heal them yet because they believed they would heal, their minds cured everything themselves....Does science have a concrete explanation?

Huh?  So you're saying that the existance of paranormal or things we can not explain is evidence that reality is not concrete?  I don't see how.

Wikipedia:
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">How the placebo effect works</span>
<br />
There are three main hypotheses for how the placebo effect works, the subject-expectancy effect, conditioning and motivation.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Expectancy Effect</span>
<br />
The subject-expectancy effect attributes the placebo effect to conscious or unconscious manipulation by patients in reporting improvement. Hróbjartsson and Götzsche argued in their article, &quot;Most patients are polite and prone to please the investigators by reporting improvement, even when no improvement was felt.&quot; Subjective bias can also be unconscious, where the patient believes he is improving as a result of the attention and care he has received.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Conditioning</span>
<br />
Classical conditioning is a type of associative learning where the subject learns to associate a particular stimulus with a particular response. In this case the stimulant is the substance perceived as medicine but is the placebo, and the response is the relief of symptoms. It is difficult to tell the difference between conditioning and the expectancy effect when the outcome is subjective and reported by the patient. However, conditioning can result in measurable biological changes similar to the changes seen with the real treatment or drug. For example, studies showing that placebo treatments result in changes in brain function similar to the real drug are probably examples of conditioning resulting in objectively measurable results. (Sauro 2005, Wager 2004, Leuchter 2002)
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Motivation</span>
<br />
Motivational explanations of the placebo effect have typically considered the placebo effect to be an outcome of ones desire to feel better, reduce anxiety, or cooperate with an experimenter or health care professional (Price et al. 1999, Margo 1999). The motivational perspective is supported by recent research showing that nonconscious goals for cooperation can be satisfied by confirming expectations about a treatment (Geers et al. 2009).

			Ok, that's all fine but those are all just hypothesis's, are they not. So nothing has been proven? That means there's still no answer to it. Also, so you <span style="font-style: italic">are</span> saying that you do not believe in anything paranormal ever johnny?And to respond to your comment paraplayer; yes pretty much. Some occurances that aren't even defined as paranormal have happened all over which science had no explanation for. So, if science, and everything we can possibly think of, doesn't explain the occurance then we have no idea what's going on. That paranormal, or odd, or miracle occurance, is a part of reality, so if we don't understand it, we don't understand reality. Therefor; not concrete. But this only applies if you believe in ANY of such instances. If you do not believe in ANYTHING paranormal or that science cannot explain then this whole post should mean nothing to you.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Saying &quot;we do not understand reality therefore it is concrete&quot;  Is sort of self contradictory.  You can not say that it is concrete BECAUSE we do not understand it.  
<br />

<br />
That's like somebody looking at a videogame, with no prior programming knowledge and saying that a glitch in the game proves that it is not concrete.

Some occurances that aren't even defined as paranormal have happened all over which science had no explanation for. So, if science, and everything we can possibly think of, doesn't explain the occurance then we have no idea what's going on. That paranormal, or odd, or miracle occurance, is a part of reality, so if we don't understand it, we don't understand reality. Therefor; not concrete. But this only applies if you believe in ANY of such instances. If you do not believe in ANYTHING paranormal or that science cannot explain then this whole post should mean nothing to you.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /></span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">What I meant before was that often when science cannot explain a paranormal occurance, it's usually because there's something we don't know about the circumstances that led to the occurance, or we are told about the occurance secondhand from someone else

Believe me, I used to jump at the chance of finding out about something paranormal.  Until I witness such a thing for myself, I'll give science the benefit of the doubt.  And even after I witness such an event, I still won't jump to conclusions right away.

That's like somebody looking at a videogame, with no prior programming knowledge and saying that a glitch in the game proves that it is not concrete.

Ok read over my post. I said IT IS NOT concrete. And I'm thinking of concrete as, set. Like &quot;this is reality and this is how is works&quot;. Also, your analogy about the videogame makes no sense. If there's a glitch in the game, then no, it's not concrete. It has a glitch. It makes no difference whether you have past knowledge about it  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  .

adjective

1. constituting an actual thing or instance; real: a concrete proof of his sincerity.  
<br />

<br />
2. pertaining to or concerned with realities or actual instances rather than abstractions; particular (opposed to general): concrete ideas.  
<br />

<br />
3. representing or applied to an actual substance or thing, as opposed to an abstract quality: The words cat, water, and teacher are concrete, whereas the words truth, excellence, and adulthood are abstract.

<br />
Concrete means 100% proven/factual. This is how I view it. My points earlier explain my views on how A LOT of instances in &quot;reality&quot; are not proven nor factual. ( All the paranormal, miracles, coincedences, scientifically unexplainable events, etc. )

			I actually did read over your post, I messed up my own post.  Sorry abouts thats.
<br />

A glitch in a game does not mean it's not concrete.  The glitch follows set rules &quot;this is reality and this is how is works&quot;.  The glitch is part of the game it &quot;follows the rules&quot;.  If it didn't follow the rules/programming it wouldn't be there in the first place.
<br />

<br />
So let's say our world has a &quot;glitch&quot; (anything paranormal or unexplainable).  Just because you don't understand why it's there, doesn't mean it &quot;doesn't follow the rules&quot;.

			I see your point about the game. Although I don't think you can compare a game to real life only because we don't know the program/programar. It's much more complex and I believe that we don't really have set rules or a program to follow. If we did, we still don't know <span style="font-style: italic">what</span> the program of reality is supposed to be like or if it is supposed to have these &quot;gliches&quot; or not. I guess that's the main point I've been getting at. I just can't accept this as concrete, or true reality, because there's simply too much we don't understand or even have a grasp on yet.
