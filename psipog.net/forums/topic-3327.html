			hmm
<br />
my hands always start tingling with a little concentration
<br />

<br />
i once discovered that in the morning before googling around till I finally got here... didn't know about that huge &quot;psi-community&quot;
<br />

<br />
i woke up and wanted to get something from the table, but was too lazy to stand up, i reached out for it and jokingly (was sceptical that time) thought &quot;haha i wish i could do telekinesis&quot;... and my hands started tingling...
<br />

<br />
hmm, that also started a few days after trying self-hypnosis the first time...
<br />
I did it only a few times but somehow stopped; thinking it wouldn't help me as much as I've thought when first reading about it
<br />

<br />
maybe you have some tips what i could try doing then when i feel the tingling?

			I found the NEW energy system good for getting my various bodily parts tingling. Its very time consuming at first if you do it properly though. 
<br />

<br />
Sometimes I get a tingling in my forehead which increases until it feels like my forehead has opened up. It sounds quite freaky but feels really nice  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> That doesn't happen all that often though, its usually during a meditation.

			i hope i understood you PeBubble , hmm you can make psi wheel or you can call it paper on pin you can make it from paper or foil and foil is better because it is easyer to get moved and the easyer from 2 of them is the paper that is used for cleaning noses <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> sorry dont know how to write it <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> get thin layer of it and put it on pin and balance it and try to move it or spin it with your choosen method . here is the link to how to make psi wheel    <a href="../art-telekinesis-tips.html" target="_blank">art-telekinesis-tips.html</a>
<br />

<br />

<br />
Dakova , you said you found new energy system and it is good , is it the third eye or you mean other thing? tell me please.
<br />

<br />
about your tingling in forehead and its feel look like blood flow too or something digging making hole but as they said and better name to it is opening the third eye , that sound dont freak me <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> it happen to me alot even when i just think about psi it make me feel that feeling . i never felt that feeling before i do tk but when i start to train and do tk i start to feel that feeling at least 1 time perday and that feeling stay for minutes and more if i want it to stay and now i can feel it whenever i want . 
<br />

<br />
here are some methods to feel it when you want : 
<br />

<br />
1- put your index finger close to your third eye or forehead and look far at anything from your hand between your fingers. 
<br />

<br />
2- relax close your eyes or not as you like imagin that energy come and get colected in your third eye .
<br />

<br />
3- relax imagin that something like horn come out from the third eye .
<br />

<br />
for me now i can get that feeling without doing that methods <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> im expert in that thing now <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .

			i tried the psi-wheel, but not actively linking it to my hands... maybe i can establish a connection through my hands?
<br />
I'll try <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />
i think he meant the &quot;NEW&quot; system, because he used capitals?
<br />
the &quot;New Energy Ways&quot; by robert bruce i think? something with moving around your point-of-awareness to &quot;clean&quot; the energy-body, don't know how describe that now, i cannot remember, i once read a little bit about it...

			The NEW energy system deals with developing your whole energy body. You can work up to developing your third eye but I'm still working on my secondary energy centers at the moment. Theres lots of secondary energy centers in your legs and arms (especially feet and hands) which is why I thought it was relevant to this topic. You can find a webpage for the NEW energy system if you do a search for it (I'm not sure if its still on the web though) I didn't mean new literally its just what the systems called. Pebubble knows what I'm talking about  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
The sensation I get in my forehead feels like a flower opening up (Argh that sounds so fluffy but its the only way I can describe it) Theres also a pretty intense euphoric feeling that goes with it. Most of the time though I just get the usual pressure. I don't need any exercises to feel the pressure I can do it by just focusing on my forehead.
