			okay. I've been attempting to make psiballs for a few days now. I feel a slight repulsion between my hands. owever, when I move them closer together, imagining the psiball 'shrinking' (to densen it), the feeling disappears- until I move my hands apart. I don't really feel any tingling- it just feels a tiny bit like I'm about to get pins and needles. 
<br />

<br />
Could you please let me know what you reckon was happening and if I managed to make a psiball?

			So I have been on again off again practicing Psi Balls for about 8 months now, switching my focus to other things like Telekenisis. But when I make Psi balls, because i've been practicing so long the usually come right away at will, to me it feels like a magnetic force pushing out on my hands like when you put a positive and another positive magnet togeather. And I can usually create one in each hand, but I was wondering is it possible that my mind is just playing tricks on me, and that gravity is making the magnetic effect on my out streched hands? I could just use somones oppinion thanks.

			Well, this is my first time trying to make a Psi Ball, and the first thing I thought of was lightning. I cupped my hands and started to envision lightning slowly flowing into me and up my arms into my hands. I started to feel heat, but I thought this could just be my hands cupped together... then I started to feel a throbbing sensation... but it felt like it came from the cup in my hands, not from my hands themselves. After awhile my mind started to wander and when I stopped thinking of the energy, the throbbing went away. But after I started thinking about it again, the throbbing came back, but less intense because my mind was wondering. Was this a psiball or me controlling my psi?

			I've been making psiballs for about a week now, and I seem to be doing well. I get a slight tingling feeling when I make one, as well as possible slight thermal variations, but I've also noticed that when I position my hands as if I were holding one, I get the same slight tingling feeling even without me doing anything. I've also tried throwing it and going to the place I threw it to pick it up again, and I get the feeling again. I have high hopes that this is a psiball, but I'm still not entirely sure. Any help?

			5th day of hard training
<br />
While making psi balls I dont feel anything that I dont feel without doin it (or maybe with psiballs feelings are quite stronger)
<br />
I feel hot but I guess its just because of usual body temperature (checked temperature of hands with and without psiball, same)
<br />

<br />
Just when I slowly try to move my hand throught psi ball, I feel something pushing me away a little, like a thick air.
<br />

<br />
So, obvious question
<br />
Did I make one ?

			Ok im completely new at this and i have no idea what im doing, but whenever i make...well, try to make a psi ball, i can only feel a sort of pressure between my hands that repells my fingers ect. Am i imagining this or have i made a psi ball?
<br />

<br />
Also, my mind is very fuzzy-like when i try to vizualize stuff, does this affect how well i'm doing?
<br />

<br />

<br />
Edit: On another note, is it possible to make a visible psi ball? if so, how hard is it? would a newbie like me be able to make 1?
<br />

<br />
Edit#2: I am really excited to learn how to make a visible psi ball, and amaze all my friends at school <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Edit#3: Just now, i tried to include my senses in making a psi ball, smelling, hearing ect and it smelt like burning paper (which is what i wanted it to smell like, makes me think of heat and fire) but it only lasted a few seconds <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> this is so exciting
<br />

<br />
Edit#4: Now i truely believe i made 1 <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. i just made a small psiball with my eyes open, then i put my right hand into it and i could feel a force pushing it away, when my hand flew out, it was pulled back to the psi ball.  Awsome stuff!! i also felt heat.
<br />

<br />
Edit#5: Ok i just put my supposed &quot;psiball&quot; to the test of it actually being there, i tried to push over a pen, but it didnt work <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			Well, seems like you made one, doesnt matter if you push pen or not, you felt a psiball so it was there.
<br />

<br />
Its possible but hard to make visible psiball, you can do it, all you need is some luck. Just one of your psiballs may suddenly become visible. 
<br />
That makes showing off at school hard  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

Making visible psi-balls is possible.
<br />
but it takes alot of training and a bit luck.

			Well, I personally cant see anything against showing off, just as long as Im not intended to hunt someone. It motivates me better to think like &quot;one day I show them and they're gonna stop laughing&quot;. Maybe its because my parents laugh like hell each time they see me practicing.

I don't think it's wrong to show off with psi. More people will believe, more people will practise... And eventualy everyone would be able to heal and other things!
