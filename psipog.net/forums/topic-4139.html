			Well, most of you people know of Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty. It is impossible to know the exact location and velocity of any given object.
<br />

<br />
Here is what i'm thinking. Could it be that telekinesis is just us sensing the object so well that we get so close to knowing the exact location and velocity that the velocity, and therefore the location, changes? This theory probably has too many holes to be a valid theory, but I'd also like to see the general response to it.

			Thanks for posting this. Nice question.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />
Well, there is a common view that Heisenberg principle rules out such phenomenon as telekinesis and so on. Many people do not look inside the problem and think so. In fact it is more sophisticated than we can imagine. I wrote in one of the past topics:

This question touches quantum effects that enble &quot;sensing&quot; by one photos other in a galxy far, far away from it. This might be explained by quantum tunneling or something from that area because it enables the existense of <a href="http://physiker.cv.vc/art/phys/phys.php" target="_blank" class="postlink">&quot;multiple realities&quot;</a> or so-called &quot;many worlds of quantum physics&quot; like the Schroedinger's cat paradigme, as an exapmple.

			I am currently reading <span style="font-style: italic">The Elegant Universe</span> and I read about this topic just today.  There is a variable (h-bar) has something to do with the probability of subatomic particles being in a certain place at a certain time.  The effects this variable has on larger things is negligable due to the fact that it is so small.  Maybe psionics is the alteration of this and/or other variables which makes the probability of a much larger object's location/velocity higher.
<br />
Of course this is probably just a wild-ass guess.  However, I would recommend reading  <span style="font-style: italic">The Elegant Universe</span>.

			Wow...I would have never thought of the Uncertainty Principle in that manner.  Kudos for being creative.
<br />

<br />
However, because quantum mechanics has never been observed in the macro-world, I doubt that that is what's causing telekinesis...And I think your interpretation is wrong...Heisenburg's Principle is not about what actually *exists* but rather about lack of ability to totally perceive what actually exists.
<br />

<br />
If this existed in the macro-world, for instance, me knowing the TV's velocity would turn its location into a probability...which would mean...what?  five tv hallucinations floating around, i dunno...weirdness.

No.

For more reasons than I care to explain.

			The first question that should be asked when seriously looking into a theory is:  &quot;That's great, but how do I test it?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Without SOME form of experimentation that produces DETERMINED outcomes, not just satisfied mathematic equations, it will always be a theory and usually of no use except as arguing stock or at least inspiration and a springboard.
<br />

<br />
Ideas have to start somewhere and it's usually a theory, but progress is made in what is DONE; otherwise it just adds to the millions of other theories that already clutter the field.

			That's a bad fallacy that people use to explain time paradoxes. They say that if you traveled back in time and you tried to kill your grandfather you couldn't . Something would stop you from doing it because that's just the way it works. I don't like it.
