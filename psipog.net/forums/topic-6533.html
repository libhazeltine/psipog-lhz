			Hey,
<br />

<br />
I've been trying psionics for a while now. I've had little success in much manipulation of psi whatsoever, but I can pool it.
<br />

<br />
I feel it forming in my stomach, and my abs tense up like crazy, twitching and the like, impossible to me normally. I can feel a tension, which lets me KNOW that I'm doing something right, but I can't succeed in anything else. I try some of the early examples from the articles on the site, such as tracing a spiral on your hand, then trying to recreate that feeling, but no such luck.
<br />

<br />
So I'm asking, After you started to pool psi, what was the first experiment you went through with noticeable results?
<br />

<br />
I'm not expecting to fling a pencil around my room, or project thoughts into someone's mind, but I'm looking for a little help to lay down the first few bricks.
<br />

<br />
Thanks in advance,
<br />
Harber

			Well, I never actually went through and pooled the psi in my abs. I just went straight to <a href="../art-psiball-source.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">the old-fashioned psi ball</a>. It took me maybe four days to get results.

			<img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  I don't think that psiballs are very reliable. Only few people see immediate results. Using psi for healing was the best startoff method for me. When you get hurt(not bleeding) by a small object, focus on the spot that hurts. You can be readily aware of that spot because you feel it hurting, right? Push the energy in your body to that spot and the pain will end. That's how I learned to manipulate psi.

			Thanks. How do you suppose I go around that? Because I rarely get hurt, so do you suggest I just knuckle punch myself in the leg? Of course it's not very smart, but it's a method.

Um, no. Mabye you should start small. Heck I don't know. Flick yourself on the wrist or something. But don't like hurt yourself. Ok scratch that.
<br />

<br />
Try this at your own risk: Go out side in 60 or 50 degree weather without a coat on. Push the psi through your skin to warm yourself. I'm so good that I can do it in 30 degrees. this an easy trail and error technique. You will see results immediately. I started this Technique after the healing one.

			Well, ya.
<br />

<br />
I didn't mean to injure myself. I guess knuckle punch sounded worse than I meant it to. I just meant to say sticking your your middle knuckle, and giving a good wrap on the leg, so it hurts, but not enough to damage you.
<br />

<br />
But thanks for the advice, I'll try the weather one after I work a little on the healing. It'll work out well, here in Canada, it's not quite cold, but not quite warm, but enough to make you appreciate a coat.
