			Ok I have been observing some things aver the past month or two about psi OOBE's and ghosts and all that good stuff and have come up with a theorie relating to how this whole psi thing may work.
<br />

<br />
   I read an post by peebrain a while ago over OOBEs and he said that he was not able to make a psi ball while he was in his astral form. I also noticed in several other articles people becoming fatigued when they do to many psi related activities. This information leads me to think that psi is something that is generated by our physical bodies and not our spirits or whatever you might like to call them.
<br />

<br />
   For my second set of observations id like to mention an episode of ghost hunter that I was watching last night which I believe to be a very credible show. While investigating a room one of the taps people attempted to provoke a spirit to do something so they could try to capture some sort of evidence. The provoker soon after the prodding he commented several times on he was uncomforted with the area and that the temperature of the room was rapidly decreasing. He decided that this was enough and attempted to leave the room but as he was walking out he felt a burning sting near his left kidney. The camera man lifted up his shirt and you could see a pretty decent sized red mark on his back. this seemed to be some sort of energy discharge considering the comment on the heat and the red tone of the skin. On several other occasions it has been noted that when an entity is suspected to be present some of the equipment batteries are reported to be drained fairly quick. leads me to think that spirits manipulate the energy around them to accomplish what they want instead of energy that comes form within.
<br />

<br />
       So my theory is simply that in order to create a psi ball in your astral form you would need to create one from the energy surrounding you. Noting the battery drainage perhaps you could set a group of D batteries together and try to take the energy from them and see what you can do with it. 
<br />

<br />
   If anyone has any comments or experiences regarding this please don?t hesitate to reply I?m very curious.

			The ghost in my house learned TK at the same time as I did and the other day my friend came he told me the ghost was some kind of parasite (This friend was the one to show me truth about TK) We did telekinesis and we felt a counterpressure and we were both focusing on the same direction and movement.. he felt some aggressivity and related it to the ghost.  Your theory about it sounds very good. Maybe our bodies do generate the energy while sleeping, acting like a rechargeable battery or psiholder. Ghosts having no body should have to use other options to carry around psi. A Psiball that acts as a reserve of psi would work I guess.

			Perhaps we could learn to use psi booth ways and benifit our techniques from it. Makes me wonder.

			I haven't tried to make a psiball in a OBE.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  But what I can really do it's to change my shape and form, for example i can take the form of a wolf or make two wings grow from my back. The wings are really useful cause when i don't have it I can't fly high, I fall to the ground and keep flotating at 1 meter from it, its like jumping but not flying with the wings i can mantain myself higher at sky ( I know that wings are unuseful but i think they give me selfconfidence).
<br />
Anyway I think that in an OBE all the psionic abilities raises cause you aren't in the physicall world

			Where you're in an OBE you normally have your body as always but you don't have physic limitations cause you can fly right? Well then why don't you try to imagine that you have two big wings in your back? At first it can get hard to assimilate your new form and it's normal to change again into the human form if you're not concentrated into your new form but if you have &quot;practice&quot; in OBE it hasn't to be difficult  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> Hope it helps
