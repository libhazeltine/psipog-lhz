			The Human Energy Body- by ME
<br />

<br />
The Human body is very complex, as many of you know.  What most people do not know is that the Etheric body is just as complex.  Just as the physical body has veins organs and muscles, so does the Etheric body?and just as the physical body needs proper nutrition and exercise to work properly, so does the Etheric body.  
<br />

<br />
First lets explain the importance of developing the Etheric body.  Your body absorbs energy through sleep, sunlight, digesting, &amp; breathing.  Lets say the average person absorbs 100 units of energy a day.  This energy is normally left alone, so its allowed to surplus.  Through out their life they have built a surplus of 2000 units of energy.  This person then develops an interest in the metaphysical.  They skip the whole ?energy development? because they figure, ?Hey, I?m practicing by using energy, so technically I am developing my energy.?  They go on practicing psychokinesis, or telepathy, or astral projection for another week, but because they are doing these things their energy requirements jump, so within that week their energy surplus drops to 0.  They find themselves suddenly unable to do any of what they were able to do before.  Because their daily intake is only 100 units, and they keep attempting these things daily, they never develop enough energy to do any of these effectively.  Not only will this person be unable to perform psychic feats, but they will suffer physical symptoms of energy depleation.  Now another person, in the same beginning situation begins to practice the metaphysical.  They have a lifetime surplus of 2000 units and absorb 100 units a day.  They dabble with a bit of psychokinesis for a few days, and drop their surplus to 500 units.  Then they decide to do some basic energy work.  They do all the exercises, and then decide to CONCIOUSLY add more surplus to their energy reserves.  Because they exercised their energy body, their daily intake goes up to 300 units.  Also, because they consciously added to their surplus, the surplus itself went back to 2000 units-completely restoring their previous surplus.  Most of you will say something like ?I?m ok, I don?t need to do any of this.  I?ve got enough energy?.  I?m telling you now, you?re wrong, always keep yourself humble, you are never above the basics.
<br />

<br />
Another reason to exercise your energy body is because it allows more movement of energy.  Unexercised etheric ?veins? are closed, small pathways that energy travels on.  These make energy movement and work very difficult, because it?s like trying to shove a gallon of water through a straw in a minute.  This causes a lot of resistance.  Energy resistance is what causes the tingling, rushing, pins and needles feeling of energy work.  If you work your energy body, these ?veins? open up and become larger, making the energy movement process much easier.  Now the energy movement more resembles spraying a gallon of water through a fireman?s hose, a much easier task.  When the energy pathways open up, resistance decreases, meaning the energy movement symptoms become less intense.  This is often misinterpreted.  People often think that they are now doing something wrong because of the lack of symptoms, when in reality they are doing everything right.
<br />
Training the Etheric body is also much like training the physical body, in that certain training types will generate different muscle and support structures.  For normal training purposes I suggest that you put in the same amount of effort you would put into reading a book or having a conversation.  This way you are not putting too much effort into training the etheric body, but neither are you putting in too little.  In the same way that body builders build big but weak muscles through much effort-the etheric body will become large and weak if too much effort is put in.  This causes instability, in that the etheric ?veins? will collapse if too much strain is put on them for long enough, which can cause many problems-which I?m sure you can figure out.
<br />

<br />
The Etheric body is made up of 5 ?levels?.  Each level has its own purpose, and is supported by the levels before it. 
<br />
The first and most basic level is made up of the energy exchange ports.  These energy exchange ports are located like pores all over your skin.  Their purpose is to draw in new raw energy and expel old and used energy.  They are also used for sensing energy to various degrees.  The energy exchange ports are located most strongly in the palms, soles of the feet, air passages and lungs, lips mouth and tongue, and the genitals.  The hands and the feet have the most concentration, and therefore will be most sensitive and should be the most worked with.  
<br />
The second ?level? is made up of the secondary chakras.  They are located in the palms.  Their purpose is to refine and transform energy so that the primary centers can use it.  The secondary chakras are attached to muscles, nerve centers, &amp; organs.
<br />
The third level is the major chakra system.  There are 7 major (well known) chakras.  The Root, Sacral, Solar Plexus, Heart, Throat, Third Eye, and Crown.  There are several more less known chakras, but they are irrelevant for now, the next energy body article will address.
<br />
The fourth level is comprised of the energy storage centers.  There are three of these, the sub-navel, the sub-heart, and the sub-brow.  Each stores a different type of energy.  The sub-navel stores pure physical energy, and is located 3 inches below the belly button and roughly two inches in the body. The sub-heart stores pure emotional energy, and is located at the sternum roughly two inches inside the body.  The sub-brow stores pure mental and psychic energy, and is located between the eye sockets about two inches inside the skull.  
<br />
The fifth and final ?level? is the kundalini circuit.  This level holds unimaginable power.  It rarely is activated on accident, and I will not be addressing how to, it is beyond most here.
<br />

<br />
Now I will discuss how to develop your energy body.  
<br />

<br />
There are several ways to stimulate your energy body.  Stimulating your energy body is based off of creative imagination.  There are 3 main ways to stimulate your energy body, they are based off of the three spatial senses.  The focus should be on moving your body awareness.
<br />

<br />
Visual Imaging- With this system, you visually imagine anything dynamic.  Nothing stationary will work, as it is not moving the energy body.  
<br />

<br />
Auditory Imaging- Imagine sound coming from, and reverberating within, different parts of your body. 
<br />

<br />
Tactile Imaging- This I find to be the easiest and most effective system by far, it
<br />
is body awareness in action.  In this system you feel your body---you sense yourself.
<br />

<br />
	
<br />
With each of these systems there are several major ways to stimulate your energy body, although they each can be adapted for the others, I will list three for each..
<br />
	Visual- (for the sake of simplicity I am saying you are visualizing electricity- but you can use whatever you want to.)
<br />
		Spinning- You spin the electricity around your body, limb, digit ect? This stimulates the energy body in a forceful swirling action, forcefully loosening the energy body and removing blockages.  
<br />
		Poking- You visualize the lightning striking your target area as hundreds of separate bolts, entering your body and then retreating.  This creates more ?rippling? in the energy body (this will be discussed in more depth later) which has the effect of subtly loosening the energy body and making it more pliable and fluid.
<br />
		Burrowing- You make one straight line of electricity flow along a path, for example, from your shoulder to your hand.  This strengthens the energy pathways, making it easier for energy to travel.
<br />

<br />
	Audio-
<br />
		Broadcast- A section of your body sends out a pitch, sound, or song- as if it were a speaker.  This stimulates the etheric body much the same way as the poking of visualization, except it also expands the energy body.
<br />
		Reverberation- Sound bounces back and forth between your bone and skin, or inside of bone and surface of bone, it never escapes your body.  This is very good for building the density of the health aura.
<br />
		Pulse- Send a beat of energy down your limb or through your body.  It helps to imagine a starting point for the ?beat? to originate at.  This encourages movement of energy.
<br />

<br />
	Tactile-
<br />
		Wrapping- Feel something like an ACE bandage wrapping over your target area.  This stimulates large areas of the etheric body, but its not quite as intense as other techniques.
<br />
		Swirl- Feel your body, just one point, and move it around in a continuously shrinking and enlargening circle.  This is mainly used to stimulate secondary and primary chakras.
<br />
		Brush- Imagine you are painting yourself, going back and fourth with the brush.  More intense than wrapping, but not as much area.  Mainly stimulates the energy exchange ports.
<br />
(look for energy work training regimen relatively soon.  It will introduce more advanced energy movement methods, and will be formatted on a week to week basis.)
<br />

<br />
When many of you manipulate energy you will find that the energy movement sensations (tingling, heat ect?) will continue even after you have finished the exercise.  This is due to what I call the rippling effect.   Because the etheric body is fluid, and is easily influenced by thought, there is thought ?residue?(your sub-conscious) that keeps the etheric body moving even after your consciousness has moved on.  Also, due to the fact that there is sensation still lingering, your conscious flicks back to it-- encouraging further sensation and movement.
<br />

<br />
Now onto building your energy surplus.  Your energy surplus is held in the energy storage centers.  The most important of these storage centers is the sub-navel center.  The sub-navel storage center stores pure physical energy, the most physical of the energies.  It is the densest energy, and is commonly referred to as chi or life force. 
<br />
You may ask ?If I want to develop psychic abilities wouldn?t I want to add surplus to my sub-brow center??.  The answer is absolutely not.  Doing so would upset the natural balance of energies, with the most energy being in the sub-navel, second most being in the sub-heart, and least being in the sub-brow.  What the system has developed is a ?threshold? of sorts.  The sub-navel storage center fills up to a certain point, but then overflows to the sub-heart, which then overflows to the sub-brow, and then continues back to the sub-navel to add EVEN MORE energy to the system.  In this way, the human energy body maintains a balance, a sort of ratio that has little leeway.  
<br />

<br />
Now onto adding energy to your sub-navel storage center.  I will outline my personal favorite.
<br />

<br />
Choose a visualization method- be it visual, audio, or tactile.  I will refer to this as awareness or visualization.
<br />

<br />
First, you must spend some time stimulating the energy body, mainly in the feet, legs, arms, and hands.  Spend at least two minutes on each, start with the extremity(hands, feet) and then work on the whole limb(feet and legs, hands and arms), so that overall there should have been four minutes spend on the hands and feet, and two minutes should have been spent in the legs and arms.  
<br />
	Get in a comfortable position, as comfort is important?certainly more important than any predetermined position.  Put your awareness in your feet.  As you breathe in draw a stream of energy up your legs(be careful not to stimulate the genitals, as this can cause major distractions).  Make this energy flow into your sub-navel.  When your in breath has finished flick awareness to your hands.  As you breathe out visualize energy streaming from your hands to over your shoulders and then finally down flowing into your sub-navel storage center.  Repeat this as long as you wish-you can never do to much.		
<br />

As found on pathlayer.co.nr-have fun with it

			There is one thing in this article which makes me believe it doesnt help at all. It says that you deplete your energy amount.  And to get them back you must put your awareness in your feet and hands.  Well if you did that, wouldnt you be taking energy from your self (specifally your hands and feet) and just putting it into the storage area.  If so, does that even help at all.  I dont think so.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />   I am curious to see what you think.  Please reply if you disagree or agree.

I have expierenced these things which is why I have incorporated them, and I understand that they can do these things with no energy manipulation, but for any worthwile results( if you ever want to end up at some high level of compentency) you must, it is undeniable.  Why do you think that so many around here are only able to move a psi-wheel with body heat? Or make up immages and call it clairvoyance? Or guess a number 1-10 10% of the time?  They do not take the time to master themselfs.

&quot;Dude, this is great. I'm adding it to my archives. Great find.&quot;
<br />
lol, I didnt find it, I wrote it.
<br />

<br />
and regarding the question above, because the energy originates from your extremities you are pulling energy from the immidietly surrounding area.  I have worked with this, and I assure you, it works well.

You think that mastering Psi manipulation has anything to do with why people here are seemingly unsuccessful? It does not. People who are not successful do not succeed because they are either LAZY (I'd say 80% of non-successful) or they aren't practicing properly.
<br />

<br />
NI doesn't even believe in  Psi Manipulation and look at all the stuff he has done.

You god damned thief. You didn't even mention the original author of most of that material. About 50% of that is verbatim from Robert Bruce's material, about 30% more is slightly rephrased, and then other 20% is merely elaborating on ideas of the  the NEW system of energy development. As linked before by PepsiBoy. I actually read it prior to reading this. I got suspicious when I saw the energy units thing, after that, after seeing all of the hijacked sentences, there was no doubt.

If you had quoted parts of this article to support your theory, that would have been ok, if you hadn't claimed it was yours, that would have been ok. But to shabbily rehash what has been written before and call it your own, that is low.

PS I saved that entire pile of plagiarism  to my HDD, so don't bother trying to edit it.

I didn't steal this stuff from robert bruce.  Some of it is, but most of it is from independant research-I did not hear about robert bruce untill my third year of psionics, at which point i had most of this stuff figured out, admittedly I did use his terminology on the 5 part system, but thats because it sounded and flowed better than the words I had been using.
<br />
For example
<br />
the &quot;tertiary system&quot; is iscussed in Franz Bardons book <span style="text-decoration: underline">Initiation Into Hermetics</span> where he describes pulling energy from the &quot;pores&quot; of your body-and anybody would be rediculous to think that these &quot;pores&quot; were the purly physical ones.  He wrote this something like 70 years before bruce.
<br />
Choa Hok Sui describes the &quot;secondary system&quot; in his discussion of pranic healing- that is where I originally herd of these.
<br />
The chakra system is all over-not original to bruce, as is the kundalini system.
<br />
The energy storage centers are used in eastern teachings, such as the sub-navel is used in martial arts as the center for Chi, and the sub-heart is used in some of the yoga practices.  The only one of the storage centers I was unfamiliar with was the sub-brow, which makes perfect sense.  And the only reason I used the energy uints section is to describe the importance of it.
<br />

<br />
So before you go saying that I stole all of this from Bruce, find out where i got my information.  Id say probably 30% of this is inspired by him-and most of that is terminology.  And I wasnt planning on editing anything-I have no reason to.
