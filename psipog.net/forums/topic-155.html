			Are we actually going to leave meditation stuff without its own area? Or is it planned to be included in &quot;Techniques&quot; area. 
<br />

<br />
It might even fit in the &quot;Science&quot; forum, but I think that it might be handy to have all common knowledge of it in one good place.
<br />

<br />
I just think it's a pretty overlooked thing in psi stuff.

Without much effort, it would lead to a situatation where one newbie advices the other with some bizarre shit that keeps circulating the boards. 
<br />

<br />
Some of the more advanced people would stay out of there since they have nothing new to learn from there. And who on earth would have the time to answer thousands of &quot;how do you make a psiball&quot; queries?
<br />

<br />
Places where new and advanced people are mixed allow us to learn from eachothers mistakes and successes. Newbies learn on the way and advanced fellas can see different points of views and compare them.

There are aspects of mediation which arn't really techniques, a specific forum would be useful.

			Totally agree with the newbie forum AND with the issue with bs spamming, it is true, a forum like that would need an intense moderation...
<br />
BUT, a balance must be found!, meditation is (as i see it) a very powerfull tool, without all the religious stuff (which i respect). And is a kind of tool that suits the needs of everyone with a &quot;focus problem&quot; (one of the most common problems present when you begin any activity),  it helps you a lot, but off course you have to spend some time, something that is not always available in these days...

			I was thinking about the newbie forum...
<br />

<br />
You claim that it would be bad, because it would have to be heavily moderated, but think of it like this: if newbies are joining and posting, would you rather focus their questions in one area, or have them spread out over the entire forum?  A newbie forum wouldn't attract MORE newbies, it would just channel the messages into one area.

			I think their should be a forum for meditation; meditating isn't just a skill to develop other skills, its a gateway into any realm of psychic aspect. For instance, meditation can be a starting point for someone who wants to experience an astral projection. they can clear their mind and then practice the door and key method. but nonetheless, a meditation forum would clear up a lot of questions in unwanted areas... <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			It seems like there are about 8 new different sections being proposed right now.  If all of these were actually created, it would be a nightmare to mod them all and might cause some confusion to members.  For example, meditation could be placed under 'Techniques' if you personally thought it went there, or it could also go into its own Mediation section (assuming this one was created).  Eventually there would be several posts about the same topic across sections.

Keep it simple.

			yep, and (mixing with the other topic &quot;Defense...&quot;) the confusion may come from the layout, I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS IS WRONG, i say, before anyone starts screaming that i'm a complainer...
<br />
The actual layout is ok, but can lead to some confusion IF a topic &quot;meditation&quot;  is added, in that case maybe a different layout based on the complexity of the skills could behave more efficiently. Meaning: i.e. A &quot;Basics Skills&quot;, putting there basic energy manipulation issues, like psiballs, moving energy around your body, energy sensing &amp; awareness and all that stuff that helps when you start, maybe with a &quot;Tips &amp; Tricks&quot; topic, then a &quot;Medium Skills&quot; with telepathy, basic contructs (although a psiball IS a basic construct, but you get the idea), empathy... and &quot;Advanced&quot; with, i don't know, maybe &quot;Sig. reading&quot;, &quot;Energy patterns&quot;, &quot;complex PK&quot; (wow, that's an undefined term), and so...
<br />
it is JUST an idea, my friends, it is ok if you don't agree, but in that case, please explain your arguments, so this keeps being a debate and doesnt' become a flamewar, that doesn't help anyone... <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

I agree I think meditation is a steping stone I guess you can call to actually being able to control your psychic techniques and is very important and therefore should have its own section .
