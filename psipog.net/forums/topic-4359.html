Nah, but you would certainly be well-known for whatever ability you showed, and it would increase the general public knowledge of psi.

Still, it's a stunt, and he doesn't intend to pay the money no matter what happens. It would be nice, though, if someone that's on-the-fence about the existence of psionics would make such a million dollar promise.

			you tell him apollo, No one is interested in these cash prizes anymore, we already know, and we don't give a flying fuck, anyway, his challenge has a rule that disallows delayed effects, which is what magic mostly involves, now then, I'm going to redirect you <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mi3/tomekeeper/jref.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">here</a>
<br />
if you haven't noticed, Randi totally denies the existence of psychic abilities, he refuses to believe in them, despite the fact that their existence has been in almost every culture since... um... the dawn of humanity! despite many scientific studies that show the existence of psi, and yes, there are, use that search function to find them, try Nina Kulagina for starters. why can't people stop posting this? hasn't it occurred to them that it's probably been posted before? *sigh*

Why don't we have a braveheart around here that would do it, and then give the money to some charity organisation instead?

A good way to catch 2 birds with one stone

now maybe that Randi is not a good reference, that I can't tell. I just like the idea.

Many people HAVE contacted Randi, and HAVE shown that they have &quot;Abilities&quot;. Perhaps from not around &quot;here&quot;.
<br />

You do realize in the entirety of the Randi Organization's existence it has not let ONE person run an experiment with them?

None. Most applicants never agree to a proper test protocol, so most are never tested.
<br />

1.5. How many people have passed the formal test?

No one has ever taken the formal test, as one must first pass the preliminary test. </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

The truth about the Randi Organization is that it is run by debunkers.
<br />

<br />
Could you imagine what would happen if they really let people run the tests? Their whole organization would come crumbling down and Randi's &quot;Good Name&quot; would be marred for eternity.
<br />

<br />
Like I said, this organization isn't a neutral 3rd party, THEY WANT YOU TO LOSE.

I've read what you quoted there, I read the entire page on that site. I also find it wierd that NOBODY ever went beyond the preliminary tests. But what do I have to think about this???
<br />
If some people then decide to conclude that this organisation is cr@p, fine by me, but I don't think you can tell without knowing. I've never seen any details of those tests so why would I believe you more than him....??

They have a reputation to Maintain, especially James Randi himself. He wants to be a public icon. Have you ever seen Randi on T.V.? The guy is a performer and needs the spot-light. The &quot;Amazing Randi&quot; doesn't want people to see him as &quot;The Retarded Randi&quot;, so he intentionally focuses on proving himself right, and others wrong.
<br />

<br />
Even when you read the FAQ in its entirety the wording suggests that there's this &quot;we're right, and you're wrong&quot; overtone. Try reading into it some more, and you can sense it.
<br />

<br />
It's no Problem Larry, you don't have to believe me. But, I'd prefer you to not believe Randi <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
I just want you to know that James Randi's Organization and Challenge are all EXTREMELY biased. They're not even nice about it <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.
