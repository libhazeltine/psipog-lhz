Energizer Shield is not quite a shield, and its use is to make yourself feel more powerful and have a morale boost
<br />

<br />
Create shield on your skin and leave it there, and fill up your entire body with Psi
<br />
When I do that, I feel capable for anything, effect is very similar to effect that some songs may have on you, or when you can't do something and your girlfriend who you love much tell you &quot;Do that for me&quot;, and you do it with no problem
<br />

<br />
I only managed to maintain this shield for couple of second cos it uses lot of Psi to fill up entire body, and I'm not very skilled in shielding, but I'll try to improve it and make it permanent

That's what some people say they feel like half way through and after meditation... sort of like enlightment I guess.
<br />
And energizer is crap, why not a duracell shield? hehe  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />
Sounds like a good confidence booster. Would be useful to try on a nervous friend before a performance...

			No, euphoria is when you are really happy for no apparent reason. It's actually something that's not funny to have(irony), because if someone dies or something really bad happens, the person with it will be laughing and happy, which is not nice to see, I expect.

Nope, this isn't euphoria, its more like adrenalin rush, in some cases <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I assume you can all send those chills up your spine at will, right? It feels like you're almighty and stuff for a vague moment, or if you're good at holding it--you'll feel prickly all over and it can last for a while.
<br />

<br />
Is that what it's like?

			Program it to hold shape and stay for a prescribed period of time and possibly with a body language trigger that can dissolve it as well.

It sounds to me like just a normal skin charge shield.  It is nice for beginners because it is easier to feel results than a common bubble shield.  Personally I don't like them because it feels like they restrict my aura (which I define as normal energy around myself) and make me feel closed off moreso than normal.  But each to his own <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Also producing feelings via only mental manipulation is just that...feelings.  Without psi and programming they are nothing but that IMO, you should work on directing your thoughts into something useful, but that is just my personal opinion.
