Me: Come on. If you have a gift that most other people can't dream to accomplish, then why not use it for or against them?
<br />
Me: One of my Psi goals:: learning to attack people with psi balls at any given time. 
<br />
Her: heh. see, thats what we call 'learning for the wrong reason'

Me: Right, depending on how you look at it...

Me: Come on! Those Jackasses? THATS AS RIGHT AS ANY REASON GETS!

her: and no, its not.

Her: no matter how much of a jackass they are.

Me: then maybe i can be a &quot;dark-psion&quot;

			I personally believe that using psi for selfish purpose, revenge or anything else of that nature is just wrong. We are given abilities to master, but to help others, to use for the good of humanity. By abusing these abilities, the subconcious if similiar mindset of the average sub-c will totally block you out and you will lose these abilities permantly or until you have a change of personality.

I have serious issues with people who try to tell others what to do, but regardless of that, who cares what other people call you?  Also, I dont really think anyone of us are going to just stroll through the park levitating stuff and zapping people with kamehameha's, lol.    I think &quot;using psi in public&quot; is a &quot;Depends&quot; situation.  You could hold a lecture about it at school and demonstrate it!  That would be cool.  But just using it out of the blue in a public area is stupid...just like showing everyone how good you are at [insert physical ability here] when no one is really watching or cares.
<br />

I have to disagree.  The sub-c is whatever you make it out to be...if that is who you are, then that is what your sub-c is.  I dont think we have been given these abilities to &quot;help people&quot;, b/c we aren't given these abilities.  We practice them in order to gain them.  This argument is like saying &quot;Only the pure of heart can...&quot; which is, of course, bs.
<br />

<br />
ALSO, psi-combat discussion isn't allowed here, so dont be surprised if the topic is locked...seems on the edge, don't tilt it over.
<br />

<br />
One more thing.  The day you can 'knock someone out' with a psi-ball will also be the day that you wont need to use that psi ball.  I.E. the guy who's picking on you? By the time you have the ability to make a psi-ball strong enough to knock him out, it wont matter anymore, you will have grown up and gotten out of that situation.  Real advice?  Just tell the teacher.  Sounds stupid and 'pussy', but they will watch and keep an eye, and when they see something is going on, they will stop him.  Trust me, authority is there for a reason and they do want to help.
<br />

<br />
There are no right or or wrong reasons.  Everyone's version of right or wrong in every situation is going to unilaterally different.

I say, do whatever the fuck you want, I mean, Who would believe you, You'll just be cast out and mocked, nothing really achieved, unless you do it secretly, and plus, PK is just about boring as anything can get unless you can throw cars over great amount of distance.

Protection is protection.

My reasons for learning, is well, I just enjoy beating known ideas, I have this erge to fight what is believed to be &quot;law&quot;, just something I've been doing since I learned about science.

Right and wrong is perception, although, I see most people to do wrong then right.

			I think it's just fine to do stuff in front of others. But I think your opinion will differ depending on how social you are. Back in highschool I had a lot of friends that knew I could do psychokinesis, I even had some guys just randomly come up to me that I never knew and would be like &quot;hey man I heard you can do telekinesis or whatever? Is that true? Can you teach me?&quot; I think a lot of people think it's cool. I'd say a lot of christian adults think it's evil. Most of psionics is associated with darker religions, and therefore probably gained it's negative reputation like this. Not teens though, nooooo, about 90% of them think it's friggen cool.

			Do with Psi whatever the heck you want. There are lines of right and wrong, not how you percieve it, at least thats what I believe, you don't have to believe it but I do(I'm a Christian and I don't thinks it's evil so theres one Next Generation Christian with Respects for psions).
<br />

<br />
Public Displays, yes, I would, if I could(I'm not really good yet). I'm just trying the basics right now, and because of my on off ness and driver's ed, I'm not doing so hot. But as far as public displays go, do it, and then if you get really really good open doors that you can just push open and creep people out <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> , <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> [runs away.]
<br />

<br />
I intend to have fun with psi, and in the process better myself. I think telepathy/empathy can be useful(not for intruding in peoples thoughts and stuff). I intend to kick back have fun and hopefully get really good at it some day.

1. There are no wrong reasons, unless you believe there are. It's just a matter of what kind of state of mind you YOURSELF want to get stuck in.
<br />

<br />
2. I'm in the process of learning. But I have a need (like neveza) to break the &quot;rules&quot;, because I don't believe any &quot;rule&quot; exists in the first place. Why they appear to exist now... is a question that has yet to be answered.
<br />

<br />
3. I intend to break apart all concepts of rules. I don't like when people say &quot;oh, physics says it's impossible&quot;, because physics is only a measurement, and boy does humanity measure wrong sometimes! What people need to be doing is not asking themselves &quot;in what way does this happen&quot;, but &quot;WHY does this happen&quot;. I swear, if you ask 'why' enough times, you'll amaze yourself with the answers you come to!
<br />

<br />
4. Right and wrong are what you believe to be right or wrong. It all comes down to your belief. That being said, other people have feelings too!
<br />

<br />
5. Is it okay to display yourself in public, period? Every movement you make is an expression, whether it be breathing, or moving something. It's a form of art, man! Use it!

			I personally think that psi abilities should be used for whatever you wish.  I mean sure, you could get into some trouble with them, but so what?  I actually think that a little psionic mischief would do well to get the word out to the general populace.  Sure, you could always go out and make a show of doing PK or something, but people would only think it was a show.  However, take your typical teenage deviant doing the same thing but for mischievious ends, and people will be much more likely to take it more seriously.
<br />

<br />
Imagine it going a step further.  If someone actually got good enough to actually steal things or manipulate others, and was found out, then you can imagine that governments (local or otherwise) would take an interest in it and probably end up advancing it just trying to stop it.

			Everything depends, all on who and why, when and where, whats and what nots. Its not a matter of showing off and its not a matter of being reclusive, but I can assure you of one thing if your doing it for revenge, for combat, to attack others, to try to be like a media figure Anakin Skywalker (Albiet I'm a Star Wars fan) then your doing it for all the wrong reasons and if your going to advocate combat for psionics then your really in the wrong place since we have rules against that.
<br />

<br />
Your friend has many good points, she is wise and I'd suggest heeding her words a bit more. Psionics isn't a cheap ticket to fame, its not a revenge form, its a skill, an art, and it is a sad day when art forms are perverted and whored out for a cheap buck or attention or otherwise. I practice psionics to realize human potential, to spread the word to those who will listen (I am not very overt on it, I must trust the person first or see signs in them), and most of all to aid those or myself in ways I can that are responsible.

The fact of the matter is, true, this is just an opinion of mine and it seems to be shared by your friend, but if your in it for the fast results for revenge...well your a star wars fan i'd guess, you've seen the story. Except in this little book we call life the repercussions come at higher prices, there are no bad and good guys, the line has long since been blurred, and every action has a consequence that can and may well haunt you for your entire life... Though thats an extreme.
<br />

<br />
All in all, it's your choice really on what to do with it, but I do hope you give this much thought and look at your intent...Ask yourself, &quot;is this what I want or is it just something I find 'neat' &quot;.
