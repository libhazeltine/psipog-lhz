			Ok first question, I was over at a buddy of mine's house last night doing some herbs if u catch my drift. Well I was sitting on the couch feeling really good and i started to zone out. As i was doing this i got some vibrations (not sure if its same for an obe). Then i hit some kind of lucid realization almost and I have read that you will know when it is right to leave your body. I got this feeling really stron and attempted to leave my body. Only thing is I seemed to only move my astral head a little bit. Was I on the verge of an obe or was it jus the herbs?
<br />

<br />

<br />
Second question, I can flex some kind of muscle or something inside of my skull that seems to be right behind the ear somewhere within the skull. I can control this muscle by flexing it and when i seem to &quot;hold it down&quot;, for a lack of better words, i hear a low rumble or some kind of vibrations. Is this related to anything psychic or the third eye? I can easily keep this rumble going for as long as i want... I am just curious if anyone has any info on this

			ok i should also add i was on a meth based roll and stoned as shit, this was happening before i hit the upper part of it. In this state my body was more drowsy. But i could swear to God that i went into a state of complete clarity/lucidity.

			I'm calling rule violations here, but as far as what happened, I'd have to guess it was probably the &quot;peace pipe&quot; Although it could have induced the 'vibes, who knows, I couldn't tell you from experience.

Any and all psychic experiences that manifest when under the influence of a hallucinogenic drug are automatically suspected of being utterly fake and solely a product of the drug itself.  At least, that is how I see it.  Regardless, try to leave drugs out of the discussion.
<br />

<br />
Secondly, the low rumble you hear is possibly caused by the muscles that are used to close your eyes.  If you close your eyes with much effort, and hold them closed, you will begin to hear this rumble.
