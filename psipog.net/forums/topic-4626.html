			Hmm I don't know exactly how I do that ... it's just sort of a feeling, in my mind I say &quot;left&quot; and it moves left. I say &quot;right&quot; and it moves right. Just like that really.

peace ?

			I control the psiwheel like another limb. It spins lots without me concentrating on it, but when I do I move it like I'd move my arm.  It's a much more basic movement than moving your limbs, so practice.  I recently learned to move my right ear. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

For spinning the wheel, im like &quot;ok, ill exert a push here and a pull here,&quot; and it spins.

If it's only moving one way with your hand next to it, chances are it isn't psychokinesis.  Static electricity or warm air currents or little invisible winged creatures, or whatever other explanation for a psychokinetic effect besides psychokinesis could be at play.
<br />

<br />
The best you can do with the psiwheel, insofar as proof to yourself and proof to others of psychokinesis is &quot;intelligent control&quot;.  Intelligent control is simply being able the move the psiwheel in a manner and direction that is consistent with your &quot;will&quot;.  This can be moving it one way, and then stopping it and making it go another direction, as well as making it stop completely and keeping it very still, and then making it spin as fast as possible.
<br />

<br />
I say keep at it.  Focus on moving it in one direction, and then the other.  Remember, you're developing a non-developed ability. Neurological or mental or physical (or all of them) transformation/adaptation is required and it usually doesn't happen immediately.  The only sure way to make it happen is through repeated practice.  Good luck, 9__16.

			Also, I've noticed that when I have my hand near the psiwheel, I put little to no 'oomph' into spinning and it spins, and I almost always feel a 'cold breeze' feeling on my hand, be it energy or actual wind.. Make sure your air conditioner is off if you're going to do PK with a psiwheel. It may not seem like any wind, but with a 'path' from your hand around the wheel, wind can move more easily to spin the wheel.
<br />

<br />
Try moving it without your hand(s) near, with just your mind. I've had a bit of luck with that, but it still might be contributed to a breeze.
<br />

<br />
Lastly, if you feel you're adept enough at spinning it with psi, and you've made sure it's not being affected by anything such as moving air, static electricity, or the aptly named 'little invisible winged creatures', get a glass bowl or transparent plastic cup and put it over the psiwheel.
