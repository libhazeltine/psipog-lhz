			This is another sort of random idea I came up with.......somehow......
<br />
So, I was watching a documentary on ghosts the other day and it just sorta hit me. Could that person right before he/she died had a OBE and then couldn't get back because...their body is dead?
<br />
I guess what I'm suggesting, a ghost could be an oob with no body to go to. 
<br />

<br />
Any takers? Critics?   <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Yes, i completly agree with this thoery. its the one that makes the most sense, when you have an OBE your astral body is supposed  to be connected to your pyshical body by a sliver aumbilical type cord, this cord is what pulls you back into your body, when you die i think that the silver cord is severed and your astral body is free to roam the plains.
<br />

<br />
There is also a reference in the a big book (you know the one, im not allowed to say it, it begins with a B <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> ) about the silver cord being severed and the spirit returning to god, not that that quote has any meaning here 
<br />

<br />
(sorry for the religious stuff i know its not allowed but hey <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> )

			Feel bad? Why? Their body is dead, they have nothing left to feel with, they even don't have personalities. They are like robots with endless power, free to just fly around aimlessly.

How do i know this? I've tried to communicate to a &quot;ghost&quot; telepathically.

			This is kinda against the rules, y'know. Talk about death and ghosts and stuff..
<br />

<br />
To answer your question, memory is proved to be stored in the brain. Physically. And your memory is available to you when you are out of body. So, I don't think an 'OOB body' could exist without a physical body. 
<br />

<br />
I think it's merely some kind of remote presence, except from the approachment angle.. Which makes it *seem* totally different, cause we go about it differently. I can't really be sure, since I've never had an OOBE/RP. This is just what I believe from my current sense of logic.

			sorry.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" />  I didn't mean to break the rules. It was just something that I was thinking about and I really wanted to what other people thought. 
<br />

<br />
The theory sort of makes sense, but when you bring up the memory thing it makes me do a double take. I always thought that ghosts (or at least most) didn't know they were dead. I know of some instances where they have felt emotions; jealousy, hate, anger. I know that some think that ghosts are just emotional memories left by a living person and I bet that it's true for certain cases (i wouldnt say for all though). 
<br />

<br />
I've never had an OBE, so I can't really give my two sense in this whole debate. But i just thought this was sort of food for thought.

			yes dead people...but how can someone be dead, walk and move, w/out a physical body?
<br />

<br />
That's the real question. 
<br />

<br />
You can think whatever you want and I'm not gonna try and convince you of anything. I highly doubt we'll actually figure out the answer, but I'm just saying, to me, that's what seems to be the underlying question.

			What I think is that &quot;ghosts&quot; can move in other dimensions than ours, cause they doesn't have a physical existence. Also a ghost can &quot;enter&quot; in our dimension (by accident or because they want) but they can't make a revelation in the physical world cause they aren't physical but they can disturb the physical world the same as we can dysturb the psionic world more or less  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />
Or ghosts can be an entity that has nothing to do with dead people, they are a creature that lives in our world and thats all.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />

hmmm...
<br />
I see what you're saying, but I've got a feeling its not that simple. I don't think you can apply that to every single circumstance.
<br />

<br />

<br />
and balmung. when you talked about disturbing our physical world, what about poltergeist? I always considered ghost and poltergeist under the same supernatural category. but i don't know too much about poltergeists, so for all i know they actually could be two different things. is this true or am i just going in the wrong direction?

What you say about the brain is true. But would you not agree that the &quot;astral self&quot; if you will, is something that is not entirely understood as to what it is capable of? We do not know a great amount about this form, I think I'll keep an open mind to this topic until I know the facts which wont happen till I?m dead hahah  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />.

Might i suggest to you people that the general rule for psipog is for no talk about suggesting what happens after death (hence no religion, etc).  Please refrain from talking about after death.

			My beliefs, as far as i've developed.. theres the Physical plane, and then the Astral plane.  Just to let others know, i'm as athiest as possible XD, if there was any terms that i say, i just picked them up for defining what i have to say, and not direct it to any sort of religion, because i hate religion.
<br />

<br />
For me to understand them (and not freak out if i see a ghost), I am convinced that they are just Astral without the physical.
