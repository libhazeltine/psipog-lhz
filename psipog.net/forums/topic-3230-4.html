Is anyone actually reading my posts? I think psi vamps are neither right or wrong as long as they practice their techniques responsibly. I think all my points have pretty much been said and its starting to get to the point of &quot;beating it to death&quot; as Rahmid has said. Sorry to have brutally assassinated this thread.

			Dakova, how would you filter the energy that youre taking in, and if you dont can it be dangerous?

			okey but as you said if that energy you get from someone is sick it will effect bad so it will not be good thing to take from one person you dont know . 
<br />

<br />
psi vampire will not be good too if you leave everything around you that you was taking energy from it and make your source of energy in one person and you dont know what is his max energy and your max energy too because you will have much more max energy and you will make him tired to get some little energy from him . and you will make your own tired from little energy you have is pass to him because you will get full energy from him and leave him with little energy .

Through a shield. I think giving you precise instructions might be perceived as combat talk.

Not anything dramatic like death but it can make you feel sick. 
<br />

<br />
Don't worry ahmed, I understand about your english.

Ahmed: The whole filtering thing is your protection from bad energies. I've never heard a psi vamp taking one person as they're only source. They usually perfer to draw energy from crowds. A great deal of them draw energy from nature and human sources. The ones that seemed most adept were the ones that seemed to take the most care that they didn't hurt anyone.

			Yes i did only skim everything everyone said, sorry.  
<br />

<br />
But as I said before, I'm done, not beating it to death.  Not &quot;taking the moral high ground,&quot; just leaving.  Nothing is going to change no point in fighting.  You take energy from where you want, I dont care.  I have my views you have yours, as everyone does. If you like vamping so much,go ahead and do it.  Nothing i can do to stop you.  Thank the people you take from though, go full circle.  Give-take.  blah blah and the such.

			I think its just plain manners to read a WHOLE post if you plan on holding up a decent discussion. You might have read that <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">I DON'T PRACTICE PSI VAMPIRISM MYSELF.</span></span> You might have also noticed that I have some valid points where as your posts lack anything of value. You want to be ignorant? Fine thats your choice but stop spreading your crap around the forums like its fact.
