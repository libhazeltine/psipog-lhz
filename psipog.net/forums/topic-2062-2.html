			&quot;Why are you here?&quot;
<br />

<br />
To piss you off, naturally <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
To see if anyone wants to really do some controlled experiments in a university setting and try to publish the results in a legitimate and peer reviewed scientific journal, such as JAMA.
<br />

<br />
To see if there is anything here I haven't found elsewhere. 
<br />

<br />
I'm bored, and I see a lot of junk science bounding up around here, and I hate that. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;What is natural?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Everything. There is nothing outside of the natural world or that is &quot;supernatural&quot;. Everything that exists, exists in nature. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;What everyone can do?&quot;
<br />

<br />
I don't think everyone nor mostly anyone can do anything paranormal or has had something truly paranormal happen to them.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;then all of psionics is natural.&quot;
<br />

<br />
If it exists it is. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;We are aware that everything can be faked but we make the videos to help others and to show our progress.&quot;
<br />

<br />
And I have made pervious suggestions as to why these videos are not helping, nor show anything significant, and what videos should show that would be more impressive. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Everyone here who has tried telekinesis, knows it is real.&quot;
<br />

<br />
You can claim this, but it is apparent that moving objects such as psiwheels or little pieces of paper is nothing but the flow of air caused by heat and movement from your hands/breath/etc. They can think they know it is real, but self-delusion does not make something real. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;you keep saying &quot;Do not delude yourself&quot; when you are the one deluding yourself.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Not really. Thinking you are moving things with your mind when it is warm air is not a paranormal ability, and never will be. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Is this statement true for all paranormal phenomena? There have been experiments in all different research centers on different phenomena (telepathy, telekinesis, remote viewing, etc.) and they have gotten results that do suggest that it is real.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Most of these experiments involve remote viewing and ESP, not telekinesis. I am well aware of these institutes and the Journal of Parapsychology and it's lack of truly significant findings that are largely unaccepted by the scientific community. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Skeptics do not believe us because their culture (our culture) is sci-fi movies, video games, jokes about it, and parents telling us how fake psychics are. When we tell them that we can do something paranormal, they automatically &quot;know&quot; it is fake. Then they either verbally attack us, lower our moral (ie what you are doing to newbies here),&quot;
<br />

<br />
Get over your persecution complex. 
<br />

<br />
If I saw something that was convincing, I would say so. 
<br />

<br />
If it lowers your moral too bad - you are not doing anything paranormal by spinning a pinwheel. 
<br />

<br />
Trying to use debunked phenomena to prove the paranormal only hurts the credibility of paranormal phenomena and those who try to experimentally show it is real. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;If i make a video of moving a psiwheel in 98 degree weather under a glass bowl (after the temperature in there is equal to 98 degrees), and it shows my whole body and the news so you know that it is indeed 98 degrees, will you be satisfied? Of course not.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Because air currents are controlled by more than just the outside temperature, and your body is still emmitting heat that affects the surrounding atmosphere. Levitating something up off of a surface is a different story. 
<br />

<br />
I don't want to see little pieces of paper moved by air. I want to see objects flying around on their own. I want to see things (not paper) catch on fire with no appreciable source of ignition. I want to see lightbulbs powered in a hand and made to explode without being connected to a light socket or other power source. That would &quot;satisfy&quot; me. Not 'prove' anything, but be satisfying. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Because it is against your culture.&quot;
<br />

<br />
My culture? You do not even know what that may be. Your genralizations are ridiculous. You don't even know who I am or what I am. 
<br />

<br />
I think it is against your nature to question things, especially that which you want to be real. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;I respect you, but not as much as if you kindly stated what you believe. Please, next time you post be nicer about your views.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I was being quite nice. If I didn't want to be nice, you'd know it. 
<br />

<br />
I do not believe anything. The types of paranormal phenomena I have witnessed and performed far outclass the petty tricks I have seen in videos found on the internet.

			Hey, hypocrite.

<br />
Why don't you make the video, if you're such the skeptic-master?
<br />

<br />
Go ahead and prove your bullshit, instead of giving these so-called explanations.
<br />

<br />
They aren't even on topic. 
<br />

<br />
Hell, there's so much close-mindedness about you, I could write a fucking novel.
<br />

<br />
But I won't, because that would crash the forums. 
<br />

<br />
Maybe I'll have time after supper.
<br />

<br />
Edit: Alright, prove this to me.
<br />

<br />
I saw somebody take their webcam around the whole room, then asked us if we were satisfied, on the chat.
<br />

<br />
He then sat across the room and moved the wheel.
<br />

<br />
And the wheel was under a glass.
<br />

<br />
...So, bullshit your way out of that, tough guy.

LoL. You kids are great. You don't want me to start making fake videos and posting them. You will think they are real and will jump through hoops to try and &quot;prove&quot; they are. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Go ahead and prove your bullshit, instead of giving these so-called explanations.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Actually, you being the one asserting the positive claim, that psionics/TK is real, must be the one to prove it. 
<br />

<br />
Given the nature of the website and videos that the topic creator psi_manipulator 3000 posted, you are up a shit's creek without a paddle <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
So-called explanations? No, they are explanations, GOOD ONES. 
<br />

<br />
Just because you don't like it and can't accept it, because you want to have the power to be able to do things so badly, and be special, doesn't mean a god damned thing. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;They aren't even on topic.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Actually they are, considering this thread is about pinwheel movement and what causes that movement - and it's not TK or anything psychokinetic. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;Hell, there's so much close-mindedness about you, I could write a fucking novel.&quot;
<br />

<br />
LoL, if you think so junior. 
<br />

<br />
You take my being skeptical of YOUR claims for being skeptical of ALL claims. This is not the case. I am merely skeptical of 15 year olds on the internet, not of real paranormal claims made by credible people. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;But I won't, because that would crash the forums.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Yadda yadda yadda. Go take that teenage angst and fuck some girls and do some drugs, seems like you need it. 
<br />
 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Maybe I'll have time after supper.&quot;
<br />

<br />
What's mommy making tonight? I think she should feed you some soap. 
<br />
 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Edit: Alright, prove this to me.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Prove what, that your silly anecdotal account is actually true?
<br />

<br />
Why don't YOU prove to ME that your anecdotal account is actually true <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;I saw somebody take their webcam around the whole room, then asked us if we were satisfied, on the chat.

<br />
...So, bullshit your way out of that, tough guy.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Numerous camera tricks could do that. It has already been established that moving a pinwheel is not TK, but is caused by the air currents and the flow of warm air. I can sneeze and cause paper to flutter from across the room. There is nothing different with this effect. Being under glass is no different, all that means to me is that air currents are more easily trapped and are able to affect the pinwheel more. 
<br />

<br />
You want to talk anecdotes, then explain how psionics is the result of a person shape-shifting into a bear, something I have seen with my own eyes, in reality, when the person did it. Because it is not, and has nothing to do with psionics, and both I and the person who did it would agree that claiming it is a psionic effect or ability is wrong. 
<br />

<br />
But then again, I could be lying. Why don't you prove to me I am not LoL?

			Kief, why dont you go to a skeptics website where they actually give a shit about your explanations. Your not going to change anyones mind here. Obviously if they signed up they are already interested, if not already skilled. We dont go to skeptics websites trying to recruit people. Dont come around here with explanations that we have already heard a million times from you people. Skeptics come here and demand proof. Why dont they try it out for themselves and get their own proof. Lazy bastards.

Yes, and if you blow on the psiwheel with air, it's obvious. There's no way you can make it spin via just blowing on it. It'd fall off, and I've proven that. But, then again, since you're the research master, you should have already seen that post of mine that contained the...16 minute video proving all bullshit skeptic claims wrong.

So, less air movement = more effect? Geez, I wonder what would happen if there was no wind -_-

Show me a temperature camera of it affecting a psiwheel. I dare you, do it. Stop shitting around, and ACTUALLY MAKE THE VIDEO.

			Semi permeable glass is awfully useful...
<br />

<br />
Seriously though, the worst thing you can do right now is reply to his arguments.  Just don't pay attention to him.  And mattz, as good as the idea of using an infrared camera to record pin wheel movement is, a change in heat could be a side-effect of pk.
<br />

<br />
And Kief, how does enclosing something in glass encourage air movement?  It blocks out foreign air movement (unless you're using semi permeable glass again).  And you can argue, &quot;But it traps in heat and pre-existing air currents,&quot; but it really is too bad that wouldn't help at all.  Those pre-existing air currents would die once they're trapped inside the glass, unless you keep a heater inside the glass.  And if the cover traps in heat (which would cause those self-sustaining air currents <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />), the warm spot would equalize with the surrounding air outside the glass.  I'm sure a credible scientist such as yourself would be familiar with the 7th grade science terms of conduction and convection.  Those hot spots would equalize unless there is a continuous heat source nearby.
<br />

<br />
Moral of the story, he's not going to be convinced so stop trying.

			that guy lives in a very small universe. he just doesn't get it. What is &quot;it&quot; you ask? well, there are many way to look at it. One way would be to say, we live in such a huge universe, how could anyone say anything is impossible. he lives in a world of &quot;can't, no, too hard, impossible, and i'm sure his life is a mirror of such.  my suggestion would be is not to go to his site and view it, simlpy just to not give him the traffic, and also as to not pollute your subconcious mind.

			I'm not going to deny certain things; All of the videos can be faked online.
<br />

<br />
I have a quick question for you Kief:
<br />

<br />
Do you believe in Psychokinesis at all?
<br />

<br />
If, indeed, someone could move an object with their minds, other than the Psiwheel... Why, infact, is performing PK on a Psiwheel not PK? I have personally moved pencils before, and I have also practiced with a Psiwheel. So, the happenings with the Pencil are PK, and the Psiwheel are not? I'd just like to know your opinion on that. 
<br />

<br />
I look forward to your response <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.

			He's never going to directly address the 'moving the psiwheel across the room under a glass' issue.
<br />

<br />
BTW: That was done by Xict (the mandarin)
<br />

<br />
He told us he was doing a show again, so he put the link in IRC.
<br />
About 10 people started watching, and he moved the camera around until everybody was satisfied that he wasn't faking it.
<br />

<br />
He then sat the camera down so you could see both under the table, and a bit above it, thus showing us anything below the table to fake his TK
<br />

<br />
He then sat across the room (15 feet away), and after 10 seconds, moved the wheel.
<br />

<br />
Now, I'd like you to pick this apart, and tell me how he'd fake it.
<br />

<br />
But you're not going to. 
<br />

<br />
Why? Because you forgot the most important rule: <span style="font-weight: bold">back up your claims</span>, which I haven't seen you do at all. Not one single bit of solid evidence.

			Ok for those that are lik: HUH?! So PK must be fake, after seeing the videos... I am going to explain the videos to you.
<br />

<br />
The 1st one.
<br />
Place a wheel infront of you, and put your both hands around it, now squeeze the air that is between your hands... abracadabra, it moves. So that is just messing around with air.
<br />

<br />
The 2nd one.
<br />
It is actually not heat that makes it move, it is the water mist that comes from the hot boiled water that makes it move... If you still believe it is heat, I suggest you get a Desk Lamp, turn it on for 3 hours so it gets freakin hot, not place the lamp near the psi-wheel, see if it moves, I garantee it won't.
<br />

<br />
The 3rd one.
<br />
Well basicly the same like the 1st one.
<br />

<br />
And the covered psiwheel.
<br />
Boil the container so id'll get water inside of it, now place the psiwheel underneath it, and id'll move, again it's water mist that causes it. And the difference between cold/warm areas. And I explained it before in my other point, heat from your hands won't make it move, unless you start to mess around with air.
<br />
