			Hi, I'm new to this forum and the term &quot;Psi&quot; Do forgive if in any way this thread has offend you.
<br />

<br />
Basically I'm a PsiGlove user (not sure if there is such a term) used for healing and some punching, or fights.
<br />

<br />
I started having this ability in increasing 'heat' in our body since I was young. 
<br />
I've read most of the threads and I read upon one which says creating a psiball in your mouth. 
<br />
That is a very good idea, by sticking in a thermormeter in your mouth, and trying to create a psiball with a temperature difference (either hot or cold) you would see the temperature moving up or down. 
<br />

<br />
why this method is useful, everybody's body heat has a certain 'maximum and minimum' capabality. If the temperature went beyond that, that is a good reason a psiball is created.
<br />

<br />
firstly put the thermormeter in your mouth, and get a reading, which will not move up or below any further. Then start focusing on your psiball.
<br />

<br />
I am a 'psiglove' user so what I do is basically hole a thermormeter really firm, to make the temperature go as high as possible. Then I would hold it lightly, and start focusing on the energy of psi. Cleary shows the temperature going further up than when I held it tightly. 
<br />
If you could make a gadget, where the thermormeter would be sticking out in mid air between your hands. Then you could use this as a test.
<br />

<br />
Now for my Questions.
<br />
 I have been a 'psiglove' user for a very long time now. And the thought of bringing psi beyond the human body has never really crossed my mind. The most I ever did, was transfering heat to another body.
<br />
I've tried focusing energy to the hands. (I do that frequently) but I'm just not sure on how to release the energy out of the hand and into the open, shaping it into a ball.
<br />

<br />
And about your term 'flaring' is that truly possible? 
<br />
Cause if psi is about 'vibrating' energy. To make a flaring possible would clearly require a collection of massive electrons and sticking them together. So as to make it visible to the naked eye.
<br />
So flaring = increasing density? (just my 2 cents, not expecting a flame here)
<br />

<br />
K. do forgive if there are lots of errors in this passage. Just what I'm thinking and what I need to know. All comments are welcomed.

			This is very interesting... although i hope your not playing a prank, if your not then the healing think is probably reiki and the psiglove thing is just making transfering psi to your hand. search KI they have shit on this.

			urm... ok.. But I'm more curious about psiballs.
<br />
About bringing the energy beyond the boundaries of the body..

<br />
I know you say your not sure is there is such a term, and there might not be (I have never heard it anyway, but just because I haven’t heard it doesn’t mean its not a real term) but seen as you use the word psiglove could you tell me what it means/means to you please  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> thanks
<br />

<br />
I don’t really understand your question, so if you’re asking how to get the energy out of your body to make a psiball, there are a few articles on the main site. Then again you have read the article on flaring so I would assume you have read articles on basic psi balls as flaring is pretty advanced. But if you havent read them, i sugest you go back and do so as most of the info people will give you is just repeating whats said there.
<br />

<br />
And to answer your question about flaring,
<br />
It is possible to flair a psi ball, and flaring does = increasing density
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Cause if psi is about 'vibrating' energy </span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Psi isn’t about vibrating energy as psi itself is energy, you would only visualize psi vibrating if you had an image in your mind of what the vibrating energy would result in e.g. vibrating the energy faster to cause heat.

hope that helped . <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
