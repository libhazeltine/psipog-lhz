			Yeah OBE's can get scary but i doubt you will suffocate or that anyone will steal your body the only thing that you have to fear from an OBE is your personal fears and mabye the weired sounds and images you get when your in the borderline of sleep. all you have to do is overcome your fear. (hard but worth it <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> )

Who would steal your body, and what would they do with it?
<br />

<br />
Think through this logically. Let's say that some other person who is OBEing &quot;steals&quot; your body. Will this person have any of the necessary knowledge to operate as you? He or she won't even know your name, much less your family's names, the way to the bathroom in your house, or what you do all day. What use would this person have for your body?

			Perhaps some pervert that changes from a guy to a girl, or vice versa.  I think it would be cool to switch bodies!.. not that i would try to do that kind of thing &gt;_&gt; maybe switch with close friends? relatives? but never a random stranger.. too risky.
<br />
Ugh, if switching bodies is possible, it makes me think it would be the key to achieving eternal life.. at a cost of someone else.

			Good idea Lucidness: we can all switch bodies with hippies right before we die. Nobody will notice.

I doubt full possession is possible. Firstly,  your mind doesn't leave your body. How can it? A lot of it is just a series of chemicals.

			Hey, who knows, we should all meet up somewhere (online or not) and switch bodies for a day, see if its possible, it will be like that one show where the people switch lives, for the first few weeks the family makes the rules, then the next they lay out the rules <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.

Funny, I was just thinking about how funny it would be if someone tried that and then for one reason or another, couldn't induce a second one and then got stuck in the other person's body.

			From many people who i know that have OBEd, there has been no account of your body being &quot;overtaken&quot; or &quot;suffocating&quot;.  If you believe that you will suffocate, you will get short on breaking and will think you <span style="font-style: italic">are</span> suffocating.  There is really nothing to worry about besides what it feels like to obe (being as that is the unknown and people are afraid of the unknown).
