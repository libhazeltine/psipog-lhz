			Hey everyone did anyone watch proof positive the paranormal show that tests super abilities and proves them positive neegative or un decided??
<br />

<br />
Well they did it on a guy hwo wa sin the cia and he was part of a secret operation called sunstreak and he wa sa psychik in the cia he was to spy on enemys with remote viewing. And now he is an x-cia agent. But he trained people on how to do it he gave a big group coordinates and didnt give them a clue to were what or anything theyd see, he just told them to find the beacon, and were it was at. And it was absolutely amazing.
<br />
Itwas a lady on a motorcycle riding theu the city and everyone of them saw thru here eyes, and drew pictures of the city as she drove by like buildings and structures as she drive by a park dead on, and one lady drew a medusa lookign lady design on one of the PA guys getting her camera on her head ready and it amazed the cia psychik how good she remote viewed. 
<br />

<br />
It was prooved positive. 
<br />
Just thought id share this with you guys.
