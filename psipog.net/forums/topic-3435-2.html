			I have told four people so far. Before telling the first two I asked them to promise me that they would keep it secret and that they must be open minded about the whole thing. Then I just told them flat out about stuff like TK and few other things. I don't think I was a member of this website at the time though. But I think I could make psi balls. One day I told them to visualize energy flowing up to their hands and forming a ball (Prior to doing this I told them stretch an arm out so all of our hands would be a few inches apart.) of energy. After doing this for only a few seconds they said they could feel a lot of heat between each other's hands. Eventually the heat was so great that sweat started to form on my forehead. I later illustrated what I thought it would look like in terms of energy. I drew the three of us with our arms out stretched and a ball of energy in the center with a sphereical field of energy that weakened in intensity as diameter increased. One of them said that it looked like a perfect illustration of what happened. A question to ponder is how did the three of us created so much energy in only a few seconds? The only theory I have is based off a concept I read from a psychic book. The author said that if two people do something psychic in unison their power will be squared. So let's say my power was 50 units. With their combined power it would be 125,000 units, or 50 units cubed. But enough of my babbling. There are still two others that I told about psionics. The next one I told cautiously. But before I actually told him about psionics I told him to do a visualization exercise. He told me he felt a tingly feeling in the area he visualized the energy in. From there I explained what he just did and I told him everything else about psionics. He is somewhat of a skeptic but he is still open-minded. And he is now a new member of this website <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />. His name is Lawrence of Arabia. Perhaps you've seen his post in the hello section <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. Very funny guy. The other person I told was not planned in the first place. He caught me posting on this website and started questioning me. He was a freshman (I don't hate freshmen unless they give me a reason to, like this guy). And a very immature one at that <img src="images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0" />. He always joked around with me pretending he was going to spill the beans to everyone. It was a real pain. I told him cautiously as well. But he wasn't ready. He couldn't stop joking around and he couldn't even feel energy when I told him to visualize it. Thank goodness he didn't join this website! As for teaching people about psionics I recommend making them manipulate energy, you making a psi ball and letting him/her feel it, moving an object that can't be influenced by wind or other forces, or anything else that you are good at and can perform under strict conditions.

Its true. I should know.

<br />
Usually I...Oh wait, yeah, I dont practice psionics...hmm...but if I did I'd be very open about it, what's there to be ashamed of. If they mock me about it Id kill their parents and make them watch me consume their remains...or make THEM eat their parents remains.

It's about time you post somewhere in general discussion. Jeez man, you joke around too much. You sound too serious when you're not in person. If I didn't know you I'd think you were scary <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />. Where'd you get that idea from, South Park? (the episode with the &quot;chile&quot;)

			I just told two of my friends that I can do this kind of stuff. I also showed them both this site. Ones really into it but the other one doesn't feel like reading the articles. I don't really care if they tell anyone.

			Only 3 people as far as I know know about me doing psi. 1 prolly doesn't know I do it anymore, 1 might not believe me, and I'm not quite sure I even told her, and 1 isn't sure she believes in psi, but she's open minded about it.

I usually start it off with something like &quot;Hey, do you believe in psychics?&quot; and if they say yes, then I go on from there.

			I showed one of my friends who I thought was a good close friend, having known him longer than my younger brother who is only 11 monthes younger than me. He has been the first person to not support me in something I decided to do. He started to ridicule me then he got a sick one to the head and doesn't mention the subject anymore.
