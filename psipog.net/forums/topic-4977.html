			OH MY GOD! im so excited...I styrofoam cup and filled it up with water..and put a small piece of paper in it and the paper got wet enough to be under water...The thing is it was just below the surface..and i kept thinking..let it happen, let it happen, and i thought to myself, now the piece of paper is gonna rise to the surface...a little bit of it did..but then a few seonds later i was like...let it happen...and i said..Now i want the piece of paper to sink into the cup..i said that twice, then all of a sudden the piece of paper fell to the bottom..now im not talking a gentle float, im talking about it sunk like it almost was weighted!!
<br />

<br />

<br />
Now it happened a split second after i said, i wanted it to sink!! I'm goign to keep testing it too see if anything else happens! Now if it was a few minutes into the whole thing i can understand that the piece of paper was weak and maybe it fell because of it, but it was only in the water for maybe 2 mins!
<br />

<br />
What do u all think? It's only like my 3rd or 4th day trying!
<br />

<br />
please post a reply!

Shhhhhhhh. The only explanation is always exactly the one that conveniently affirms your existing beliefs. You might upset them.

			Ok i understand what you are all trying to say..yes paper does sink, and even right after i had done the experiment, i thought to myself..u know maybe the paper just sunk on its own and i just so happen to try to make it sink at the same exact time..so in my conclusion i can not fully say it was TK that made it sink...and i cannot say that it wasnt...so i'll just leave it at what i did and what happened and go from there...I'm not frustrated or dissapointed over it at all..I'm just going to keep trying with small things and see what happens
<br />

<br />
Now i dont know if a couple of peopple's replies were ment to be rude, but if they were, id like for the rude comments to stop...Instead you could give me some advice on what I could do to improve my abilities...Thank you

You actually went back and tested this on your own and proved yourself wrong? Nice. If it weren't for deducing from that it &quot;could have been either&quot; instead of going by what that actually demonstrates (same thing happens whether you're focusing or not? Hmmmmm), you'd be 100% cool by me.

			After it had sunk, I would have tried to make it float again, if I were you. Not sure if you did that, but I didn't get from your post that you did.

			I dont know if i stated this yet but soon after the first experience with the &quot;TK&quot;..I decided to go back and test something because i wasn't sure if it was TK or just an odd coincidence..soo i decided to take another piece of paper the same size as the other one, put it into a ball and place it in the water..now what happened was the piece of paper unreveled (spelling?) or became undone and just sat there floating..the thinner end of the paper went into the water about half way and the heavy (still ball) part was floating...I let it sit there for like 3 mins and nothing happened to the heavy part..So i decided to take the piece of paper out and crumble it into a ball-it was wet--and i set it back into the water, and that's when it sunk to the bottom like a second later..
<br />

<br />
so again, can i say it was TK....im not 110%...can i say it wasnt....No...all i can go by is what happened, and i keep asking myself,  what is the possibility of a really really flipping strange coincidence like that to happen? Even when I went back and tested it....
<br />

<br />
So i'll just keep at it...Not getting to excited over it cuz i cant say what it really was....all i can say is that, it gives me hope, and the inspiration to keep going!
<br />

<br />
thanks

I must agree. I remember when I was first starting out with the psiwheel I'd sometimes doubt that it was me and figured it must be the wind or my breath (very possible). But I found that when I just gave myself the benefit of the doubt it fueled my self-confidence enough so I could eventually get some &quot;real&quot; results. 
<br />

<br />
Remember, you can't prove it was pk, but you can't prove it <span style="font-weight: bold">wasn't</span> either. Just keep practicing and soon enough you'll have results even you can't argue with   <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
