			Hi everyone.
<br />

<br />
I just wanted to tell you of my obe try last night. 
<br />
I went to bed pretty early, as usuall when I try to get an obe. 
<br />
I didnt move for some time and I felt that my arms were getting numb, its not that often I get to the phase where the body falls asleep and the mind is awake, so I told my sub-c:
<br />
-Whatever you do, dont make me fall asleep. I would be glad if you could keep me awake. 
<br />
 Right after I finnished the &quot;keep me awake.&quot; sentence my vertebras started to &quot;pop&quot;, it was a pretty nice feeling, not unplesant at all. 
<br />
It kept poping for a few seconds and my body turned completely numb. 
<br />
I thought that this must be it, I'm about to achieve an obe.
<br />
I started to fantazise how it would feel, if I would start to see in black and white and stuff like that. 
<br />
Eventually I started to turn more and more in to a dream like phase, and right before I started to accually dream my sub-c sent a  great chill down my spine. 
<br />
 It kept doing that every time I wandered off. Since I didnt have enough will power to keep my mind in one piece I kept wander of the whole night, and my sub-c kept sending me the chill thing.
<br />
At two am  I felt that I just had to get some sleep so I gave up. Moved around in my bed a little, felt my body again and fell asleep.
<br />

<br />
Well, I wasnt able to achieve an obe, but I think that I was pretty close. 
<br />
What do you think?
<br />
I'll try again tonight.
<br />
Oh, and if youve got any tips or something that you think could help me please tell me.
<br />

<br />
G'night.
<br />

<br />
P.S Im sorry about the lousy spelling and the bad grammar, english isnt my native language so please bear with me.  -_-

			Well from my experiencie i will tell you that don't get too emotionated when trying to get an OBE. cause then you won't have it, emotions normally don't let the brain work like a normal night so it won't get to sleep easily (thats what i think).
<br />
Also think that an OBE is a thing that when it's ready it comes, I've never went out from my body, normally i stay in my bed imagining landscapes or places (but i've to be conscious of it), and then there's a moment when you say: Hey! i'm really here! Thats when you're in an OBE, since there you can do what you want but it's hard not to return at the body the firsts times.
<br />
It gets practice to realise of it and escape from a dream.
<br />
Continue your practice cause the reward is really pretty <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
