			Finally I have on all encompassing hypothesis for the phenomenon known as psi. Over the span of my psychology research on psi and my philosophical journey I learned a few things. I learned that everything in existence is basically just different forms of the same one thing. As we get down further in science we can already see that when the matter/energy line gets blurred. Einstein also said that space and time were intricately connected and one and the same thing. I believe that there is another dimension we move in besides in space and time. I believe that everybody has not only a physical and temporal location but a location in a mental dimension. When we think, feel or experience something we change our mental location. Think of the universe as an XYZ graph except instead of XYZ being spatial dimensions they are thought, emotion, and perception. In this TEP graph each object in the universe has a location that represents its thoughts, emotions and perceptions. Some objects have a larger area in the mental dimension and are connected to other points thus creating memory. Of course it is much more complicated than this and we can't comprehend a mental &quot;location&quot; because it really isn't a &quot;location&quot; anyway. It's just a metaphor. You're probably thinking now, &quot;Wait, did he just say rocks think?&quot; They don't and they do. Everything that does not have a complex TEP location, like living things, is subsequently located at the TEP point 0,0,0.  This is where the metaphor becomes perfect. I developed this hypothesis from a personal experience where I reached the origin point and felt connected with everything but didn't actually think or feel anything at all. The metaphor is great because the origin is the point where the thoughts, emotions, and perceptions cease to exist but it also connects them all. That's the best way to describe the connected place I reached.
<br />

<br />
After experiencing it I tried to comprehend it rationally but could not and then started to remeber my buddhism. I realized that the &quot;commonplace&quot;, as I called it, resembled enlightenment in buddhism. Later I realized you have to integrate the commonplace into your &quot;soul&quot; in order to be enlightened. That's probably the hardest things anyone could ever do and I have not yet. To sum up everything important you need to keep in mind: The commonplace is an aspect of everything and connects all. The commonplace is eternal and is where most of the universe is mentally.
<br />

<br />
How this relates to psi is pretty damn amazing in my eyes. During my research I found that most people who did psi also did a little spirituality, ended up doing spirituality crap, or spirituality people dabbled in psi. Basically, the two areas where connected for some reason. You can even trace this back to ancient china where meditative monks used telepathy and such. Oh yeah, one more thing about the mental dimension, after you've reached the commonplace you have a little more understanding of the universe but its not really understanding. It's more like going there and feeling the soul of the universe engulf your mind tells you something about it. I began to realize that everything was connected or in fact the same thing. The mental dimension is as intrisically connected to the physical and temporal for various reasons. Such as, the temporal dimension is a direct construct of thought. I think one, two, three thus I have time. Anyway, I finally realized the connection between spirituality and psi. When you go to the commonplace you are basically becoming one with the universe and connecting yourself all over everything. And since it is an aspect of everything, you connect with complex TEP locations to, such as other people. You're just gonna have to experience the commonplace for yourself to fully understand what I'm trying to say. I highly suggest doing it. It's a great experience and will teach you a lot. Since the mental dimension is part of the physical and temporal dimension you are being spread over all time and space too... mentally at least. It's like expanding your awareness to encompass everything and become a part of it. When you come back from the commonplace I believe you are still partly in touch with it always in your subconscious. Being connected with it means if you try hard enough you can interact with the rest of the universe creating a some pretty cool effects. We know these effects as psi. Think about it, it covers everything. Telepathy, TK, RV, precog, OBE, healing... My hypothesis breaks down since I find it's very hard to explain, in words, the commonplace. You are just gonna have to do it yourself or scan a meditating monk. Tell me what you think and please give me ways to improve it.

The first time I was there, was an accident.  I was staring at my self in the bathroom mirrior and suddenly I like sunk into the ground.  It was a wierd feeling.

I never felt closer to the Earth, the people or even the keyboard i'm typing on right now.  It was sad but overly worth it.

Sgt. psion, this was a problem for me at first too but I think I found a way around it. My co-producer has told me time and time again I used to many words to describe such a simple thing. She got to the commonplace by herself to and described it as god. In fact, if you look deep down at each religion's god, it's quite similiar to the commonplace. She also dabbled in self taught suggestion, precog, and micro TK, which gave me the idea for this hypothesis. Anyway, I don't think words will ever truly describe what it is thus I have to communicate not with words. How do you do that? Psi. Think about it. I imprint the commonplace into like a rock or something and then give that to people to scan and directly upload the commonplace to their mind.
<br />

<br />
Edit: Woah, I totally overlooked tanky. What do you mean by yourself. Yourself meaning my mentality on psipog or something specific to the theory? I'll answer both. Sometimes I'm one way on psipog but I can get serious and write something smart. You can be yourself within this commonplace based world because all thoughts are basically just twisted reflections of the one true thought, the commonplace. We're just offshoots of the one thing and we've lost touch with it. That's the best answer I have. The real answer is I don't know because your question deals with the meaning of life and stuff. That's the next nest of questions I need to answer.

Second Question: My personal veiw is that we cannot be random. We all came from the patterned process of evolution and all life basically is is just an extended complex global process. Life started out as atoms finding stable molecule forms which then had the ability to self replicate themselves. These replicators took over because they had no other competitors for replicating but then different patterns of replicators started &quot;fighting&quot; and finding new and better ways to control resources and replicate more easily. They built battle shells for themselves and the first bacteria were made. Everybody knows the rest. From this basis our personailities are just the product of genes and the soceity. Since then really everything is based on genes and genes are based on this orderly chemical process, we must also be like this too. In every situation we make one decision that can be predicted if you knew where every particle in the universe was and what state it was in. We don't have free will. We are just products of life that follow a strict line of destiny. There's nothing random about what we do. In a way, all of our actions have been planned since the big bang.
<br />

<br />
When I reached the commonplace though I realized that understanding, logic, and all other ideas didn't matter. All that mattered was the commonplace and getting there. You don't have to worry about free will or whether or not this world is just a dream. The commonplace engulfs your mind and when you're there you can't think anything else. You are the commonplace.
<br />

<br />
Damian, there's many different methods to get to the commonplace and buddhism seems to be the most popular one. My method is thinking about how everything is just an orderly chemical process like the plants and such but then trying to feel their &quot;soul.&quot; The soul of the chemical process. Then you move on to thinking about what it would be like to lose your humanity and become one with nature and visualize some stuff about becoming wind or the earth. My method is very connected with nature and connecting with it. My partner's method is just to be somewhere very quiet and expand your consciousness. I would suggest trying my method and her method and see which one works better. Oh yeah, mine works best outside on a cool day where you can hear like birds and wind and such. Just white natural background noises.

Second Question: My personal veiw is that we cannot be random. We all came from the patterned process of evolution and all life basically is is just an extended complex global process. Life started out as atoms finding stable molecule forms which then had the ability to self replicate themselves. These replicators took over because they had no other competitors for replicating but then different patterns of replicators started &quot;fighting&quot; and finding new and better ways to control resources and replicate more easily. They built battle shells for themselves and the first bacteria were made. Everybody knows the rest. From this basis our personailities are just the product of genes and the soceity. Since then really everything is based on genes and genes are based on this orderly chemical process, we must also be like this too. In every situation we make one decision that can be predicted if you knew where every particle in the universe was and what state it was in. We don't have free will. We are just products of life that follow a strict line of destiny. There's nothing random about what we do. In a way, all of our actions have been planned since the big bang...</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

What about quantum particles? Misunderstood and random.

			I see...for someone who base there understanding off facts you leave a opening to the quatumn realm. Classical physics falls to peices when you look at evidence of the quatumn realm. Facts show that random is more effective and more accurte. For this time being anyway...
<br />

<br />
But of cource that logic can easily dismiss it for now, but its useless in the long run untill the facts are shown.
<br />

<br />
Hard itsnt it?
<br />

<br />
To imagine somthing that can truely be random in our world? When classical phsyics can explain everything, that is if you know everything.
<br />

<br />
Personaly I think of them in terms of dimenions, while there are many. Any single or group of them can be predicted. But I like to wonder if there is something...some unseen formula that creates a random code.
<br />

<br />
The worlds beyond earth is so complex....simply because you must escape common sense.

HEY that sort of rumes!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

Time for my 3rd question,

Why must you go there, can't you be happy with others?

Why must you go there, can't you be happy with others?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">Quantum physics is highly misunderstood and when they say that things such as electrons are random it means that we do not have the means to track their motion yet. I think that's right... Plus, my theory brings everything together as one and quantum physics and classic physics already have a connection. Quantum makes classic but classic dosen't exist in quantum. There's a middle ground where they both blur together and are one. That's the real existence.(That was a little confusing even to me, I hope you got some of it)
<br />

<br />
3rd question: I can't answer that. After I went there and when I was coming back I told myself this is something big. Stick with it and keep thinking about it even though it seems silly. When I came out it seemed silly and I didn't want to think about it. I did think about it though and realized it was important. Now I'm a sorta hybrid; a logical thinker who evolved into a &quot;spiritual&quot; person. This is why I think I was able to come up with this theory. Once you visit the commonplace you get a feeling of understanding and oneness that beats everything else. I really don't know though. Go visit it.
