			I have reached some of the most deep meditative states that I thought I would never come back. So much can be accomplished through meditation, and the ability to go deeper and deeper. I've come to believe there is no limit to how deep one can meditate. The feeling of no seperation of consciousness between everything and yourself is indescribeable and overwhelming. Hopefully I can give some insight on some steps to take in the productive direction. 
<br />

<br />
It is commonly believed and said that there are two primary kinds of meditation. One is to focus upon one single thought, object, or focal point of any kind until the mind is clear and focused only on it. The other is to focus upon nothing and achieve a state of mental void. In my experience i have come to the conclusion that the first method is redundant and pointless, as they both lead to the same result. By focusing on one object, you keep your mind still and focused upon a single notion. The latter however, is more direct and effective. So it is my opinion that there is only kind of meditation, and that is attaining mental void.
<br />

<br />
Thinking about nothing is a paradoxical concept in itself. It is seemingly impossible to accomplish this task. How can one think about nothing? I will do my best to answer this question logically. The first obvious answer that presents itself is that one cannot think about nothing, since to be thinking is something. Thus, one must not think. Our being is truly a state of mind, but is often confused as a string of thoughts read off by an internal monologue. By state of mind, I am referring to an 
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">ego</span>. By ego, I mean ego as in the defined parameters of &quot;The self, especially as distinct from the world and other selves. 
<br />
In psychoanalysis, the division of the psyche that is conscious, most immediately controls thought and behavior, and is most in touch with external reality&quot; (dictionary.com). When one is too focused upon their own ego, their percieved external reality becomes isolated from the shared and true (keep in mind truth is relative) reality. Our internal reality and our external reality are reflections of eachother. To explain how and why is a whole other article entirely, so I wont get into it (You'll just have to take my word <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. Meditate on it sometime). So to &quot;think about nothing&quot; is really to strip ourselves of our own egos by not thinking. Which brings me to my next topic of non-thought. 
<br />

<br />
Now comes the hard part: The actual not thinking. The most common problem in my experiences with myself and other people is that they are unable to become relaxed enough to not think. To simply relax is one thing, but to completely still your mind of all consciouss thought requires a deep level of calm similar to drifting off to sleep. What then seperates this 'not thinking' from merely sitting there in a daze drifting off to sleep?<span style="font-weight: bold">awareness</span>. The trick with awareness is not to be aware by thinking, but to be aware by percieving and <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> thinking. This is not as impossible as it may seem. However, it is still one of those incomprehensible things such as the 'just do it' method of TK. I guess the most simple, yet complex way to put it is &quot;just be&quot;. Exist and do nothing more. You dont have to think about anything, including what you percieve. I find it helps to consider it as time to escape from the confines of normal existance and be. Just take it all in.
<br />

<br />
A question I am used to hearing is &quot;If your aware how are you not thinking?&quot;. This is a paradox within itself and I implore you to think about it in great detail. Awareness is not a static thing. It can change in ways you wouldn't believe until they have been experienced. When it comes right down to it, awareness is still a perception. It is not a reaction, and does not require thought or unconsciouss thought. When one has attained this equillibrium of percieve but dont react (even with thought), all thats left to do is keep it that way. It begins to feel natural after a while, and only deepens. Here the real progress can be made. My apologies for the length of this article, but I sincerely hope it helps with any difficulties encountered with meditation, and renews an appreciation for the value of meditation.

			I have a method of non-thinking that I think will work for a lot of people, and I would like to share it. Have you ever just been sitting, say, for example, in class at school and not payed any attention to what the teacher or anybody is saying, your just there, kind of zoned out? Come on, I know at least ALL of us have. Well, try to do the same thing, just completely relax, not listening or thinking about anything at all, as if your in class and a boring teacher is lecturing in a monotone voice. This works for me, I hope it will help at least one person.

			Agreed. Also, meditation makes you look younger! Wooh, less oldness. None of us in PsiPog are actually over 25 I believe, so it's just a random fact.

			My little experience in deep relax is that to think about nothing is hard. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
For some of you it is maybe easy.
<br />
If you want to lie down and then relax and be without thoughts first you must:
<br />
watch your heart beating or watch your breathing.
<br />
After your body is relaxed you can drop any thought and just be.Relaxed body allows you be without thoughts.You just need to relax body first.Am i right? 
<br />
Another methods of non-thinking could be.
<br />
To put attention to one thing is harder than to put attention to many? <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />
You can put all your attention to all sounds. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> Its easy but really interesting...
<br />
Also you can put all your attention only what you see, or only what you touch.
<br />
As for me put all my attention to all sounds can let me go so deeply into myself without thoughts that..heh its so great and so...
