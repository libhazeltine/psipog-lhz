			Lately, there have been many people writing using 'internet shorthand', this is incredibly frustrating, as you have the opportunity to spell and use punctuation in a correct manner, but completely disregard it. For those of you that cant write properly (or think properly for that matter), ever wondered why your posts werent answered, or had hilarious posts about grammar on them, its because the people trying to help cant understand what the fuck youre saying. Remember, be a good Author and make your posts count, you dont want to waste your post counts on telling people what the fuck youre trying to talk about. English is appreciated, not MSN language. Some of you may think that im a complete grammar freak, but who gives a shit. If i cant read your post, i cant fucking help you.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

This is true.  I'm sure I've said this multiple times throughout my various posts, but if someone wants another person to read their post and take the time to answer it, then they should put effort into their post so that it's concise and grammatically correct.  If it's not easy to read because of shorthand or whatever, just don't reply to it.  Eventually some of these people will get the message if their questions go unanswered.

			A-fucking-men. I agree completely. I had people with bad grammar. If you're from a different country, I can understand. If you have only 2 functional fingers, I can understand that (unless they're your pointer fingers- you better chickenpeck you bastard!). But there is no excuse for being lazy and not typing a well-formed sentence. It's not hard. Just do it, pansy.

			In my thoughts this whole 'new generation' as I call it of members that have flocked in, well I havent seen so much fluff and just... Well low grade stuff on the forums. I mean the site used to be so great back in the day, i'm sure you other veterans remember, but it seems time has taken its toll.
<br />

<br />
I can't really even go down the psychokinesis forum without feeling like I'm in some anime chat room or some sort like that. Although, this arises the question, just where did the others go? I try to do my best nowadays to answer questions when I have the spare time, although my practices and meditations do take up a good amount of time, this is not to mention the post limitation.
<br />

<br />
In short I guess I am saying is that grammar, rather lack there of, isn't the only problem this forum is facing..

			This reminds me of a post somebody made on my other forums.  They were explaining that they couldn't log into the game and I asked them if they were typing in their password correctly.  Their response:
<br />

<br />
&quot;i m not tying whong, i r sure of dat.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Now see, this is why I actually like people with bad grammar.  It gives the rest of us something to laugh at.
