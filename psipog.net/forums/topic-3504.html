			That should be possible.. my friend and I have been trying to do it but we haven't had any success yet.  The way I see it, we'd have to be linked before we fall asleep and into a dream, and then we can find eachother through that still active link.

			I actually just joined this forum to ask something of a similar nature. :O
<br />

<br />
After doing extensive reading of psipog's articles, it seems like I'm suffering from an unintentional psychic link with someone and have been for the past eight years, a problem stemming from experiments with dreamlinking.
<br />

<br />
It started during innocent mutual OBE and TK experiments back in the middleschool days, both which have come to extreme fruition. I've tried to link experiences and experiments with other people, but this was my only real success case--we were definitely something of identical mental wavelengths. I think that's important, along with a burning desire to accomplish the said task. =)
<br />

<br />
I've had linked  projections with a person, many of which have been objectively verified (read: I place an imaginary item somewhere for you to find, and you give me a call and tell me what it was). We never practiced for the dream state, we went right for a dual projection: it helps if you have an agreed meeting place, be it a church, your backyard, an imaginy room. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> This was what worked for me, anyway. You must both, obviously, start at the same time. We also practiced constantly, and I believe that plus a routine was beneficial.
<br />

<br />
If you can find someone to wholeheartedly explore this area of consciousness, it is amazing. After a couple of successful attempts, I have found it gets infinitely easier to accomplish. It's also fun to compare the same experience from two different points of view--both of you picking up different details in the same scenery, for example. Sometimes only one of you will remember the night's experiment.
<br />

<br />
I have to add an extreme caution to this, however. I suspect whether or not you want to link yourself to someone indefinitely, this is an inexplicably potent method of doing so. PLEASE make sure both you and your partner are aware of this risk. This site has a lot of helpful things to say about linking. Sharing in something so beautiful with another person is emotionally transforming, as well as addictive. After dabbling in the dual projections for a period of time, linked dreams seemed to become a natural side effect (or dreamlike-remembered projections), as have been many other psi-related phenomena.
<br />

<br />
To summarize, dual-projection experiments practiced routinely, patiently, and diligently with another person will create dreamlinking and/or something far more awesome. =) I practiced this the same way I practiced solitary OBE, but with far better results. O.o But beware if you or your partner has any bleaker emotional elements lurking within, this WILL play a dynamic role in the link between you.
<br />

<br />
Interestingly enough, all of my experiments have been carried out with the two of us in separate locations (30-60 minutes driving distance), if anyone was curious about proximity.
<br />

<br />
I do believe proximity helps, but is in NO way necessary, based upon one experience: years after the original practice ended (we had neither seen nor practiced with each other for years), for the first time we wound up in a close-range sleeping proximity (bad weather); I had two significant dreams--neither of which I tried to have--both full of horrifically personal details about my link person which I relayed the next morning. The detail and clarity with which I dreamed had surpassed all other linked dreams, with few notable exceptions--and the clarity was likewise pure enough to leave the person frightened, speechless, and in avoidance of me since.
<br />

<br />
But this doesn't mean the link stopped feeding thoughts, dreams, emotions. I guess that's why I'm here. O.o
<br />

<br />
Dive with caution.

			Why do you say caution?? Does this have any danger or somthing? Can you explain the method you used to dreamlink?

			I outlined the method I used which resulted in affirmative dreamlinking:  rigorous practice of dual OBE. If two people attempt to project to the same place in a consistent practice routine, I have found the results to be more successful than my solitary OBE practice (given you and your partner &quot;connect;&quot; people whose thought processes differ more from my own I have found less successful than solitary practice).
<br />

<br />
I say caution because, in creating this extreme success, I cannot STOP the linking. I have been intimately, painfully linked to another person for over eight years, and it can become extremely emotionally draining. I say caution because I had no knowledge of linking and neither of us intended for this to happen. The dreamlinking/dual projection experiences have been beautiful beyond words. I am only cautioning you to be aware of the potential intimacy this can create between two people. It's mental/emotional/metaphysical nudity, if you will. The articles section of this site provides excellent information about linking: I suggest you read it just to generate more awareness between you and a prospective practice partner. I suppose I need to say WATCH OUT FOR NIGHTMARE LINKING. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
