			I come from a family of psychics anyway, so I don't really need to prove anything.
<br />
I don't even need to hide my abilities. I've always been a telepath/empath anyway. And Nanna (only other psychically perceptive member of the family, other than me) can't blame me for shielding. I had natural shields before I learnt energy manipulation anyway.
<br />

<br />
I'm ok as long as they don't think I'm actively practicing. No idea why they don't want me practicing, but meh.
<br />

<br />
PS: It's become a sort of family joke to say &quot;stop thinking so loudly!&quot; or &quot;WHY ARE THERE PEOPLE IN MY HEAD?!&quot;

and, i try not to make this public in my community. 20% of the people there are like that crazy cow woman from that movie.  (dork sided). i had the misfortune of practicing in front of one...

			I've had some weird chats with my dad sometimes. He's told me he tried telekenisis when he was younger along with other things. But he told me stuff like that can only be done if your born with it. I tried to tell him other wise but realized i shouldn't press it. I'll wait till i can actually move the wheel and not just shake it.

			I told my brother and my mom about it when I was 10.  My mom certainly didn't approve of it.  My brother made fun of me and PK...he kept throwing cheerios at me and telling me to move them... <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />

My mom was really skeptic about it and thought I was converting to a different religion or something.  Which is really weird.

So I practice in private now.  I've mastered Psi-balls, so now I'm going on to having constant OBE's. Hehe, OBE'er by night, PK'er by day...it is Yuliya!  Ultimate Psion!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" border="0" />
