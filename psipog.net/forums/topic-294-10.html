Your mom thinks baseball and math are evil?  I mean I get the Mountain Dew thing.  It's from the devil.  But who opposes baseball?

I'm not answering the poll because it's not particularly relevant for me.  My parents won't have any evidence that I'm still alive until I call for my father's birthday in a week.

			My parents (and I) don't believe in religion..  My dad doesn't really care, but my mom believes it. Though she doesn't think that it's something psychic, more that it's what you can accomplish when using more then 10% of your daily brainpower. I'm lucky, eh?

			I told my mum about it, so she gave the psiwheel a go, and she got it to spin, so i showed her that i could do it really well, and she dismissed it as me blowing on, that really did me angry   <img src="images/smiles/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" border="0" /> , but then the psiwheel started moving really fast, and my mum got freaked out, so i didnt bother showing her again. Anyway, a few days later, i told my dad, and he said something i didnt expect him to say, he said &quot;ahhh, good good, youre learning the old family abilities&quot; and i was like WTF, and he said &quot;before my mother and father died, they told me they could move things without touching them&quot; id never heard this before, so i just kept listening, and apparently, my dad started moving things when he was young, he said the bigest thing he ever moved was an iron candlestick, then he somehow didnt have enough time for Pk anymore, i think thats such a shame, because if he carried on practicing, imagine what he would be able to do now, he was 12 when he moved the candlestick, hes now 65, this is my dad, not grandad, anyway, i think thats really cool. My mum believes in my spoon bending, because ive done it infront of her, so im on my way to convincing her totally lol

Nice! <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> Sometimes I want to train more, at least enough to show amazing stuff to other people, but no one here would listen to me. 50% would say it's evil, the other 50% would say I was doing some magic tricks. Bleh. I always get so motivated, but it's quite difficult to try psionics all alone when no one around believes in you.
