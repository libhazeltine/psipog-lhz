			In an emergency situation, could you use Psionics to a degree you did not know existed inside of you?
<br />

<br />
I'll give an example. Let's say you are hiding from your little brother in some bushes beside a bridge. He comes up looking for you, and one way or another falls off the bridge. Is it possible that as he is falling, you could PK him gently to the ground?

			It depends. There have been numerous reports of people doing crazy things like lifting cars in extremely dangerous situations. Whatever your mind comes up with, I doubt people will get the idea to actually attempt such a thing in this state as it?s probably not on the &quot;emergency-plan&quot;-list. It does sound pretty nutty but so far all reports on these things did. I doubt anyone can give a serious response on this. That includes nay-sayers.

			People tend to tap into some psychic ability during life or death emergency, but usually it's the person in the situation. Although, I wonder, A psion mixed with such problem, would the effect be better?

			I think ppl will tap into the first thing that comes into their mind in the moment. If you pratice TK a lot, you may do it without even thinking.

			Palavara. It is better that you stop him from falling off the bridge through verbal communication, rather than hoping that you be able to float him to safety. Frankly, you will not, and he will plummet to his fate.

			I will relate an experience of mine that occured a month or little longer ago which deals with not exactly life and death but my sub-c kicked in anyhow.
<br />

<br />
I was taking care of couple wasp nests that needed to be gotten rid, was using a concrete hoe, and had water running through a hose that I dragged behind me as backup protection, and took care of the first nest no problem. The second nest I fucked up and nest fell down, lot more wasps then I thought there were and they were swarming toward me, now mind you I am scared to death of these blasted things, ran back to the hose and started to spray toward them, when I felt psi gather around me then a massive heatwave expanded outward from me. All but one wasp that was hit by the hose spray was burned to a cinder. Sub-c stepped in on it's own to protect me I guess, but it does go to show that under extreme circumstances, psionics will become much more powerful. 
<br />
Thought I'd relay the experience to all of you, and perhaps we can figgure out precisely what my sub-c did lol. 
<br />
any how thought might as well post it here help as motivational piece. It still boggles my mind thinking back on it, trying to figgure out precisely what happened gr.. beginning to hate my sub-c for doing stuff when I'm trying to learn lol. 
<br />

<br />
Believe it or not as you wish, it's just been in my experience that in dangerous situations sub-c tends to protect yourself.

<br />
Yes, I think it is entirely possible.
<br />

<br />
One word: Adrenaline.
<br />

<br />

<br />
If you get your adrenaline pumping, whether your scared or angry, and you beleive, It's entirely possible to do something you never thought you could do before.
<br />

<br />
~About that example....yes you could have slowed the force of gravity on him. Causing his fall to slow down a bit.

			the only experience iv had with this is as follows:
<br />

<br />
i was pissing around with my friend, and he pulled a BB gun on me...
<br />

<br />
earlier that day i had put up a PK shield but it didnt really work so i was frustrated.
<br />

<br />
back to the story...
<br />

<br />
he shot me from about a foot away, and i hate guns you see, my natural instinct was to cover myself, but my reactionswere too slow anyways. i just froze and got a major adrenaline rush.
<br />

<br />
the BB seemd to actualy bounce off the shield somehow and it hit my friend. it didnt make any contact with me, so im really confused. anyways i have a video camera, and its one of my research projects for this summer <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
