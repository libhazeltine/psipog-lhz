			Okey, well I just remembered a weird experience I had a 3 years ago and I thought I could ask you guys about it.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, I was taking the bike home from a school I had been to for some meeting, and I had just started cycling from the school, and then suddenly, I was at home! <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> I could just remember me getting on the bike and cycling for 2-3 minutes and then standing at the door to my house to lock it up. It's about a 20 minute trip from the school to my house, and there's alot of roads that i need to cross to get home, so I can't really imagine me not being aware of the happenings along the way home. 
<br />

<br />
Could my subconscious have taken over and could my mind have fallen asleep? And do you have any idea what could have triggered this state of consciousness if that's the case?

			That's weird. lol. Maybe you teleported, hehe. Sometimes if you day dream, you kind of lose focus of whats going on around you and a long time seems like nothing. Maybe you slowed your perception of time.

			Lol, this reminds me of a time that i was working on a piece of beethoven's music on the piano. I had just started to play the song, was 3:45 in the afternoon, my mind zonked out or something, when mom hollered at me, it was after 5:30, and I was still on the same note that I was playing before I zonked out. Lets just say that occurence totally freaked me out <img src="images/smiles/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" border="0" />

Well, the thing is that I wasn't really daydreaming or anything, it was just like I had jumped from here to there without any thought at all. I know of times I've been day dreaming and off somewhere and not noticing the world around me, but it was not like that this time. It was like my movements were automated or something and my mind was asleep. I had no memories at all of the trip and I didn't remember me thinking of something else neither.

			Your brain switched into alpha mode.  This usually happens in people who are driving.  They report remembering getting into their cars, and then BAM, they're at their destination.  It's a kind of trance, nothing extraordinary and certainly nothing harmful.

Yeah, my mom said that's what happens to her sometimes and she doesn't have to think where she is going, because it is so routine you sub-concious does it for you.

			Hmm yeah, it could be something like that. But it was not really a routine so it's still kinda weird since I didn't attend to that school at the time. Ah well, thanks for the input. Now I don't really have to be scared of my subconscious taking over <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> j/k

This is quite right, nothing abnormal.  It can seem scary after the fact when you realize you weren't quite aware of driving.
<br />

<br />
It has happened to me on quite a few occasions I must admit, usually quite early into the morning.

			Nanaman,

You experienced meditation. A bit like roy said, but I do not fully agree there, because while in alpha mode you can still be aware of your surroundings and you still have some sense of time, albeit more abstract. In real meditation, two hours are over, and it feels like 20 seconds.

			the answer is simple...
<br />
you havo got yourself consciously that your trip to the home was made unconsciously.
<br />

<br />
If its the first time you felt this.. its very good.You become aware in your daily life.The most simple things like - eating, going home, going into the shop, doing smth else are very robotic ( i mean you do it very good, as a robot, without awareness )
<br />
watch yourself more and more and soon you will feel smth, or see smth, or hear smth...experience...
<br />
dont listen to people who are saying... you was teleporting, alpha waves and other shit stuff... also... doubt as much as you can...feel that experience and doubt on what they we all say to you.
<br />
personaly im very proud of you.Thats a nice start ( surprise too <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> )

			Something like that happened to me a few times when I was a child. Once I was specifically sitting up in my bed and I wasn't remotely tired. It was early so none of my older sisters were in bed. I literally blinked and it was hours later with my sisters both asleep. I was still in the sitting up position.
<br />

<br />
I guess I fell asleep or something without realizing but I don't just fall asleep. I have to be really tired and laying down for awhile and it never just seems like a blink.

			I know this feeling, and i've wondered the same thing. This has happened to me at least 20 times within the past year. Here, i'll mention two.
<br />

<br />
1: Couldnt get my City of Heroes Timecard Working (game fanatic). One of the numbers i kept typing in was wrong but since they look alike it was now taking me over 20 minutes. I could tell my subconscious was becoming frustrated. Without my own control, i typed in a couple numbers (that i cant remember now) and it worked!
<br />

<br />
2: Same thing with travel. I was walking from my house to a street called Steinway, near my house. And all of a sudden i was in front of Eb Games.
<br />

<br />
The way i figure it, its just a sort of trance your mind puts you in to make things easier on you.
