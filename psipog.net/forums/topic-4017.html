			Hello, Ill get right down to the point, Ive been wanting to includ some of my close friends with psi practice but hey have a strong disbelief or skepticism against it. So what I want to ask is if someone skilled in the art of telepathy could do some long distance online experiements for me, mainly number guessing or somthing simple. Ok thanks for your time, my conctact info is in my profile.

			Ever thought skepticism is a healthy attitude, far more mature than blind acceptance?  Something like 52% of the scientific community believes in Psi phenomena (parapsychology surveys have actually been done time and time again).  Those scientists ARE skeptics but still have been persuaded that psi exists, so skepticism is not the problem in any way.  Deliberate ignorance and the desire to force your beliefs onto others is the problem, and that's exactly the qualities you're demonstrating.

			Basically all of the skeptics on these types of websites are forceful, ignorant and arrogant. There is nothing wrong about being a skeptic, the thing that doesnt make a good skeptic is, for example:
<br />

<br />
maxus: Hey man, i just moved a psiwheel using Telekinesis
<br />
Skeptic: No you did not, Telekinesis does not exist, youre a complete fucking liar and you know you are, it must have been heat currents from your hands or static from the air, because Telekinesis doesnt exist, im right, youre wrong, end of discussion, you lieing bastard.

			Have you ever thought about just having a friendly talk/debate on the topic? That's always something fun to do with people with skepticism, especially ones that aren't assholes.....I can always do some RV for them even though I'm pretty rusty as of late...

dont get me started on how many ppl have done that to me. ugh they r soooo frustrating like that. they just have to argue and prove a point to themselves. of course no one should be discouraged by these skeptics most of the ones i have met were addicted to some illegal substance. <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

I don't understand why people hate skeptics. I mean, it's not like we're trying to take your money or hurt you or anything, we're just skeptical about a few things you believe in... I mean, it's like evangelistic Christians, almost; some Christians will refuse to even touch anything an atheist has touched (not many, though). I just don't understand it...
