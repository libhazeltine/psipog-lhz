			Not only do I believe, but I investigate them (www.cufort.org) and also am a field investigator for MUFON.
<br />

<br />
I have seen some in my younger years, and have some amazing video (u can check some of them out at the site).
<br />

<br />
I definately believe that telepathy is THE ONLY way to communicate with aliens.  
<br />

<br />
I have never seen one face to face (that I can conciouslly recall) but imagine I have had some contact (as at least 70-80% of the population) with them.
<br />

<br />
I had a psychic who did not know me tell me about my direct connection with them when I was little.  This person knew all about me without personally knowing me.  It pretty much sent shivers down my spine each time he began telling me all about my past and me (all true).  He was possibly simply scanning my memories...
<br />

<br />
In any case, if you are seriously interested in UFOs there are hundreds of good sources to learn out there.
<br />

<br />
Where are you from?  what state if in the us?

			Why would telepathy be the only way to communicate with aliens? I mean, who says telepathy isn't frowned upon in aliens civilizations (if there are any)? I believe in aliens, but I have my doubts about small, grey people with big eyes. I would assume that an alien race intelligent enough to visit us would be able to learn our languages.

			I don't think it would be the only way to communicate with them, but since we may communicate in two completely different ways (we use sounds, but there's no reason to assume that they do too), telepathy would probably be the best way, or at least help us to learn each other's languages.

			I think that we should try to communicate with aliens telepathically. All of those legends about them knowing PK and stuff... maybe they know a really easy way to do it.

If you want some stories on UFOs, go to <a href="http://www.unsolvedmysteries.com" target="_blank">www.unsolvedmysteries.com</a> because they have tons of them. They also have some awesome jokes and stuff.

			I think they are. If we can use telepathy, I'm quite sure that they can do it too. But perhaps they wouldn't be able to understand us telepathically? I mean ... Since they're alien, they might be so different that it would be impossible to communicate with telepathy.

			Indeed,
<br />

<br />
I mean telepathy helps us just communicate to others, but there is still the language barrier, we can send messages but there is no guarentee they will understand what it means at all, its like talking to someone who speaks a forgeign language that you dont know at all and they are speaking fast. The only way i'd think it may be possible is to communicate pictures to them, but then again with no information on their culture we dont know how they will take it, remember this is a culture clash of the highest degree if we do make viable contact...and through history we have seen two things happen, both assimilate to one another and things go well...or blood is shed.
<br />

<br />
Now then as to if I believe in aliens? Sure I do believe there is something else out there. Do I believe they are little green men? No. As like said above I do believe they wouldnt come to earth to just make crop circles and dice up cows. Also the fact of matter is we have no speculation on how aliens could or would look, they may not be bipedal, they could of evolved into a conscious energy form. Or for all we know the truely intelligent lifeforms are far away and havent even discovered us. I do believe there is something else out there, the universe is to expansive to not have others, but I do not believe everything else is beyond us, for all we know we could be one of the more highly evolved species in the universe... all in all I think we arent alone and alien lifeforms are out there, but I dont bite into the crop circle, little green men, cow dicing, flying saucer hype sort of thing you find in stuff like the National Inquierer.
