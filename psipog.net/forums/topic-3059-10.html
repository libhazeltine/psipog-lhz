			Changing eye color in Photoshop is piece of cake. It can be easily faked (using color replacement tool or even a brush).
<br />
I wish changing eye color were easy in real life as well <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> . Oh well, back to meditation  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			A vieo would be more believable than a photo, since it's much harder to fake videos. Of course, people could always use the old conact lens, which is a bitch really, cus there's not proof exept that you do it yourself.

			I once saw a picture of coowl dragon lenses. They cover your whole eyes( also the white part... well.. the white part that can be seen ) and they look like dragon eyes. Maybe if one would become really good at this it would be possible? And I don't think it'd be possible to say: Those are lenses! Because they kost something like $360, and I don't think anyone is willing to spent that much money just to make people believe they did it with their mind.
<br />

[EDIT: This is the link(they have other coowl lenses too): <a href="http://www.fxeyes.com/custom_lenses.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.fxeyes.com/custom_lenses.html</a>

			I doubt you would be able to make the whites of your eyes go that colour. It would maybe really damage your health. I mean, they must be like that for some reason.

			But what if you don't change the color of the eye itself? Maybe you could make an innocent layer above the eye with the wanted color / pattern.

			Oh. Ok.

If I were going to provide proof, I'd at least make a video...those are harder to edit and therefore provide more stability than a photo.

My parents, however, won't let me have a video recorder. Won't even let me have a camera... <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" border="0" />

Oh well. I see these changes, and that is what counts, not whether various people choose to believe me or not. Myeh.

Not hard to import a .filmstrip file into photoshop and edit each frame individually... just time consuming.

The longer the video, in this case, the more convincing.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Spooky indeed, but I'll keep trying no matter what  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> (For some reason I'm sure I can't die. Not now. I'm serious.There are some really weird things happening on my life o.0).
<br />

<br />
Anyway it's been 1 week and 2 or 3 days since I started and the results are... little. LITTLE. I'm getting mad =P, but I'll keep at it. I've noticed my meditations now are usually longer and deeper

Maybe you should only try this on yourself. At least untill you get more advanced... It might make a difference.
