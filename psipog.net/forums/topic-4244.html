			It's been a while since I started training on psionics. I've never got any 'good' results, and actually this stuff gives me a lot of trouble (like, my mom thinks it's evil or something like that). My psiballs are weak, and I don't even know if I can call them psiballs. I've never moved a single thing with PK, ok, i'm training for a little time (1 month). This is the same for Micro-PK, i can't do a thing. I'm growing tired, nothing happens, it's always the same old house, the same old people, the same old hope that makes me try things which look impossible for most people. And everytime I try, all I get is 'NO'. The wheel stands still, and sometimes I just end up thinking this is all fake, and that I can't change a thing in life. 
<br />
I'm quite a depressive guy, I can't bear a thing, and at the same time all I want is to believe that I can change &quot;everything&quot; I want if I try harder and do my best.
<br />

<br />
I wake up, I have some fun, I play video games, I go to school, but this life seems so... empty for me. I have many people around me, I have parents, I have a religion, everything seems fine to me. But I can't stand this anymore. I have absolutely no motivation. It seems so difficult, it seems impossible. How do you people get so motivated to do it? How do you convince yourself that you can do it?

			Well, ... there's just a matter of how much effort are you willing to put into it. Some people need more time, some need less, but they <span style="text-decoration: underline">all succeed in the end</span>. I say just practice until you get it, then your motivation will go up 500%.

peace ?

			Dude.....you sound almost......suicidal.  You might have some issues in your life that you need to solve before you can monivate yourself enough to perform PK.
