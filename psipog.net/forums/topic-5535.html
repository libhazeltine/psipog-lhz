			well, i tried to have an OBE for the first time last night
<br />
I got to the point where my whole body was &quot;asleep&quot;...i couldnt feel it any more, and in some spots it felt a little tingley.  Then sudden i got this strange pushing feeling.  It felt like someone had put their palm on the top of my head and pushed me down.  Do you think i was starting to leave my body and just freaked and went back in?
<br />

<br />
Then the second time i tried, i got my whole body asleep and everything like before.  Then something was bothering me, so i opened my eyes, just my eyes, I didnt move anything else, and the rest of my body was still asleep, I still couldnt feel anything but my eyes.  Then i moved my head, and i couldnt feel anything but my head, then my arms and I coudlnt feel anything but my head and my arms...So basically I had to wake up every body part individually...Is that normal?
<br />

<br />
I've also been wondering something else...Is an OBE a type or lucid dream, or are you literally leaving you body and your spirit (or soul or conciousness or whatever you call it) is goign out into the physical world?
<br />
If you move an object during an OBE, will it be moved when you go back to your body?

			I havent been too sucessful at an actual OBE but i have had the symptoms that frequently lead up to the outer body experience. but when you seriously OBE (and you'll be 1000% for sure) you should be more concerned with experiencing it as if it were a dream, not trying to affect the REAL life aspects through the OBE.
