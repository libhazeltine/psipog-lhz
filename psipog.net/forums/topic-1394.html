			Okay, so I am in ninth grade now.  About a month ago, I realized that someone in my eighth grade class last year was probably a telepathist.  A mind-reader telepathist.  Here is my reasoning, tell me what you think.  The poll doesn't make alot of sense right now, but it will.
<br />

<br />
Mind reading ability evidence
<br />

<br />
1.  He started singing this song one time by Jimmy Buffet.  I don't think Jimmy Buffet is that well known, but I am not sure, so that's why the poll is up.  I listen to Jimmy Buffet, and was thinking about his songs earlier that day.
<br />

<br />
2.  He only once asked me about video games, he was asking me if I played TimeSplitters.  (Great game btw.)  That's my favorite game.  Also, one does not really play TS 3 (the one he played) without playing at least the second one.  I kept asking him about the lasergun (darn, they got rid of that in TS 3)  and he didn't know what I was talking about.  He might have been testing his abilities, if indeed this is the case.
<br />

<br />
Basic Psionics-related evidence
<br />

<br />
3.  There was a research project we had to do in science class.  His chosen element was potassium.  Nothing big here, but I think I remember potassium as a mineral as being related to psionic performance.
<br />

<br />
4.  Once I brought in a pendulum into school.  I use it as a lie detector.  As you can probably see by my set up and stuff, I do like to do detective work, so I like to have something to use as a lie detector.  We were asking each other if we were stupid while holding the pendulum or whatever, just doing weird things.  At the time, I was not a big psionics practicer or anything, I had some basic knowledge and a few minor skills.  It's too bad I didn't see all this earlier.  Anyway, I told him that these lie detectors could amplify psychic abilities.  I don't know why I said this, it was pretty random, as I figured the chance of there being another psionicist in the school are pretty small.  He said, &quot;really?&quot; in a very excited/ enthusiastic tone.  This is a weird thing to say, unless you are trying to hide your ablilities.  If he was a psionicist, he probably would have known this, if he didn't know anything about psionics, why did he seem excited at all?
<br />

<br />
5.  At lunch, I saw two of his freinds doing something strange that could most likely be explained as practicing telepathy.  Each had their hand pressed up against the other's forehead, and they had their eyes shut and it looks like they were concentrating pretty hard.  Then they cayght me looking at them and resumed eating or whatever.  Why a lunchroom though?  That's a pretty noisy place to practice telepathy.
<br />

<br />
So, I hope you read all that.  What do you think?  Is he a telepathist or is this all a hideous fluke of probability?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
EDIT:  I remembered one more thing on post #16 (first one on last page)
<br />
I could pick him and his friends out of a crowd much more easily than anyone else, since I was practicing psychometry/ general sensitivity back then.  Of course, he was pretty much my best friend in school, so that might have something to do with it, I don't know.

			Well, could be, couldn't be. Some of those situation might prove themselves as evidence, but they might be just coincidences...
<br />

<br />
Try to discover if he is indeed a psion. When talking to him ask randomly about mind abilities and such and if believes in those, use some article as an excuse... try to figure some way of starting a conversation leading to that topic. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I would like to, but I go to another school.  He doesn't go to my high school.  He was at my middle school.  We were pretty good friends, maybe someone at my high school will know his email adress or something, for some reason I never got it.  Maybe if worse comes to worst and I need to find out, I might be able to get his street adress or something online.
<br />

<br />
But yeah, that's a good idea if I do contact him.  I was trying to think of some way to work in my question subtly and slowly.

If he thinks I'm crazy, well, I can think of something.  Some article someone might have posted an err...  More normal message board. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			What does it matter if you meet another person interested in Psi?
<br />

<br />
----
<br />
Edited:
<br />

<br />
What I mean is; Are you into to psi to find companionship, or are you in it to discover something unknown, and to push the limits of reality?
<br />

<br />
Also, the few things you have stated do not provide enough evidence to say whether or not the person was a &quot;Psion&quot;.

			I am trying to get your opinion, based upon the facts I have laid out... Do you think he was a psionicist or not?  He does not go to my new school and I don't see him anymore.
<br />

<br />
@Ribbitribbity- if I ever am in this situation again, that's a good idea.  Almost every psionicist knows what it is.
<br />

<br />
@michellethemit- I am not a very good telepath.  I could try pinging, I have had some luck with that...
<br />

<br />
@bladeslinger- I have just kept a shield up with a message imprinted on it, just in case he tries again, but why would he if he doesn't see me anymore?
<br />

<br />
@Sheepking- More like the second one.  And this is all the evidence I have.  I'll see if I can think of any more.

I checked, but he doesn't have one, from what I could find; oh, well.

btw, I don't have one either.

The only problem is, if I get his e-mail account, it will seem a bit weird if I havn't talked to him in a while, and the first thing I talk to him about is what he thinks of the paranormal.

so what you're saying I'm crazy now?! Is that it? That's it I'm going to beat you up......
<br />

<br />

<br />
nah ignore that its a J/K comment.
<br />

<br />
From what I've read I would have to say it was all a coincidence but when I read the last reason that really did sum it up. 
<br />

<br />
But maybe they were checking if someone has a fever or something either that or they're just wierd. (unless you count the psionic theory)
<br />

<br />
I'd practice tp a bit more and then ping him myself.
<br />

<br />
or I'll just releveant metaphorical questions the next time I see him.
