I saw a cartoon vid of an experiment done by scientists on particles. They fired them through a wall with holes in. I can't remember the details of it but when they surveyed it with cameras, the pattern on the wall that they hit at the end was different; the particles changed their path through the holes. I have been thinking...what if this is related to pk in any way? Think about the technique on forkyou.com. They talk about directing your attention somewhere else...then it suddenly bends.

you are either talking about the photoelectric effect or interference. Are you sure it was particles? It wasn't a laser? Because if you shoot a laser through what's called a diffraction grating the light goes through slits and interferes with itself and forms a pattern of constructive and destructive interference on the screen. This interference is one of the eperiements that proves the wave properties of lights. Of course, there are other experiements that prove the particle properties of light like the photoelectric effect. here check this out to read more:

			Nope. It definetely wasn't a laser. It was electrons or just particles I think. They were shot rapidly at a wall with holes in it with a back wall behind that. They hit the back wall and formed a pattern consistent to the holes. When they videoed it (don't ask me how in the hell they did that) the pattern was completely different. Oh hang on. No it's the other way round. When they were watching it, they were normal, and when they didn't watch it, they were all weird in their pattern. It was talking about how matter behaves differently when it isn't seen, like it's not in existence.

			Exactly. All electrons, all peices of matter, are existant, and non existant at the same time. I point to Schrodinger's Cat experiment. It states that a cat in a box, with a canister of poison and a molecule that every hour has an exact 50 percent chance of either decaying and emitting a particle, or not decaying. Due to this exact 50 percent chance, the particle is suspended in a decaying/non-decaying state. This holds true for the cat, as it is suspended in both death and life. Only until the box is open, and is observed by an observor, is the determination of decayed or not decayed, life or death. Put a human through this experience, and he is suspended in a state of immortality(as naturally all things are immortal). In one universe, he lives, in one universe he dies. But this goes way off topic into the realm of multiple universes.
<br />

<br />
Quantum mechanics describes all particles of matter as suspended as both existant and non-existant. However, once the brain, or the collection of many brains conceive such particles to exist, well, they simply exist. This brings about the fundamental explanation of the powers of the mind. With enough strain on the powers of the brain, the conception of any object to exist, or not exist, is a very real thing and has been a very real thing all along. It is the rules of the universe, that every organism has control of. It is why my thoughts can be your thoughts as well. Because the electrical impulses in my brain differ not at all from the electrical impulses of your brain, of any animal's brain, as well as EVERY piece of matter in this universe. The electrons, and it's probabilistic nature is an underlying force of nature that mother's intuition, a school of fish, and guard dogs smelling fear that backs up every thing that we as human beings are really capable of. Which is quite literally, anything if you believe.

			The most embarassing part is, I've been able to only barely move a psi wheel which was like 2 minutes ago. I guess I just had never got around to trying it out. I feel spent of energy!(I'm assuming I'm supposed to feel this way?) I do feel energy coming from others, especially people who look like they realize these things, quite readily though. All of this has been in my head for months now, conversing with friends on the matter of quantum physics. Only recently..last week did I really realize what the fuck is really going on in this world. Phenomenal if you ask me.

Your &quot;failure&quot; could have to do with your view on how to perform Psychokinesis, and how you think you should feel during/after it.
<br />

<br />
You may &quot;believe&quot; something, but not truly believe it, understand?
<br />

<br />
Convince yourself of your beliefs, of the method you are using, and then perform Psychokinesis, it will work.

			I don't see my experience as a failure in the least bit! And believe me, I realize exactly what you are saying. I know that my mind has not even came close to molding to what I know is true from what beliefs are still stuck in my mind, whether that be sub-conciously or still conciously.

			going along with Rev's amazing post giving a jist of everything, he talks about string theory. I like the theory myself and it seems to go along with psionics, but since the 'strings' are soooo small, no one has been able to scientifically prove or disprove this theorem. No experiments have even been done!! They have been able to measure the strings because they're so unimaginably small.

			Oh, I absolutely agree that string theory is the vital key to connecting all of this. Like I said, string theory relates every peice of matter to another through a mass matrix web of such string-like connection. Making the connection between such electrical impulses possible. Scientists like Albert Einstein searching all their life for the Theory of Everything could quite possibly find it in studying the string theory more in depth.

			ya true that.
<br />
i just wish it was a little more plausible when it comes to actually proving it.
<br />
people wouldn't at us like we're nuts because now psionics has been scientifically explained!!!

			This is an absolutely amazing program that aire on nova a few years back on string theory. It is 3 one hour long programs that explains everything really clearly and precisely. If you are at all interested in cutting edge theoretical physics, you should watch this.

			Just a post to tell you that this is an amazing thread ! I believe we are many to read an appreciate. Thanks.
<br />

<br />
Recently, i began to see waves! Not only waves, but what I think is polarity of objects (it can move so fast)! Our eyes are design to react not only to colors but to other &quot;kind&quot; of electromagnetic &quot;radiation&quot;. The idea that we are interacting with waves of electrons correspond to empirical evidence for me. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Seeing&quot; is one of our senses that seems to be very tough to train but it's design to analyse electromagnetic waves. It can be such a tool, trust me.
<br />

<br />
Maybe I'am a little off topic here but I will give you a personal training technique. Tell you eyes that there are hidden patterns everywhere. Stay unfocus with the eye's open (like when you try to find hidden holographic image), make a psiball and look beetween your hands. Practice more than once.
<br />

<br />
Tip: I think that the touch feeling of energy (except when making a psiball) is a rebound of a wave on an object.
<br />

<br />
Continu this great thread.
<br />

<br />

			Strangly enough Mordak, but I believe what you are talking about I saw in great detail last night. Of course, I was on some drugs, but in an instant, the entire realm of these brightly colored, cube shaped systems became aparant to me. It overcame me in a sense, and my entire vision was overtaken by a lot of systematically positioned(i.e. not randomly placed, but extremely extremely orderly) cubelike structures. But this seems to be the same patterns that I tend to see when looking at any object. That staticy electromagneticness... I don't know if you guys know exactly what I'm talking about, but it's definately something that I am well aware of.
