			so, I figured i'd train PK  the hardcore way, by staring at something about 100 times the weight of a psiwheel like a stapler and trying to slide it. I sit on the front row in front of my teachers desk, and had enough free time to mess around, and tried about everything.  I tried visualizing it as an instinct, like a hand coming out of my body and grabbing it, to visualizing hooks coming out of me and grabbing it, and towing it towards me, to blasting it with all the psi i could muster.  I didn't see the stapler move a fraction of a nanometer, but I did see it kind of skew to one direction, almost like a cartoon, sort of stretching to the right alittle. I figured i must've bent the light around it with PK instead of the actual stapler, or maybe i'm just seeing it shifting alittle because i wanted it to move so badly.

			I can do that at will. It's not bending light, well...I'm pretty sure. I've never done that to someone else before. Everytime I move something or try to move something it seems to skew and bend. Sometimes it helps and I can actually feel it's resistance and...&quot;will&quot; to bend the other way sometimes. And 80% of the time it ends up moving that way when it does move. It might be predicting what way it would move if it did, it might be bending light, whatever. I just use it to make it look like it's moving to give me confidence. I sorta say to my brain, &quot;look it moved&quot; and then my head thinks, &quot;that was me?&quot;. Usually moves in the end.

btw, do it at the ground, makes you feel like your high. Basically manual hallucination but on a small and basic level. Tis funny when aimed at people sometimes.

You're fucking stupid. That doesn't even remotely help see energy as that ,too, is a vision illusion.

It's just your eyes. Usually you're loosing focus of one point so your right eyes isn't combing with your left...so it distorts things...such as streatching or double image. (at least, that's how it seems to me)

That's pretty much it.  My first thought was basically &quot;they're staring too hard.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I remember trying to move an extention cord that was on the floor... I stared at it so long that the colors started inverting (y'ever stare at a color for long enough, then look at a piece of paper, and it's burned there on your retina in the opposite color?  Yeah, that's it) and my eyes went wacky.  I thought the cord was moving, but after blinking once or twice, I realized that it wasn't going anywhere.

			Yeah, that happens to me, it's just your eyes unfocussing.  Now, if we have an analogy:  Which is going to make you stronger: trying to lift a 300 pound weight until you can, or gradually working up to it?  But sorry, I am going to have to agree with nevezea here.  By the way, it takes the gravity of planets much larger than the earth to create gravitational lensing, so I doubt that's what's going on.
<br />

<br />
EDIT:  I meant to say, it takes those planets to create <span style="font-style: italic">visual</span> gravitational lensing, because, technically, everything creates it.
