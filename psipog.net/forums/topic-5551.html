Look, your talented. You could easily learn to send telepathic message sto people, but receive them as well. You could train your self to force haulicination and scna for whatever information you want from somebodies mind.

Sure, shielding will stop it when you dont want to. But dont be one of those people who habituates their power instead of developing it to even cooler hieghts.

Why cant you make your shield move with you?  are you structuring it to something other than yourself?  If you start by building it inside of you and slowly spreading it out and around, it should move with you as well.  Just use a simple programming when you create it, and it should only limit random thoughts from entering, instead of all, right?

			you're only focusing on one thing.  ground.  focus on your root.  the shielding problem should go away.  learn to focus on different parts of your body - try to lift yourself up into the subtle a little and see the energy - makes it easier to manipulate.

			to say that shielding does not work is to misunderstand shielding btw.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Sheilds are constructs of energy that follow you around that i programmed to a certain task.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I suggest you read all psipogs texts on shielding. Cause it DOES work quiteeasily.

Phht. Stop complaining. Ask someone a question, they'll think the real answer, but say a lie. 
<br />
Like, that would be good when asking someone if they like you, or if you're a cop. =D

Construct manipulation isn't always &quot;easy&quot; for everyone. You may find it quite easy, while others may struggle for a long time.
<br />

<br />
Practice making various types of shields. The articles, although helpful, do not lend themselves to each and every individual that comes across them. If you find something that works for you, then use it. If not, then you're going to need to keep looking.
