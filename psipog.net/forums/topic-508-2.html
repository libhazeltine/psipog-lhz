Nice try bub, never did anyone say that we need an article for something to be fact, which psi isnt. What were saying is that if you can harness the incredibly vast powers of nature then you may as well replace your name with God on your birth certificate. In addition, I will get on your case about lieing due to people not needing to be falsly persuaded into some persons false statements. There are younger people on these forums (which Im beginning to think you fall into) who are new to PK, they dont need to be practicing unreal skills.

			All for a Fluff Sticky
<br />
But then again all fluff should really be disproven before its put aside.
<br />

<br />
Tests such as the finding forecast for the next day and changing it would be relatively conclusive.
<br />
So i tend to wait until the statement has been disproven or proven for the reason to not instantly scorn someone who could believe it totally.
<br />
I admit i am sceptical about this but:
<br />
Theres a whole world of unknown out there.  Be patient.

			I'd say weather control would indeed be possible, for an extreme master of Macro-Kinesis. I mean ok a nudge in the right direction, but ask yourself how you are going to counteract EXTREMELY HIGH WINDS with that of your own unless you can create a gust of wind that can tip a book case over with just lifting your hand.
<br />

<br />
This said I dont like be extremely zealous on one side or another unless I am extremely zealous to something. So i'll state this to counter it.
<br />

<br />
During times a few times of high emotional importance to me (important talks with my girlfriend and what not) I found an odd occurance. It was raining here on that day and I was talking to her over MSN, now then there was something very important I said to her and I had to wait on a response from her (Now this was important and I was in a very anxious moment filled with many thoughts/emotions on what could happen next), during said time the rain picked up and was falling extremely hard, I heard a huge difference in it. It wasnt untill after she answered did the rain die down, about a few seconds after she answered. I'm chalking that one up to coincedence, though I must say it was a cool coinencidence, me and her both love the rain afterall. 
<br />

<br />
Now that i've show some arbitration, some not fully arbitrating, but with that sound i'll end on this note. Manipulation of the weather would require massive amounts of skill in the field of Macro-Kinesis and it's subfield (Pyro, Cyro-kinesis) for one to do so, and if they could well control the weather then could do what Uri Gellar claimed to do and bend steel, or pretty much create the same effects the Hutchenson Effect made. Basically i'm say it's pluasable, but for the amount of training needed i'd say for we who practice Psionics it's not possible.
<br />

<br />
Again, extreme Macro-Kinesis....highly extreme.
<br />

<br />
Thats just the wolf's 2 cents

			Hmm.. that's quite interesting.
<br />

<br />
I don't know about controlling the weather... but I have had experiencing with influencing wind patterns before, on a small scale.
<br />

<br />
Now, I mostly practice pretty much everything with tactile visualization. &quot;Feel&quot; and &quot;push&quot; and all that jazz. Anyway, I was walking home from the bus stop one day, and the wind was blowing in my face (For some reason it always seems to be blowing directly at me-- never behind me or to the side... Oi. &gt;.&gt;), and it was really kind of annoying. So, me being the absolutely mature person that I am, kind of like... this is the part that's hard to explain.. &quot;threw&quot; a whole bunch of energy at it. Not necessarily psi (though it probably was), but like this burst forward towards the wind. And I swear that breeze backed down a little bit, like I had pushed it back. It was kind of cool, but I was also extremely freaked out about it. And this has happened on <span style="font-style: italic">multiple</span> occasions. I mean literally probably nearing twenty times. I'm like okay, seriously, the wind is not supposed to actually react like that. lol
<br />

<br />
Like I said, I don't know if that counts as controlling the weather, but... just an experience.

			I specifically said that the conditions must be right. There are techniques for this that do help. Emotion is actually quite useful with this. I know that it helps PK for you to visulise the psiwheel to be a part of you. It is kinda simmilar for weather control. As I said, the conditions must be right and the effects are a bit slow and subtle, but it works. I have saved days ou.  from being cancelled by rain. When I discovered this skill a few years ago, I tried to get out of having to do something by making it rain. I believed that I could do it and it turned out that I did.

This is exactly what I was talking about. Imagin the same thing, but constant. It easily goes with the flow and the you leave it. I am not totally sure how this works, but I reckon that moving clouds aroung (which is really what most of this is) must be pretty easy with a bit of wind.
<br />

bringdownthesystem, really? I have never tried it on such a large scale. I am so relieved to be backed up for once. I am not trying to lie to anyone. I was just making an attempt to spread knowlage of a new skill. I have  been practicing psichic powers for years I would not believe this if I had not discovered it myself.

			Wont hurt you, but mess up the delicate balance of nature yes.
<br />

<br />
Even if possible I think its better to NOT have this skill widespread and practiced, if everyone starts changing the weather all over, well we could easily just destroy the world with all the huge shifts in climate and what not. Seriously your playing with something that should be left to run its course, as if pollution wasn't bad enough.

			I have used this power many, many times. The change of weather, as I said, is most very often subtle. No one cares too much is some clouds move a tiny bit to (un)cover the sun or drop rain a bit further on. Don't worry. It is nothing like the infamous butterfly effect. The effects, while much bigger than most psichic powers, the effect is only on a reletively small area (nothing more than a mile in diamiter). I don't think that this will effect the balance of nature much. It hasn't so far. And I am sure that this skill can be used maliciously.

			I agree with both ShadowWolfX and Ignium, best to leave it alone.  With this ability comes responsibility.  As it is, we are already experienceing strange weather.  I wonder how many others have it; could they have an effect on the weather and not be aware of it? <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />
