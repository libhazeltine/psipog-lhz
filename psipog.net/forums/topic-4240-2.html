yeah I heard of that before, I didn't think it made sense though because I have several dreams where I fall and supposedly hit the ground. But then I realized that you never actually hit the ground in those falling dreams, oyu always wake up before it. So if anybody has actually had a dream in which you fall and actually hit the ground please post it or had a dream where had the experience of dying.

			THE THING
<br />
i had a dream ( its propa random though and iv had it more then once ) Iam in an orange car on the motor way. its in the afternoon because its geting dark and raining. This thing jumps infront of the car, we braked and slide sideways into it, as we hit it it goes over the car roles abit and stops dead? then it goes blank and i wake up in the dream still in the car like i had just come around from being unconshious, everyone is dead exept me. i get out of the car in a frenzy upset ,mad,sad, then i see it and terror strikes me, it doesnt look scary, i can handle how it looks (dark figure no eyes sharp teeth claws)but for some reason i know its going to wake up, and i know its evil. some how i find a hole near where the car crashed it must be from where the car hit but it leads into the sewers its deep with runing water i drag the thing in and cover it with a large pease of concreat then with peables. the motor ways empty and im wondering what to do knowing that i have to get away but not wanting to leave the car and my dead family, still upset i sit next to the car waighting. Then out of no where i hear some one i look and its my friend franticly trying to dig the fing up rambeling about how its her kid or something. i pull her off and tell her  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> its too late?(to late for what? i duno) anyways then my view flips to inside the hole onto the things eye as it opens. i grab my friend arm and start runing across this field everythings quiet just the wind and rain coming down lightly, this thing is chasing use and its realy fast i turn around and its runing straight at me i shut my eyes and scwees my friends hand i open my eyes but im in a room , a blue room thats filling up with water that thing is lay on the floor dazed shaking its head like its dizy then it runs at me, i punch it and tell my friend to get as high as they can as the waters rising i run after my friend and start climing this wall that leads onto a small slope in the wall we sit on it as the water rises, but as it does the thing gets closer and closer, it gets onto the platform thing with use and goes to bit use i kick its head but it only nocks its head back and makes it mad the waters up to are neck with with this thing face to face with me then its screems and i wake up lol (so its kinda long)
<br />

			I stopped beleiving the whole  &quot;you die in your dream you die in real life&quot; myth long ago. Simply put, goign through the experience is the best proof you can get <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I've died at least FOUR times in my dreams. Three of them QUITE gruesome and all tactile sensations simply too vivid for words (very creepy)...
<br />

<br />
The first time i died while dreaming, It was from a sawed-off shotty blast to the face. My whole head was literally obliterated... I FELT the initial impact and tearing of my skin and skull, but as that was happening i felt myself sucked out of my body into an &quot;ethreal&quot; body, invisible to everyone else, but i could fly around... 
<br />

<br />

<br />
The second time I died, I was ripped apart by Velociraptors (dont ask... long story <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />) but basically, i'd been pinned up against a cement wall that i juuuust couldnt get over before one nabbed my leg, pulled me down, and proceeded to feast on me with the 2 others in the hunting pack that was chasing me and some friends down...  It was fantasically gory, blood pouring out of my body, the intricate detailing of my ripped innards being tossed around and munched upon...   Upon this death i merely floated above my body after the first four or five bites finally pulled the life from my physical body.  A strange feeling indeed... I'f you've played any sort of multiplayer first person shooter games, kind of liek the effect when you die in those, you just float up out of your body and spin around slowly, looking in the direction of yoru corpse....
<br />

<br />

<br />
The third time i died in my dream, was actually in a dream-state re-creation of Team Fortress Classic (this is one of said first-person-shooters). I was literally participating in a &quot;real-life&quot; version of TFC, and i died about 4 times in this dream alone, each time respawning to go forth and fight some more, lol.
<br />

<br />
The fourth and last time i recall dying in a dream, was very detailed...  I was a prisoner of sorts in some foreign dungeon that was apparently up high somewhere... large, light-tan stone walls about 30ft deep with a man-made leaf-canopy covering the top so as to mask the presence of the dungeon.  At one point i was laying down, and a strange, invisible presence basically gave me an ultimatum: Kill myself or be killed.  I opted to kill myself, and a small, green blade appeared in my hands. i tried to slit my throat and it just couldnt penetrate. After a whiel i was given a large, insanely sharp butchers-cleaver.  That worked. I felt the blade sink in across my throat, i felt the warm blood run down my neck, i felt it fill my throat and start suffocating  me. I felt the adrenaline kick in, i felt my body tense up and try to cling on to life, and as it was all coming to darkness i felt/saw a white, angelic presence over my body, it whispered something to me and then i could no longer see, all there was was a speck of light in the distance, and i hurdled towards it at an alarmingly fast rate, and just as i almost &quot;hit&quot; it, i woke up flying out of my bed (was laying on back, and sprung forward as if i had literally &quot;hit&quot; my body at 100mph).
<br />

<br />
Very strange indeed.
<br />

<br />
I have died many a times in my dreams, and has yet to have had an ill effect on  me <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
As far as the waking up just befor falling-death: yeah i've done that countless times... If i were to count near-deaths like that i could raise my in-dream-death-count to something in the double-digits <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			the whole dieing in real life if you die in a dream is false. i've had that falling dream before and i hit the ground (yes, i remember hitting and dieing). everything went black when i hit, and my entire body was numb/heavily tingling (you know that stage). needless to say, i woke up a few seconds later and was *gasp* not dead

			I have had about 3 or 4 Lucid dreams before I ever knew what they were so I wasn't able to control EVERYTHING. But I could control most stuff. I haven't been Lucid sense I heard about them.
