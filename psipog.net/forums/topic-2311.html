			well, I showed my friend who has ADD, and he said &quot; I started to look at the penny, then the token, then the other token, then the penny and the other token then the penny.&quot; and I asked &quot;Did you see it move?&quot; and he said &quot;yeah.&quot; then we went on with our day.

the others sabutoge it, just to say it's fake, another words, they would shake the hell out of the table and mock me.

			Awesome! I can't wait till I get it well enough developed that I can show it off with pencils. I still can't move the darn psi-wheel to the point where I can say, &quot;woah, I definately moved it!&quot;. Instead I just kind of see it moving about as fast as the minute hand on a clock, but it's inconsistent. 
<br />

<br />
I'm 18 by the way, so I'm nearing my final year of high school. I guess I'll have to get a job and show it off at work. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Anyone else have stories?

			I've always wondered why people were so scared of these kind of things. It's because they're afraid that there is more to reality than they've been confronted with. They know there are things out there that they're too afraid to get into and they don't want us getting into them either, because if we do, we might learn something they don't know - and that makes us a little out of their control.

			A greek girl I was dating a while ago was a telepath, but didn't want anyone to know. I showed her my energy manipulation and easy PK and then she &quot;opened up,&quot; if you will.

EDIT!

I just realized how sexual that sounds, but it's not what I intended, I meant emotionally.

I've shown my friends videos, but they come up with bullshit explanations.

I won't show them untill I get stronger at it. For the main reason of if I get someone NOW to say &quot;that's bull, it's really *excuse excuse angst angst&quot; and my subconcious believes it, well, I think you get where I'm going with this.

			me and  my brother were smoking one day and we got into a philisophical talk (hehe not a surprise if you know us) he then said something along the lines of &quot;science is discovering new things everyday&quot; and i said.... really.. then got into a discussion with him about a &quot;mysterious energy&quot; then, i proceeded to show him a psi wheel video, and he tried to explain it away. Then i showed him a psi wheel video with a glass over it. He used the same &quot;magnets explaination&quot; then i whipped mine out and showed him.
<br />

<br />
Didnt move that much, but enough to notice that i was the only one moving it. He was dumbfounded. Ill never forget what he said. &quot;man im gonna have to try that, because i just saw you move it!&quot; Great feeling.
<br />

<br />

<br />
What about the &quot;pre-demonstration&quot; feeling. How did everyone feel? I felt confident, which is probably due to me studying it and knowing more than he does about it, but right before i was going to show him, i started to shake. Like have massive tremor like shaking. I dont know what it was and have never experienced it before... did anyone else have this shaking?
