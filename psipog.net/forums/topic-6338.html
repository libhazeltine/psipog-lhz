			Instead of searching/feeling/seeing for objects, could you see where people/beings are?

If so how?

Also, I'm currently trying to find out where someone I know lives(address?). Is this at all possible to do? Or is it too specific..

			Hello DannyLee,

</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>DannyLee wrote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Instead of searching/feeling/seeing for objects, could you see where people/beings are?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Absolutely. Remote viewing is defined as an intelligence gathering tool in which the perceiver (Also known as a “viewer”) shares detailed information based on any target he or she is given regardless of time, distance, space or shielding. However, please understand one thing; You're not actually seeing anything. Please do not expect visual access to the target. Although there have been those few circumstances in which a viewer claims to have seen the target in a visual sense, the majority of viewers do not gain visual access of the target. 
<br />

<br />
Remote viewing is a tool in which you literally &quot;download&quot; information based on the target you're attempting to view. You'll perceive certain aspects of your target through following a certain protocol. Remote viewing is a step-by-step process. Some, if not most remote viewers have the mentality that if you're not following a remote viewing protocol, you're not actually remote viewing. Others disagree with that belief. I personally do not disagree.

You need to first learn how to actually remote view correctly. I recommend that you lurk around the different communities (Visit our link section of the main website, not the forums link section) and browse for remote viewing information. You can also visit a popular search engine such as google and search for remote viewing techniques/protocols. 
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Also, I'm currently trying to find out where someone I know lives(address?).

<br />
It's possible to figure out where a certain individual currently is located, yes. I myself have helped the local police in my living area with finding missing persons. However, gaining such accurate information such as an address is close to impossible. For one, remote viewing numbers is generally difficult. However, it's been done to a certain extent. For instance, Pat Price at one point in time gave such accurate information that he was able to accurately perceive name tags in which people where wearing, filing cabinet names/numbers, etc. However, please keep in mind that you'll have to be acceptingly good with remote viewing. Which means, work on viewing targets which are relatively easy to view before you attempt to view such difficult targets such as numbers. 
<br />

<br />
Good luck, if you have more questions, please feel free to ask. 
<br />

<br />
Take care,
