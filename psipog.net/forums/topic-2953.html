			I've always had better luck (at least in terms of tangebility) with direct manipulation of energy and affecting the physical. However lately I feel as though my sense of telepathy is getting better. The problem is I can't exactly feel it. It seems as though events of synchronicity and subconsciouss triggers are occuring through telepathy to me. Things like finishing others sentences and seeing flashes of images or feelings of things their thinking. What can I do to 'feel' telepathy in a more intimate way?

			Focus on more of these events happening again.
<br />

<br />
Try and practice it more.
<br />

<br />
Recall the events that HAVE happened, attempt to discern what caused them, how you felt etc...
<br />

<br />
Practice will definetly help,<img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			Uhh...how is this worse than just &quot;feeling&quot; people's thoughts?  Rather than feeling a slight sensation you're now initimately connected with others' thoughts and feelings.  So much so that you can see images relating to those feelings (a picture is worth a thousand words) and can finish their sentences for them.  You'll also probably find that often you'll bring something up in a conversation and someone else will go &quot;Yeah, I was JUST thinking that!&quot;  
<br />

<br />
You're becoming one with everyone around you as some Zen monk would say.  What were you expecting telepathy to be?  Some isolated pocket in your mind that stores others' thoughts that you could simply turn on and off at will?  Telepathy isn't just a repeatedly scanning and recording of other people's heads, it's a constant sharing of information that allows you to be on exactly the same wavelength as other people.  What could be better?

			could you describe that feeling of being intimate in thoughts??? like how should that feel in telepathy... I get somehow some psi energy surges from their thoughts and feel that but aside from that I still have a lot more to know at telepathy... its different from empathy... I could just extend my awareness and burst of emotions go flooding in and its just up to you to regulate and find the person who you want to feel...
