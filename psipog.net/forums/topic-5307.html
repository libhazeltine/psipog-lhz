			Ok Now this might not be new to some experienced TK people but I'm going to say it in my own way.
<br />

<br />
Ever since last night, when i got to move my psi wheel 2 and a half spins around really really fast, ive noticed something. A Few days before that I had been trying to move a toothpick, an object harder then the Psi Wheel..
<br />

<br />
Well take weight lifting for an example...For those who have lifted weights..You usually start off with a certain a mount for a bit then work your way up after you get more muscle...Well I was trying to the Psi Wheel and I could move it a little bit, so I moved up to the toothpick &quot;Heavier Weights&quot; if you will. Now I couldn't move the toothpick or &quot;Lift the heavier set of weights&quot; after a few days. So I moved back to the Psi Wheel and Moved it right away more then I have ever had before.
<br />

<br />
The reasoning is because the psi wheel will become easier to move after you try harder things.. Just like in weight lifting, the better you become at lifting more weight, the easier the lighter weights (that you started off with) will become.. See What I mean... All Common Sense... lol

			I agree, I wouldn't call it common sense perse, but I can attest to the results.  A while back I did some visualization excercises to levitate an object and after a while of doing it it actually tripled my energy/ability(mind you I was really weak then).

			Dj Wolf you mayb e onto something.
<br />

<br />
Although I'm trying to keep my mind free of any beleifs that may hinder my psionic progression, such as &quot;heaver objects are harder to move&quot; which may not be completely true, I can only report my own experience.
<br />

<br />
The night before the first time I was able to move the psiwheel I had (in a trance state) attempted to move my computer swivle chair. 
<br />

<br />
Last night I attempted to move a pen, when I returned to the psiwheel it moved my easier, for longer then it has ever done before, it also moved pretty smoothly. This may have nothing to do with the pen and may jsut be a reflection of my increased understanding of moving the psiwheel.
<br />

<br />
The above experiences -in my mind- add a slight legitimacy to your claim Dj wolf, I'll try it again and see if it works and contact you with the results, please do the same for me.
<br />
