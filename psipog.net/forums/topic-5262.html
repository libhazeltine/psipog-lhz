			Well, about an hour ago I was asleep in my bed and I awoke. I was laying there and began to drift back off to the sleeping world. I'm not aware of how much time past, but I found my self sitting at a table (dreaming...) across from someone whose face I can no longer recall. It seem I was in some sort of nice restaurant with many people all at different tables. I suddenly remembered that I was actually laying in my bed asleep and became semi-lucid. So, I decided the first thing I would do to see how lucid I really was, was to make the person sitting across from me at the table disappear. As soon as that thought crossed my mind it was so, and right when he disappeared I got this strange feeling that shot from the top of my head down to the bottom of my neck, kind of a chilling, shocking, buzzing feeling. I immediately snapped to some sort of semi-awake semi-asleep state and then moments later found my self back at the begin of the same dream and became semi-lucid again. So, I repeated myself and the same feeling struck me. I then snapped awake completely and laid there too anxious to go back to sleep. Does any one have a clue what that feeling might have been and why it struck me each time after I made the person disappear? Thanks.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: I probably should have mentioned that this was my first time becoming lucid in a dream.

			When I first started having lucid dreams, everytime I'd become lucid I'd get in this state of &quot;shock&quot;. It can feel likes shivers going down your spine, but after a while, I started getting over those anxious feelings and was able to remain calm and not wake up. The trick to staying lucid and not waking up is to remain calm. Just keep on trying to lucid dream. It's awesome.

			I get those feelings (in the waking realm) when I'm dreading something, an extremely odd coincidence occurs or a combination of said stimuli happens. It's generally not a pleasant feeling. I can't say I've ever felt it in sleep but I can't say I've not either.

Try to get used to the feeling or get used to LD'ing enough that it's no longer happening.

			Yeah, I get the same feeling sometimes when something weird happens or something freaks me out. It was just strange because I had this sense that the person I made disappear was also me. The feeling didn't strike me until right when I made that person disappear. I can't imagen why the first thing I thought of doing was to make the person disappear...
