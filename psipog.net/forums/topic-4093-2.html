			Nintendo used to be the top dog in gaming. you didn't say that you'd be going home to play videogames, you said you were going home to play nintendo.
<br />
sony and micriosoft have placed a foothold in the market with their consoles. but nintendo have remained strong. with the release of the DS lite it has shown that they can be stylish too.
<br />

<br />
i like nintendo because, apart from being around since roughly 1889 selling hanafunda cards it's the most long running popular games company.
<br />

<br />
i like 'tendo because their games rock. anyone who's played metroid prime:hunters on wifi will know this <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I'm not gonna use pk on either the wii or the ds lite. No way! If I screw that up, I will be so pissed. That's why I'm not gonna try and control my ipod; it's just not worth it.

			dude dont even get me started on nintendo. all i will say is i personally think they are the greatest company of all time. Wii is gonna be awesome and zelda is my favorite series. and nintendo are still top dogs in the game industry. its just that america gets caught up in all these rediculous shooters that are all the same. and america is full of hype and scandal so ppl who play xbox tend to speak out about it.

			Heh. You think it's bad in US? You should see Australia! Nintendo has almost been driven to extinction here. The only think keeping it alive is the DS. I sure hope that the Wii gives us a chance in the console race.

Actually in America nintendo is doing the worst at selling, but they are making the most money XD. Microsoft is burning money just because they want to be in a cool industry. I really like nintendo too. They are a smart company. They are not going to die without a fight. They actually keep a reserve of money to try out new ideas like the wii. So if it fails they can jump back with new a battle plan. I don't think the wii is going to fail anytime soon though.
