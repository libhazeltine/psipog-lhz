			If you just tell your sub-c what you want, and you trust it, won't be any dangers involved. However, if you tried to conciously ramrod the effort then yes it's extremely dangerous. You have to trust your own sub-c or you'd create a living hell for yourself, for example I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for the fact that I trust my sub-c so much when I play with electricity :O

			Removing it from your skin will course way more chance of skin cancer, yes. I can't belive I didn't remember that. I knew the word...meh.
<br />
Removing it from the eyes, I'm not sure will do any harm, but then again no one has tried this for a very long term and it may course some kind of disease with the eyes. Think about it, if you take away the protective substance from your eyes, they may go bad. Even blind. I suggest if you do it to a maximum that you stay out of the sun or simply do it in the winter. 
<br />

<br />
I myself, may try this cus it sounds fun.
<br />
And I'm pretty sure that just trusting your sub-c won't swing it. It's still doing exactly the same process to change the colour. How esle would it? Not be just thinking it. Bending reality isn't here...yet. Except in the matrix of course.
<br />

<br />
Hair colour should be fine, since it naturally changes anyway, then again so does eye colour but you can dye your hair, so.....yeah.

Exactly, Rahmid. There are sites on the internet that even have the gall to SELL these kind of spells. I feel for the people that believe this and then get duped for their moola. Tis a shame for sure.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

well, when i was wiccan for 4 or 5 years, i have heard of this practice (glamour), and performed it a couple times.  all my wiccan friends (and my friends mom, who was a high wiccan priestess) have heard of this.  that's where i came with glamour as a suggestion.  i found it in a wiccan book of spells i used to have...but, since i don't want this thread locked, i'm going to stop talking about it.

as for dangers of changing eye color (concerning melanin), it may be easier for retinal damage and blindness if you decrease the amount of melanin in your eyes.  just a theory though.

			But maybe you can ask your sub-c to make sort of a layer on your eyes which has a certain color.. Would that be dangerous too? I don't want to become blind but I do want to be able to change eye color and such.

			I'm just going to try it out, saying &quot;Change my eye color to blue&quot; for about 10 minutes each evening and morning and see what happens. I'll post any positive/negative results I get per day over a period of...probably about a month. Starting tomorrow, I'll post my first &quot;log&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Let's face it, we're never going to get anywhere by just speculating about any good or bad side effects we may get...somebody's gonna have to try it out. Might as well be me...

I'm gonna try making my left eye red, that way if there is any damage done, I'll still have one eye to use. (Not really sure if this would be possible, seeing as it may be like moving eyes independently: very hard to do and can strain muscles, but I'll try when I can anyway)

			someone who is relatively experienced with this stuff, should try to give themselves a tan without going into the sun. Spend about a week trying this everyday, and see if it works. for instance, try to get your torso or thighs or something to get tan. Because usually, those areas aren't getting sun unless you go swimming or something.

Mine seem to be doing that as well, but I don't think it's quite like your case. For me, whenever I view my eyes from far away they seem to be a light blue color. But when I get closer, it changes to a brown.
<br />

<br />
Weird...they've stopped doing it recently, though, so it's alright.

First log tomorrow after school!

<br />
here's how I do it:
<br />
Relax, meditate. Visuallize yourself with the intended eye color and tell yourself that you will indeed aquire this change, just believe strongly and let go of doubt. do this for 10-30 mins everyday. 
<br />

<br />
speaking to your sub-c is easy as talking to it in your mind.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: something like what gonzo said... i almost forgot about that lol.

			Heh, with me it's a case of my eye color changes which has tendecy to freak people out but I don't even think about it, blue is my standard color. However, when i'm really angry about something or just in general pissed off, my eyes are a dark steely gray and when I'm in the mood for some adult fun my eyes are a hazeltint green and yet I don't experience any side effects from it. I had forgotten about that until I looked in the mirror today and noticed my hazel tint green eyes and went ya forgotten about that eh.
