			&quot;I believe him. What kind of loser would sit around and make fake telekinesis movies.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Because they are bored and they want other people to think they are cool with what they can seemingly do. 
<br />

<br />
What kind of loser goes around making computer viruses and hacking? 
<br />

<br />
Because they can, and it is fun for them. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;You can believe what ever you want. I know it is real and that is all that matters.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I do not need to believe anything I want, the video is just bad and neither shows anyone anything nor proves anything. It looks quite silly in fact and the paper looks like it is being blown on or that string is pulling it. I am not skeptical of the paranormal but of your ability to perform paranormal feats. It is that kind of attitude that causes you to lose credibility. 
<br />

<br />
If you are taking requests then I could suggest quite a few things I would like to see that would be more convincing. 
<br />

<br />
If paper can be pushed and pulled along a surface, then you should be able to straight up levitate it. I never see this, because it is a more difficult effect to fake and trickery can be seen quite easily without proper care.

			It's been said all over this forum and main site that the object of videos isn't to prove anything...
<br />

<br />
And actually most hackers/virus creators target a set group.  For example, I am under the impression that there are many more hackers around the world willing to hack american sites then the ones willing to hack swiss ones.

And, a question for Apollo--
<br />

<br />

<br />
Do you try to &quot;force&quot; the things you use tk on or do you rather try to &quot;let&quot; it move?

Because things can be done, controls, that will help ensure that what is done is not merely a product of natural phenomena and is indeed paranormal, thereby increasing credibility.

<br />
Only that you can't do it. It is not any type of question save for a valid one. You can't levitate it because you can't do it and it doesn't happen. It moves because it is a trick. That's the distinction. If you can overcome gravity and friction and push or pull an object along a given vector, there is no reason for this vector to not be straight up, into your hand, or something of that nature.
<br />

<br />
Truth be told it is (or should be, given TK is real) more difficult to slide an object than just levitate it. This is because you must overcome the friction caused by air, the friction caused by the surface the object is on, and gravity, to slide an object. To levitate, you need only overcome gravity and the friction caused by air. Surfaces provide lots of friction to hold back objects, but air offers little frictional resistance, though there is a small amount. Nothing that should be able to hold back someone that can overcome gravity and move objects with their mind though.

I have been quite nice in pointing out the problems I see. 
<br />

<br />
If I didn't want to be nice, I'd say it utterly sucks both in quality and quantity and is something I can fake in under 2 minutes, AND make look much better with a longer effect duration. Which is true. I could create apparent psionic effects with little effort and with items laying around the house, and film them with my digital camera, and no signs of trickey would be apparent, and it would be more impressive than what you did. If I wanted to go crazy with it I'd have my computer graphics friend touch it up or play with it with digital effects software like Maya.

You're not the 'scientific decider of the world', Kief. You aren't this bullshit 'honest scientific opinion', because in no way have you presented any facts that you are RELIABLE.

This is not entirely(sp) true IIRC. When sliding something, you arent going directly against the force of gravity(which if I remember my physics well enough is 10 m/s on earth). In order to levitate an object, you would have to constantly resist the pull of Earths gravity, whereas with pushing or pulling something, you only have to give enough energy for a short sporadic burst. But again, this is just IIRC, and I would like someone to verify this if possible.
<br />

<br />
I respect the right to your opinion Kief, but I request you dont try and force it on others, which is what you are doing by the looks of it.

&quot;Only that you can't do it. It is not any type of question save for a valid one. You can't levitate it because you can't do it and it doesn't happen. It moves because it is a trick. That's the distinction. If you can overcome gravity and friction and push or pull an object along a given vector, there is no reason for this vector to not be straight up, into your hand, or something of that nature.&quot;

I stand by my decision that you have no experience at all in the psionic community.  You have also learned nothing.
<br />

<br />
&quot;It seems you do care as you have invested your time and energy in responding and your getting all pissy.&quot;

<br />
Its because you are stupid and making a fool of yourself.

&quot;I have been quite nice in pointing out the problems I see.&quot;

<br />
Nice?  You think you are nice?

After reading Mattz post, i have refrained from posting more in this one reply.  just so you know, Kief, Mattz post is right above mine.  Dont get lost trying to find it.

&quot;If I didn't want to be nice, I'd say it utterly sucks both in quality and quantity and is something I can fake in under 2 minutes, AND make look much better with a longer effect duration. Which is true. I could create apparent psionic effects with little effort and with items laying around the house, and film them with my digital camera, and no signs of trickey would be apparent, and it would be more impressive than what you did. If I wanted to go crazy with it I'd have my computer graphics friend touch it up or play with it with digital effects software like Maya.&quot;

I have said it 3 times now but i guess you missed it.  Here it is again in big blue letters.  If you have trouble finding the blue letters, just ask and i will happily shove them up your ass.

When you slide an object, a couple apparent factors are gravity and friction.  When you slide it, gravity is increasing the friction so really you only have to overcome a bit of greater friction.  
<br />

<br />
Now when things are suspended in the air and in free fall, most everyone knows that gravity acts upon an object at a downward motion of -9.8 meters per second, dont know exact amount of joules or pounds per square inch but it's definetely greater than the little friction on the ground.  Then you have to take into account how heavy an object is.  You would have to push with an upward force of that many pounds constantly and for a bit of time to &quot;levitate it.&quot;

			yes i have to add that were dealing with TK here. its very new to man. People have yet to accept it as real yet. Kind of like how people didnt believe that the earth was round. Just because its not poplular and well known doesnt mean that TK and psi and stuff doesnt exist. And about the paper being able to go up and levitate. I have seen videos on levitating objects before. If im not mistaken theres on in the media section of <a href="http://www.psipog.net" target="_blank">www.psipog.net</a>  .  Its been done, but most arnt that experienced yet. You wont find any truth in anything if u dont have an open mind. Dont make exuses for everything just because your mind cant handle it. Do your own research, maybe go out and try it yourself with an open mind. If you get no succes dont come back and complain, ask for help and it will be given. and about what apollo said. YES all videos can be faked, and alot of stuff is. I could say that the moon landing was faked also, but would you believe me? I hope not.

			Heh, well, Kief, I tried to be nice to you, but after seeing the shit you try to put everybody else do, then personally attack me? Fuck being nice.
<br />

I can so imagine Kief arguing that the world's flat.
<br />

<br />
Haha, that would be awesome.

you know there's a &quot;Flat World Party&quot;? Go join that.

Oh, wait, oops. I'm making generalizations again.

This is because you must overcome the friction caused by air, the friction caused by the surface the object is on, and gravity, to slide an object. To levitate, you need only overcome gravity and the friction caused by air. Surfaces provide lots of friction to hold back objects, but air offers little frictional resistance, though there is a small amount. Nothing that should be able to hold back someone that can overcome gravity and move objects with their mind though.

You are terribly wrong here. 
<br />

<br />
1.
<br />
Your subconscious needs to get used to different types of telekinetic movement. So when you are switching from sliding to levitating chances are you won't be getting any results soon, just like switching from spining a pin wheel to rolling a round pencil. That is why many people are still stuck on the pin wheel.
<br />

<br />
2.
<br />
When you levitate something you need to constantly defy gravity, meaning you would have to use force on the selected item constantly. You see from the video that the paper is moved from time to time by an &quot;energy outburst&quot;, so let's say he could direct that outburst to move the object upward so it would &quot;jump&quot; up and fall down (but he can't because it is a different type of movement [1.]) , i bet you would say it was done with a string just like this one, so what's the point?
