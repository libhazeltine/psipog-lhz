			I've just got to say that this thread gave me the best laugh of my life (next to  those G I Joe dubs) but this is starting to get out of hand.
<br />

<br />
Criss Angle is a magician, not a super-psion, and certainly not a messiah. If he is a psion, then so are David Blaine and Harry Houdini. David Blane levitates, is he a psion? Harry Houdini would get stripped down to his underwear, chained and shackled, locked in a trunk, and then thrown in a river. Did he bust his way out with PK? Segfried and Roy have made countless white tigers appear and then dissapear on a stage, did they teleport them? If you say that Criss Angel is a psion, then that means every other person that did magic on tv is a psion. 
<br />

<br />
Do you guys even realize what you're saying? &quot;I saw a guy doing magic on a show. He says he can lift a car, and levitate from one building to another, and I believe him.&quot; That alone makes people think you're an idiot, but then when somebody comes up with evidence against Criss Angel being a psion, instead of trying to refute it, you just turn into a little kid and start cussing at them and calling them &quot;fucking morons&quot;. Calling anyone a fucking moron without any basis in a debate makes YOU look like a fucking moron. 
<br />

<br />
So far I have heard no proof from the people that say Criss Angel is a real psion, other than the worn-worn out  &quot;but I saw him on tv!&quot;. If you want people to take you seriously, dig up some more information. Did Criss Angel come out and say he was a Psion? Has he posted on any forums like psipog or psionline talking about psionics? Has he made any dvds showing his personal techniques on lifting cars or levitationg? Give us SOMETHING that proves he does psionics besides his FUCKING tv show. 
<br />

<br />
Seaking of his tv show, it's just that: a TV SHOW. Do you think the cast of CSI go out and solve real murders? Was That 70's show really filmed in the 70's? Come on, whatever happened to healthy critisism?

			Well, the good news is that the majority of replies in this thread seem to agree that it's silly to think he's a psion.  So the fluff is a minority.  Healthy skepticism is very useful.

			Criss angel, in his second season, has taken a new approach. He tells everyone that what he is doing is completely real, there's no props or rehearsals beforehand. He has a spectator's pov camera that he gives to random people in crowds to view from whatever angles they want. He said, several times in several different episodes, that he believe he &quot;truly can do things that most people consider impossible&quot; which is saying, to me, that he is a psion. 
<br />

<br />
Also, that levitation trick video was for people who are not psions to freak out their friends. Criss angel has done several fake levitations, and several real ones (floating from the top of one building to another. No strings, no props, no nothing between the buildings but air and criss angel levitating) Criss likes to mix up his psionic abilities with magician's tricks. He'll mix it up between fake and real psychokinesis (usually explained during the episodes) and fake and real levitations, and fake and real phasings, and fake and real &quot;teleportation&quot;.
<br />

<br />
He does this because he wants people to decide for themselves what is real and what is not, and he wants to ween out the believers and non believers. Non believers, aka idiots, will see proof of some of his fake tricks and declare all of it a hoax, being the idiots they are. Try looking around a little more. The internet is filled with tons of bullshit about david blaine and criss angel and alian nu and all those guys being fakes. Why? Because only fucking moron non believers bother to put that shit on the internet because they're so adament in &quot;convincng&quot; people that they are right. Controversially, believers such as myself laugh, sometimes scornfully, at the silly antics of the morons. We don't bother to post proof to the contrary simply becuase it's not worth wasting our time. Non believers need a lot more proof than a television show, and believers really don't give a shit about proving anything to them.
<br />

<br />
Believe what you want. That's your reality, your world, your mind.
<br />
But the whole world doesn't bend to the will of a single frail human mind.
<br />

<br />
PS: as for the audio interview, criss angel was telling them what they wanted to hear to avoid argument. What, you think he isn't capable of telling lies? he's human just like the rest of us.

			YES! You said it Xiouslaidyn! You hit the nail right on the head! He's capable of telling <span style="font-style: italic">lies</span>. Criss Angel is <span style="font-style: italic">lying</span> about telling everyone what he does is real. He is <span style="font-style: italic">lying</span> about not doing rehersals beforehand. As for the camera, you're kidding right? If it was Criss Angel really doing psionics, he would have the camera do a long continuous shot of the effect, not several cuts around him. Doing that just makes Criss Angel more fake, becuse all of the other TV magicians can manage to do their tricks without cutting the camera, whereas he has to revert to &quot;tv magic&quot; rather than street magic. Those are what most of his tricks are, &quot;street magic&quot;. Google it. better yet, go to <a href="http://www.ellusionist.com" target="_blank" class="postlink">www.ellusionist.com</a>, I think they have a good street magic section.
<br />

<br />
How do you know that he does fake levitations and real levitations? Fake and real phasing? Did he come out and say it on his website? Or are you just speculating?

<br />
Why would he do that? If he was a real psion, the most obvious reason he would be on TV would be to make other people believe in psionics, right? So then why would he want &quot;idiots to not believe him? That just sort of defeats the purpose doesn't it? Why would he try to weed out believers and non believers, instead of trying to make everyone believe? It doesn't make any sense.
<br />

<br />
And in you're post, you keep calling people morons, and idiots for not believing you? How the hell is anyone going to take you're claim seriously when you call them retards for being critical of someone they saw on TV?
<br />
It says right above the little window where you right your post: <span style="font-weight: bold">Be Intelligent.</span> So far I haven't really seen any intelligence from the people that say Criss Angel is a psion, only them downplaying the intelligence of others. It's good to be a healthy skeptic, and it's good to have firm beliefs, but it's not good to think that, just because you believe something, you can mock and berate people and call them idiots for not believing, while at the same time telling them that you don't have to prove anything to them. What, you just want us to go on your word that this guy is the second coming of Christ or something? Your word means dick in a place like this. Show us some proof and we'll believe you. Say you don't have to prove anything, and we will think that you're just dodging us because there is no proof.

			thanks.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" /> I don't mind it if someone has a different opinion than me. I don't really care if they want to argue about their opinions (I love a good debate). I just hate it when people stop coming up with formal arguments and start either making wild speculations or critisizing others for not believing them.
<br />

<br />
If you want people to believe that Criss Angel is a psion, do it in a polite and dignified manner. If you want to have an argument with someone about Criss Angel's authenticity, be at least slightly respectful of the other person's opinions instead of down-playing their intelligence. Come up with valid arguments that come from sources other than your imagination, otherwise people won't take you or your beliefs seriously.

You use terrible logic here, as I wrote about earlier in this thread.  Your logic follows the pattern of, &quot;If I can't figure out how it's done, then it MUST be real!&quot;.  He's a magician.  Of COURSE he's going to say what he does is for real.  How much of an impact would he have if he levitated across a building, then he immediately said, &quot;Well, I know that looks real, but actually it was just a magic trick.  Pretty cool though, huh?&quot;  Do you think it would have the same emotional impact?
<br />

<br />
I was actually disappointed with a lot of his tricks.  He has great presentation, but some of his tricks are insanely simple and worn out.  For example, one episode was dedicated almost entirely to driving blindfolded.  I remember seeing that trick in a magician's magazine for $25.  He does a great job presenting it, and he builds it up wonderfully.  But the actual trick is run of the mill.  A few of his tricks are actually original and clever... but most of those are fairly easy to figure out as well, if you know what to look for.
<br />

<br />
You MIGHT want to research magic a little more before proclaiming that he can really levitate over buildings.
