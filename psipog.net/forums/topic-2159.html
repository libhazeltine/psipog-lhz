			Really, coordinate remote viewing can be helpful, but I found that the &quot;just view it&quot; method works best for me. Find a target, and view it.
<br />

<br />
Ex. So-and-So lost their CD players, and want to find it. You volunteer to find it. When you view it, you focus on finding So-and-So's CD player. Just say it once in your head, they focus on the info to come. 
<br />

<br />
Also, never, EVER, try to find out what the object is, unless you manage to keep your mind seperate from your imagination with no problem.

			Just to anticipate a question: If you're wondering, how is that possible. How come i have never spontaneously done this before, then i might have an answer for you.
<br />

<br />
For you see, i believe, that a human soul is inifinate. It was created with the universe and it is this allmighty, ancient being. Because it is ancient, it knows anything about everything and our subconsious mind is just an imprint of our soul. Therefore, all the knowledge to RV, to do PK or Telepathy is already known to your subconcsius. You just have to &quot;Unlock&quot; the knowledge in order to use it consciously.
<br />

<br />
So all you have to do, is order your subconcsious mind to do something, and it will accomplish the task without problems.
<br />

<br />
The only problems that start to surface are when your consious mind starts to question your subconsious mind.
<br />

<br />
Hope this helped someone overcome some barriers and you do NOT have to take my beliefs as your own, but you are very much welcome to.

			Here is a step-by-step guide on what I try to do:
<br />

<br />
1.Quickly relax for about 10 or so seconds.
<br />
2.Say the target in my head
<br />
3.Wait for the information to come to me
<br />
4.Identify what I saw
<br />

<br />
5.Eat Brains <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> .(joke)

			I personally think the fourth point is the hardest. Info comes in in spurts and you can't really start identifying when another chunk comes in. Sometimes, when i'm really focused, i get A LOT of info at a time and i can't identify anything since all the mental images seem to be overlapped and it's just a haze.
<br />

<br />
Or sometimes i get no info at all, and when some dripplets come, they're just fog. Which is kinda depressing.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

Look at the sun, then close your eyes and look away. What do you see? Exactly, the sun, kind of pulsating and the color is red/orange.
<br />

<br />
That's kinda what i see every time i RV. And you can't really tell by color what is RV info and what you made up.
