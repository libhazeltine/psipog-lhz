			I certianly hope that everybody has read enough of construct making and shield making that theyve herd of certian dangers associated with the unseen, but has anybody been attacked by/ accidentally created a dangerous construct/discarnate entity?  ive herd of somebody who accidentally created a dangerous construct while going to sleep, the construct creation began while the person in question was having vengful thoughts, therfore creating a vengful construct designed to attack the person to whom the anger was towards.
<br />

<br />
does anybody know of any occurances like this? or has anybody been attacked by something like this?  phislisophical implications are also welcome

			um... the creator destroyed it asap and completely forgot about their anger in the process.  the question of obtaining too much power is a valid one, uncontrolled thoughts and actions could cause alot of harm, thats why i think that maintaining harmony and controll is one of the most important things in psionics or any field of magic.

			well, I would hope that if you are that good and this thing is possible, that you could make a sheild to stop that happening, have a shield asorb other constructs around it then the problem is solved.

			you have to understand though that when anger comes up like that in your sleep that he may have taken down the sheild without knowing... i think if he was that good then he would have SOME empathetic/telepathetic feelings to deal with. He could have already had a sheild up and just took it down in his sleep in order to &quot;succeed in his goal.&quot;

the more you try to find a possiblity, the more this story sounds like bullshit.
<br />

<br />
I'm sorry, but if you are good, you would know how to create a shield that wouldn't go out from a single thought.

			mm, this person wasnt so much into the shield thing... its ok, but unless u practice 24/7 and get really good at it it does very little(nd by the way, it was a she) basically, shields arent the be all and end all, especially when your the one sending out the energy...
<br />

<br />
as for harmony, make a list of all your bad charecteristics, scrutinize yourself for every little negative detail, then rate them from one to ten based on how likely they are to come up and how dangerous they are, and then work your best to fix all of these

			Hello everyone! ok, just to say that I myself have created quite a few 'aggressive' contructs by mistake, and someone who has an enemy will most likly create one (awake AND asleep)
<br />

<br />

<br />
My advice is to create a shield to hold anything IN, or create a construct to destroy anything made during the time your asleep.
