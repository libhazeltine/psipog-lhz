			Hello everyone, I'm back. A few years ago, roughly around the age of 13, (I'm 16 now) I was interested in psionics and frequently visited PsiPog. After about a month or two of some success but no significant gains, I sadly gave up. Well, I'm back now, and more dedicated than ever. I believe that 3 year gap and the knowledge gained over those 3 years will help me become more devout in the phenomenon known as psionics. I just wanted to let you guys know that I plan to &quot;study&quot; these topics once again, and hope to gain some enlightenment of the world around us, hopefully gaining a better understanding of life and its flow. I plan on concentrating on 3 branches, which will consist of psi ball manipulation, OBE's, and some TK. In the past, I have had some success with each 3. I have managed to make some decent psiballs, but never a visible one. I have tried inducing OBE's but only managed to get to the &quot;vibrations&quot; stage. And as for TK, I have had incidents of psiwheel spinnings, but that's about it. I hope to one day have a full OBE, a visible psi ball, and able to move objects like pencils with TK. These are my &quot;goals&quot;, but I will certainly not limit my studies to this, I will go as far as my mind and body lets me. Well, enough of me rambling on, just wanted to say &quot;Hello&quot; and I look forward to hearing of your stories and success, and I will keep you posted on my advancements as well.
