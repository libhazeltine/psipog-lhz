			Hi to everyone, it should be obvious that Im really new to the community, as this is my first post in it.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I recently read almost all the articles on PsiPog, at least those of the categories I'm more interested in.
<br />
But it may not be this simple to know where to start with psionic, so I fortunately and suddenly found the Handbook in the Features, and I realized that I should start from somewhere precisely, so...
<br />
My question is the following: 
<br />
After being able to &quot;feel&quot; and hopefully &quot;manipulate&quot; the psi into the simplest of the constructs (psiball), would I need something else to learn before attempting the PK?
<br />
That's the field I'd like most by now, but I want to take it easy and do everything I may need to learn PK in a safe/controlled/easy way, so Im wondering what basics should I learn before.
<br />
It may sound stupid as question but, look at me as a beginner, I want just to take it the right way, and as I've tried to practice PK in these days (not so much i know, just 3-4 days, without success) I started thinking about trying the basics first.
<br />

<br />
Let me know, please, and above all, I HAVE TO say that this community is simply great, it opened a lot my mind, and I'm just convincing myself more and more that all this staff is real (even if a &quot;real&quot; feeling about it would be really really helpfull for me at this stage, but it hopefully will come with patience and practice).
<br />
I hope this is the right section to write about it.
<br />

<br />
Again, thanks to everyone in advance, I hope I'll be welcome in the community <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
And I hope my english doesnt stress you all ^^.
<br />

<br />

<br />
P.S. I wonder if there are any Italians here, even if I havent much problems in understanding english, but a conversation with an italian about this things would be really great. Please let me know if possible <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			I suggest making a psiwheel to work on to start off. Psiballs are good to do before TK, but its not needed. Tk is all about personal preferences. You have to experiment for whatever works for you.

			I was actually practicing on a psiwheel I made some days ago, but as long as I couldnt feel the energy (maybe it's not needed), and it's like I would like to (this could be my personal preference ^^), I just started reading about these &quot;basics&quot;, like psiballs.
<br />

<br />
Now, assuming that I want to learn the basics before trying the PK thing, do you suggest me trying other things apart from Psiballs or is it &quot;enough&quot; as basic?
<br />

<br />
Thank you for the reply randywm <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			It is not necessary to make a psiball or be sensitive towards psi before attempting PK.
<br />
I've spun my psiwheel before making my first psiball.
<br />
It might be handy to be sensitive for psi, but that will come after a while.
<br />
It took me about 3 months before I could really sense psi.

			this is maybe a bit harder but it helped me...you can hang a key on a piece of string, and hang the string on the ceiling, then by looking at the key try to move it, this helped me a lot.

			Well, the reason I was trying to start with Psiballs really...is because, as long as I've read making simple constructs like psiball should be easier than PK (yeah I know it depends on the individual too), I thought that a feel for psi could help me convincing myself that I'm able to use psi.
<br />
Im pretty sure all these things are real but, Hey, you know how you feel when you believe in it but still cant reproduce it, I wonder if my sub-conscious still doubts.
<br />
As long as I wonder, it may doubts.
<br />
This is why I'd like to start with easier/concrete things to achieve  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> 
<br />
Actually, I tried creating a psi sphere in my stomach yesterday, like I read somewhere, for two times during the day, , and I'm still trying to understand if what it seems I felt, was real or my imagination...
<br />

<br />

<br />
dexo3 - Sure, thanks for that advice, I could try both psiwheel and other techniques like that <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Thanks for the replies, really  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Oh.....and now comes the strange thing.
<br />
In these days i've been practicing with basic psi manipulation and psiball.
<br />
Well, the negative aspect of this is that I cant still feel any energy flowing through my body.
<br />
The funny and positive thing instead, is that, after a few days without even thinking about PK, I just tried to move my psiwheel yesterday evening, before going to bed.
<br />
Now, I did not even bother a lot about meditating and getting in a relaxed state (maybe I already was in such a state, or for strange reason I didnt need it), and just put my psiwheel on my desk, focused on the black dot I writed on one of the edges, and gave it a go.
<br />
Hey, after few seconds, It just started to move a little bit in the counter-clockwise(is this the right spell of it?) direction.
<br />
It didnt a complete spin (maybe a half circle movement, followed by little movements in the same direction), but it moved, and I didnt put really that effort at all!
<br />
Than, after 5 minutes or so of practicing, I realized I was so excited that I couldnt focus on psiwheel anymore, and it didnt move anymore, so I just gave up thinking about trying another time.
<br />

<br />
Wow....I will be really amazed if I'll be able to repeat such thing another time, it's like I've to convince myself more than this ^^.
<br />
The only thing I can imagine that helped me in this, is maybe the Jack video gallery I discovered yesterday, about levitating his ball. It is so real, maybe I just convinced myself the right way that I was able to move my psiwheel that way.
<br />

<br />
It's strange guys, I'm gonna try it tonight again...
<br />

<br />
Whatever will be my results, I've to thank you all, for your replies, for the amazing articles I've read, Thanks to the authors, thanks to this amazing community.
<br />
Thank you PsiPog <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Ok i've given it another try this morning, few minutes ago.
<br />
I actually can have my psiwheel spin (a little in c-clockwise direction, not completly still) without this much effort.
<br />
At least it seems so, I just focus on an edge and it moves after some seconds.
<br />
I also had it make a little clockwise movement, but that wasnt my will, I have to practice to controll that I think.
<br />
Guys, Im so happy <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
<br />
But I will not give up trying with basic psi manipulation and psiball, I just want to practice a little PK to prove my parents and my friends that it's real.
<br />
For the rest, I'll practice for myself and for who believes in it ^^
