Ahhh very good. Completely agree. This started because someone was very confident in stating that reality is concrete, and I am glad we can now agree to disagree  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I don't understand. It would be impossible for a reality to exist if not concrete. You're talking about our perceptions and methods of observation to be not concrete. Reality remains to be concrete, whether we understand it or not, or it simply would not exist. Of course, now that I read over it, we do not know the true rules of reality. Who is to say it has any rules? It's crazy enough for some of the things to exist that do, especially cosmically. It's insane to think about what happens after a star dies, destroys a solar system, and creating a mass afterwards which seems to have a force of gravity that is not proportional to it's mass.

JOHNNY, You'll never just witness any paranormal phenomenon if you're not open to the idea, since whenever you see something that could possibly be paranormal, you would just chalk it up to a trick, and try to explain it with science. Anything that has no scientific backing to it is simply impossible to you. Until you open your mind a little bit, you'll never experience anything and call it a <span style="font-style: italic">real</span> paranormal event.
<br />

<br />
Why else would you use Wikipedia for EVERY THING that you cannot explain? I became open to the idea, and now I can perform psychokinesis whenever I want, albeit on a small scale. Of course, I bet it helped that I've been able to manipulate energy for as long as I can remember, and I am an empath. It is still recordable, still percievable, and I know I am doing it. It really just seems like you're just here to prove us all wrong, and laugh in our faces. In one of your posts, you say how much you 'wish' it was real. You do not believe in any of this. The only thing I've seen you say to the contrary is that you think Psychokinesis is 'possible'. Anything is possible. Our science is flawed, since our methods of observation and our perceptions are severely limited. We've only begun <span style="font-style: italic">serious</span> scientific research in the past, say, couple hundred years? It's insane to think of the technological marvels that exist now days that would be considered paranormal 100 years ago.

However something like &quot;TEH WORLD IS FLAT LOL BECAUSE I SEE IT THAT WAY&quot;  Is pretty much laughing at JBG's face.  (Mattz I don't know wether that was intentionally insulting, if it wasn't I'm sorry for assuming, but there have been people that have said things along the lines of that.)
