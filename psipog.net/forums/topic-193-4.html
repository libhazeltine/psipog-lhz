			I'm 15 and I first learned about this sight about 2 or so years ago from my sister, where basically I learn everything of the sort from. How long have I been working with psi and such alike? Well see, when I first started reading the articles on here I started to get a grasp as to what it really was about. Then, eventually I realized that I had been working with psi for all my life and had no idea what it was! It actually always scared the hell out of me because I didn't know waht it was and whenever I described it to someone they just laughed or thought I was crazy. haha. But, now that I know what it really is, and that I'm not some sort of a freak for working with it.(and I'm not the only one who does <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> ) I love it because I have an amazing know how! I've been doing things with psi for as long as I can remember. So I pick up on things really quickly. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I'm seventeen, I discovered all this stuff about four years ago but I don't think I really began practicing it till I turned about fifteen. Even then it's been an on and off thing, big procrastinator. That seems to be a reoccuring theme on these boards.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			I've been practicing psionic abilities and related fields for about two years. I discovered it by myself, when I was searching online, I found psionline. Then I found psipog and read every article I found.  I don't have anyone around my area that practices psionics, but I've been trying to get my buddy into it, who has previously had symptoms of lucid dreaming. He's just preoccupied with kid stuff, so he &quot;doesn't have time&quot;. It's more of an &quot;I'm too lazy to sign on and type&quot; kinda thing.

			Although I don't like revealing my age, as it conjurs images of spotty teenagers posting about how they &quot;totally ki-blasted that noob&quot;, I'm 14.
<br />
I've been manipulating chi (which feels the same as psi to me) since I was 6, in karate.
<br />

<br />
I'm a natural telepath, but I wasn't sensitive enough to be fully overloaded until puberty for some reason. Until then, though, I instinctively (and consciously) grounded to deal with it. I had no idea what I was doing though.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, at around the start september of 2005 I finally asked my Nanna (a reiki practitioner and natural empath, with experience in shields) about the increase in sensitivity and she told me about shielding. I did a search on the internet and found PsiPog.

			25, and into psi for so long i cant remember where it all started. I think i'm interested in the subject for about 15 years now. I've had results in allmost every field. Studied the paranormal and the occult. I have a father who is a reiki master. I did loads of stuff with energy manipulation, shielding, healing etc.
<br />
I came to Psipog.net mainly for the TK articles.

Wich where a great help, and a great insight!
