			For the last few nights ive been having these 'epic' dreams, i really could write a novel about my dream travels, but im not very descriptive and im too lazy, i'll just try and explain the jist of my dreams...i realise they sound really stupid, but they seem so incredibly real, and it really does feel like im in an epic battle of cosmic proportions..
<br />

<br />
1st night of dreams: I was running with a group of people who were wearing ragged clothes from some kind of snowstorm that had characteristics, like chasing after certain people, but then out of nowhere, there would be some caves, me and the people would run into the caves, and there would be like a little lake in there, and we jumped in the lake and swam down into it to escape the 'snowstorm', but then these mermaid things (like from harry potter 4) started attacking us, so we had to flea from them.
<br />

<br />
2nd night of dreams: I was standing in a village, and out of the corner of my eye, i could see a cloaked figure just under a tree above a ditch, at sunset, then i went into my little villagers hut and went to bed, then i heard a woman scream, rushed outside to see what was happening, the cloaked figure was riding a black horse with red eyes and had a womans baby in its arms, with the woman standing not 4 feet from it, then the cloaked figure and his horse gallop off into some woods behind the ditch.
<br />

<br />
3rd night of dreams: Exactly the same as the 2nd night. But after that happens, i somehow find myself in a gunshop with several hundred types of bullets, i open one of the boxes and it had hollowpoints in it, but they were silver and longer than conventional bullets, then the owner of the gunshop comes over to me and says 'heres what you ordered', and he pulls a long silver gun from his belt, i buy the gun and the bullets, and walk out of the gunshop, straight back into the 15th century peasants property, when i look back, the gunshop has disappeared, and so have 3 of the bullets.
<br />

<br />
4th night of dreams: When i hear the womans scream, i jump out of my bed, run outside and try to grab the baby from the arms of the cloaked figure, the baby disappears and the cloaked figure jumps from his horse, pulls out a sword, and for some reason, theres already a sword in my hand, not a fancy sword at all, just basic sword, and me and the cloaked figure fight with swords until he slashes me round the face with the end of his sword.
<br />

<br />
Then i woke up, the 4th dream happened last night, and my face really really hurt, like something had hit it really hard, so i got up, looked in the mirror, and something that scared the shit out of me, i had a cut straight along my face, bleeding profusely, from the right side of my nose, across my cheek and down to my jawline, but the scary thing is, thats where the cloaked figure slashed me with his sword.
<br />

<br />
If anyone could shed some light on this situation, id be very very grateful, when i have another dream, i shall post it, and i hope we can make a picture of what the fuck is going on here.

			the end of this dream seems to me that you have had a false awakening.
<br />
is the cut STILL on your face? if not thats what it was.
<br />
in either case you are having a vivid dream that you can remember and its obvious that you are running or battling one of your fears in dream state.

<br />
so i guess the question is.. where is this cut now? and if its not there now where did it go?
<br />

<br />
a similar situation happened to me. i had a dream and i went to the bathroom and only when i looked down at a magazine i realized that i had a dream. so maybe when you looked at the mirror you remembered looking at the mirror in your dream with the gash in your face.
<br />

<br />
i really dont know EXACTLY how or what not but. it could be like a very quick flashback to your dream memory, and the two could have merged in your eyesight.
<br />

<br />
im not really sure about any of this 100% so hopefully there'll be more feedback
