			I think seeing the future is a very mixed issue on here because some believe it and others don't. Do you believe in the ability to see the future?
<br />

<br />
I have no problem believing that seeing the future is entirely possible but its effects are pretty hard for anyone to wrap their head around. Let's say that you see something in the future: You're going to get into a car accident on a certain day. What effect would that have? Would you take actions to prevent it?
<br />

<br />
So you take actions to prevent the accidents and you end up getting slammed in a car accident. Was seeing the future what caused the accident to begin with? Would you have gotten into the accident if you didn't know about it?
<br />

<br />
Let's say that you know about the accident and take steps to prevent it and nothing happens. In that case, did you really see your future? Did you change your future?
<br />

<br />
I could really make it interesting and cross fate and free will into this but I'll save it for another board.
<br />

<br />
It's a very interesting topic. What are your opinions?

			I think its kind of contraversal becasue the future is not set in stone so to speak and if you see the future you can change things a good exaple would be if your mom decided to clean your room and you had a precog dream the night not to long ago of her finding all your psychics stuff and you getting that stuff outta tehre after the dream and when your mom cleans your room outta nowhere you dont get &quot;discovered&quot;

			I'd say that without a doubt it is possible. Thats mostly becuase I've done it, my freinds have done it, and i've read about other people doing it. So from personal experience and others' experience, yes, it is possible.

			i think a better question would be:
<br />

<br />
do you think the future is linear, hard as a rock and unchangable, or is it curvy, and flexable, able to bend to our desicions?
<br />

<br />
and, i think there is no predetermined future.
<br />
 i cannot see it. i can only know when something may happen.

			Only the probable future.
<br />

<br />
Our minds is just a computer, that processes every single varible...but mistakes do happen and it won't be exactly like it happens or it doesn't come close.
<br />

<br />
That also explains my idea of specific fate that our minds create through normal Telepathic messages of others minds and it calculates that and decides the best course of action, but because of our concious mind, it doesn't pan out so well.

			grrr does anybody read those precog articles i wrote? i slaved for ages trying to figure out how ;_;
<br />

<br />
tbh if you do have precog, then dont really misuse it. just one of those unwritten rules, like talking about DBZ on psipog. ya just dont do it.
<br />

<br />
well one ofmy theories was that  were just taking a peek of what is to be. i think everything happens for a reason, i cant be arsed to rant on. read the articles, they have lots of explanation.

			Why won't you stop asking questions and begin your training to find them and experience these things themselves.
<br />

<br />
Most people think they need tot rain their energies and so forth. That's not true, the average human has enough power to perform most of the basic psychic arts (which is taught on this website). They just don't have the proper mindset, belief system, and knowledge to use their energies correclty.
