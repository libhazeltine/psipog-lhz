The guide includes a chapter on how to avoid AOL, and as a result I can only infer that this implies it's something to be avoided. There's no personal vendetta, either - why would I attack your views? I taught you remote viewing. Or do we forget so soon?
<br />

<br />
I don't get a personal record of all your logs sent to me. But I don't need the whole community to come together and decide what is right. Neither do I need you to consider what I am saying. Your opinions don't change facts. The facts are that AOL needs to be controlled, but not stopped completely, and that there are proper channels and proper times for AOL to be recorded in CRV protocol, while at the same time, it is not something to be absolutely halted.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

True, True. I am not arguing facts, I am just expressing that while you state I demonize it, someone else decided I don't make it out to be as bad as it should, and used my article as a reference, along with my forum posts. Also, I do state in the avoidance of AOL section a way to make note of it if you must, and then to move on with the rest of RV. I was also trying to state that I can't please <span style="text-decoration: underline">everyone</span>, unless they all have the same idea of what RV is, and apparently they don't, even with the facts that have been presented long before this ever took place. While you may be one of the best with RV, and true, I did learn most of what I do now from reading your articles, you are not my main audience, as I am not yours.

			As Oneta said, how RV works and what the viewer &quot;should&quot; do isn't something written in stone.  His and Yumper's article outline the basics of what AOL is, and that it's a bad thing.  If they were writing a book, I would expect more.  But they are writing an introduction article for people who want to get into RV.
<br />

<br />
In your old seminars on RV, you taught people to avoid AOL.  You recommended they take a break, and come back with a more clear and focused mind.
<br />

<br />
I don't see how Oneta and Yumper's article &quot;demonize&quot; anything.  It's a solid article that hits the basic points of RV and how to do it.

			Hmm, well enough. I was looking,at the time, for an example there, and I may not have found a very good one. I was also unabashedly assuming where they'd gotten their information, and I apologize for that. 
<br />

<br />
Yes, I did teach to avoid AOL primarily because I was teaching only stage one RV. Very little past that. The AOL from an AOL Bk and the AOL that's recorded are two very different things, though when taking an AOL Bk it's important that we always record the AOL.
