			The glass doesnt need to cover the whole fucking lake, just like a little square or something, and have you ever heard of safety glass, thats what i stood on, unless you hadnt noticed, Criss Angel isnt the fattest person on the block so it wouldnt be easy to break that glass.
<br />

<br />
As for the mirrors, i shall draw you a picture of how it could be done and post it in a couple of hours, as im off to work now, toodleoo.

			even if you aaalll right about that he is disabled person ( cant do any trick without mirrors, glass, ropes ) even if you are so clever, dont you think others people are clever in this way too? I mean no one should be so exited watching it, because they are as clever as you in from of pc.No one would watch this because the ttricks are fake. It woould be better to do by themself tricks in parties and whateva...

So you could have had a very long and thin glass pane stretching across the pool, and the people swimming around in the pool could have been paid to avoid the long length of glass.

yeah, I thought about that, I would need to see it again to figure out if that was possible, Unfortunately, I'm on dial-up, which makes watching online videos a major pain. and yeah, someone post the video, I don't know where to find it.

he also pulled some woman apart, and her legs ran off(robotic?) her top half just sitting on the ground.

			Pulling the woman apart was done by there being 2 dwarves, one standing on the shoulders of one and the other on bottom, and he made it appear like he pulled them apart. 
<br />

<br />
Being cut in half looked like some camera trickery may have been involved. They also didn't show all the angles. 
<br />

<br />
I do like how he'll take old tricks and make revamp them up though. 
<br />

<br />
With walking on water, and across the building, I imagine that was done with a crane or wires, or some similar device holding him on wires unseen from straight above. In both shots they never show an angle from directly above. He certainly isn't walking on glass or any kind of plate in the water, what is holding him up is in something from above. 
<br />

<br />
Remember Criss does many of his stunts in and around the casino that endorses his program. It would not be difficult to set up stunts there.

<br />
of course, and the bottom one lacked a torso. <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> I say this because if memory serves, she was wearing pantsEdit: nope, a skirt it was, sorry, but after watching the episode again, the woman was far too stable. but hey, Kief just made a post without insulting anyone, I'll have to punch that atheist in the nose, tell me there's not a god. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> that's a joke, I kid the atheists! Seriously, I watched the water walking episode again, too. Kief is actually correct, halfway through the pool, he took off his shoes, which sunk right in front of his feet, however, if he were being lifted, his feet shouldn't have normally touched at the same depth of water.
<br />

<br />
also, I watched another episode today, he payed tribute to sigfried and Roy by making an elephant vanish, it was in a street, and an elephant would have broke a trap door, anyway, plus he had people stand in a circle, so it wasn't led out while the audience's attention was elsewhere, so I really don't see how he went about &quot;vanishing&quot; an elephant.

He is an illusionist until proven otherwise. Be happy. Stay in school. Dont do drugs (unlike some people on this forum, not naming names), and be happy you have friends and family, and a roof over your head. Happy now?

			have you seen the little disclaimers before the show starts? Stunts and Illusions...yeah. They could be a cover up but I doubt it. Innocent until proven guilty, but the public normally contradicts that...
<br />

<br />
I like watching him, good entertainment, but not the real thing in my opinion. You want to really levitate? Work your ass off in psionics or be trained in hypnosis. You want to look like you levitate? Go to wikipedia or that magic site one of the people have and learn king's rising(that's my favorite levillusion*), that's pretty good, or try Aliun, but that'll cost ya about $1500.
<br />

<br />
Notice when he cut himself in half they didn't show his cross sections of his lower and upper halves...
<br />

<br />

<br />
Too many of these threads...also if you can't spell his name right please don't bother making threads about him <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> .
