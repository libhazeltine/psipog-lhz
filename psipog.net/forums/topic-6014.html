			I made this technique for beginners, it'll help you to visualize and get the right feeling for PK, it's easy and the success chance is quite big.
<br />
If you're already into PK then you probably won't get any useful results out of this.
<br />

<br />
So far I taught this technique to 2 of my friends which both had small but positive results <span style="font-weight: bold">on the first try</span>.
<br />
(They did use the psiwheel before but they were PK newbies.)
<br />

<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="quote" align="center">  <tr> 	<td class="row1"><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>  </tr>  <tr>	<td class="row2"><span class="postbody">Alright let's get it started, first of all you will need 2 things before we begin - 2 (weak) magnets that fit in your hand.
<br />

<br />
Take the magnets in one hand each, hold them about 3 inches apart and begin to move them closer and further away, repeat that some times.
<br />
Feel them attracting each other, REMEMBER that feeling!
<br />

<br />
Now for the more difficult part, put the magnets aside and get something very light like a hair or a small piece of tin foil. (A psiwheel works too)
<br />

<br />
Imagine the magnetic force from before on the tip of your index finger (that worked best for me but it's up to you), feel it attracting the object you want to move, feel the space between your fingertip and your object start to get smaller and smaller, like a little blackhole.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
As always you should start with small things and then work your way further up.
<br />

<br />
For more advanced people, try this technique with reversed magnets to &quot;push&quot; objects away.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />  
<br />

<br />

<br />
Additional Notes :
<br />

<br />
- It's not magnetism (it's psi if you couldn't have guessed), it's just the best name I could think of.
<br />

<br />
- Tin foil or metal like objects seem to work best because you can imagine that it <span style="font-weight: bold">really</span> is a magnetic force.
<br />

<br />
- The chance of success with this technique is high because you feel that &quot;invisible power&quot; and then recreate it using your own &quot;invisible power&quot;.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Any comments/suggestions are highly appreciated.

			we don't know for sure that it's not magnetism.
<br />
magnetism can effect things differently.
<br />
turn on your radio, there's some electromagnetic radiation.
<br />
scientists just don't know enough yet (or aren't sharing)
<br />
so it's best to not assume what it is and what it isn't.

If it is magnetism then why can we move paper?  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			paper is made of molecules. those molecules are made of atoms. those atoms have a nucleus, which contain protons and neutrons. surrounding the nucleus are electrons. electrons are responsible for electricity, which is a part of one of the 4 fundamental forces: electromagnetism.

look it up on wikipedia or something
