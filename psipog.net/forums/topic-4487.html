			I was recently informed that the male adult brain reaches maturity at age 25 and that the female brain at age 20. both of these are estimates. and when I say mature I mean that new brain cells stop forming, and synapsies between those brain cells stop forming as well. meaning that (for all of you computer people) you can change the software after maturity but your stuck with whatever hardware you already have. computer storage being the brain cells, and RAM memory being the synapsies between them. (although I may be wrong about my analogy on a few levels). now for the big question...
<br />

<br />
-Is psionics software and/or hardware? Being a 20 year old male, I still have time should the answer be hardware. from what I read on the articles at psipog.com psionics is a combo of both. you need to learn how to trigger it (software) and your brain re-wires itself to suit your needs (hardware). thus when you practice again you progressivly make more progress at progressivly shorter intervals. thus when you just start out (in the case of many) progress seems impossibly slow and discouraging. But when you reach the higher levels (such as one of my cousins, who continues to inspire me, he does amazing micro-pk without even knowing it) you get amazing results that continously become more amazing very quickly. that's the end of my statement for those of you interested in my cousin read on.
<br />

<br />
for those of you interested in my cousin, he believes in psionics slightly, but he calls it &quot;ding&quot; power, he just shouts DING DING DING! and he usually gets his way with random events. (I know that sounds made up and humorous, and while it is very funny to watch him look silly it really does work for him!) he'll call numbers on dice BEFORE he rolls them. he does not hit red lights often and when he does they are freakishly short. and he is the only person I know that can say before a game of poker that he &quot;wants a royal flush&quot; and gets it before the end of the night. I am well aware that these could be all co-incidental events. but you will be hard pressed to change my opinion after experiencing events like this for nearly a decade.

			You're half correct: by that age, most brain development has stopped. However, if what you are saying was in fact true, and no new synapses formed, it would be impossible to learn or remember anything. Clearly this is not the case!
<br />

<br />
In fact, you are born with as many neurons as you're going to get, but the configurations and layouts of these do change - quite heavily in children, less in adults.
<br />

<br />
After reaching mature age, learning new tasks is more difficult, but not impossible. A good example of this is language learning, which becomes much more difficult after age 13, and even more difficult after age 20. It is not, however, impossible.

			Thank you Elliptic for that info on synapsies I was wondering how anyone remembers any new infomation after the brain matures.

			This was disproved some time ago, your brain slows down the production of new cells, but it never stops. However, there is debate as to the function of cells formed during adulthood, some think they may even cure depression!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

kay. so i stopped reading after this because its just not true. When you learn. Your brain creates new synapsys and links other thingers in there. Nothing stops happening <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="text-decoration: underline">in</span></span> the brain after the age of anything exept for the fact new stuff is forming as you learn. I think that what you ment is that the size stops. Like the size of the brain in general. It stops making out heads bigger lol.
<br />

<br />
i do know male's stop gowing sexual maturity at the age of 18 and females only stop maturing after there early 30's. I think thats funny cuz if i wanted to get some good action at the 18 i would have to go to a 30 year old.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />  good thing im gay

Yay! I'm not alone!
<br />

<br />
Also, I think it is easier to learn Psionics at a younger age. Synapsies (sp?) seem to form much easier at a younger age, and can be more easily strengthened.
