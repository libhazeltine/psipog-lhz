			I personaly don't I dont understand the concept of the need to take psi from somebody else.
<br />

<br />
I talked to two people who consider themself psi vamps, they like to call psi life energy, which doesn't sound right since I learn from school that ATP that is passed through the food chain is used for life processing, so it sounds like to me these psi vamps can't break down ATP or get enough &quot;life&quot; energy and uses psi to get it from others, it just doesn't make sense.
<br />

<br />
any body have any idea why people think they are Psi vamps? do you believe in psi vamps?

			Well, here is a site that has FAQs on Psi Vampires, and Saragouki Vampires. I'm unsure if this is official or not but it was linked for information on Psi Vampires on another website forums when a member wanted help since the person found out they themselves were a Psi Vampire. They are vampires since they syphon energy from other people to suppliment their own.
<br />

<br />

<br />
(Note: This has some Religious words such as &quot;chakra&quot; and other things. I don't endorse or reccomend this site. Nor do I suggest seaching around it just for the fun of it, but it has information on PsiVampires)

some of the things they say on there is very...humm...stupid?
<br />

<br />
I don't understand why the spereated psi with psychics since non-psion practicioners of psi are still psychic just they aren't as in touch as we are.
<br />

<br />
the energy the describe are mainly feeling based, so that doesn't make to much sense.
<br />

<br />
&quot;If the only side effect that a true energy/psychic vampire had to not feeding were a headache, it would be a crippling headache that would stop normal functioning. Like an extremely severe migraine.&quot;   
<br />

<br />
isn't that just a common side effect when over doing psi or anything for that matter?  usually migraines are from stress too, some people would be fooled from that.
<br />

<br />
living longer...umm, , I heard people normaly could do with practice of meditation and basic mental\physical exercise, although I find the &quot;immortality&quot; to be BS.
<br />

<br />
the &quot;gifts&quot;...ugg...they obviously never heard of psipog, and hopefully they don't..
<br />

<br />
sadly I didn't get infomation on how they became to knowing what they are.

			That place looks like to many goths got together and had a party....a very sad and depressing party....in fact lets just say they got together.
<br />

<br />
Seriously guys, vampires?
<br />
Those aren't vampires, those are socially inhibited kids that choose to be 'vampires' instead of going out into real life and meeting people.  
<br />
Sure, you can stay inside all day and avoid sunlight,  you can put on fake teeth and drink animal blood,  and you can make a web site about vampires, but those don't make you a vampire; those just make you an idiot.

			Imho, energy Psivampires require is somewhat split up from energy our body produces through chemical reactions. If we knew what psi is really about, there would finally be some feedback on how knowing if it's related or not... Hope this makes sense.

			Psi vamps aren't people who are like, actual vampires ands shit.
<br />

<br />
They're just people, who take energy from others and sometimes aren't aware of it.
<br />

<br />
It's like a mood transfer, I think. Ever talk to someone who was feeling absolutely awful, and then after talking to them, you felt awful as well?
<br />

<br />
They don't need psi from others to survive.

			Okay there are three types of vampires that I've experienced
<br />

<br />
Poser Vamps: These are your typical middle-upper class kids who decide to be all rebellious and are attracted by the lore and romance of the vampire life, as shown in movies and Anne Rice books. They have weak psionic powers at best, and are basically total vampire wannabees. They do it because it is &quot;cool&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sanguine Vamps: I'm not really sure about this one because it is extensively hard to prove, but I know a few people who are pretty sure they are ones. They feel for whatever reason that they need blood from time to time. They don't die without it, they just get sick and blah and depressed and generally not fun to be around. They aren't immortal, they can't transfer it to other people, they don't have overly enlarged canines (though some have somewhat larger canines just by chance).
<br />

<br />
Psychic or energy vamps: These people are definitely for real, because I am one to a very small degree, and I've gone out with two psi vamps. For whatever reason, their basic energy imput (chi or what have you) from their surroundings isn't enough to support their everyday activities, so they end up having negative pressure so to speak, when it comes to energy. Energy is drawn in from everything around them, especially people (we're basically walking sacks of energy). That's why many are drawn to crowds or social situations. Many psi vamps are very social, flirty, gregarious, and physical at times. Think about it, it kinda makes sense. If human life-force is similar to other forms of energy in that it obeys the inverse-squared law, the closer you are to someone, the more you can absorb. 
<br />

<br />
Energy vamps follow this particular pattern. Let's say Joey is a psi vamp and Susie is just a regular person. Joey is kinda down, but Susie is very energetic and cheerful. If Joey and Susie spend a lot of time in close proximity (not in a dirty way) eventually Joey will become very energetic and Susie will mellow out. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
I have figured out a very simple and effective way to determine if someone is a real vampire or a poser. Posers will think that it's the coolest thing since sliced bread that they are able to live off of drinking blood or steal peoples energy, while the legit ones shun that fact. The real ones often wish they weren't, and seriously look down upon the posers. Think about it. If you have diabetes or any other deficiency disease, and you needed to take supplements (insulin or hormone replacement or whatever), that is a large hassle, and you don't feel well unless you take your supplements.
<br />

<br />
Artful Dodger: Very insightful. I like your analogy on psi vamps &quot;nibbling&quot; on others energy fields, because that is very much what they do. Often in passing, a psi vamp feeling down will just skim some energy, consciously or subconsciously, off of passing energy fields.
<br />

<br />
And yes there are people who are like energy fountains. They either have too much energy and don't know what to do with it, or they just don't shield very well and leak energy like a sieve. Psi vamps like these people a LOT for obvious reasons.

don't let your ignorance change your veiw on people.

thanks for shining some light on some of the things about energy vampires,defenestrated23, I think I mainly talked to the posers which sort of made me biase on &quot;psi Vampires&quot; but I sort of still have a hard time believe in it, but when I read about the energy vampires,espeically the Suse and Joey Example, it sounds like they can't produce energy well when energy is passed through plants or animals so they use psi to get that energy.
