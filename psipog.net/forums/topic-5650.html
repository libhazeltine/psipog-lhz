I have never thought of trying that. I am not sure if it would work either...sounds interesting to try out, but I don't have the money to go and ask a hypnotist to hypnotize me, and I have no experience with self-hypnosis either so don't think about saying that to me.

			Hm.... that could be interesting, may have varied results too. With access to the subconcious mind, you may be able to do psionic-related thinks easier, but would you even be able to do them at all if you had no past experience whatsoever?

There are many books and DVDs on hypnosys, even self-hypnosis.  I've heard it's not that hard, it just takes a bit of patience and 3 hours of free time.  I really want to learn hypnosis...

I'm pretty sure they'd have to have some past experience so they'd at least know how to do telekinesis.  It might be a little dangerous though.  They might get frustrated and break stuff.  That'd be pretty funny anyways though.  
<br />
Hypnosis is a strange thing though.  It's like hacking into someone's head.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

			I am pretty knowladgeble in hypnosis, so I would love to share my opinion.

In self and regular hypnosis, you are communicating with the persons or your sub-c mind.  Therefore, I believe that it would be benefitial to to suggest to the person that they can perform telekinesis.

I don't really have any one to try it out on, but I would love to see results. I have used it on myself, and I can perform TK, so yeah....

Could you teach me hypnosis?(I doubt it, but it doesn't hurt to ask)  If not, where did you learn it??  Hypnosis is just awesome. <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />   O, JONNYBEGOOD, just cause there's some corny series of CD's that include self-hypnosis doesn't mean it's fake.  Hypnosis is entirely real.

			Hypnosis is very simple. Get some self-hypnosis .mp3s from a p2p program or just do a search on google on how to do self-hypnosis. It's pretty sweet. I used to know how to do it. I'll recite what I remember. Take a deep breath, and hold it in as long as is comfortable. Do this about 3-4 times consecutively, and begin to relax. Count back from 100, repeating in your mind to relax as you count back each time. Also, starting at your feet to your head or vice versa, begin consiously relaxing each part individually. Do this until you've consiously relaxed all parts. Then, you use your own thoughts to program yourself. It's like programming a construct, but you're actually programming your sub-consious.
<br />

<br />
Tell me if that sounds right, and give it a try. I think there's a little I left out 'cause I don't remember all of the details %100, but I remember all that.

			i've been using a hypnotic state as a form of meditation, it works really well.  I have barely practiced PK and i just began staring at the psiwheel and it started wiggling like crazy until i had to go and do the completely stupid thing of trying to make it levitate.  then it stopped.
