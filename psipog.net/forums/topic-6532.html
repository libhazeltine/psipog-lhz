			I'm autistic and I was wondering if there's a way to make me feel my emotions. I have visited an aura reader who says that I do have emotions, but my mind somehow can't connect to my heart. Does anyone know something on this?

			Hmmm, not entirely certain this will work, but...
<br />

<br />
Try to determine exactly how you feel in a particular situation. I don't mean naming a particular emotion; that comes later. What I mean is trying to learn and feel how you react to various situations. For instance, if a particular situation makes you act in a certain way, try to think of what emotion people usually associate that behavior with. Try to analyze the physical sensations you feel. Pay attention to yourself.
<br />

<br />
You probably have emotions. My little brother is autistic and he certainly has emotions. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> The problem could be that you don't know what the emotions feel like to you, so you can't name them or gain control over them. I don't really know you personally, so I can't say that with certainty, but it makes the most sense to me. 
<br />

<br />
That idea may or may not work. Again, I'm not certain, having spent most of my time trying to get control of or suppress my emotions, not the reverse.

			From observation, I'd say that people with autism have emotions in the same ways as everyone else, just are less able to process and understand them, which would naturally hinder understanding the emotions of others.
<br />

<br />
I don't really know much about this, so I'm only making suggestions.
<br />

<br />
Start simple, maybe, like thinking about whether you feel good or bad in a certain situation. Once you get the hang of that you can start expanding on such feelings. Like, do you feel good because of something you've done, or because of something someone else has said or done? Or because of a person or object? If you feel bad, is it because someone has physically hurt you? Or have they said something that makes you hurt? Have you lost something, or failed at something? Did you forget to do something?
<br />

<br />
This isn't a very good explanation of what I mean, and it's only a starting point - hopefully I can trigger some thoughts. I don't know, but let me know if it's any help whatsoever.

			Normal people act because of the emotions they feel. I act acording to what emotions my mind thinks it should feel. I don't feel anything. The only exception is when I'm very angry, wich hapens only a few times a year. I realy want to feel them, but I don't seem to do it as easily as others do. If I felt something I think I would be able to understand them. Nothing wrong with my brain, except this.
<br />

<br />
Fieldmouse: Thinking about emotion is not what I want. If I analyse what I do near a girl, I could say I'm in love. But that would mean I'm in love with half of the girls I know. I got a major problem with choosing things, like school, friends, everything.
<br />

<br />
Bit more about me. I'm nineteen, from the Netherlands, like computers and sience. Asperger Syndrome (autism), high IQ but not the slightest bit of motivation or diciplin to do anything with it. I tried feeling Psi in my stomach and to feel my aura. Both worked after a few secs, but there wasn't any progress after that. I think I'm high sensitive.

			Have you considered trying meditation? Through meditation I am able to cut of my sense of emotion entirely, and am almost certain that the reverse could be done with practice.

Like shenlon said, meditation might help.
