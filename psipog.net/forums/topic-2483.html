			I had plenty of dreams that are lucid, but this one was a bit odd...I'm not sure if it was a dream at all...
<br />

<br />

<br />
I was in science class, finished with my Biology Gateway practice test, I put my head down, started to rest my eyes, and thinking of random thoughts. 
<br />

<br />
Still thinking and noticing my enviroment, I was aware of everything and nothing, but I knew I was still in my science class room, yet, I had a image, with very detailed infomation, from feeling to sight, I was walking and thinking, and slipped on mud. 
<br />

<br />
I grabed hold of my desk in fear of falling, just to be surprised by the thought of how I was conciously thinking and never knew I was sleeping, yet, I knew I was in a classroom and I still took in belief of this.
<br />

<br />
I still remember everything, from when I put my head down to when I woke up....I mean, it didn't feel like a dream on where you didn't know that you slept and didn't have much thought between it...
<br />

<br />
maybe it's not lucid, but I rather hear opinion on it.
<br />

<br />
not English acceptable, but it's readable.

			That was probably a state of dreaming in which the brain was still very active, and all of the senses were felt.
<br />

<br />
Normally, from what I've read, &quot;Lucid dreaming&quot; is simply a person dreaming, but realizing that they are dreaming--and then acting more logical/in control during that dream.

That's a good sign.
<br />

<br />
Having very vivid dreams, with all the senses being used at once, during a dream: that is very &quot;advanced&quot;, IMO.
<br />

<br />
I am wondering how relative a person's psionic power is to the vividness of their dreams. I'm not very &quot;deeply emersed&quot; when I dream, but I can start to &quot;dream&quot; consciously, if I close my eyes and set my mind into that state. The dreams are barely vivid, though.
<br />

<br />
I think that everyone's mind works differently, and some things are easier/have more meaning to <span style="font-weight: bold">A</span> then <span style="font-weight: bold">B</span>.
