			From psiwheels to pencils: A training guide
<br />

<br />
This guide is intended for those who have no specific schedule or training 
<br />
regimen for practicing TK. It will, most importantly, touch all the fine 
<br />
points that seem to be missing many manuals. It will also help those who want 
<br />
to achieve the power and control to move pencils. This is NOT another how-to 
<br />
guide but merely a suggestion as to how training should be done. I highly 
<br />
recommend that those who are reading this guide have read various guides as 
<br />
to how to use TK. Now on to the guide <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
The problem with most psions in learning TK is that once they start, some 
<br />
might find it hard to move up to that next level as did I. I have been 
<br />
practicing for at least a year (on and off, as well as trying a multitude of 
<br />
techniques). And on my way to the holy grail of TK movement (yes for me its the 
<br />
all mighty pencil &gt;.&gt;) I have came across an interesting way to achieve this 
<br />
magnificent feat.
<br />

<br />
The first step on your journey is to obtain a small psiwheel and a room with 
<br />
little air movement. Now you must train. Use whatever method you like until 
<br />
the psiwheel moves/shakes. It might take you awhile or maybe it will take you 
<br />
just a few seconds. Once this is done then congratulations! You're ready to 
<br />
move on the the next level.
<br />

<br />
After you have achieved results, then control becomes the name of the game. I 
<br />
would suggest using your hands to achieve this. Then comes the training part 
<br />
once again. Before you move on to the next level you MUST be able to move the 
<br />
psiwheel left and right, willingly of course. This could take quite a bit of 
<br />
practice and even be very frustrating because sometimes the wheel seems to 
<br />
have a mind of its own. This, along with step one, will probably be the meat 
<br />
and potatoes of training. This is where a large portion of your training will 
<br />
go.
<br />

<br />
Once you gain enough control to move it left and right with your hands for 
<br />
help, you can then graduate to the third step. It's  actually quite short and 
<br />
simple. Personally I use this to &quot;crystallize&quot; my fine points of control and 
<br />
gain a little more power for the bigger objects. This &quot;half step&quot; still 
<br />
involves the rotation of the wheel so don't get too excited. At this point 
<br />
you should take your hands AWAY from the psiwheel and practice moving the 
<br />
wheel just by looking at it. If you can do this and have the same amount of 
<br />
control then its time to move on to the final step.
<br />

<br />
Before we get onto the final step I would like to note that when moving onto 
<br />
bigger objects this outline should be strictly followed but openly. Steps 1 through 3 
<br />
can be used when training with any objects. And might I suggest (sorry cant remember who posted this maybe it was NI but kudos anyways) that you try to get results on the next object you plan on moving to complete the almighty step three. It might take awhile but I find it works just fine.
<br />

<br />
Now for some more training before we finally move on to pencils. For me I 
<br />
thought the jump was kind of big. It was a big downfall for me because even 
<br />
though I had adequate training in the psiwheel. After about 2-3 weeks I still 
<br />
had no results so I went back to the psiwheel thinking that it would still be 
<br />
very easy. To my surprise I had no results with the psiwheel for another 2-3. 
<br />
For this intermediate level of training I highly suggest using a larger 
<br />
psiwheel using a pen or pencil (finely sharpened) to rest the wheel on. The 
<br />
wheels dimensions should be 6x6 in. and made of a fairly durable material. I 
<br />
myself prefer construction paper but a sheet of lined paper cut accordingly 
<br />
works just as well. Another thing you HAVE to remember and I don't stress 
<br />
this lightly but keep your old psiwheel nearby. It makes a great warm-up as 
<br />
well as a way of reassuring that your technique is right on target. 
<br />

<br />
For me, the smaller wheel would spin even though my goal was to move the 
<br />
bigger one. After a while I began to ignore this and remember that at least 
<br />
something was moving from my focus -_- .
<br />

<br />
After you get results from the new psiwheel follow steps 1-3 until you have 
<br />
gained more power and control. I thought there was a lot to learn about 
<br />
control and power when you move the bigger wheel.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I have just began to get shakes on the pencil and will write another manual 
<br />
if a find a different method for moving larger objects. But for now I suggest 
<br />
that you should keep the big psiwheel with you when you practice on the 
<br />
pencil or a similar object to make sure your technique is working right. 
<br />

<br />
I would also like to remind people that although my guide for training is 
<br />
really in-depth, don't forget that there are some really good tips in other 
<br />
guides, manuals, and even the forums that should not be forgotten when 
<br />
training.
<br />

<br />
May the psi be with you

			I second Apollo, I may try some form of this since I'm getting better with the psiwheel but am having difficulties taking any further steps.
