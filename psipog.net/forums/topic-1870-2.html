			i'm just confused whether i even need to generate this energy of mine or not to do psi. Do I even need to get all that static etc to even attempt to form a psiball? Or I just need to vizualize and try to feel it?
<br />

<br />
More importantly, i need to know for sure what this &quot;energy&quot; of mine really is.

			Well Kaigen, we might only be able to help you so far. This &quot;energy&quot; whatever it may be, is being generated by you. For what purpose and how is anyone's guess. The ultimate disicion on what it is and why it's there is up to you. 
<br />

<br />
Energy is being generated all the time but here's a way to find out wheather or not you need it for psi;
<br />
1. Attempt to make a psi ball WHILE concentrating on this &quot;energy&quot; and observe what happenes.
<br />
2. After you do #1, attempt to make a psi ball without it and observe what happens. 
<br />

<br />
If it goes faster/easier with the &quot;energy&quot;, use it to your advantage. If there is no difference, then go with what's easier and more comfortable.
<br />

<br />
But don't curse this &quot;energy&quot;, you have it for a reason. Maybe it doesn't have a name, maybe it doesn't need one. All we know is that you have it, we (most) don't, therefore it's your gift. 
<br />

<br />
All the questions worth knowing have no answer or are very hard to figure out. What this &quot;energy&quot; is certainly belongs with those.
<br />

<br />
Either way, i wish you luck with psionics, and i hope that your &quot;energy&quot; will prove useful to you.

			That is a stern possibility, we will grow and become more powerful, it is inevitable. 
<br />
Maybe Kiagen is the next step in this evolution; a living psi generator with his own visible, physical field availible to him since his younger years.  
<br />
You maybe onto something there PsykillerX...

			Hmm.... Anyone here strong in aura vision? Maybe if they could get a good lock on on me and take a good look at this energy of mine, then they could tell what it is and more importantly it's capabilities.
<br />

<br />
Mindhack, i did try the steps.... i form psiballs and shields together MUCH faster with my energy than without it. Today i formed a shield around me that almost lasted whole day. Periodical black streaks (very faint) was seen coursing around the outline of my body. For some reason though, i vizualized the shield being red originally, but then eventually it turned to black as well as my vision for it, which was pretty odd. It happened automatically just like that, as if my mind was forced to change it to black yet it was natural.

			Well, I'm glad to hear that my advice worked. So, since it worked well with the &quot;energy&quot;, my obvious advice is to stick with it. The color change does seem a bit odd, but strange things are bound to happen with psionics. 
<br />
It could be that your &quot;energy&quot; is a Psi ampliphier and gives you faster results, if that's the case, the congrats, see what else you might be able to do with it. (Pk, Tk etc.) Who knows, you might be the next step in Psion evolution.

			Kaigen, me and you need to really talk. You definitely have a powerful energy about you, I don't doubt you for a second. However, I am a bit concerned about a few things. For one, are you now able to control this black energy of yours when you go to make a psiball, or does it still go haywire? Also, you mentioned having a lot of negativity about you, if so, this can attract evil energies to you more so when you go to take in energy from different sources. One thing you need to know, is that there are good and bad energies around us in all sources, so be wary of that. Also, I know of a technique to release any negative energy inside of you, so we need to talk about that. What else? If I were close enough to you, I could read your energy level, and tell you whether you need to do this technique or not. One more thing: is black your favorite color?

Black is often associated with secrets, disease, and death.

I personally see it as deep thought, however.

			My advice would be...
<br />
If you have a place where you could be alone.You should do some meditations - kundalini or chakra breathing or simple dynamic.
<br />
Those techniques are very very strong if you do it good.But it requires experience and maybe a little consultation about all stages of meditations and practise.
<br />
Later you could try to feel yourself...
<br />
1. before meditation how do you feel 2. how is your psi-ball
<br />
3.after meditation how do you feel 4. how is your psi-ball 
<br />
I dont know are you gonna try my suggestion  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />  but it sure would give really differences.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Kaigen, about this shield you talked about where it emits black sparks and what have you... have you ever tried focusing on this shield till you can see it well then making a psi ball and seeing if the shield/aura(if that is what it is) goes away? I'm just guessing at this though just an idea... <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

			Kaigen, it seems to me (My opinion dont matter Im a newbie...) That you have really strong psy energy and that you should maybe practice psy because with the way you explain it, you could go really far in this field!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
