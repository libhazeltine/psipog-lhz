			I've been working on pk, however this afternoon when i went to Wal-Mart, i kept getting bombarded with a ton of emotions. Right now i'm still overloaded from that jaunt. What shielding techniques would be best for controlling the influx of emotions?
<br />
I honestly had thought i wasn't even sensitive on the empath level but after working for about a week on pk stuff seems that i'm getting bombarded. This is very distracting and i'm finding myself very testy and wanting to go hide-bury myself where there is no one around.

			a sheild is just a large construct, you can program it to do whatever (in consideration) you want it to do.  if you want to filter out emotions and empathetic overload, just program your sheild to.  you could also program your sheild to filter out any telepathic/empathetic links or broadcasts unless you want them to get through.  you could use a visualization while sheilding to aid in the process.  something like a relfective/mirror surface of the sheild, or a reflective &quot;metal&quot; could help.

			heh shielding works fairly well unless somebody is broadcasting quite strongly then it's like my shield doesn't even slow it down :S. Earlier this afternoon, there was a nasty kind of bee outside of the cardoor that I was wanting to get in. Mom wasn't paying any attention and she is very much deathly afraid of most bees and the windows were down. I told her to get the windows up before the dam thing got stuck in the car and she wasn't listening so I attempted to broadcast alarm toward her telepathy wise, seemed that it was an empathic result. She said i was throwing off all kinds of vibes, not quite sure what went wrong but afterwards she was shaking, not good.

			Imagine a shield that will block out any unwanted emotions. Use whatever symbols, colors, or senses that will best fit with this shield. Find what works best for you and build upon it  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

no, that isn't good...i don't know why an empathetic result would occur when attempting telepathy...my suggestion is (unless you WANT to recieve telepathic/empathetic messages) program your sheild to block out all telepathic/empathetic messages.  this would of course hinder telepathic communitcation, but it should also help out in case of overload.

			Actually I don't want to block everything out, basically just filter out about 90-95% of the stuff, gives me a heads up warning if something is about to happen. I live next to an area that is basically one of the most crimed filled cities in the world. If i totally block everything out then, I won't be able to tell when i need to get the hell out of there ect.
<br />
Regardless still need practicing on both, can't use chat yet <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />, got another week to go

			in that case (^above^) then it isn't telepathy/empathy that is warning you, it's more of precog or even sensitivity/awareness.  in this case, blocking out all empathy/telepathy messages, links and broadcasts won't impair the ability to know when something bad is about to happen.  
<br />

<br />
you can program a sheild to filter out <span style="font-style: italic">unwanted</span> empathy/telepathy; this would allow you to select what links/messages/broadcasts you want to let through while keeping the overloading minimal.
