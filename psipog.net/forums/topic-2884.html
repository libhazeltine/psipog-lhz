			When I first started with the Psi Wheel &amp; also reading some information about the concept of telekenesis.  I was highly reminded of the Star Wars film.  
<br />

<br />
I remember when I was little &amp; saw Luke Skywalker being trained on the planet Dagobah with yoda.  He was levitating the rocks out in the woods.  When I saw this, I did not think this as supernatural but instead a HIGHLY natural occurance.
<br />

<br />
When I did the psi wheel, it worked real well when I pretended that I was in the Star Wars film &amp; that I was Luke.  I know that sounds cheesy, but it worked.
<br />

<br />
I recognized that it did not matter how strained my hands were, or how my brain felt.  I kept on relaxing &amp; recognizing that everything has an energy field around it &amp; that I can affect this with my own.  I can move this.  This is real.  I was reminded by the following quote,
<br />

<br />
&quot;When one is calm, it is easier to feel the ebb &amp; flow of the force&quot;
<br />

<br />
Keep that in mind.  You are not the force, but a vehicle of it.  It binds EVERYTHING.

			One of the best examples from Star Wars is when he has the helmet that covers his eyes and he's trying to block the lasers from the droid. And then Obi Wan tells him to stop trying to use his senses and to let go. I'm not even a big fan of the movies, but when I first started my psi training, I found it to be the perfect example.

			While I'm sure it counds cheesy to a lot of folks, I know exactly what you mean, and in fact I use a similar technique when I do TK.
<br />

<br />
I envision all the energy and matter near me - I try to 'feel' it, really stretch out and understand it's movement and how it flows. Then I visualize it - permeating everything. From there I twist or turn or simply send a ripple along it. It's not a 100% effective technique, but I've found it works for those days when I'm having a really hard time.
<br />

<br />
Really trying to feel 'The Force', that big energy field that's just everywhere, is an interesting experience - and partially a true one as well. Einstein told us that everything IS made of energy, and in that vein it's a very easy hop to believeing that the Force could be real - though I don't necessarily believe it guides our actions or anything.
<br />

<br />
The way they descibre it in the movies almost makes me wonder if old George Lucas is a Psion. *L*

			A long while back I was into Jediism.  Which was the jedi religion.  Online there were a lot of sites which gave instructions and methods for tapping into the force.  George Lucas did not make up the force, but pulled it from various religious beliefs around the world.
<br />

<br />
It is known as Chi, Odic force, Prana, Psi, etc.
<br />

<br />
The jedi religion sites that I found instructed people on meditation, martial arts, codes of conduct/laws, and psychic ability/manipulation or psionics and other forms of mysticism.
<br />

<br />
I though have not been able to find any jedi religion site since they have been taken off.
<br />

<br />
But I can agree.  &quot;An energy field which surrounds all living things, which binds the galaxy together, penetrating us.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I did print out a jedi training manual which I used for about 3 years &amp; gained a lot from it.  It combines concepts from Taoism, Buddishm, Christianity, Mysticism, Yoga, and things from the movies as well.
<br />

<br />
I am thinking about typing up a copy of it.  From the manual is where I get, &quot;When one is calm they are more ready to feel the ebb &amp; flow of the force&quot;
<br />

<br />
I have done the meditations and have felt it &amp; have percieved objects with the force &amp; manipulated them.
<br />

<br />
Not in the sense of telekenesis, but in the sense of altering its energy whereby it will cause an effect ether immediately or eventually in time.
<br />

<br />
For an example;
<br />

<br />
Walk up to a tree on the side of the road, I percieve it with the force, I sense it, then I fly up (astral) and push the tree downward.  Then perhaps later on in the week I find the tree cut down, or it feel over, or its branches are broken.  Etc.
<br />

<br />
Or say I do that with a cup on the table at school &amp; then someone comes by and picks up the cup.
<br />

<br />
Thats what I mean.  
<br />

<br />
Manipulating the force is no different than manipulating energy.  Which is the basis for all witchcraft &amp; sorcery.
<br />

<br />
I find HIGH similiarities between Psionics &amp; Jediism.  It is amazing.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I myself am a chaos magician and am taking what I can from psionics and combining it with a lot of my work.

			It is a possiblity to gain alot more control over your Sub-C if you pretended you were someone else. It is primal instinct, if trained, to take on some chracteristics of whatever you are trying to mimic. Thus, you would not tell yourself, &quot;this is not real...&quot;

			In Europe there was some sort of poll once on what religion you were, and I think it was Jedi (or something related to that) that beat Christianity.
<br />

<br />
But yea, Star Wars can be a good example.  Me and my bro use &quot;the force&quot; in games to just let go.  Sometimes we can be looking away, look back and it turns out we accomplished whatever we were trying to do <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />.  Mainly fighting games like Street Fighter. Just an example, this can easily relate to doing things with psi and all that.

			I always thought(when i was little) that jedism would make an awesome philosophy/religion thing, becuase every one would be happy! lol  Alot of what they say makes a whole lot of sence.  Then when i stated looking into religion more i relized how rediculously close jedism is to many Eastern philosophies, Buddhism inpeticular.  There is alot of truth in what the jedi believe many of thier qoutes make alot sence.  
<br />

<br />
I dont  think this is going to be locked.  idk it may though so be careful.  But it all just philosophy stuff no gods in this thread.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />
