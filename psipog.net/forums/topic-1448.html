			Perhaps the site administrator should read posts a little more carefully before locking them. Perhaps then he would understanding I wasnt advocating substance abuse which i clearly stated, nor did I suggest breaking the law. I was asking for people to share their experiences and possibly look for connections in an open minded way, which clearly didnt happen. If you would like to find a specific example of how I was advocating &quot;substance abuse&quot; or &quot;breaking the law&quot; then by all means, lock my thread, and enlighten me as to what I did wrong so that I can make sure it doesn't happen again. But until you <span style="font-weight: bold">prove</span> there was anything in my post which directly broke the rules, I would ask you in the spirit of fairness and open-mindedness to unlock my thread.

It doesn't matter if the next sentence you SAY you aren't condoning drug use... in those two previous sentences, you ARE condoning drug use.  Actions speak louder than words.  This falls under the same logic of: &quot;No offense, but your mom is a total bitch and looks like a cow.&quot;  Just because you say &quot;no offense&quot; in front of it doesn't mean people aren't allowed to take offense to it.  Just because you put a disclaimer on your post doesn't mean that your post doesn't advocate drug use.

Technically, putting a disclaimer in my post shows that I do not condone drug use, since I am putting up protest and censure, rather htan merely overlooking or disregarding it.

I am not pleading or arguing in favor of drug use. Nothing is favorable of drug use in my post. I stated that these substances have a relationship to psychic activity and that they are not as harmful as commonly said to be. These are both facts which I can prove if asked to. The definition states to speak out, plead, or argue in favor of. I merely stated facts from a unbiased point of view. I can't say your doing the same.

			Why <span style="text-decoration: underline">should</span> the topic be unlocked?  Owner of site says don't talk about it.  It is clear that he read it and evaluated it.  Your topic got locked, oh well, it's happen to me more than once, you get over it.
<br />

<br />
PS - By the way, you don't have to prove that anything broke the rules in order to lock or delete it.

Yes there is.  The two sentences I quoted are arguing in favor of drug use.
<br />

<br />
Keep in mind that we get a lot of 13 year old kids coming to the forums.  Perhaps my wording in the rules is inaccurate - but even then, your post is still inappropriate.  If a kid is sitting there being offered pot, I don't want him to think back to a post on PsiPog and reason, &quot;Well, I know it's bad for me, but that one post said it might help with psychic abilities, so maybe it can't hurt to try.&quot;  And don't argue with me that no one is that stupid.  Because some kids are that stupid.  If you really think I'm doing something totally terriable and I'm so mean to censure you, then you're free to create your own forum about anything you want.
