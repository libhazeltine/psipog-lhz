			How about a section specifically for Auras and how to see? I don't think it's psyionics (spelt wrong i know), theres also no tutorial on the website. But still, a topic about this on your experiences, how-to's, tips etc I think is worthwhile.
<br />

<br />
lol I think it's because I saw my  first aura a few days ago <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> even though I can't do TK yet or a OBE 100%. And ever since, after some practice I could see auras of people with a little effort.

			Just a few things I saw, you can comment on yourself if you want:
<br />

<br />
* My bed made from wood --&gt; White glow around edges
<br />
* Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus calculator --&gt; White distinct glow
<br />
* Me --&gt; Blue
<br />

<br />
Basically you look, not at the object, but just to the side of it. Don't concentrate on it, just let your eyes doze off and lose some focus naturally at the same time, you'll start to see a glow. It took me nearly a whole minute before I could see a light white glow around my graph.calc and later it increased in opacity. 
<br />

<br />
Of course, this was all after I saw my aura accidently a few days ago when I was looking at my elbow thoughtlessly. Before that I couldn't see anything, now I can. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
And strangely enough, the day before I saw my 1st aura, I did a exercise to open the so-called 3rd eye chakra. I guess it worked <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

Probably not, because seeing auras is called auric-vision.

			Its an interesting idea but i dont think it's going to happen at least not on the temporay forums. The more we break each subject in psionics down the more confused people get about what to post (noobs mainly) also it makes a hell of alot more work for the staff having another section to mod. I dont think it's practical really, maybe a board that encompass's a few things with that in it but not one on it's own.

			PsiPog's official stance on the subject is that there has been no scientific proof that auras exists (the K-photographs don't count for a number of reasons), and that they are a matter for religion to handle.  Obviously, this is not the view of certain people in the forums, but the line has to be drawn somewhere, and usually this is an area of things that we delete.
<br />

<br />
If you do want to talk about auras, however, there are a number of different places that you can turn, such as the Astral Society (http://www.astralsociety.com/), last I knew.

That aside, I don't like the idea of a section dedicated to inducing synaethesia. Probably addles your brain.

			i have to agree with the original poster here. i deeply believe that aura's are not only real, but that they do indeed have scientific proof just as many &quot;religious&quot; things have scientific proof and the belief in that proof is held by the eye of the beholder. if there is no aura viewing forum here, i will be glad to provide that same thing at my own site. (that was not meant to advertise or put down psipog at all).

			It doesn't matter what any individual believes. It's what Peebrain thinks, as he runs the site. If Peebrain and the other important people here at Psipog decide that chakras and auras are too religious for Psipog, then there won't be a section on them.

Not only is there no proof for auras, there is no proof for any religion either. There is <span style="font-style: italic">evidence</span>, but not proof. If there was proof, it wouldn't be considered religion.

Not only does this statement make me want to kick you, but it's also false. By that logic, I can claim that because some homeless guy is talking to what he believes to be an alien, that aliens are real.
