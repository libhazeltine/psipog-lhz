According to what I've heard, PK isn't really making flames. It is the manipulation of them.

			in complete disregard to you question, I have been able to make a make go out almost right when it starts, maybe like 2-3 seconds, yet, i have not been able to make it relight or just plain light up again. Sry, just had to share my experince.
<br />

<br />
Also, it is much easier to make the fire go out, then to make it relight. Months is my answer. Pure concentration is the key.

			Well it's possible, to indeed light something on fire, but not produce it in thin air.
<br />
Like maybe light a candle, I think peebrain or NI said something about it in one of the articles... or it was someone else... not sure <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

			i think that it is definitly possible to make a flame from thin air because all fire needs is oxygen which is in the air. There is a term that firemen use (i dont know what it is) but it is when there is a flame in a 2 story house and the fire is on the 1st floor, the heat would rise up to the 2nd floor and when the air gets too hot patches of fire start to light up in the air. So I think it is possible but you have to be very experienced and be able to maintain a steady flame.

			A fire can't survive on just oxygen. Oxygen itself doesn't burn, it just promotes burning. There's a big difference.
<br />

<br />
If you take a flint and try to make sparks in a room with pure oxygen, not a lot would happen. On the other hand, if you had a stick that has a glowing ember on it and stcuk it in the same room, then the stick would combust. And keep in mind this is a room with pure oxygen.
<br />

<br />
That being said, it is possible to light a flame, if you had something like a candle or some kindling to start out with. I think there is an article on the main page in the pk section called &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; that talks about heating things up and cooling them down with pk.

			Isotope go look up on pure oxygen burn. On earth agree majority of the time oxygen will not burn but Look at one of the apollo mission's they used pure oxygen at the time and there was a major explosion, and the result of it was just a little spark in the air.
<br />
The only reason why we don't have oxygen burning down here is for 2 reasons, Nitrogen helps keep the explosive capabilities down which inturns increases the amount of heat that's needed to cause oxygen to explode/become into fireball.

			This is getting into combat guys......I wouldnt be tlking about how you can use two psionic techniques can be extremely dangerous when mixed.....but the best thing a pyro pk user could do would to be.....what ever their limit is.....theres not really a &quot;best thing&quot; that one division of psi can do because they can all be combined to make each other stronger...

I don't really think this is quite into combat. IMO anyway..
<br />
It'd be pretty interesting mixing the two right enough..Although I think it be more &quot;Remote presence&quot; or whatever rather than remote viewing.
<br />
Might give it a shot sometime.
