Some believe that the 'third eye' is sensative to extra sensory perceptions such as brainwaves or emotions. Also commonly referred to as a chakra, along with the other 'sensitive' spots on one's body.

			Telepaths that don't believe in the third eye is like super man not believing in the god damned sun. It's the source of our damn power but some of us choose to not believe in it. It just makes me laugh and wonder what type of meditations they use to increase their ability. Then I remember that some psychis don't even believe that meditation is neccessary to increase power.

Ha ha ha, fun stuff.

You have all together 12 main chakra points through out your body.
<br />

<br />
7 main ones that you always hear about.
<br />
2 for your hands, and 2 for you feet
<br />
and the 8th chakra that is actually your energy center above your head. 
<br />

<br />
When studying the chakra system anybody who reads a book or two about realizes taht the human body was actaully designed to be psychic. Each chakra point controls physical parts of your body. 
<br />

<br />
The beginning chakras deal with the mastering of the self ending with the fourth heart chakra. Then the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th deal with communication.
<br />

<br />
the 5th chakra point being for your mouth of course.
<br />

<br />
The sixth chakra point, the one that we deal with. is the third eye. And deals with clairvoyance and telepathy when opened.  The 7th and 8th deal with a connection to god and all things including the universe. 
<br />

<br />
third eye chakra meditation is important to the development of telepathic powers. buy a book, go to a website. it's everywhere. But if you dont want to believe it exists (LMFAO) go right ahead. Your entitled to your opinion.

You're kinda stuck on this whole &quot;chakra&quot; thing, aren't you?
<br />

<br />
The chakra system <span style="font-style: italic">isn't</span> a required belief system for psychic practice. Some religious groups and body energy groups place faith in it, but many don't. If you believe in it, all the power to you. I, for one (of many), don't. Some people have gotten all uppity with me when I express this opinion, and give me the whole &quot;Well, when you're creating a psiball with your hands, what do you think you're using? HAND CHAKRAS! HAHA YOU ARE STUPID I WIN!!!1&quot;
<br />

<br />
My response? &quot;Why are you using your hands to create constructs?&quot;
<br />

<br />
This usually throws them off. No, I don't use my hands when creating constructs, so that would render this argument completely moot. Honestly, I've never seen any proof that chakras exist, other than they're highly stylized in many anime cartoons.

What isn't to believe about chakras? Something with a belief so widespread has to have some credability, it seems. That's what I thought with things like TK and energy manip., and  I was right. At each point where a supposed 'chakra' point is located, there is a bundle of nerves.
<br />

<br />
Chakras are just psi energy centres. The points that connect them are called meridians, and there are hundreds of minor ones throughout the body. Do a quick search on chakras. Really read up on them, and if it doesn't change your outlook, that's fine, but consider, as with psi, and everything on this site, that you're just being closed minded.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

Believe as you so desire. I desire not to prove anything to anybody. 
<br />

<br />
But let me tell you soemthing. Sometimes proof can be proven by obtaining power. The more powerful you become the more the coincidences towards the chakra theory will occur. 
<br />

<br />
Sometimes people get so caught up in obtaining proof through media. But believe is uncertain and subjective. Experience is the mother of all certainty. Instead of researching countless topics to prove the existance of ghosts simply gain aura vision with your own eyes. Want to know the true nature of psi? SImply become more powerful an the answers will reveal themselves to you. That is how the chakra system was created so long ago. Beings became so powerful that the nature of energy through out their body became obviouss to them. They obtained all the perceptiosn tools needed to obviously see what was in front of them. 
<br />

<br />
If you keep training diligently you will reach a level where the answer will reveal itself to you. The question is, will you accept the absolutelness of your experience or contining holding on to the subjectivity of belief?
