			started think 4 days ago and couple days ago got psi wheel to move at pretty good clip <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />. now however after i told mom what i was up to dumb me. She is totally against it and I haven't been able to move psi wheel hardly at all. However this evening finally got a little movement again but the main problem seems to be it'll move an inch or so either direction and then just lock down with full resistance. I check with my finger and there's resistance that is measurable enough that i can feel with the finger. What can I do to avoid that resistance and also for some reason the darn thing loves to slide off the pin.

			Just keep on practicing. Don't get frustrated or obsess over it. Practice and if movement will come by itself.

			Well, at least your subconcious wants to listen.
<br />

<br />
And by that I mean your mother's disapproval has been ingrained into your head as a Bad Thing? and something you shouldn't be working to gain. This is probably part of the reason that you're having trouble. And it's also something you'll have to make a decision about too - are you interested enough in PK to go against your mothers wishes and teach your subconcious it's ok to do so? Sure it doesn't sound that big, but if you do then it'll probably take more concious thought and consideration afterwards if she tells you to do something.
<br />

<br />
Another item is that when you sit down at the wheel, you hear your mothers voice telling you not to do it. That's a pretty big distraction.
<br />

<br />
I had something similar recently when I hinted at a friend to see if he was interested in Psionics and got the reply 'It's not possible. No - not at all.' and really had an impact - the nest few days I found it very hard to move the Psi wheel. 
<br />

<br />
The only real way to deal with something like that is to prove it wrong in your head. You may think you know it's true,  but if you're sitting down and hearing it all over again, it's just not resolved. You need to confront it, dissect it, and disprove it. Once that's done it's no longer an obsticle.

			That's the strange thing though, i can still do the psi balls just the pinwheel seems to be affected, i'm hoping that i can convince my Sub-C to go against mom's wishes with the use psi balls :O. Got a cat going insane from my experiments on him  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />
