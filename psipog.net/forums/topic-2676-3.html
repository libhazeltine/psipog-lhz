			Also, we did prank him back.  You won't find that on his page though <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
When he first wrote his article, he leeched images off the psipog.net server.  So I changed the images to some funny pictures, and some things like &quot;PsiPog ownz me!&quot;, and stuff like that.  He didn't catch on for a few months  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /> .

			Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
I remember that. That was funny stuff. Also, when he pranked us, we quickly caught on however, some people didn't find it as humorous as the rest of us. Hence the ban <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. I do also remember that prank leading to some decent conversations based on psionics and animals. Some good came out of it. 
<br />

<br />
Take care.
<br />

<br />

			ok, i see what you're saying now, sorry for the confusion (working late kills me lol).  it was kind of funny, but a bit immature IMO.  he just showed his own maturity by pranking a site that tries to act as professionally and peacefully as it can.
