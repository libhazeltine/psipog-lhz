these are the kinds of skeptics we dont like. the kind that will try to discourage you because of what they believe or w/e their reasons are. but it is also very good to be skeptical. if you blindly accept things you are likely to fall in with a cult and end up committing mass ritual suicide. and all the ppl who have been jack asses to me have been addicted to something if not something illegal. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

That is well said.

Fully agree on the skeptics that do not even allow the discussion and simply close the subject (like in Markus's example), but hey, that's not just being skeptic, that's being stubborn like hell and having no bloody common sense at all. I bet such people don't last here for long, + why would they even come if they're so sure about it?

			Larryleisure, my name is not markus.

Honourable_psion, i do agree with your view, but ive only rarely seen open minded skeptics on psipog, but the majority tries to deter believers from practicing Pk, i could name a few names, but i dont believe in flaming (much). I have no idea why these types of skeptics are such assholes, or why they have to be complete assholes, if they think were wasting our time, why would they spend all of their time telling us it wasnt real, i would just let the Pkers get on with it no matter what my views on Pk were.
<br />
Here are some rules that these skeptics break when they become assholes:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Dont force your beliefs/opinions on others&quot;
<br />
&quot;Be Nice&quot;
<br />
&quot;Be intelligent&quot;
<br />
&quot;Avoid the mentality of, i am right, everyone else is wrong&quot;
<br />
&quot;Research your topic in depth&quot;
<br />
&quot;Dont attack others&quot;
<br />
&quot;Laugh&quot;
<br />
&quot;Avoid preaching 'the truth'&quot;
<br />
&quot;Research evidence without bias&quot;
<br />
&quot;Be understanding&quot;
<br />
&quot;Be Fair&quot;
<br />
&quot;Dont try to manipulate others&quot;
<br />

<br />
The three rules that are almost always broken are:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Be Nice&quot;
<br />
&quot;Dont attack others&quot;
<br />
&quot;Avoid the mentality of, i am right, everyone else is wrong&quot;
<br />

<br />
I give no kind of respect for people who break these rules, they should think about their argument before they think they have a sensible one.
<br />
One of the 'arguments' im increasingly hearing is 'Pk is not real', this 'argument' is not backed by any kind of evidential information, or a sensible attitude, which encroaches on the rule &quot;Be Intelligent&quot;.
<br />

			sorry that I mispelled your name.... <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />
I agree with you completely, and understand fully ur view.. 
<br />
I'd even say that it's a bit strange because to be honest what I see you can do in other threads look sometimes hard to believe, for me at least, which is normal since I'm a skeptic. But on the other hand we can agree on things, which is good. 
<br />
So far I don't think I've been rude or said things in a way to just destroy people. And also I try to read before I post stupid questions or arguments about the validity of things that happen or are said here, but there's a lot to read, and I'm quite new. And I can understand why there some tension and people become nervous or feel offended. I can imagine if I were you, being able to do some of your stuff and having to deal with all those skeptics, that sometimes i'd rather want to slam the door instead of remaining polite and gentle and explain things in a nice way. 
<br />
You know, my main goal here is the same as yours probably, it's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">learning</span>. And one thing that scares me would be to put myself and my time into something to suddenly find out it was all bullshit, pure invention and manipulation. &amp; that is a dangerous thing, not only for me.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, tx for your response, and sorry again for your name lol <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			Thankyou.

We people on psipog completely welcome skepticism, as long it does not break any of the rules i previously stated. Skeptics just have a bad name around here for being complete morons, going on the basis of 'i am right, you are wrong'. Its nice to see a proper skeptic once in a while.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

			I feel sorry for the skeptics that are polite and intellegent most of all because such a bad stereotype has been put on skeptics. The asshole skeptics are just people that have no life and are looking for some purpose so they just try to disprove people with different veiws than most. <img src="images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" border="0" />
