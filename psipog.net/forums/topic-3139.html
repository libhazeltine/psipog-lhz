			I can communicate with my subconscious fairly well. Well enough to know that it is superior to your conscious mind in many ways, and inferior in only one way. It creates your conscious mind, and yet, your conscious mind (your will) has to capacity to order your subconscious to change this or that, or make this happen. Or whatever. 
<br />

<br />
This capacity is widely ignored or never noticed by 99% (rough estimate) of the world's populace.
<br />

<br />
Over time, i've noticed a lot of people asking for guidance, and getting flame replys or stupid replys and very highly opinionated replies.
<br />

<br />
This, you could consider as an opinionated Topic. Or you could not, it's up to you. Your decision does, after all, ultimately depend on what it is. This is because, what is it to you, is what it is. That's how it is.
<br />

<br />
Your subconscious mind <span style="font-style: italic">made</span> your conscious mind. When we are born, the mind is one thing. Singular. It begins to build, first creating the building blocks and structure necessary to create a conscious mind, then eventually creating a conscious mind, heavily (but not completely i think) relying on sensory data. Words, images, people, places. Existence. The singlular mind creates using the body's five senses, and it's own driving force. 
<br />

<br />
Once the conscious portion is completed enough (sometime between the early years of childhood, the driving force &quot;jumps behind the wheel&quot;, leaving the true mind to it's extensively numerous functions. It might still &quot;talk&quot; a little bit to the true mind, but mostly, it's busy looking at the road ahead and in front of it. Sometimes, it forgets about the true mind, the subsconscious mind, completely. This could go on for most of a person's life, I believe, and they would still be able to start talking to it again. It's always there, so why not? This is what i have, some time ago, begun the process of doing. It is working, so far, in theory, but I have much practice to do yet. I can &quot;talk&quot; fairly well with my subconscious mind, but, I need to start doing less &quot;talking&quot; and more &quot;listening&quot; because I can't understand a lot of things.
<br />

<br />
The &quot;driving force&quot; i spoke of is the will. The will makes consciousness possible. The will is why you have awareness. Normally a part of the mind as a whole, it may be considered masculane, for division's sake. Consider the subconscious as feminine.
<br />

<br />
This whole topic is an analogy, which, I hope, will get through to most people. Consider it an opinion if you like, but I know the workings of the mind quite well, and i will tell you it is quite factual. I spent a lot of time thinking about how to go about expressing, consciously, the working of the subsconscious mind, and now that i've done so, it has helped me greatly the last while. I just though now to post it as a topic, in the hopes that it can help the development of people.
<br />

<br />
There is so much more I could say, but i do not wish to rant or confuse people, so I will refrain. Any questions, however, I would be glad to see if i can answer. General questions regarding the operation of the mind, solely, of course. Don't ask me how to do macro psychokinesis, because it's the one thing i've not yet successfully done, that i want to do. There's a mental block i've set up in there somewhere, and it's a tricky one. Sunnuva bitch, really.

			What's the method that you use to open up channels of communication between the concious and sub-c? I've been trying to do this as sub-c been doing to much without my concious mind's intent :S not good at all and can be dangerous <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

			Good subject, I suppose it would help others a great deal if you went out and told people how to communicate with their subconscious <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.
<br />

<br />
--
<br />
Personally, I tried doing this today because of something I read elsewhere... I suppose the methodology that you use involves some form of meditation/relaxation, followed by some sort of visualization of &quot;going into your mind&quot;?
<br />

<br />
I am, I think, pretty creative so I have thought of several ideas how I would &quot;contact myself&quot;. They involved a visualization of &quot;My place&quot; (Varies from a grassy field smothered in darkness, with a pond and a waterfall, and lots of starts/trees, or a cave with glowing mushrooms and a small pond with a stream connected), and attempting to contact my subconscious there. Please Xiouslaidyn, continue with your musing <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />.

			I agree with SheepKing, learning to communicate with your sub-c is a very good skill to have.  I do it fairly often, and it has definitely helped me with psionics.  Personally, I don't meditate before doing it, but it really helps if it is quiet around you.  However, I heard that lucid dreams are another good way to &quot;talk&quot; with your sub-c.

			I've never used lucid dreaming to communicate with my subconscious mind.. at least, not in the manner that helps in daily life (other than with my imagination regarding visual imagery). 
<br />

<br />
And yes, sheepking, I suppose you could say that the method i use involves visual imagery. But only in part. It's more like my mind is trying to put a picture to what is happening. I really don't think I can explain, in words, what it's like to communicate with the sub-c. I'm sure the experience, and the strength and power of the experience, varies from person to person.
<br />

<br />
What i'm trying to communicate here, is the <span style="font-style: italic">how</span> of it. How does one go about strengthening their tie to their subconscious mind? What sort of mental process is involved? Tough questions to answer in some kind of a comprehensible manner, but i'm going to give it a try. Any comparisons, observations, alternate metaphors, similes, analogies, will be appreciated.
<br />

<br />
When you think, you have to examine your mind's way of doing so. Thought, as anyone knows, is the main function of the human mind. Many people will leave it at that. Thinking is just what we do. It is why we are aware, and it's not a process that we can stop, or even control completely.
<br />
We have thoughts that make us shudder inside at times. We think something out, and then do it, and then wonder why in the hell we ever thought that in the first place afterward. We think we know things, either because we assume or we've been falsely informed previously. Sometimes we do know things, and we know that we know these things, and yet, some nights, as we lie awake, in the back of our minds we'll ask ourselves &quot;Do I really know this?&quot;. A seed of doubt has blossomed into a question of doubt, and you really have no idea why your mind has come to this conclusion. It just has, and you obey the thoughts that result.
<br />

<br />
Your mind possesses all five senses. In your mind, you can see, hear, taste, and even touch and smell if you take the time to notice. You can even almost physically experience these senses at times, because they are so powerful in your mind.
<br />

<br />
Why is it that your mind can conjure, although in a weaker sense, all the things that are solid and real before us? The conclusion I have come to, is that it is because &quot;thought&quot; itself is far above everything before us. For lack of a better term, it is &quot;higher&quot; than everything science has found and substantiated as &quot;the physical universe&quot;, and that's quite a lot, folks. That's everything, as far as some people are concerned.
<br />

<br />
So then, this phenomenon, thought, must be a useful tool indeed. We've used it to paint pictures in our minds of what could be, and using the evironment around us to make it so. What creates the images? All of the senses to go with the images?
<br />

<br />
The answer, which I cannot form words, currently, to explain how i've come to my understanding of (of which I don't really <span style="font-style: italic">have</span> a full understand of, myself) , is the subconscious mind. The conscious mind merely directs the driving force of will into the subconscious, like electricity travelling into a power supply, and causing the computer to function. The computer itself is what creates and what does everything, but without the electricity, it is nothing. One cannot exist without the other. The mind needs energy to function, and the will is that energy.
<br />

<br />
You can't have one half without the other. The will, though less complex by far in terms of understanding its purpose, is literally half of the mind. Working the will is the key to communicating with your subconscious mind. Because your subconscious mind will talk to your conscious mind far more often than vice versa. It's the feminine half, boys, and you all know how the ladies love to talk  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Females are much more than talkers though. They are the bringers of life, and the ones that actually facilitate the creation of new life. It is their biological systems in which the new human is made. Or kittens, or puppies, or frog eggs or whatever. The males contain the force, the genetic information, neccessary to activate this process. Once the activation is complete, the female's body takes it from there. Or the product of the female's body.
<br />

<br />
Now, that is just about the crudest physical example I can come up with as comparision for the two main halves of mind. The principle is there, though.
<br />

<br />
A person needs to learn how to use their will. When the will is used, it becomes stronger, like any muscle. The more things the will has to overcome, and the more it succeeds, the stronger it gets. Most people who aren't into the crazy stuff us psipoggers are, will limit the use of their will to physical material, such as quitting smoking and other bad habits, or losing/gaining weight, or improving themselves academically, etc etc.
<br />

<br />
But the will is part of the mind, which of course is not limited to what is in front of our faces.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I meditate to strengthen my mind as a whole, will included. I practice in other ways, every day, all the time. Everyone does. but, i by far get the most of my results due to meditation. 
<br />

<br />
There are countless ways, including visualization, that one can use to strengthen willpower. My advice to anyone, is to not take anyone's advice regarding such. Use whatever methods come to mind, as they are, chances are, the ones you will be most comfortable with.
<br />

<br />
I really cannot elaborate or drone on any more than I have. I'm getting tired of watching myself type.

You are awesome. I was about to get into psychodynamics, but thought better of it, lest I need to argue with people. Uh, this man is right - the moment you become consciously aware of a thought, it is no longer subconscious. The entire definition of the subconscious is that which lies beneath consciousness. If you communicate with it, then you are making subconscious thoughts conscious, but you are not knowing subconscious thoughts.

Are you saying that when we are younger there is a point in age where the concious mind actually doesn't exist?  Or that it hasn't taken over yet?

Claiming something as &quot;quite factual&quot; without any supporting arguments or scientific research seems foolhardy to me.  I'm not trying to flame you or make fun or anything, but rather I'm quite interested to see if it is based on research, or something you came up with.
<br />

<br />
Theres no fault in having an opinion on the way things work or how the mind was created, but presenting it as fact disturbs me without any proof.

			uuuhhh i dont think you can communicate with your subconcious. maybe it could be one way, your concious mind stating something....but say fi your sub-c &quot;replies&quot; you would take notice of itand pop into a concious state.
<br />

<br />
the only type of experience like this iv had was like a few nights ago. i never meditate or anything, i dont see the need to. but i was in bed and restless so decided to see how deep into a trance i could go
<br />

<br />
either way half an hour later it was just silence. it seemed i went so deep that it was like i didnt notice my physical ailments/ properties. it was just blackness and my voice echoing. there wasnt any thoughts or anything....it was really creepy. usually i have my imagination going wild etc etc  but it was just so weird. 
<br />

<br />
either way i ended up talkin to myself in my own head....great place to think lol. but to be fair i dont really think you can hhave a 2 way chit chat with your sub-c.
<br />

<br />
you could program it to act in a certainw way, like with PK. when you do the same thing over and over, your sub-c gets the jist of it, and does it for you, i.e. rolling a can via PK...
<br />

<br />

<br />
you catch my drift?

			When the subconscious mind speaks to your conscious mind, the level of conscious awareness of it does not go above just that; being aware of it. It's a mental feeling quite unlike any other. Awareness of the connection to the deeper reccesses of mind, awareness but not immediate understanding.
<br />

<br />
Once the feeling stops, you have that &quot;undeciphered&quot; information held in your conscious mind, and you begin to decipher it.

It begins to build, first creating the building blocks and structure necessary to create a conscious mind, then eventually creating a conscious mind, heavily (but not completely i think) relying on sensory data. Words, images, people, places. Existence. The singlular mind creates using the body's five senses, and it's own driving force.

Do you have any scientific facts to support this claim? Or did you make it up? Or did you get it from your subconcious?

Droshi, I am sorry to inform you that what I am attempting to explain is far, far beyond current reaches of scientific study, as far as hard, physical proof is concerned. Someday perhaps you'll see it for yourself.

<br />
To answer your question, well, I already have. I &quot;got it&quot; from my subconscious.
<br />

<br />
Most of you are thinking too crudely, and too literally, and most of you are obviously not comprehending the message I am trying to get to you.
<br />

<br />
I'm done on this topic, but I hope I can seed someone's mind with a closer truth.
<br />

<br />
Edit:
<br />

<br />
 And to the one who asked me about younger kids not having a conscious mind until a certain age, it doesn't exactly work like that.
<br />

<br />
The mind starts off as one. And slowly, it builds another part of itself, the part that drives the body, the conscious mind. Consciousness takes over slowly, and then asserts itself completely at a different time in everyone's life. I cannot simplify it any further and retain my arguably subjective viewpoint.

I think &quot;speaking&quot; is perhaps a problematic word here. You are referring to a system that according to psychoanalytic theorists is the lowest level of consciousness. The &quot;subconscious&quot; influences conscious action, but does not manifest in a conscious way. If you manifest it consciously, you have unmade it as the subconscious. This does not mean it's not incredibly useful for learning about ourselves, but it does mean it's not technically &quot;talking to the subconscious.&quot; Unless, of course, you're talking about the mystical practice of &quot;Conversation and Knowledge of the Holy Guardian Angel&quot; or summat.

And what process do you use to decypher this? As a psychology student, I would advise you not to start decyphering your own motivations without first ensuring you're able to do so.

Weak answer. Horribly weak. You have very little right to tout as &quot;fact&quot; that which hardly qualifies as &quot;hypothesis.&quot; No psychological model of which I know uses these kinds of definitions, with the (waning) exception of psychoanalytic psychotherapy, which wouldn't use quite the method you're discussing, but might at least support your work as somewhat valid.

Which is? That if we invent psychological structures and then reinforce them through alleged communication, we can arrive at a psychological model similar to your own?
<br />

<br />
Freud mapped the consciousness by analyzing his own mind - but also by then checking that his model could be used to analyze others. His work was descriptive, not prescriptive - we know models exist, we need to discover how to define those models, or term the aspects of them. Your inventing models which seem to have worked for you does not seem to promote anything scientific. A more appropriate title for this post would be &quot;Hypothesis regarding...&quot;

According to the psychodynamic theory from which you draw your terminology, we begin as the Unconscious, Id driven being, operating entirely on the pleasure principle, and this continues until about 2 years of age, when the Ego begins to manifest, allowing us to take conscious control over our world. Then, at around age 6, the Superego develops.
<br />

<br />
If you're going to use some of the terms, you really ought to use all of them. It makes things easier.
<br />

<br />
Of course, you're going to say that you're not using psychodynamic systems, and that your understanding is greater than that of modern psychology, and that if we'd stop relying on our &quot;facts&quot; and our &quot;experiments&quot; we'd learn more about ourselves. Then you'll say that modern psychology is keeping us all back, just ilke the Church oppressed Copernicus, and so I must refer us all to my signature,

			I personally have found that talking with your sub is a bit like telepathy...it's sorta like learning a language that you already have the gist of, but it's a matter of fine tuning it. Constant practise seems to help.

I can see clearly what you intend and what you are trying to explain.  The problem is that you don't support it.  I can tell you that pink chestnuts are flying around the sky above me at all times of the day, but really the fact is that I'd be just delusional.

This would imply that the subconscious builds the conscious mind, and then you say that consciousness takes over, also implying that for a time you are governed completely by your subconscious.

You cannot simplify any more because if you keep yourself confusing enough, people won't question and assume your smart.  Sorry but I don't assume.

From my own experience this is not correct.  The term subconscious refers IMO to an internal computer in everyone that governs bodily functions including psychic abilities.  By talking or communicating to it consciously it does not mean that its function changes, but you could perhaps say that the term &quot;subconscious&quot; is not quite accurate at that point and I would agree.

Completely agreed, don't mislead people by calling all this crap fact.  Not everyone is a psychology student such as Elliptic to know when people here spout of crazy and claim it as fact.  Again another reason to speak about your experiences and have people take them as they will.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Don't take my skeptism to mean that I don't believe communicating with your subconscious is impossible, quite opposite.  Infact it is one of my favorite subjects.  You can check my technique in the personal techniques section.  But claiming wild crazy bullshit, in my opinion, does not qualify as fact.  Call it what it is, that is all that I'm asking.
