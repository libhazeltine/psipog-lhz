			I've been thinking about this alot lately, ok when we speak in person we speak in English. Animals don't physically have the proper organs to speak. Do you think it is possible to ping with an animal and to have conversations? Kind of like Dr. Dolittle but not in English.

			I know you can send telepathic messages to animals, though it has to be in pictures or feelings, not words or abstract things, since most animals can't comprehend them.

			Honestly, I think a lot of pets do retain a lot of english, especially with no other animals around for them to communicate with. Aside from that you would have to learn to communicate with feelings and signals as opposed to language.

			I think Dbizket is right, to an extent. If you teach an animal... Say a dog certain commands, they will know what they mean. &quot;Sit/Stay...etc.&quot;
<br />

<br />
However, if you want to do telepathy with animals you'll have to &quot;learn&quot; about your pet, or the animal in question. Basic instincs can overcome telepathic suggestion (at least it does with animals, seems more like it does with them than does with humans). For example, I have a rabbit. I used to project to it that i have all this good green food and that if he comes to me he will get it... Eventaully, after I didn't have food he stopped coming to me when I did that. 
<br />

<br />
Another example, which is kind of strange, is when I want to pick him up he runs away from me... That is unless I &quot;LET HIM KNOW&quot; he's going to be picked up and that I'm not playing and am not going to stomp on him or anything.
<br />

<br />
You have to learn to communicate with your pet and understand it. It usually requires a little bond to have an effective Telepathic link with an animal.

			hi i was a member here about 3 years ago... but its been a while...lolz anyway.. I just wanna share my weird experiences with animals... I dunno I just have that weird affinity with animals... I know sometimes they could be wild and all specially here in our place (for ex. the dogs) but when I stare back at them right in the eyes and assure them I am no threat to them... they calm down... and likewise I could feel their trust... by the way I am an empath... since I started practicing pK 3 years ago, somehow empathy just burst out of me and so I enhanced it instead... for now practicing telepathy, although I have to start from scratch.... *sigh
