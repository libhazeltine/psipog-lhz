i just heard something similar. mine sounded more like something hard hitting something hallow. it was around the rapid eye movement stage. its similar to the fright you get from that falling off the bed feeling. i woke up and the first thing that came to my head is why. then i remembered this post and i was like &quot;oh crap now i HAVE to believe him  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> &quot;
<br />

<br />

			In hypnogogic state your mind is not restricted to the limited perception of the 5 sences...
<br />

<br />
clarisentience becomes possible....you could of been hearing your neighbor slamming a door even though it was physiologically impossible.
<br />
the important thing is to remember what you were focused on the moment before you heard the door slam. 
<br />
YOu should experiment with this...bring yourself to the hypnogogic state(or just dont sleep for 3 or 4 days)....
<br />
If you can control it than focus on something (the future , Past, Thoughtforms) be open to what you recieve dont become fixated....also the hypno gogic state is equivalent to the theta brain wave state which is the receptive state to the
<br />
universal mind ( all knowing mind of god)  if you can relax a stage further you will go into delta which allows you to seek the records.
<br />
Although falling into delta conciously is very difficult it is an inexplicable experience, iits like experiencing an hour or even days of time in....
<br />
half a second.  
<br />
Precognition is a tap into the universal mind..the ability to tap this mind determines the accuracy of your predictions.
<br />
Although there are other ways to see the future...these do not involve the mind and are not considered precognition.

			Time 2 add my 50 cents:
<br />

<br />
On many occaisons when I've been sleeping I've been woken up by a noise. I have deduced that these sounds are from temperature contraction. I know this because if I wait for a few minutes I will hear similar creaks comming from something.
<br />

<br />
But: These noises seem EXTREMELY loud. So, yeah...
<br />

<br />
Anyway, on another occaison, I sort of half-woke up. I could hear my family speaking loudly and I could also hear the chimes on the porch. These sounds were also very loud although not as clear. This happens often in the mornings, I hear my bro yapping away 2 my mom or summin and they're in the kitchen
<br />

<br />
My Conclusion:
<br />

<br />
When one sleeps most of one's sense shut down. When one wakes up they are 're-activated'. But when (for whatever reasons) one is semi-awake, only a certain few of the senses re-activate and the usual brain capacity is assigned to these few; therefore amplifying their strength...
<br />

<br />
So, when I hear some sort of sound in my sleep, I instinctively wake up  but only sort of. My sense of hearing is activated and amplified only to catch the middle and last part of the sound slowed down.
<br />
