my change in eye color is not so noticable yet but when it does so eventually, I have to make out an excuse so to convince my very strict school that I'm not wearing contact lenses <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			I was thinking after changing my eye color i could go to something a little harder like my hair color. and if you changed your height you would be making your bones grow faster than normal right so wouldnt that be very painful <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

			Ok somethings, I have been traing seriously in Psycokinesis for.... 5 years (Started at 10) and, in Biokinesis (Improper term but w/e) And the trick is you must first understand what takes place when you change the world around you or in you to get the full effect of what you do. I can change my hair color, but peferr to do it slowly because if you rapidly change the construct of you body, then you body goes through alot of stress. Making for some BAD side effects. I had a bad experence with that... Anyways, FOr the height thing: Yes is IS possible to change your height, not the most plesent experence in the world, because 1 of 2 things take place when you do it. 1) You stretch your bones in order to acheive the growth making your bones thinner. or 2) You rapidly grow your bones (as you said). But this is much much more painful to reverse. I have only done it 3 times, because it hurts soo much. -Salem

			Why are the first 10 posts of this thread different versions of &quot;I think it's impossible although I have no practical experience with attempting this?&quot;
<br />
Before you go saying stuff is impossible, try it.  Then try it again, and again.  After you've done all of that, try some more.  So after you've given it the best effort you can, meditated on it for an hour a day for more than one day, and spent time actually attempting rather than thinking of how cool the success would be, tell me it's impossible.
<br />

<br />
So back on topic, yes this is possible.  I have done it myself.  My eyes started at hazel and I changed them over the course of about 2 1/2 weeks to dark blue.  I don't have any pictures, so don't bother asking.  And yes, I physically changed their color: no telepathic suggestion here.  Simple really; I just meditated and told my body to decrease the melanin production in my eyes.  Maybe that's too technical for some of you, so just stick with whatever works for you.  I stopped telling my body to change its melanin production, so my eyes faded back to hazel after about a week.  Pretty fast, but it was very noticeable - I had received comments from friends asking whether I was wearing contacts or not several times.

			For me it would be pretty easy to make people believe I'm not wearing color lenses... If I'd change my eye color to pure RED I could take out my normal lenses and they would still be red.. convincing everyone I have done it with my omega powerz!!!!shift+one shift+one!!111
<br />
l0lz... But I'm going to try it tonight right away <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> I'll start with brown (My eyes are blue/green/grey/with a bit of orange/brown at the moment) 
<br />

<br />
Wanna change my hair color too XD Right now it's black in front and the rest is orange(it was PURE RED but it faded DX) and I want it to be red again without using hair paint XD
<br />
But I won't practice that just yet... I'll start practising with my eye color
