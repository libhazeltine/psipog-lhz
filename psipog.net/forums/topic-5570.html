My name is Dustin Clark, and I'm writing you on behalf of The Book of THoTH website(www.book-of-thoth.com) and author Philip Gardiner.  We will be coming out with a book next year, to be published by Reality Entertainment, containing user submitted articles.  We looked over your site and thought that the quality of your user articles was really above and beyond, so we wanted to approach you about telling your members and seeing if they were interested.  If you wanted to annouce it on your site, we'd also give your site a mention in the book as a BoT supporter, and link to you from the site.  Most importantly, I think, it's an opportunity for your members to get their names in a book and get their articles published and distributed by a big name publisher, and we do some cross promotion for our sites along the way.  The authors who get their articles published will also get really nice prizes from Reality Entertainment and other contributors.  If you're interested the links below will give you some more info, and you can just write me back and we'll get working on this together.  Thanks for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

			Thank you for posting this!  I think it's a cool idea, and one that all of you can get involved with if you want to.  The articles written by members here really are great, and we'd love to get some submissions from all of you here.  So, go ahead, get your name in print!   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Here's our announcement, so you don't have to read my lousy e-mail.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />

<br />

<br />
In addition after 6 months the very best articles will be chosen to appear in a new Book to be launched world-wide by Reality Press entitled <a href="http://www.book-of-thoth.com/ftopict-8297.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">The Book of THoTH : Wisdom of the Ages</a>. Although there will be no royalty payments on the book, presently unpublished authors will have the chance to see their name in print in a major new book and will then be able to use this as a catalyst to further their publishing career.
<br />

<br />
With Guitars, CD’s of some of the world’s leading bands, Books and much more the prizes alone are worth writing for, so come on everybody, get writing now and start inputting into The Book of THoTH.Articles should be no less than 500 words and no more than 2000 (<a href="http://www.book-of-thoth.com/article_submit/competition-rules.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">full rules here</a>). It must be based on one of the paranormal or other categories here on the site. One image per article only please. Give full name and a brief 2 line bio with each submission. Closing Date December 31st 2006

I have to say the response from this site has been great.  I think there's about a half dozen articles in so far from here.  You guys are all great!  This is going to be a really fun contest.
