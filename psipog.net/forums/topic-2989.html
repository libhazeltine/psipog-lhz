			You could try powering a torch/flashlight. That would be hard and complicated though. Wouldn't enhancing your eyes like that be DMILS?

And anyway...we all naturally have nightvision, it just needs about 10 mins to fully work.

I totally agree!  Flashlights are worthwhile and work.  If you dont want to run out of battery, get one of those flashlights that you just shake.

			Or if you insist on using psi, which is harder than using flashlight, you could spend many years training until you're good enough to make constructs that give off their own light, that way they would help with the dark...

			actually, you don't even need to see in the dark. Its a case of utilizing your brain/ train it by not allowing yourself to be able to see one thing.
<br />
When you start out, trying to move around, frequently you will find yourself fumbling into furnature ect. However, a blind person has a tremendous skill in spatial cordinates, and frequently they become so in tune with life around them that they can sense an object at a distance and be able to tell what it is. Don't ask me how as i don't have details on this, just a little food for thought  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

			both above posts are very true IMO.  instead of night vision (continuing Yamamaya's idea) try using matter perception, which is thought to be the input function of pk.  just send out some &quot;psi&quot; around you and allow it to bounce back to you.  kind of like sonar and ecolocation, but without the sound.

			id say that there are occasions where a crude light source is just not an option (psi or otherwise). prime example of this is when your in the field (slang for combat zone). the last thing you need to do in the middle of a night recon is to start waving a flashlight around.
<br />

<br />
before you start trying to fuddle your eyes up, try using your already existing physical night vision features. as said, 10 miniutes in a darkened enviroment, with no bright lights allows your eyes to adjust. also, not focusing on what you want to look at helps, instead focus on the point next to it. after a bit of practice youll be able to see much better in low light conditions, although youll tend to see everything in shades of grey as you approach pitch black. and when it does get pitch black, then good eyesight or not, i can assure you you wont see a thing.
<br />

<br />
im not sure how psi could help you with this. possibly try engaging your third eye to help you out? someone who knows more stuff needs to answer

			that is where sensitivity comes in to play.  if you can &quot;feel&quot; the objects around you, and the ones at a distance, that's almost just as good as seeing them.  for example, bats are blind, but because of ecolocation they can &quot;see&quot; what objects are around them, and how to move past them.  now, this does have to do with sound waves, but we can do the same with touch.  let's not forget the tactile senses and how we can use them with psi.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
