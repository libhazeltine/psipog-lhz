			Ok... i noticed that some skeptics can be jerks to psions and vice versa. Please... respect their ideas. You should try to explain something, but dont just try to be and ass and say they are retarded. This goes for all forum members.

I absolutely agree, Psi_ninja. Of course people know this, but they don't always remember it. Thanks for reminding them.

			Psi_Ninja brings up a very good point here. Granted, there are always going to be those who post new topics with the intention of starting flame wars, but a lot of skeptics (such as the guy who posted the topin on Dale Power) are pretty polite and intelligent about their views, and we were really nice to him too.
<br />

<br />
Of course, the ones who get flamed to Hell (pun very much intended  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> ) are the ones who act like their personal opinion is univeral truth, and are just pompous assholes about things.
<br />

<br />
In all, we'll be nice if they are.

			It's just an ongoing war between most people.  The skeptics want to prove us wrong and we want to prove ourselves right.  I find that being prepared for &quot;battle&quot; will help you at least make an intelligent arguement, although confrontation isn't always a bad thing <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> ...

			As far as i have seen is that when psions try to explain things to skeptics, they just make fun of them. Psions are usually the ones showing respect to skeptics. I say that the skeptics show us a little respect.

			i like most skeptics.  A lot of them are just people who want to make sure they believe what is right (or proven).  
<br />

<br />
[rant] I have run into one friend who i did telepathy on (to show her it existed) and she got scared because she thought that since this was true (in her words &quot;not proven by science&quot;) then other things were true (not proven to science) such as religion.  That scared the hell out of her and so she remains a skeptic for her own health and belief. [/rant]
<br />

<br />
I will continue to argue with skeptics in a nice manner if they respond nicely.  If they attack me, my fellow psions, my friends, etc, i will pwn them (as some of you have seen me do).

You bring up a good point.  For some people, seeing that psionics can be real throws into question a lot of the beliefs that they hold dear to.  Scientific proof can be just as much a belief system as religion is.
<br />

<br />
Me?  I'm agnostic, so I don't have a problem accepting that these things could be true, given proof.  But we can't expect everybody to be so open. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
