			...but randomly I'll get a feeling from someone or the answer to one of my questions.
<br />

<br />
Can anybody give any suggestions to help me? Is this my subconscious doing this? If so, I need a better way to talk to my sc. I've been able to make communication in the past, but like, I only get feelings back. I don't get pictures or anything. It's weird.

			search this first man. its been posted million times. its even in the &quot;how to communicate with your sub c&quot; it says you will get emotions/feelings you arent going to get polaroid perfect images. thats like opening your bank account expecting money already in there. work with wucha got. you arent going to be able to control it to recieve an answer right away, you only get answers when youre ready.

			bah a couple affirmations will do the trick. 
<br />

<br />
heres what you do.
<br />

<br />
enter trance (how ever you would do it) 
<br />

<br />
then say
<br />

<br />
&quot;My psychic sense is just as consistant as my eyes and ears.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I can control the power to do [ ] at will.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;My telepathy is 100% accurate&quot;
<br />

<br />
or whatever affirmations, in the positive sense, that you'd need.
<br />

<br />
that'll solve your problem.

			Same story here, only I'm an empath as well as a telepath, so at the same times as getting thoughts, I'm getting emotions. Once this happened in assembly at school, and guess what? There was a nervous girl on the stage, and someone who'd hurt their arm behind me somewhere. Lucky it only lasted a few minuets!
<br />
I reccomend meditating. I know you've heard it said before, but it just helps. It doesn't block out the &quot;feelings&quot; but it helps with managing and interpretting. Don't knock what you have though! I got lucky once and managed to pick a test answer out of the blue! Not that I do that anymore... ahem1 <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0" />

			So, I was trying to ping my friend today and I noticed that before I started trying my mind was clear, I think I could've done it, but I hadn't noticed that until I had started trying then my mind got all cluttered.
<br />

<br />
I just need to know how to control this. I've read through the articles, believe me, it's the first thing I check. But some people have different ways of doing it. I'll start meditating though, for sure. When I first found this site, I meditated for a few minutes(I have bad motivation for a lot of things) and I found that I could clear my mind easily. As the days went on, though, my skill has been lacking. I need to get back on track.
<br />

<br />
Any tips for bettering my skills with telepathy? Tips that are, perhaps, different from what I could read in the articles.

			Sorry if this has been said in the articles, but why not join us in the telepathy practise sessions, or there is a list of people willing to practise telepathy over msn in this section.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
