			man the crazyest thing happened to me last week. I had been talking to some kid from another country we had been talking for sometime. so all of a suden he tells me that he kills people and the GOV was interested in me, he said that they had been scaning the house and found psychic energy he said that they where comeing to get me and all that stuff. At first I did't believe and tryed to bluff him by saying that my dad was with the F.B.I and he knew I was psychic. he replyed with your dad is nothing but a middel age retired police officer wich is true ..but i saw that as a luck guess. but then again why would he have said that out of everything there is to say. any ways a few days later we talked again and I asked him to tell me somethings about myself that only I would know or my family. he then told me things that where right everything he said was right. but also could have been lucky guesses we talk longer and he told me that he really did't want to kill me or what ever, so for me to tell him why would I lie about being psychic and if I told the truth he call off the whole thing. Well at that point I did't care what he did if had came I was going to fight and if he did't ....he did't. but he was getting on my nevers so I told him what he wanted to her. I told him I was craving attension and stuff like that. this was crazy for me and a little frightning ..but I was ready becausae he also said he knew about my causin who can break glass with only a touch. and of another kid that jumped in on my side 2who is also psychic and told me of this sit...he said that he was comeing for all of us...really I was ready it seemed as if it would have been a great adventure but at the same time we just need to be seen and not detected....lol so post back tell me if u think this kid was a fact or if I was in trouble. let me know if anything like this ever happened to any of u ..thanks ps this kids name was Josh just so theres no confusion, sorry if any

			This does not follow standard operating procedure for such things, as far as I know. Don't worry too much about it.

Shhh. They're not after you. If they wanted you, they'd already have you.
