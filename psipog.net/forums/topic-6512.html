			So energy is always moving and bouncing back and forth and changing. We have our light, dark and neutral energy but what does this have to do with consciousness? Well here's a theory on that but first: 
<br />

<br />
How we pick up stimuli: 
<br />

<br />
Now before we get started, I would like you to get this straight: I know how stimuli are formed both within the body and the CNS/PNS I know which sensations come from where and how they start from your body, travel to the brain, where it becomes translated and sent back. I'm not talking about that! 
<br />

<br />
Okay so how energy is lined up. So picture a line with a bunch of markings on it as your scale for dark, light and neutral energy. In your mind of course there are boundaries but in reality, it's infinite. Now here's where I really get creative. Humans, among every other species, organism and building block of life aside from energy in and of itself, have receptors which pick up these signals where a stimulus occurs and from there they're translated into a sensation: an instinct, a memory, a scent, a taste, a vision, a sound. Every bit of energy you pick up on is essentially translated. 
<br />

<br />
When energy travels: 
<br />

<br />
When traveling energy reacts with a receptor and forms stimuli, and the brain translates it and it also implants itself on the reacting organism. In other words, they're like memory cells. So once the traveling energy leaves a mark on the receptor it creates a sensation. 
<br />

<br />
But what happens when we get the same sensation twice? 
<br />

<br />
The memory receptor picks up on it and sends another signal, a signal of familiarity. In a tiny fraction of a second, a strong sensation sweeps over you and you subconsciously try to find out where that sensation first came to you. Since it's the same sensation as the first time you initially received it, your brain usually automatically relates to where that sensation was first acquired. If the brain fails to relate, 3 things can occur:
<br />

<br />
1. You're stuck with that signal but not the whole picture and it drives you crazy. (i.e. someone looks familiar to you but you don't remember who they are)
<br />

<br />
2. You try to win it back subconsciously often leading to a panic attack.
<br />

<br />
3. Absolutely nothing.
<br />

<br />
Levels of stimuli: Basic functions to higher level thinking. 
<br />

<br />
What I mean here is that there many levels of stimuli that you pick up on first. We do this subconsciously without realizing. I might have these levels jumbled a bit but here's how I ordered them:
<br />

<br />
Emotions: The general signal that drowns our bodies.
<br />

<br />
Colors: every energy level omits a certain color but since we can only see red through violet, we can only see the ones in that scale. Since very little energy is actually in that medium, we can't see the other signals going on around us. However picking up on these colors while seeing the energy move and change may be how it's possible to see auras.
<br />

<br />
Instinct: This is for every organism on the planet. When we receive these energies, it's automatically translated into a command. This affects us both consciously and subconsciously as well as conducting chemical changes. 
<br />

<br />
Subconscious: This goes a little more in depth than instinct and it could actually come before instinct but there's 1 reason that it's not. But first, the subconscious stimuli are interpreted by the PNS/ANS and sent throughout the body and controls every subconscious move and thought. Why I DIDN'T post it first is because only higher and more complex organisms can pick this up. Mainly the animal kingdom and more bluntly put: anything with an actual brain.
<br />

<br />
Conscious: This is where we can actively realize these stimuli, where they convert to actual messages: thoughts, fantasies, anything we ever think of, are derived from these energies. It's here where we can also create our own stimuli and send it back to ourselves for false interpretations. (hallucinations, fantasies, etc.)
<br />

<br />
Memory: This is where the memory receptors that impact your conscious life come from. Where your brain translate a familiar stimulus to, &quot;Hey, I've been here before... this is where&quot;
<br />

<br />
Spiritual: No way of getting around this. These come from the extreme frequencies of light and dark. When you feel something that's pure dark, or pure light, you recognize that instantly and it changes your life. For example, seeing a ghost or feeling the energy of the full moon. This level is so advanced that it takes no communication to interpret. It's all emotional.
<br />

<br />
So what forms consciousness?
