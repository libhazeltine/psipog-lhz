			I joined the air force, they kick me out for failure to abapt and a personality disorder. Let me give you a word of advice.....you are only as strong as your weakest link, and there always is this one guy who gives everyone else tons of push ups. Help each other out, teamwork is key. Its going to be tough but trust me, when its over (well I got half way and stayed there for a one more month but I still feel much stronger then I did before) you start to laugh at boot camp, infact you may even want to go back to boot camp again. Don't act like a big shot and be all slow.......thats disrepectful to the team and it never works.

I had to bite my tounge to hold the laughter.

My goals?.................I'm not so sure about that. I would like to watch people and understand there pain, so I do like some sort of enlightment in my life. But I feel like I should follow my childhood goal of becoming a astnomoner or a theriost. I want to understand the factors of realitory and space/time. Or as Einstein once said.

I guess what I want to really understand is something that we humans may never be able to understand.........the concepts of infintily. But I don't like I should be everything like Einstein, he placed his hands to much into god.

Einstein theory was so elagant he even believe that if his theory was proven wrong he say the tests were wrong. Who am I to challange such great minds?

<br />
Most great minds in the physics department tend to believe in god because they often see the sign of infinite power. But regardless of the evidence they throw aside there beliefs for there work............I feel like I could do this but there still that sense of doubt. I have my own theory of faster then light travel but I have my doubts in it. From Goth to Penrose, to Newton and Einstein, from the great mathmanic Rammin who solved Euliduican math of being false. To Einsten who placed a theory that prove it wrong.
<br />

<br />
Right now I am only a baler in a donation company, the pay is crappy but the people there are willing to help me somewhere.
<br />

<br />
Will I get there?
<br />

I don't care for you answers because it donest mean I won't try either way.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />

			Heh, I wouldn't mind hanging out in the forest becoming a master at every psionic ability. That would be emmense. As for a job, animator. I love working with programs like Maya so expect to see me in the credits for the amazing explosions and special effects in the films to come later. In fact...computer generated media will replace actors soon. <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

Either that or a psycholigist. I like analysing human behaviour, I have always been a natural at solving mind problems and working out the reasons why people act the way they do.

			Here are my ultimate dreams/goals
<br />

<br />

<br />
1. Become a full fledged manga artist and get a manga about a psychic ninja published (see the manga thread I made for details)
<br />

<br />
2. Make my manga good enough to become somewhat well known.
<br />

<br />
3. Become enlightened and possibly become temporary &quot;forest buddies&quot; with somefatguy and derricktheone when I go on vacation or something.
<br />

<br />
4. master psionics and possibly test the limits of it if there are any.
<br />

<br />
5. Make use of enlightenment and somehow be a messenger of the ulitmate truth/spread my ultimate &quot;religeon&quot; (more like a way to live than a religeon; almost like Buddhism) across the world.
<br />

<br />
4 and 5 are more like dreams *duh <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" />* that I could only accomplish if the right conditions are met. A lot dealing with fate. In fact the first two also deal with fate but are still a lot more plausible. Well, that's pretty much it right there. The only other almost intangible dream I have would be winning the lotto and just living the rest of my life in retirement (the previous would also make all the other goals a lot easier <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" />)  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />.

			Why become enlightened in a forest and not here? I'll tell you what happens when you go and seek enlightenment in a forest: You will reach great heights of consciousnes and because there is no distraction in the forest, no other egos that can offend your fragile superficial identity (ego), you will become very peacefull and you will have a clear, loving mind. You will think that you are enlightened because your mind is never disturbed anymore. Then you say: &quot;Okay, now it is time to go back to society and teach people a lesson.&quot; So you go back to your parental home or something like that, and there you have this mother or father or brother or neighbour or friend or just some pedestrian that offends you. Suddenly you realise that you are not enlightened, but that these negative impressions in your mind, were just not activated for a long time when in the forest. You thought they were gone now, but it turns out that they just became latent, in potential form. But nevertheless, they are still there. So now your mind is back in its old state, and you just lost a couple of years of your life. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Become enlighened anywhere, anytime. If you master yourself in the midst of chaos, then you'll know that you are really a master permanently.
<br />

<br />
as for what Idd like to do: I like to be.
<br />

MartialArtist: Damn you are good. The forest will be my home, and that is where I wish to become enlightened. I will bring many books and meditate all of the time. 
<br />
Aha! All of my forest buddies and I can test each other and call each other names. Then, if we are offended, we aren't enlightened. Perfect!

So forest buddies, what forest shall we live in? I like Canada but I heard it is cold so where should we live?

MartialArtist: Damn you are good. The forest will be my home, and that is where I wish to become enlightened. I will bring many books and meditate all of the time. 
<br />
Aha! All of my forest buddies and I can test each other and call each other names. Then, if we are offended, we aren't enlightened. Perfect! 
<br />

<br />
So forest buddies, what forest shall we live in? I like Canada but I heard it is cold so where should we live?</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Second choice, Martial arts...but if I can't afford college, I dont' think I could afford classes...unless I waltz right in and side kick the teacher then fight the entire place to see how far I get before the cops break in with pepperspray and nightsticks.

Either way, my future is going to be a loney and terrible. I'll try to wait it out as much as possible.</span></td>  </tr></table><span class="postbody">
