   <p>PsiPog is a wanna-be licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program (it actually has a annual fee, can you believe that?!). TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to enable individuals and organizations to establish trusting relationships based on respect for personal identity and information
   by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site www.PsiPog.net. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users' privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices (even though we aren't technically a member of TRUSTe).<br />
   1. What personally identifiable information PsiPog collects.<br />
   2. What organization collects the information.<br />
   3. How PsiPog uses the information.<br />
   4. With whom PsiPog may share user information. (no one :-P)<br />
   5. What choices are available to users regarding collection, use and distribution of the information.<br />
   6. What types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under PsiPog's control.<br />
   7. How users can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</p>

   <p>If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should first contact PsiPog by emailing <a href="#">sean.m.connelly@gmail.com</a>.</p>

   <p>Information Collection<br />
   PsiPog is the sole owner of the information collected on PsiPog.net. PsiPog collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.</p>

   <p>Registration<br />
   In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (their email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he has expressed interest. We don't sell your address to anyone
   and we keep it private, even amoung other users. We hate junk mail too.</p>

   <p>Profile<br />
   We store information that we collect through cookies (on your computer) and log files (on PsiPog's computers) to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing habits. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally
   identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to only to enhance the users visit at PsiPog. We do not share your profile with other third parties.</p>

   <p>Cookies<br />
   A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use persistent cookies with session IDs. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for
   an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. The ID points to data stored on PsiPog's server, so no sensative information (like your password) is stored on your hard-drive.</p>

   <p>Log Files<br />
   Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather
   broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable our Web-based service.</p>

   <p>Communications from the Site</p>

   <p>Special Offers and Updates<br />
   We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members can receive messages from other users based on their email. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.</p>

   <p>Service Announcements<br />
   On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications
   are not promotional in nature.</p>

   <p>Customer Service<br />
   We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email, in accordance with the users wishes.</p>

   <p>Sharing</p>

   <p>Legal Disclaimer<br />
   Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.</p>

   <p>Links<br />
   This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, PsiPog, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable
   information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>

   <p>Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums<br />
   Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited
   messages from other parties in return. We do have rules about disclosing personal information for your protection and we will enforce those rules.</p>

   <p>Security<br />
   This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.</p>

   <p>Notification of Changes<br />
   If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

   <p>If, however, we want to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will ask first.</p>

   <p>Contact Information<br />
