   <p>Yes, it's the dreaded Mother-Hen again. Perhaps it is a sign of Peebrain's effectiveness as webmaster that this site attracts so many people who actually stick around for a while. The site is aimed primarily at newbies, and those who are new to Psionics might be excused for overlooking a few things that ought to
   be obvious to the more experienced psionicists. One of those things is the simple and inescapable fact that Psionics is real. Regardless of what the white-lights-and-fluffy-bunnies brigade will tell you, it is possible to hurt yourself, when doing this stuff. There are cases on record of people dying from straining
   their bodies too hard, most often with PK. Psionics is not the same as gently "nudging" the universe in the desired direction, or petitioning some Deity or another to grant one's desires. It is the use of force. On occasion, people come into the forum and say something to the effect of, "I've just been practicing
   TK for two and a half hours, and I feel tired. Does anyone have any idea why?" Think about it. If you had been a couch potato for ten years and then suddenly decided to run the Boston Marathon, would you ask us why you were winded? Psionics is a physical skill. Exercise due caution.</p>
