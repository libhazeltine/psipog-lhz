                  <p>I personally believe that ANYONE can learn. Others believe that some people can't learn because they don't have the right genes, or they are born with some defect. (They usually equate it to being blind - some people are born blind, therefore it's logical to assume some people are born without an
                  ability in psionics - I disagree with this theory personally).</p>

                  <p>Other people believe that if you aren't born with it, then you can't learn it! I think this is blatently false. But hey - some believe it's true. What do you think?</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hi, I was wondering if you had ever heard of the Hutchison Effect, or as a guy named Dr. Mel Winfield calls it, nucleonic energy. Anyway, Hutchison built a machine that channels this nucleonic energy, and there are videos on his ite, www.hutchisoneffect.com, that show him using his machine, and he
                  uses it on an aluminum bar and the bar gets all floppy, (spoon-bending) then he points it at various objects and levitates them (Telekinesis), the most notable one being a 60 pound cannon ball (the machine used only 75 watts of electricity to lift it!). And the guy who wrote the article I read,(if
                  you want to read it, go to www.ppsociety.com, then click on science corner, then click on Hutchison effect/Nucleonic energy) said that he contacted Mel Winfield, and asked if humans could be the source of this energy. An d in the reply he got, Mel winfield said that yes, humans could unknowingly be
                  channeling nucleonic energy. The guy then asked if it could heat things up, or cool them down (Pyrokinesis &amp; Cryokinesis) and Mel said that it could. What do you guys have to say on that?</p>

                  <p>Hi, there. Thanks for pointing this out. There are a lot of parallels between Mr. Hutchison's work and psionics, ranging from the "minor" issue of precisely who has expressed interest in it to the capriciousness of the replication of the effects themselves. You already noted the similarity in the
                  actual effects.</p>

                  <p>This message is shown to multiple people. I have been doing psi stuff for some time. My newest thing is telekinesis, I have moved stuff that is not force to stay there like chains, ropes, globes, stuff in an e mag field that?s floating there, and this one was the only thing force there is paper. I
                  move things from a few ounces to about 50 lb, so I don?t believe that how much lb is there but the force that is in reacted with mine. But the whole point of me showing you this is I need someone to train me one on one. And even the military will do. I will do any thing but 2 or 3 things on my end.
                  All I real want is a way to speed up the myself training or someone to do this with. 1 of them is paying you. I can the research or you can do research on me if you want just same thing go, 2 or 3 things.</p>
