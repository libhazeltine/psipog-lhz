               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Empathy came natural to me as result of energy manipulation. Then came the headaches and so on. But two days ago, I practiced empathy for the first time with a net friend (an empath too) and we kept scanning each other over and over. Due to that practice, I've became more aware of feelings (more
                  than i did before) and I successfuly made it into some of my friends head, although I couldn't interpret thoughts and receive them successfully. Anyway, since that practice, I stopped having headaches when exposed to crowds, and I can now control my empathy both at sugestion and at will. Do you think
                  that headaches are still to come again, or have I developed some kind of controled empathy? Thanks in advance. <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Dear PsiPog.net Staff,</p>

                  <p>Hello, obviously...I have a question. I think was born as an empath, though I am not entirely sure. I have been known to...know...when someone is angry, or whenever someone's relationship is progressing or failing miserably. I can also sense a bunch of emotions, but I'm not sure if I'm just
                  guessing or what. But I am good at telling when people are lying. I just get a feeling or a thought that says someone is lying. However, I don't have the problem where I go into a crowd and get over loaded with several emotions all at once. But I am really moody. Another thing I would like to address
                  is making others feel emotions. The most I have ever done is making others feel calm or become infatuated with me, but I don't know if it's my personality or not and I am in no way trying to brag. So, those are my questions. Thank you for your help if you do answer!</p>

                  I don't actually see any question marks in your paragraph. So I'll give you my general take. Being an empath has its good and bad characteristics, as does any skill. Perception of emotions of others' is a pretty basic element of empathy. As far as being in crowds and your moodiness, why don't you
                  just shield? Forcing others to feel emotions that are not of their own choice goes against PsiPog's combat code of conduct.<br />

                  <p>After I read Peebrain's article about communicating with one's sunconcious, I went into my room and meditated. During my meditation, I started asking my subconcious questions. For several questions, my head/shoulder/legs twitched. Is it normal for your subconcious to respond physiacally? Or am I
                  just twitching and thinking that it is my subconcious.</p>

                  <p>Yeah. Actually, that's one method of communicating with your subconscious. The method I heard about was putting your hand flat on a table. Assign "Yes", "No", "I don't know", "I'm not saying", to each of your four fingers (ignore thumb <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>I never tried it (because I communicate a different way), but you might find the exercise useful. Give it a shot, it might work.</p>

                  <p>Unfortunately I got myself banned from the chat so it looks like I will have to direct my questions this way. I think I am a natural empath and recently one of my friends has been really depressed and I think I have been affected by this - suicidal thoughts are a reoccurance and I have actually
                  caused a lot of damage to myself with a blade for no reason I can think of. I can never stick crowds, they just give me a headache and I feel like I am trapped with nowhere to run. People always think I am happy because that is the emotion I am trying to emmitt but inside I hurt and this is scaring
                  me a lot now, no doubt it will get worse. One day coming out from school, there were so many people coming out at one time, a friend had to stop me from falling backwards because I had just totally lost control. If you can help me with this then it would me much appreciated, it's a shame I can't talk
                  to anyone else about it though *sigh*</p>

                  <p>I think you should talk to other people about it. You don't have to say "I psychically feel others emotions", but I think something along the lines of "I feel overwhelmed when around a lot of people" is ok. Talk to your parents and friends, it's ok... If you need to control your empathy, then you
                  should learn to shield. Check out the article section on shielding and constructs. But also, don't be afraid to open up to people around you and share your feelings. It does you no good to keep it bottled up.</p>

                  <p>Hey Peebrain, regarding your empathy article, I know you said empathy is so natural for you, it's just become a part of your life. Still, I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on that and give a few examples of how you use it daily? Mostly I'm just curious, plus it might give me some
                  ideas/more motivation.<img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"

                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" /></p>

                  <p>Also, when sending in empathy, are you able to send extreme feelings immediately w/ ease in normal conditions? For example, sending a feeling of overwhelming happiness to the point the target is crying (out of happiness of course), or pain equivalent to breaking a limb, etc.. ? I assumed that
                  would be impossible because most people probably can't conjour up emotions that extreme very easily, but I'm not sure. Also, when sending an emotion to someone, is it a requirement that you are feeling it too?</p>

                  <p>And last question: now that empathy is natural for you, do you find that even with shields on, there are some places you must avoid?</p>

                  <p>Hmmm let me think.</p>

                  <p>For example, we just got a new video game, and all my roommates want to play it... but it's single player. So the tension sort of builds after a while, and I can sense when one person is pissed off about something in the game, or that they want to play, or if they think another person is hogging
                  the game. Sounds kind of lame <img src="blah.gif"

                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />.</p>

                  <p>Another example... I can feel the progress of friends' relationships with their significant others. I can tell when they're mad at each other, or one is annoyed with the other, or when they're bored...</p>
