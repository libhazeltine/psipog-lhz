                  <p>Empathy has been a subject of great interest to me, and reading Peebrain's empathy article I've decided I might try to learn this ability. However, I have a few questions.</p>

                  <p>1) Would an empath, in general, have trouble going to crowded places such as rock concerts, parades, etc?</p>

                  <p>2) Does empathy apply while you're asleep (example: you forget to shield and while sleeping, you're flooded with emotions)?</p>

                  <p>3) Lastly, if a tragic event occurs within you area and many people are grieving, would that effect you a lot, even with a shield? An example of this may be 9/11.</p>

                  <p>1) A strong/sensitive empath, yes. Weak/borderline empaths seem to have less severe problems, and folk who learn it from scratch do not always have any problems at all.</p>

                  <p>2) Yes.</p>

                  <p>3) Decidedly so. Many of us were stunned to the point of complete loss of function (over-all, not just psionically) by that incident.</p>

                  <p>Yes. However the fellow most interested in RV left the community, which is why his writings are no longer here. Remote Viewing is a huge topic in its own right, and has been covered in considerable depth in communities devoted entirely to it.</p>

                  <p>Hi,</p>

                  <p>Not Sure if this question would go to Perception, but it's the closest I can think that it would go..</p>

                  <p>Anyway, Today, While I was absentmindely staring at my Psi-wheel, I got to thinking about various things, one of the things that popped in my head was using telekinesis to type. Then I figured out pretty quickly, that that would be a slow and not very effective process. So, I decided on thinking
                  of otherways, and I came up with this, and I'm just wondering if it's been tried before..</p>

                  <p>Would it be possible to mentally "Hack" or something, and bypass the keyboard and just type with your mind? Sort of like "Plugging" yourself into the computer as the keyboard. Don't know if this would harm the computer and/or you. Am Just wondering if this has been tried, and if it has been, what
                  came from that.</p>

                  <p>Thanks!</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Typing telekinetically _Can_ be done, but it is very slow, and awkward. Typing accurately is difficult, because the pressure must be placed precisely, to avoid hitting neighbouring keys.</p>

                  <p>Hacking directly into the computer, bypassing the keyboard entirely, can also be done. Strangely enough, this tends to be the easier route. You do run the usual risks of any telekinetic activity, of course, plus the added "bonus" of the possibility of frying your computer.</p>

                  <p>It is also possible to imprint programming directly onto a disc (CD, floppy, etc) using psionics. It must be said, however, that typing it in the old-fashioned way is a _lot_ easier.</p>

                  <p>Hi, I've been searching throught the Articles and Q&amp;A but haven't quite foud the answer. Is it possible to develop some kind of vision with your eyes closed, like sensing the energy from objects and life forms? I've heard about people who can actually see everything around them with their eyes
                  closed, however not quite like with OBE's, they can maintain it when moving and when walking around. I wonder if it has anything to do with psionics. I'll accept any help you can give me. thx.</p>

                  <p>Yes, it is a variety of "clairvoyance". There are several approaches. Two of the relatively common ones are to a) "feel around" with the edges of your field, and to b) take the "feeling colours with the fingertips" concept further out from the body. (Feeling colours...run your fingers over the
                  face of a playing card, without looking at it.....what colour does it feel like; red or black?)</p>

Once I predicted all the answers to `Who Wants to be a Millionaire?` befor the questions even came up and where the guy would finish. Resently I sent a text to my mum and then turned all ringer tones off. Later I heard my phone playing a tune,
                  when I picked it up I had a text message. I checked that I had tuned of ring tones and I had. Is this some kind of tele kinisis or precognition? Thakyou :)</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>hi, i recently began naturally recieving telepathic and empathetic signals from poeple (by naturally i mean after about 2 years its finally become normal and constant)<br />
                  my question is, when i put up shields, i get very wierd vibes from poeple, or rather if its getting annoying being around poeple, and i begin to put them up, i get wierd signals. vauge hostility/disappointment. also a peice of myself becomes sad/anxious. i was just wondering if this seperation
                  anxiety is normal for telepaths/empaths at first, and will i become more comfortable being cut off from the input over time. Also, do poeple treat you oddly when you have shields up? what sort of subconscious effect do normal poeple get from being unable to sunconsciously get information from
                  poeple?<br />
                  The second part of this question is, if i don't want to shield, how easy is it to train my subconscious to stop madly projecting at everything.</p>

                  <p>"Separation anxiety", as you call it, is relatively common among empaths who were _always_ that way. It seems to be unusual among those who became empathic deliberately.</p>

                  <p>People treat you oddly, if you have some kinds of Shielding. Other kinds are ignored entirely.</p>

                  <p><br />
                  "Normal" people tend not to notice such a lack.</p>

                  <p>If you don't want to Shield, you'll find that you must use the more difficult disciplines if you don't want to project madly. In other words, not easy at all.</p>
