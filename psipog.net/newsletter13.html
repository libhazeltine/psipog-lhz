PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #13, for March 1st, 2005

"What is a scientist after all? It is a curious man looking
through a keyhole, the keyhole of nature, trying to know what's
going on."
- Jacques Cousteau


Dear PsiPog Users,

Yoooo! How's it going? Good I hope :-). If not, then maybe
some cool pictures of bent silverware would help? The PK Party
was a ton of fun, with about 75 people total at it's height. A
bunch of people reported bending their metal, and sent me pics!
Check them out at: http://www.psipog.net/pkp/

I'll be writing up a page to add to the Feature section some time
in the future, but until then you can check out the pics at the
above URL.

I've also updated the Q&A so that members can rate each question
and answer, to whether it was helpful or not. Helpful ones can
be sorted to the top, and boring useless ones can be pushed
towards the end. I figured if Amazon.com uses the same idea,
then it's a good move for PsiPog.net too ;-P.

Speaking of ideas - I'm looking for ideas on how to improve
PsiPog! We're going to eventually have a forum, but that won't
be for a while, so in the meantime I want to be open to what
everyone else thinks could improve the website. So if you have
ideas on how things could work better, or have a totally insane
idea about psionics that we could get together online and try
out, then send it in! E-mail: ideas@psipog.net

And as usual, specifically with this newsletter we like questions
and comments too. If you have something to write in for the
newsletter, then send it to: newsletter@psipog.net

That said, let's check what people have sent in the past two
weeks...

"Hey, as long as I can remember I've had natural abilities.
Lately they've shut down. I use them daily for certain things,
and I could send off pings long distance, but lately I havent
been able to send any type of ping. I was wondering if you knew
anything that would help? Another question is that when I get
really mad, my abilities become powerful - I mean I've thrown
things at people with TK and it scares me. I was wondering if I
could harness it with out getting so angry."

My comments: To answer your first question - sometimes we just
have off days. Like any other skill, some days we are just on
the ball and can do anything, and other days we can't do one
thing right. Try to roll with the punches and pick yourself up -
the skills aren't gone, just try again later. For your second
question, I can't really speak from personal experience. Usually
I WANT things to go flying across the room... I don't want to
STOP it from happening :-P. But I do feel your pain in a smaller
scale - I've had "outbursts" which wern't pleasant from intense
emotion. Shielding can help, but also dealing with your anger
before it becomes a big problem can prevent it too. Harnessing
the same power in controlled conditions is really hard - if you
can figure out a way to do it, let me know ;-). The only
solution I know of is steady practice.

"I've been doing Tai Chi for about a year and a half now, and had
formerly been apprenticed by a chi gung guy. I left because he
wasn't credible. Anyway, when I form a ball of chi, or psi, it
is like magnets that are of both polarities at times. Though I
find that I can control the polarity. Also, I have felt a
marshmellowy feeling at times. But, what I was wondering is if
you guys (or girls) had any other type of feelings? I just feel
a bit limited when I think about the possibility of there being
more sensations of any sort."

My comments: I personally usually feel warm or cold sensations on
my skin. A magnetic feeling is popular too. Pushing and pulling
of different fingers... or heck, sometimes you can actually SEE
them with your eyes. I recommend not worrying about one
specific feeling or another... focus on controlling what you
have. Can you move the feeling to another part of your body?
Can you ball it up, throw it, and catch it? Can you have someone
else feel it too? Can you verify it with some external device?

"Howdy. I have come to the conclution that... well... How can you
practice something that does not work at first? When you imply
practicing with this stuff, do you mean try different stuff until
it works, or to just stick to a few techniques, and try over and
over again, and then if right, it will eventually work?

As for me... I can't make a psi ball... I can't make a psi dot!
Anyway. For some reason I find it entertaining and fun just to
practice something that does not work for me at the moment (even
though I keep a positive mind convinced it will work one day)."

My comments: To answer your first question, look at any other
skill. How do gymnists learn to do backflips? They can't do one
at first, but after a while of trying, they can eventually get
it. When you just start out, I suggest doing a basic exercise
over and over again until you get it to work. The basic
exercises have worked for many people, so chances are it'll work
for you too. When you get more into it, and have some success,
then start branching off and seeing if different things work
better or worse.

Getting psi to work for you from the basic exercises shouldn't
take too long... perhaps a week for the average person. Start
simple, and build on it. Read the first couple chapters of my
eBook, located at: http://psipog.net/ebook.php

"Hey! I've been able to make psi-balls since I was young but
never been able to think of anything to use them for. Here's what
I've recently used one to do: I was meditating one night when I
felt an urge to make a psi-ball and then I decided to program it
to remember things for me and notify me via thoughts. Since then
I've been able to remember all my school work and even began
remembering dreams (which I hardly ever remember even having!).
So now I've also made a psi-ball to improve my response times in
Math and Science, I sort of embed the ball with sciency thoughts
and told it to help me by bringing important things to my
attention as I needed them, almost like improving my brain's
filing system. So, if you can make psi-balls good then maybe
these are some other uses you can find for them!"

My comments: Awesome! :-D

"I've got 4 years of various meditations behind my back and have
been practicing psi off and on. I haven't had any real
difficulties with it until I get to projecting things past my
"range". Additionally I find that no matter how relaxed I am, the
back of my neck and base of my skull will feel instense pressure
and tension while working with psi. Basically that's 2
questions; what are some things I could do to increase the
projection and range of my constructs and has anyone else had a
problem with tension in the neck during practice? And if so have
they found a solution?"

My comments: Hmmm, I think you've stumped me on both questions.
For your first question, about increasing your sending "range",
perhaps the article by Brandon can help you, "Increased Sending
Through Pinging". URL: art-outline-to-shielding.html141
I've never had neck pain from practicing psionics either. Maybe
some of the readers in the audience can help? I would normally
suggest just relaxing and chilling out, but you said that you
already do that. Maybe you have some junk built up in your field
that is causing the problem? Clean out the neck area the next
time you meditate, and maybe that will help.

=================================================================

For this last section, I want to recommend a cool website for
people to mess around with and play some psi games. If you have
some time to kill, point your browser to: http://www.gotpsi.org
They have a bunch of fun games that are psi related, and they
measure all the statistics stuff for you automagically! For some
tips, you might want to read the article on PsiPog.net at:

art-outline-to-shielding.html110

In it, Vigil lists some tips of things that worked for him. Try
and see how you do :-).

=================================================================

Thanks for reading! Remember: submit your comments, questions,
suggestions, exercises, or whatever else you think would be cool
to: newsletter@psipog.net - don't be shy! Share your thoughts
with everyone :-).

On a last exciting/sad note, I won't be writing newsletters for
a while. I joined the United States Air Force, and I'll be
flying out to Texas for Basic Training in 2 weeks! :-O. I'll be
stuck without internet for about 7 weeks - but I plan to jump
right back into writing for the newsletter when I get out. In
the meantime, I'll be passing off my duties to other mods, so
hopefully the site won't fall apart while I'm gone :-P. I'm
going to write some exercises down for mods to copy/paste into
future newsletters before I leave, but I won't be able to respond
directly to the e-mail. Wish me luck :-).
