<pre style="width: 530px">Hey hey!

Welcome to all the new members of the Official PsiPog.net
Newsletter. We have over 2,200 people signed up, and it's cool to
see so many people interested in pushing modern science to the
limits, and discovering new things about reality :-).

USUALLY I send out a newsletter every two weeks, but this past
month has been a little crazy. I still don't have internet
access (I'm using a lab computer), so it's hard for me to work on
ANYTHING related to PsiPog, unfortunately. I'm in Technical
Training School for the United States Air Force, so I don't have a
whole lot of control over my life (anyone in the military knows
what I mean :-P). Nonetheless, I keep bugging them about internet,
and they've said I should be online in a week. Of course, this is
what they keep saying every week, but this time they sound
serious :-P.

I wanted to e-mail everyone and let you guys know that I still
plan on sending out newsletters in the future, but right now it's
just too hard. Hopefully in another week or two I will be back
online, and I can continue the newsletters like normal.

Some good news though: the newsletter is now over a year old! Who
knew it would last this long :-P.

Thanks for your patience, and I'm sorry it's taking forever. I
check my e-mail almost every day, and I try to answer questions in
the Q&A on PsiPog.net. If you have a pressing issue, send it to
the Q&A at http://www.psipog.net/qna.php - or if you want my
direct attention, send it to: peebrain@psipog.net - please be
aware that I might not reply to your e-mail (but I do make an
effort to try to reply with SOMETHING, even if it's only a short
sentence).

And of course, if you want to contribute to the newsletter, send
your questions/comments/etc to: newsletter@psipog.net (but I don't
know when the next newsletter will be :-P).

Thanks again and hopefully things will be up and running again in
no time!
