                  <p>It is my perception that this is crap. That is, not helpful in any way. I guess all i really want from this question is: can i help in any way to give better answers to the questions of the patrons of this site, directly or indirectly, because it seems that some moderators are not commited to
                  giving helpful perspectives. Is it time constraint? Stress? I can help. I swear. Love, me!</p>

                  <p>Are you suggesting that Rainsong is not "commited to giving helpful perspectives"? You've got to be kidding, right? Look around you. At least she GAVE you an answer, I personally would have deleted the original question, and this one too. In regards to the actual comments, her statement was
                  correct. Humans give off heat, and that heat can heat up other objects. Therefore, it shouldn't surprise you when you hold onto something and it gets warmer. If you think the replys are "crap", you're free to not use this site.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1) There is a difference between "not being able to teach everyone who asks" and "not being able to teach anyone at all". Teaching is time-consuming, and often is hard work. None of us have the time to teach everyone who asks. At least some of us do not have the inclination to do so, either.</p>

                  <p>2) Planning for the future... it's easier to code in sections now and plug in the right things later, than recode everything. I.e., I plan on putting polls and voting in the future, so those are just some counters I have in place. They don't do anything now...</p>
