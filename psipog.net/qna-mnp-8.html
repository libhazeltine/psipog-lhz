               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I have a habit of collecting and cross-referencing as much metaphysical information from a variety of sources as I can. Over the years I have studied your articles in energy manipulation and had some small successes. However just recently I came across www.astraldynamics.com, where Robert Bruce
                  has a tutorial on the New Energy Ways (NEW) methods for moving energy through the body. The high quality of his tutorial has given me huge results and I feel like I've broken through a plateau metaphysically. The difficulty I'm having now is many exerienced energy-workers at psipog do not believe in
                  chakras or energy pathways in the subtle energy body. I've seen chakras mentioned as some sort of "constructs" by rainsong. Robert Bruce emphasizes that energy pathways and secondary chakras should be worked with and strengthened before moving to primary chakras, and that primary chakras are the
                  cause of all psychic phenomenon. Do you think primary chakras are constructs automatically created by the belief system impressed upon new learners by current energy workers? Why is that so many religions seem to agree on the existance of primary chakras for centuries? Many energy works experience
                  pressure in the third eye, and some methods for creating psiballs (on this very site) draw energy from below the naval which is to Robert Bruce, a subnavel energy storage center. Are these just coincidences? Any input is greatly appreciated.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Chakras are part of the belief system of several religions because most of the religions on question have some basis in the earliest one. Most of the modern energy-working beliefs about Chakras, as well as most of the "New Age" relious beliefs about them, derive from Theosophy, which itself
                  derives from Hinduism.</p>

                  <p>I personally do not believe in Chakras, although my opinion in this regard is subject to change, if I encounter any evidence to warrant that change. As far as I have seen so far, the Chakras appear to be constructs, created by belief in them. Notice I say "appear to be". I've seen them on quite a
                  few people, and can indeed produce the Chakra effects myself, having been trained to do so. If they turn out to be a natural, non-construct reality, I would be interested to know why there are so many wildly divergent variations on the Chakra theme, as far as "what they are" and "what they do".</p>

                  <p>My experience and observations leads me to believe the energy pathways exist although I freely admit that those might also be constructs. Belief in the one does not require belief in the other. More to the point, successful energy-work does not require belief in either of them. Either they exist
                  or they do not, ne?</p>

                  <p>At the same time, it is quite possible to use systems such as New Energy Ways and Therapeutic Touch which involve Chakras in their explanations, without the Chakras being involved in fact, at all.</p>

                  <p>As for the "subnavel energy storage centre", I do not know _why_ psi-stuff seems to collect there in the regular course of the day, but on most people, that does seem to be where it accumulates. That does not make it a Chakra, though. Chakras are supposed to be vortices, not storage containers,
                  last I heard. Also, the pressure on the "third eye" area during certain forms of energy work might be the reason for the belief in the "third eye" as easily as the "third eye" being the cause of the pressure sensation.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Bruce's approach to things works quite well, but that does not mean that his interpretation of _how_ it works is correct. At the same time, and in the same way, our interpretation here at PsiPog about _how_ it works may not be correct, either (apart from the fact that this interpretation is
                  incomplete in the extreme). Until there is further evidence to support more than hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms, I would suggest not worrying too much about the interpretations of _how_ it works unless you are actively involved in research on that subject. If you _are_ actively involved
                  in research to uncover the actual mechanisms involved, be careful not to let your beliefs interfere with your observations (that error is far too common in this field of endeavor).</p>

                  <p>Short version: if using a chakra-based energy system works for you, run with it.</p>

                  <p>Actually, some people say that you only get psi from yourself, and that visualizing you are getting it from the earth is only a mental crutch. Others believe different things. Don't worry so much about theories and all that crap - focus on what YOU feel, and how YOU can learn from YOUR
                  experiences... If you read a theory and EXPECT to feel something because the theory says so, it might just be the placebo effect. But if you take a more open approach of "well, this one theory says this... but this other theory says that... let's see what I feel". And hey, you might feel something
                  that contradicts all the theories you've read.</p>

                  <p>My point being - let yourself experience what you are going to experience without the pressure of someone else's theory on you. Experience! And then later if you find one theory reflects what you've experienced, then consider that theory a little more than other ones.</p>

                  <p>Once it is set up, it shouldn't need attention in order to be maintained. If it is left alone, eventually, it will run out of "energy", and dissipate. The duration of its existence should be part of the initial program of the construct.</p>

                  <p>hey guys. I have a question (don't we all).</p>

                  <p>when I was younger, I used to often visualize, or pretend to see the energy of a point of light bouncing off of walls onto other walls kind of like 3D pong. Some times I could control it, other times it happened spontaniously. I also used to look at a plant or something, and see things happen to
                  it in the future very rapidly with good detail. It used to give me a headache if it happened for more then 5 or 10 seconds, so I usually tryed to break away.</p>

                  <p>Now I dont see these things as often. Do it meant I used to have natural skills in psiballs and stuff? Just curious.</p>

                  <p>Thanks!</p>

                  considered shields or what? and is there anyway to control your subconscious and your power because sometimes i find that ill say something about someone like wow they are really annoying i hope they trip and then later on i find out that they fell down the stairs and then i feel really bad because i
                  didnt mean it i just said it and then it happens sometimes.please help</p>
