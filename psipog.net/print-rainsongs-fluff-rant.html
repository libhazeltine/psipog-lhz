   <p><em>by Rainsong</em></p>

   <p>Fluffbunny: a moron in serious need of a clue, especially when clues are readily available; a moron studying hard to become an idiot, but failing the course</p>

   <p>To start with, I will begin by saying that I do realize that I am "preaching to the choir", and that the people to whom this rant is actually directed are those least likely to read it. PsiPog has become a virtual magnet for people of conspicuously low evidence of intelligence and even less of courtesy.
   Fluffbunnies are not always rude, but they are becoming increasingly so. Clearly, they don't hold a monopoly on rudeness, by any means. But the ones who are asking for help have more to lose by alienating their audience than do those who are giving the assistance. Rather than making my regular semi-annual fluff
   rant, I am going to offer some hints for the gentle reader who wishes to avoid fluffiness.</p>

   <ol>
      <li>If you don't know, ask. However, if the question is answered in an article, expect annoyance. The articles are there for a reason.</li>

      <li>Claiming to be able to do something that you can't actually do is not an effective way to impress people here. If, after claiming to already be able to do something, you then demand instruction in how to accomplish it, you will be laughed at, and not in a good way.</li>

      <li>Peebrain is not required to do anything with his website other than any obligations he might have to the computer communications firm he deals with. He can choose not to update anything, decline any article he feels like, and so on. He might consider your preferences, but he is not under any compulsion to
      honor them. Deal with it.</li>

      <li>In a similar vein; Peebrain, Myriad, Nazarak, et al have no - repeat no - obligation to instruct anybody in anything, on this site or in the associated chatroom. Teaching is a serious commitment and a lot of work. If someone does deign to teach you, you are expected to hold up your end. For example, I
      require essays and data-keeping from my students. If you aren't up to that, don't bother asking me.</li>

      <li>This website is called "Psychic Students in Pursuit of Guidance". "Guidance", guys, not self-esteem-building cheerleading regardless of your conduct. If you come in here with a story of some incident that is clearly not a psychic phenomenon, that's all very well and good, but we are not going to tell you
      that it is something that it is not. Deal with it; sympathy's for wimps.</li>

      <li>Coming into the chatroom and saying, "I'm making a new website. Tell me everything about &lt;insert topic here&gt;" will usually get you ignored by the polite people and insulted by everyone else. Starting a conversation about whatever topic you like is rather more polite. However, if you paraphrase someone,
      on your website, without understanding what you are paraphrasing, you will look like an idiot. If you do this with a concept that is already relatively well-known, you will look even more foolish. If you do both of the above without crediting the concept, thus claiming as your own idea something that you don't
      even understand, you'll really look like a moron..aka fluffbunny.</li>

      <li>Most fluffy things will only earn you mocking laughter and contempt. Pretending to be a deity, a cartoon character, or a super-hero in the forum or chatroom is also likely to get you banned from the room. It was funny the first few times, but the novelty has long since worn off, and the moderators can pretty
      much kick whomever they want to. If being both fluffy and banned appeals to you, then by all means fill your boots.</li>
   </ol>

   <p>On a personal note, regarding teaching.Yes, I do teach some aspects of psionics, sometimes. Therefore, from now on if you ask me "Do you teach?" in the chatroom, I will assume that you have not read the site. I do not teach everyone who asks, although in certain moods I will lecture on rudimentary skills to
   almost anybody. I rarely take on private students these days. When I do, if they do not do their assigned homework, or if they simply annoy me, they quickly lose their spot in class-often without so much as a polite explanation as to why. I have better things to do than babysit: for example, practicing with
   buddies, helping people who are really interested in training and/or research, and watching paint dry.</p>
