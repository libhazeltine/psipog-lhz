</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Playful Psychic alternates practice sections with learning sections. This gives time to practice the existing skills before developing too many new ones. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The teacher's manual is intended for use in a small group setting, with breaks for discussion after worksheets and between units. It is advantageous for each student to have a copy of the book, so that lecture does not need to cover every detail.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Topics are divided into days but the divisions are flexible. Students should be competent with the material through Practice Month One before attempting Advanced Skills. If time permits, use an extra day or longer to practice the early skills, before proceeding.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Preparation</I> addresses fears, goals, and the learning process. It sets up the environment for learning. Fears are addressed because students tend to be very nervous about their first attempts at psychic perception.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Basic Skills</I> introduce several skill areas, focusing on learning to perceive and direct psychic energy. These skills provide personal experience with psychic perceptions, and increase belief and self-trust. They help the student expect success and accept the existence of psychic abilities. They also provide some basic practical skills for daily use.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Practice Month One</I> discusses how psychic events affect daily life. It addresses identifying psychic events. It looks at how psychic abilities change your perception of the world, and gives ways to use the abilities every day. It adds understanding to the basic skills already started, and answers questions that may occur during practice.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advanced Skills</I> build on the basic skills, increasing accuracy and complexity. They rely on the self-trust you’ve gained from practicing basic skills. The advanced skills combine many of the other skills and require significant confidence and accuracy.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Practice Month Two</I> gives more ways to practice daily, and discusses areas of life that psychic abilities influence. It provides game ideas for children and pets and explains the difference between magick and psychic abilities. It also explains teaching from both a student and a teacher perspective.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">References</I> are given at the end, including scientific studies, related books, a glossary, and extra copies of the worksheets. The worksheets may be reproduced for classes or personal use.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Black" SIZE=6><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="_Toc472931729">Preparation</A></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The teacher can explain his/her own teaching style, or address the particular issues in the book, during the first day of class. The section on choosing a teacher is intended mainly for solo readers. The worksheet in it may still be helpful.</P>

<UL>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><LI>Practicing helps you remember how a skill feels; it may be awkward at first, but it gets easier.</LI>
<LI>Learning psychic abilities is just like any other skill.</LI>
<LI>Making it happen once is the first step, and often the hardest.</LI>
<LI>Explain spontaneous psi, and explain that reading and talking about the ability can induce it.</LI>
<LI>Notice how psi feels when it happens spontaneously, and repeat that feeling or idea.</LI>
<LI>After you can cause it on cue, practice detailed control by giving it a goal.</LI>
<LI>Practice, use it daily, have fun. Relax.</LI></UL>

<UL>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><LI>Seances and spooky moods can put you into a slightly altered state of consciousness.</LI>
<LI>Atmosphere and mood affect psychic perceptions, in good and bad (inaccurate) ways.</LI>
<LI>Start out by avoiding spooky settings, since you have enough doubts to deal with.</LI>
<LI>A spooky mood can help out once you're experienced, if you enjoy it.</LI>
<LI>Mood can be a useful tool to enhance your experience; quiet, dreamy, separate from daily worries.</LI>
<LI>Consider what sort of mood best separates you from the mundane world. Discuss.</LI>
<LI>Drug use for psychic perceptions can be uncontrolled and is unnecessary.</LI></UL>

<UL>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><LI>Grounding connects your energy to the earth in a stable way, letting go of bad and providing a connection for good.</LI>
<LI>Letting go: Let go of physical tension, relax, and focus on this moment and place.</LI>

<LI>Releasing negativity: Drain negative energy and tension downward. Stay calm and avoid getting lightheaded. Relax.</LI>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_Toc472931741">Centering</A></P>

<UL>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><LI>Centering means finding your own identity, energy, and essence, separate from other people's expectations.</LI>
<LI>Finding center is easiest when alone, but any quiet place will do.</LI>
<LI>Sit quietly, breathe, and notice yourself. Notice your feelings and accept them without judgement. Do not try to change anything, just notice yourself.</LI>
<LI>Notice your thoughts, your body, your daydreams, and everything that is a part of you.</LI>
<LI>Notice anything that seems to be imposed upon you by others; tension, expectations, anger, and how you have reacted.</LI>
<I><LI>Give everyone time to practice. Then discuss and address problems.</LI>
</I><LI>As you practice this over many weeks, you'll become more clear about what feelings are yours and what belong to other people. This will help you stay clear of other's pressures, and increase your focus for energy work.</LI>
<LI>Staying centered in crowds is more difficult, but with practice, it can be very helpful.</LI>
<LI>Summarize: Ground. Recognize yourself. Recognize others' imposed energies. Focus on yourself.</LI></UL>

<UL>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><LI>Psychic energy exists naturally, and you need it to use psychic abilities.</LI>
<LI>Sources include the sun, moon, earth, nature, water, wind, fire, storms, emotions, movement, and creatures.</LI>
<LI>Low energy correlates with depression and bad health.</LI>
<LI>Choose a source to draw energy from, and imagine it bursting or glowing with energy.</LI>
<LI>Visualize a connection between you and that source, such as a garden hose or a tree root.</LI>
<LI>Draw energy from that source, feeling it warm and glowing flowing through you.</LI>
<LI>Do not try to stop the energy inside of you like a bottle; keep it flowing like a stream.</LI>
<LI>Pull as much energy through as you comfortably can, without becoming lighthead. If you get lightheaded, let the energy flow shrink, and ground it into the earth.</LI>
<LI>When you have found your comfort limit, hold the energy gently at that speed for a little while. Then let it shrink and ground back into the earth.</LI>
<I><LI>Give everyone practice time, then discussion and address problems.</LI>
</I><LI>Summarize: Ground and center. Choose a source. Pull energy through. Stay balanced.</LI></UL>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_Toc472931744">Shutdown</A></P>

<UL>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><LI>Shutting down means that for a while, you completely stop thinking about what happened, in order to recover from shock, anxiety, or other strong emotions. It lets you shut off all psychic perceptions for a little while.</LI>
<LI>Some people shut down instinctively out of fear: "I don't want to deal with that right now."</LI>
<LI>If thinking about a psychic experience bothers you too much, shut down for a while. If instead, you can just step back and think about it, do that instead. </LI>
<LI>Shutting down is an extreme step; it's reversible but only with effort, because you've told yourself you don't want the perceptions.</LI>
<LI>To shut down, ground all of your energy. Then focus all your conscious thought toward here, now, in the physical world. Find people to talk with, do physical activity, walk, stretch, jog. Get into your physical body. Do something creative if you feel like it. Just keep yourself distracted for a few hours.</LI>
<LI>To return to using psychic perceptions, start with the basics. Set up a helpful atmosphere and supportive mood, ground, and center.</LI>
<LI>If you still have fears, return to the earlier section on challenging fears.</LI>
<I><LI>Discuss situations that might scare someone enough to make shutdown useful.</LI>
<LI>Discuss alternative solutions to the fear, without shutting down.</LI></UL>

<UL>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><LI>Psiball is a nickname for a ball of psychic energy.</LI>
<LI>Psiballs can have size, shape, density, texture, emotion, temperature, and thought forms.</LI>
<LI>Ground, center, and draw energy. Direct it outward through your hands.</LI>
<LI>Cup your hands as if you were holding a baseball or a ball of cookie dough.</LI>
<LI>Imagine the energy flowing through your body, down your arms, out your hands, and into a ball.</LI>
<LI>Feel the energy swirling, getting denser, pulsating, tingling; see it as waviness or sparks, or in any way that's comfortable for you. </LI>
<LI>Don't worry whether you're just imagining it or if it's actually there; imagination creates the reality.</LI>
<I><LI>Give everyone practice time. Address any problems. Discuss what everyone felt.</LI>
</I><LI>Learning control comes from more careful imagining, and more practice.</LI>
<LI>Each person makes a psiball, then combine them one at a time into a big center ball.</LI>
<I><LI>Discuss what everyone feels as this occurs. End by directing the energy into the earth.</LI>
</I><LI>Everyone returns to making one psiball each, and invents attributes to give it; size, density, color, and temperature. Try throwing them, splatting them, making them different shapes. Play.</LI>
<LI>Summarize: Ground and center. Draw energy. Shape the energy. Notice sensations. Ground the energy.</LI></UL>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_Toc472931747">Shielding</A></P>

<UL>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><LI>A shield is a bubble of energy that works like a window screen or glass. It filters any type of energy you tell it to, in any way you choose.</LI>
<LI>Common uses are to bounce away negative energy, letting only positive through; to bounce off psychic scans, telepathy, and energy from other people; and to keep your emotions or physical space separate from other people's.</LI>
<LI>Decide first exactly what you want your personal shield to do. <I>Discuss this as a group.</I> </LI>
<LI>Will it filter or repel all energy? Temporary or permanent? Defensive only or aggressive? What texture will it have, rubber, glass, soap, feathers, light?</LI>
<LI>Once you have a clear intent, ground, center, and draw energy.</LI>
<LI>Direct it out from your body in any way you choose; through your hands, or through your head, or out through your skin. Imagine it all flowing into a bubble around you and back down to the earth, in a cycle. Again, don't bottle it up, keep it flowing.</LI>
<LI>When you feel that the shield is strong enough, send your intent into it, and then let go of it. It will continue to maintain itself, and it will carry out the purpose you gave it.</LI>
<LI>Take the flow of energy you've been drawing from the earth and let it shrink, and ground back into the earth. The shield has its own separate energy flows and is unaffected by the other things you do now.</LI>
<I><LI>Give practice time and discuss with the group. Address problems.</LI>
</I><LI>Stress and tiredness can affect the shield over the long-term. You may want to add energy to it (the same way you originally built it) on a regular basis, whenever you feel you need it.</LI>
<LI>Meditation, time alone, and rest are the best ways to prevent stress from tearing down your shield and your personal energy.</LI>
<LI>Summarize: Ground and center. Choose the shield's purpose. Draw energy and swirl it into the shield. Let it go and ground.</LI></UL>
