</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Effects</A></A> of Psychokinesis</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc451336217"><A NAME="_Toc441314488"><A NAME="_Toc451336213">Chance Variations</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The most common effects of psychokinesis are small variations in chance, such as dice rolls, card shuffles, and influence on electronics. These can help a person win a board game. They can force variation in a random number generator. They sometimes cause electronic equipment malfunctions, and often happen without us realizing it.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Retro Psychokinesis</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychokinesis can also work backward in time. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The experiment uses a random number generator to produce a set of 1's and 0's and records them on floppy disk. While it occurs, a person is trying to force the results using PK. Another person then looks at the numbers to see whether there are more of a number than expected. Like the flip of a fair coin, there should be about half of each result.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In one form of the experiment, a person with PK is told to force 1's before the generator runs. Then it runs, a person checks the results, and the person has successfully forced extra 1's. This is normal cause and effect, as we understand it.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In the second form of the experiment, the number generator runs first and the results are recorded on floppy disk. Then afterward, the person is told whether to force it to produce extra 1's or extra 0's. The person makes an effort, and then someone looks at the already recorded results to see if it worked. And, it does a scientifically significant amount of time. Since the floppy hasn't been touched, the results must have been there all along, in the direction asked for.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">No one, including top scientists, has been able to explain how that works. All they can prove is that it does work a significant number of times. For more details, look for studies on retro-psychokinesis in scientific parapsychology journals.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc451336218"><A NAME="_Toc441314489">Levitation</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Levitating objects is possible though rare. This can either be straight up, or moving the object across the room. For reasons probably tied to beliefs, this rarely happens when people are watching. Sometimes, though, a person will turn around just in time to see the object drop. It may account for some objects relocating across the room when no one moved them (this happens to a large number of people, in cases where it couldn't be just forgetfulness).</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In my experience, objects spontaneously levitated or moved when I was daydreaming. Typically, I was relaxed, dreamy, unfocused, and mentally energetic. I don't know how long objects levitated. I only noticed them once they fell down with a bang. Other than general mood, I haven't discovered any details for causing movement on purpose.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Chimes rang indoors without wind, repeatedly (and just one chime at a time, not the whole set). A pan floated straight up and then dropped back down onto the same shelf. A cordless phone moved to a different corner of the room while I was awake in it but not watching. A spiral handset phone cord floated in the air in front of my eyes, until I thought, "That can't float!" at which point it promptly dropped to the floor. Some of these happened with friends in the room, and they agreed with my observations. I haven't learned to control them yet, though.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc451336219"><A NAME="_Toc441314490">Teleportation</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Teleportation, which means an object vanishes in one place and reappears somewhere else, is reported occasionally but is extremely rare. Since I don't have the ability, I can't teach it. I mention it here to help people research it.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Search carefully through parapsychology journals and publications. There are stories of psychic Chinese children who can cause flowers, pills, and other small objects to teleport on cue. There are stories of a Scottish man from hundreds of years ago showing up in Europe in the 1990s, very confused about what happened to his farm. There are stories of mediums who conjure small objects during seances. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some of these have been researched in detail. Some are just reported as case studies. Because they aren't repeatable in a lab, they're difficult to verify and prove. Also, it's very difficult to get studies of such controversial topics published in the United States. Search for psychic studies from Europe, Australia, Canada, China, and Russia. </P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P></A>Causes of Psychokinesis</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Random Manifestations of Micro Psychokinesis</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychokinesis most often manifests spontaneously and accidentally as microPK. The person may not notice microPK. Strongly wanting a dice roll or a particular hand of cards, can cause microPK to happen. This may account for a person's good luck or bad luck.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Random manifestation comes from a strong emotional desire. The desire motivates the ability, which then works subconsciously to bring about the goal.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Random Manifestations of Macro Psychokinesis</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The other emotional state that often causes psychokinesis is high adrenaline. This can be anger, fear/terror, frustration, excitement, or pleasure.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Adrenaline psychokinesis can manifest in a big way: objects moving around, electronic equipment breaking, or a glass shattering. While this is impressive, it's usually not repeatable. It usually scares the person involved, although it's unlikely to hurt anyone.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This is also the ability sometimes responsible for poltergeist effects in homes. The poltergeist effects center around one person with an undisciplined psychokinetic ability and usually a lot of emotional upset and stress. The psychokinetic activity may be a way of releasing some of the stress or making it more obvious so it gets solved. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This may not account for all such cases, but it is the reason behind some of them. People who have troublesome psychokinetic activity should contact an agency with a good reputation in parapsychology - ask for their history and references - and get assistance there.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Random psychokinesis shows that the person does have a natural ability towards psychokinesis. If the person wants to do so, she or he may work on gaining control of the ability, and causing it on purpose in the intended fashion. Even if a person has not had random psychokinesis before, if he or she is willing to let it happen, it may eventually do so.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc451336215"><A NAME="_Toc441314486">Intentional Manifestations</A></A> of Micro Psychokinesis</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychokinesis can also manifest on purpose. The easiest to study is micro psychokinesis affecting random number generators (RNGs) because scientists can measure the effect. Psychic research labs have identified people who can consistently affect RNGs.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Computer programs are becoming a possibility for an at-home lab with as much or almost as much control as a scientific lab. The best of these programs use true random numbers, generated from special hardware. Simpler programs use pseudo-random numbers, which can have patterns or repetition in them, and are harder or impossible to affect. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A cheap route to practicing micro psychokinesis is to use a fair die. See the section Statistics and the Z-Score for detailed experiments and how to interpret the results.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Intentional Manifestations of Macro Psychokinesis</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Some people can also manifest macro psychokinesis on purpose. Most will not demonstrate it, or even let anyone else know they can do it. They would be harassed about the ability if they did. Don't expect any demonstrations.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In many cases, these people had random macro psychokinesis manifestations, and eventually discovered how to control them. They may not understand the ability or be able to teach it. Some methods for learning macro psychokinesis are discussed later in this page. Since few people can learn it easily, they aren't as tried and practiced as the other skills in this book.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A very large part of learning macro psychokinesis is belief. If a person believes that it can't happen, it won't. If they believe it might happen, then it might. If they can fully believe that it will happen, it will.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This is covered and explained in more details in the belief section. Disbelief is why macro psychokinesis is one of the more rare psychic abilities. It takes a lot to overcome the initial disbelief enough to manifest the ability a few times. Just like any other psychic ability, it can be learned if approached correctly.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P><A NAME="_Toc472931503"><A NAME="_Toc457970577"><A NAME="_Toc457970251"><A NAME="_Toc457894828"><A NAME="_Toc457892931"><A NAME="_Toc457892750"><A NAME="_Toc457811525">Statistics and </A></A></A></A></A></A>the Z-Score</A></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892932"><A NAME="_Toc457892751"><A NAME="_Toc457811526">Random Chance</A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">A 6-sided fair die is equally likely to roll any of the numbers on it. So, the chance of rolling a particular number is 1 out of 6: it will show up approximately once out of every six rolls. Out of 30 rolls, a certain number would show up approximately 5 times.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If a number shows up much more or much less than that, then either the die is not fair (trick dice? weighted?), or something else, such as psychokinesis, is affecting the roll.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Having the correct number show up extra often is called psi hitting. It's also possible to have the correct number show up much too rarely, and this is called psi missing, meaning that psychic abilities cause you to miss more often than chance. It's just as important in studies as psi hitting, since it's still affecting the roll.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you have a lot of psi missing, check that your thoughts are clear and free of doubts, and then try again. Sometimes an ability will just work backward of what's intended, and changing your approach can fix that.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Scientific Significance</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The <I>test of scientific significance</I> measures how significant a certain result is. This is a common scientific method of proving a given theory based on experimental results.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">It gives a percentage likelihood that the results of the experiment are due only to random chance. If there is less than a 5% chance that the results are due to random chance, then it is accepted as scientifically significant, meaning that the results could be due to psychic abilities.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The math behind it is somewhat complex, so the experiments listed on the following pages have simple tables to check your results. You won't need to do any math for them.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As an example, the significance test says that on 30 dice rolling trials, 8 or more rolls of the same number, or less than 2 rolls of the same number, are <I>proof </I>that something special is happening. That would mean that either the person is using trick dice, or psychic abilities are affecting the rolls.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>For Science and Math People</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">If you are interested in more detailed math, the full z-score and probability formulas are available in the appendix of this book, with a description of how to use them. Also, check the Journal of Parapsychology for their statistical methods, which are much more detailed.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you want to do more advanced analysis of your experiments, keep a list of exactly what the target was, and what your actual answer was. Write your name and the date on every experiment result. Keep all your results, even the ones that you think you did badly on. Then find a professor of statistics or parapsychology and explain that you've done some experiments and you'd like to learn how to analyze the results. Most will be willing to help you out if you're patient and friendly.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The explanation given here is for the purpose of doing simple parapsychology experiments at home. The charts will give you accurate results, as long as you are following the rules about how to use them. You can do different experiments from those listed, as long as chance is the same as listed here. </P>
<OL>

<LI>Chance needs to be one choice out of a set, with each choice equally likely.</LI>
<LI>You need to do enough trials to be able to use the chart. This is listed under each experiment. In general, you need enough trials to make the number correct by chance be at least five. So if chance is 1/4, you need to do at least 20 trials, so chance would be 5 correct. If chance is 1/6, you need to do 30 trials, so chance is 5 correct.</LI>
<LI>You need to keep track of how many answers were correct and how many incorrect. </LI></OL>

<P>Dice Experiment</A></A></A></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Preparation</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">If you are using a normal die, chance is 1/6 because there are six sides. The table below gives probability values for any results with chance 1/6. You will be making 36 rolls.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You will be doing one set to test the die and another set to try out psychokinesis. The method for each is the same. It's important that you test the die first, so that if it's lopsided, you can find a better one to practice with.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Experiment</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Here you will be trying to roll a 3. (You can pick any number, but these instructions will assume 3 for now.) Roll a single die, and record whether it came up as a 3. Repeat this for all 36 rolls. At the end, count how many 3's you had and find that number in the "Correct" column in the chart.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Results</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">If you are just testing the die, it should roll anywhere from four to eight 3's during that time. If it rolls differently from that, it's probably not a fair die. Try using a different one, especially a new one. If you are testing your psychokinetic ability, you need zero, one, or eleven, or more 3's to prove that you did it. If you get more than thirteen 3's, then you've really proven it.</P>

It may involve invoking a higher power to do work for you, or using a ritual to bring forth power within you to do work.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some religions use magical ceremonies for blessings, rites of passage, and recognition. Examples would be baptism, communion, weddings and hand-fastings, prayers, rain dances, and some superstitions.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The traditions around magick vary greatly. Most Christian traditions have magical ceremonies of various sorts, conducted by the priest or pastor, and involving sometimes an entire congregation. They may not be referred to as magick, but the rites fit the definition, involve God's power in some way, and have a purpose in the minds of the people involved. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Most Christian traditions restrict the use of magick to only religious officials, and only in the ways defined by the church. They discourage general people from pursuing psychic perceptions, and especially from practicing ritual magick without the church.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Other religions, such as Wicca, are much more open about who can use magick. Wicca is a nature-loving religion with a God and a Goddess. Its basic message is as long as you harm no one, do whatever you want. It supports the use of rituals to help you think differently, to accomplish things, and accepts the existence of psychic perception. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">There are many other religions that support psychic abilities and ritual magick.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Magick and psychic abilities are related but somewhat different. Psychic abilities come entirely from within, and are generally under the control of the person involved. Magick can come from within or from other sources, and may or may not be entirely controlled. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">They are two similar but different ways of causing changes in the world. They often work well together, because ritual is especially helpful for setting a mood that psi will work in.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Check details carefully, for colors, sizes, shapes, similarities, word sounds, and other things that may match. Watch out for the extremely general things that don't provide useful information. "You will have difficulty tomorrow" is too general.

For that reason, I'm grouping together the abilities that are frequently used together, and listing some of their common uses. There will always be more uses for them than I can list; be creative, try things, and see what works for you.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892952"><A NAME="_Toc457892771"><A NAME="_Toc457811552">Aura Vision and Aura Healing</A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">These abilities can show the emotional state and overall health of a person, animal, or plant. They can help diagnose medical problems, areas needing attention or energy, relieve cramps, assist massage, and encourage healing when combined with traditional medicine.

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892953"><A NAME="_Toc457892772"><A NAME="_Toc457811551">Telepathy, Projection, Remote Viewing</A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">These can be used to communicate with friends or family who are far away or for any reason unreachable. Like seeing or speaking, they can be used to learn nearly anything: current location and activities, opinions, experiences, interests, etc. They can be used to find lost pets and missing objects (keys, socks, and toys). They can be used for anything you think of asking.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The following story is my personal experience using remote viewing to keep my family safe in a storm. With some practice, you can do the same.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc457811553">Dodging the Storm</A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The rain began to lessen. As we sat in the restaurant, my mother asked jokingly, "Can you use your psychic </FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">powers</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> to make the storm go away, or tell us when it's safe?"</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I was nervous enough, when we hadn't been able to see this driveway through the rain. I certainly didn't want to go back onto the road, just to be chased into the next driveway. The storm terrified me so much I almost felt like I was dreaming, or in another world.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">My little sister, almost asleep on her damp pillow, was gazing half-focused out the window. Other travelers were stranded in the restaurant, too. There was a mother with three children, soaking wet and shivering. The thunderstorm caught us all unprepared, trapping us in a family restaurant amid miles of Illinois farmland.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I decided to try my psychic abilities. I wouldn't be able to affect the storm; it threatened much too large an area. Perhaps I could visualize it and learn its path, though. I finished taking in my surroundings so I could stop thinking about them, and closed my eyes.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Realizing my heart was racing, I breathed in slowly and shakily a few times. In a few moments, my muscles relaxed and I calmed down a little. I focused completely on my emotions, blocked out sounds of the storm, and let go of the fear. I needed to be calm, not anxious, to use my abilities. I relaxed.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I reached gently high into the clouds until I could look down on them from above. Then I stretched out, gradually farther, until I felt the edges of the storm in all four directions. I slid inside the storm, flowing through it like honey, mixing my essence with it until we melded.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As the storm cloud engulfed me, my heart raced. I realized there was too much information; it would overwhelm me. I needed to simplify my perceptions, to understand any of it.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I chose a simple way to see the shape of the cloud. It should show up like a weather map, but in shades of gray. Once I had decided how to handle the information, I reopened myself to the cloud. This time the information was comfortable, even easy, to understand. I wasn't scared anymore, and felt that I could understand the storm's patterns.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A weather map with the storm cloud perching above it appeared in my mind. It had eight arms, spinning slightly. It reminded me of a squid or a spinning star. I focused on each arm in turn, noting its location and intensity, studying it with the calm interest of a scientist. I looked closely for the arm near us, and examined each finger and strand floating off of it. Satisfied, I anchored a part of myself in the cloud, brought the rest back to Earth, and opened my eyes.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I must not have taken more than fifteen or twenty seconds, because my mother hadn't even noticed my eyes closed. She was looking out the window at the storm, wondering what to do.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Ok... I checked on the storm psychically. I don't know how reliable my information will be, but then, it can't be any worse than guessing." I explained the shape, size, and intensity of the cloud to her. I could probably identify bursts before we drove into them. She must have trusted my information more than I did, because she decided to go ahead and travel the next time the rain let up.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">We drove somewhat nervously through light rain for the remaining four hours of the trip, adjusting speed to avoid bursts ahead of us. Although we heard many reports of flash floods on the radio, we had no more trouble ourselves and made it home at 9:50 PM.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">At 10:00, we turned on the television for the weather. The Doppler radar showed exactly the size and shape storm I had described, with the same number of arms. Although I usually believed my skills, I still jumped with surprise that night in 1993, when the image matched exactly.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If we had left the restaurant any earlier, we would have traveled inside the arm. If we had left later, the next arm would have caught us. We had managed to travel with the lightest section of the storm. As the news reporter described all the accidents from the storm, I realized that my abilities might have saved my life.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">This game combines empathy, telepathy, and remote viewing, since it's difficult to separate them. The goal is for the receiver to accurately describe a picture that the sender is looking at.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">One person is the sender, and chooses a fairly complex picture out of a book, magazine, art collection, web page, etc. The picture should include at least four objects, and it is best if it also has emotional impact. The sender says, "Ready," and then both the sender and receiver are quiet until the receiver is done.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The receiver writes down any objects or descriptions he or she receives, and draws a simple sketch of their arrangement in the picture. Crayons, colored pencils, markers, or pens can be used. If the receiver is very young and hasn't learned to read/write yet, just draw pictures and be ready to describe what each item is.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">After the receiver has drawn the picture and is done receiving, get together and compare pictures. Discuss how well they match or are different, and how both people felt as they practiced. You might be surprised at the similarities!</P>

Then create it as you go.</P></FONT>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After someone has chosen and created an astral place, the group arrives and starts to explore. Each person should describe what he or she sees, aloud to the group. It may take some practice to stay in projection, while talking physically, but it is certainly possible. Explore and have fun discussing as long as everyone is comfortable and not too tired. This is usually easiest if everyone keeps his or her eyes closed.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">This game is the same as normal hide-and-seek, with everyone hiding and one person finding them. The difference is that psychic perceptions are encouraged. It uses aura vision to watch for hidden people, and telepathy and remote viewing to try to locate people. Anyone hiding will need to either shield very strongly, or shutdown, to be harder to find.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">For a more advanced version, each person who is found helps look for other people. The person who stayed hidden the longest is the seeker next time.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P><A NAME="_Toc472931507"><A NAME="_Toc457970581"><A NAME="_Toc457970255"><A NAME="_Toc457894832"><A NAME="_Toc457892958"><A NAME="_Toc457892777"><A NAME="_Toc457811554"><A NAME="_Toc451336227">Teaching, for Teachers</A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892959"><A NAME="_Toc457892778"><A NAME="_Toc457811555">Responsibilities</A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Teaching psychic abilities requires strong confidence in your own skills, and knowing your strengths, weaknesses, and limits. Teaching can also be one of the best ways to become more confident.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A relaxed, consistent teacher inspires confidence in students, which makes it easier for them to succeed. A teacher encourages students to explore on their own and trust what they find. This way, the student will continue to use the abilities well even without the teacher nearby, and this reduces the long-term burden on the teacher.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The most common problem a teacher helps with is lack of self-confidence. Doubt will make students quit early, withhold information, and generally be uncooperative. Games can help overcome that, by distracting the students from their doubts long enough to get results. This is also why the basic skills start very gradually. The first skills are for building confidence.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892960"><A NAME="_Toc457892779">Experimentation and Confidence</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Scientific experimentation too early reduces confidence and cause performance pressure. Instead, play games and practice without counting results. After the student has several months of experience, then controlled experiments can be done. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If the student has trouble with feeling pressured then, practice for many more months (or years) before controlling things. You wouldn't put a 16-year-old, inexperienced driver into a rush hour traffic obstacle course. You also can't expect an inexperienced psychic student to perform under high pressure.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Young children are sometimes the best to work with, because they are extremely open to learning and play easily. Invent games appropriate to the age of the children. Play them only as long as they are interesting and entertaining. Remember, too, that nobody is too old to learn.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892961"><A NAME="_Toc457892780"><A NAME="_Toc457811556">Traditions and Methods</A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">There are many different traditions for teaching psychic abilities. If a tradition works and you like it, use it. It's usually to your advantage to research a few other traditions and see how some things are done differently. You may find something useful. Various religions have different approaches, and there are also many methods that don't use religion at all.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">One requirement, though, is that the student and teacher need to be working with cooperative methods. They don't need to be the same, but they need to agree on some basics. Discuss spiritual or religious beliefs early. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Decide whether you will use a primarily mental approach, or a primarily ritual approach, or a combination of both. Decide on a mood that works well for both of you. Be ready to resolve disagreements in your perceptions. One or both of you might be wrong, or you may both be right but from different perspectives.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Determine how much responsibility is on the teacher for providing course material and direction, and how much is on the student. It doesn't matter which person has more, as long as you both agree to do it one way. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Will you follow a predetermined order of skills? Or, will you follow the student's interest and enthusiasm? Do certain skills need to be learned first before others can be attempted? How much feedback will the teacher give on each student's progress? Is it the student's responsibility to measure his or her own progress?</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Whatever traditions and methods you choose to use, be sure you agree on them or find a compromise to which you can both agree.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892962"><A NAME="_Toc457892781"><A NAME="_Toc457811557">Aura Interactions</A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">As you work with students, your energy and aura will affect theirs very strongly. Grounding, centering, and keeping your energy stable and clean are helpful. Your energy and psychic skill use will raise your students to a higher energy level and awareness. The more active you are around them, the faster their skills will develop.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">To some extent, this is very good; you're providing stimulus to a sense they are learning to use. However, it can be overwhelming for some students. You may need to lower your energy level, shield carefully and gently, and project less energy, to avoid flooding a few of the students. Your energy is many times stronger than theirs is, and so your control also needs to be stronger and more careful.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some students appreciate an occasional flood of energy; it helps them feel connected to you and confident of the link. It will tend to cause headaches and shield failure, though, so be aware of when you are doing it.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You have the capability of, literally, forcing the student's energy and aura to shift very significantly. This can be a great help in lifting the student past a difficulty or explaining and showing a new skill. It can also be misused and cause the student pain or more difficulty. The student has opened up to you as a teacher, with trust that you will be helpful. If you are instead hurtful, he or she will eventually shield you out and leave, and you'll both be prevented from a useful learning experience.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">On some skills, such as shielding and astral projection, psychic sparring or wrestling with energy can be fun. As long as the people involved agree and understand, it's a good workout. If they don't know ahead of time, they may perceive it as a real attack.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The teacher can also observe and influence the aura interactions between students. This can help strengthen a practice session with an empathic or telepathic link. It can magnify the strength of an energy effect, or add a stabilizing ground and center. It can also cut off a link or lower energy levels.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892963"><A NAME="_Toc457892782"><A NAME="_Toc457811558">Working With a Group</A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Working with a group is very similar to working with an individual. Mostly, it takes more time and attention.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Keeping a stable mood is very important. As long as everyone is cooperating, and the mood is set, things will generally go well. If one or a few students are interfering with the mood, goofing off when it's not appropriate, or disturbing other students, remind them of the purpose of the meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">They are present to practice and discuss psychic abilities in a fun but serious context, and if they aren't interested they can simply leave. If they persist, tell each one, "You are interfering with the group. Will you be quiet and participate, or would you rather leave? Choose now." Don't be afraid to kick them out if necessary; you're in charge.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Encourage people to talk with each other, and let them answer each other's questions. Only offer information if no one else understands what's going on. Obviously, this is different when you first present a new skill. But once practice has started, let the students work with it and figure it out. Be patient. Some of them may

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can choose to use your energy and skills to help them past difficulties, or you can encourage them to confront the problems by themselves. You can choose to set the mood, or you can ask a particular student to set up a room ahead of time to help everyone settle (candles, music, pillows, whatever).</P>
