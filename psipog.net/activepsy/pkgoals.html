<H4>Standard Deviations</H4>

<P>When the RetroPsychoKinesis experiment ends, it will give you a final
score. There are several numbers shown; the "standard deviations" is what
you want to look at. Here are some possible scores and what they mean.</P>

<TR><TD>1.28</TD><TD>Neat! Only a 10% chance that your results are coincidence...</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1.64</TD><TD>Great job! Only a 5% chance it's coincidence... (Nearly proven!)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>2.32</TD><TD>Wow! Only a 1% chance of coincidence... (Probably proven!)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>3.09</TD><TD>Incredible! Only a 0.1% chance of coincidence. (Most definitely proof!)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>3.72</TD><TD>Outstanding! Only a 0.01% chance of coincidence! (Most definitely proof!)</TD></TR>

<H4>Details</H4>

<P>These numbers are a measure of how much chance there is that your
results are due to coincidence versus psychokinesis. It can also
be called a z-score.</P>

<P>Most scientific
areas consider the 5% level to be proof that something is happening.
Parapsychology has restricted it to 1% to be very sure. Thus, if you
get a total z-score of 1.64 or above, you're are almost certainly 
affecting it. If you are above 2.32 your results are quite impressive.
It's to your advantage to do a lot of experiments, because then the
small effects you have add up and are easier to see. It's also more
scientifically impressive to have a lot of high scores instead of
just one here or there.</P>

<P>The number might have a minus sign (-) in front of it. That means
it went the opposite direction from what you intended. Still, a large
number is meaningful.</P>

<P>The most meaningful score is your total z-score over many experiments.
Enter the same email address for many attempts. Then have it show you
your results. At the very bottom will be a total z-score. That is the
best to judge against because it takes all your tries into account.</P>
