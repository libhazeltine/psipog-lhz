<H1>About the Author</H1>

<H3>Skywind</H3>

<P>I have been working with psychic abilities
consciously since age 3.  I have been teaching the abilities in person
and over the net since I was 14 years old, and I'm now 24.</P>

<P>I moved the psychic site off of my personal web pages and onto
www.tadma.net because the site hosting my personal pages has had
a lot of net trouble.  So, for speed and easier updates,
I moved it.  My personal web pages are still there just as before;
only the psychic section has moved.</P>

<P>You may also want to visit my personal pages, <A
