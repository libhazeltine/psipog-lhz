<P><B>June 17, 2002:</B> Skywind started this site in 1993.  I stumbled upon
it in 1999 and quickly started practicing the exercises presented.  Skywind's
teaching philosophy has helped countless people, and it's an honor to archive
this resource on the PsiPog server (which wouldn't have existed without her,
by the way).  I hope others will find her teachings as exciting and helpful as
I did.
<P>
With that said, here's the material.  I changed the formatting of some
pages, but the content is still 100% the same.  All material is copyright and
written by Skywind.  Comments/edits from me are clearly marked and in italics.
The interactive parts of the site still work, so feel free to use them.
