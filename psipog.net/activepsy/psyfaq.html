<H1>FAQ on Psychic Abilities and Astral Projection</H1>

<P>When I receive email about psychic abilities, astral projection, and
related things, I tend to get a lot of the same questions from many
people: frequently asked questions.  To reduce the number of emails
I have to answer on simple questions, I have written up this list.  </P>

<A NAME="z"><P><B>How do I know that all of this is actually real?</B></A></P>

<P>Try it.  Or, pick up some books on parapsychology experiments, and
read through the data and results.</P>

<A NAME="a"><P><B>Will you teach me psychic abilities?</B></P></A>
<P>I will teach anyone who wants to learn.</P>

<P>Before I begin teaching, though, I ask that you research an ability
yourself.  Read through my pages, and choose an ability you want to
learn.  Do as much as you can to learn the ability yourself.  If you
have trouble, then email me describing what you tried, and what didn't
work.  I will reply as soon as I have time, and I will try to help you
get through the problem.  Then you will continue to practice and learn
on your own.  I will always do what I can to help you through a problem,
but the only way you will improve is to use the abilities yourself.</P>

<A NAME="ww"><P><B>I just tried something psychic.  Did I do it right?</B></A></P>

<P>I don't know.  I wasn't watching.</P>

<P>Only you can judge your progress.  Did it feel right?  Did you
notice any effects?  Did it work?</P>


<A NAME="y"><P><B>How do you teach over the Internet?</B></P></A>
<P>I discuss through email, over IRC, or through whatever other methods
are available for communication.  All it takes is discussion to get
someone's questions answered.</P>

<A NAME="t"><P><B>Can you teach me telekinesis, levitation, or
teleportation?</B></P>

<P>No.</P>

<P>There is a section in Playful Psychic about it.  Work with it
yourself and experiment, try things out, and let me know if you find an
especially good or especially fun method of practicing.</P>

<A NAME="b"><P><B>How can I get better at psychic abilities?</B></P></A>

<P>Practice.</P>

<P>The only way to improve skills is to use them.  You will make some
mistakes, and probably have some difficulties.  This is quite normal.
Find as many ways as possible to use your new abilities in daily life.
Choose fun ways, because then you won't have to work at motivating
yourself.  This will improve your abilities the quickest.</P>

<A NAME="w"><P><B> If I wasn't naturally gifted with these abilities,
can I still learn them without devoting my entire life to
them?</B></P></A>

<P>Of course.</P>

<P>Humans aren't born knowing how to play baseball or swim at an Olympic
level.  You also don't have to be an Olympic gymnast to turn summersaults
in your back yard.  Psychic skills are just like any other; you have
certain natural abilities just by being human, and with practice, you can
fine tune them to make them more useful.</P>

<P>It doesn't matter what age you learn at, or whether you've had
previous experience; everyone has a first time.  And then you have a
second time, and a third time, and if you keep practicing, eventually
you do have experience, and you do have skills.</P>

<A NAME="c"><P><B>Can anyone learn psychic skills?</B></P></A>

<P>Yes.</P>

<P>Age doesn't matter, experience doesn't matter; the only thing that
matters is motivation to try.  If you don't have any motivation to
really learn them, you won't; but if you are interested and you
keep practicing and trying, you will eventually learn some abilities.
Some people are born with abilities, and they often have an easier
time increasing their skills.  However, anyone can learn.</P>


<A NAME="d"><P><B>How long will it take me to learn an ability?</B></P></A>

<P>It takes however long it takes.  Some people pick up an ability the
first time they try, and other people take months of practice.  Some
people can learn certain skills quickly, but can't learn other skills.
Everyone can learn something, if they try.  Generally, a skill is
quicker and easier to learn if you already know a skill similar to it.
Practicing and having fun with the ability daily also helps greatly.</P>

<A NAME="p"><P><B>Should I be able to see a psiball?</B></P></A>

<P>Probably not.</P>

<P>Some people, after a lot of practice, can actually see the psiballs
they make, like a slight clear waviness in the air (kind of like a heat
wave).  Most people will only feel them though.  I can not give any
exact amount of practice, time, or energy that will let you see an
energy ball.  Most likely, if you do see it, it will happen when you
aren't even trying to; it requires that you be relaxed and comfortable
with what you are doing.  I didn't see a psiball for over 3 years
after I started making them; when I did, it was an accident.  There is
little that's useful about seeing them; as long as you can feel them,
you are doing fine.</P>

<A NAME="x"><P><B>How do I know that what I just made was really a
psiball?</B></P></A>

<P>If you can feel it in any way, or see it in any way, or both, then it's
a psiball.</P>

<P>Don't worry if the sensations don't <I>exactly</I> match what is
described in the book.  As long as you have some kind of sensation, that
happens when you try to direct energy there, you've succeeded.  Don't
email me asking, "Did I really do it?"  I wasn't there to watch you; you
have to trust your own perceptions of energy.</P>

<A NAME="e"><P><B>Can you recommend a teacher in my area?</B></P></A>

<P>No.</P>

<P>Almost all of my psychic correspondence occurs through email and
IRC (internet relay chat).  I do not know where people are from.
I also do not keep any list of psychic organizations.</P>

<P>I have written a web-based database that lets people
enter information about their psychic interests and their real life
locations. </P>

<A NAME="f"><P><B>Is astral projection safe?</B></P></A>

<P>Yes.</P>

<P>The only "real" danger is your own fears.  Emotions take the shape of
what they represent to you, and so if you are scared, you will see your
own fear.  If you approach it without fear, just with the curiosity of
a child, you will not find anything fearful there.  If you still have
trouble projecting, because you are afraid, research the area more so
you have a better understanding of it.  This will make it less unknown
and less scary.</P>


<A NAME="g"><P><B>Will using psychic abilities send me to Hell?</B></P></A>

<P>That depends on how you use them.</P>

<P>Psychic abilities, like any other skill, are not inherently bad or
good.  The Bible has many stories of good prophets, who helped God
bring about changes on Earth.  It also has stories of people who
used similar abilities for bad reasons.  It is not the skill itself,
but the way it is used and the purpose, that matter ethically.  As
you put such skills to use, consider whether it is an ethical thing
you want to do, if you didn't use psychic abilities to do it.  That will
help you decide what is ethical use of the abilities and what isn't.</P>

<A NAME="h"><P><B>Are astral projections, out of body experience, and
lucid dreams the same thing?</B></P></A>

<P>Probably not, but I have no research to prove anything.</P>

<P>There are many theories on this topic.  I define astral projection as
any method of seeing and interacting with the astral plane; this includes
out of body travel, but it also includes many other methods too.  If
astral projection or out of body experiences are a dream state, then
they are a particular subset that includes psychic perceptions.</P>

<A NAME="oob"><P><B>Can you help me leave my body?</B></P></A>

<P>No.</P>

<P>Astral projection and out of body travel are not quite the same thing
(see above question).  I can teach astral projection, but I can not teach
out of body travel.  It's not an area I have control of in myself yet,
and so I don't understand it well enough to teach it.  Read Practical
Psychic.</P>

<A NAME="i"><P><B>Is astral projection real? Can I meet other real people with
it?</B></P></A>

<P>Yes.</P>

<P>I have experimented with astral projection, with many people in
regular life and over IRC.  During these experiments, I have had a
very high success rate of accurate perceptions, both when I project
to another person, and when another person projects to me.  Both
people do see most of the same things, and have very similar accounts
of the experience.</P>

<A NAME="p"><P><B>Do you have proof of psychic abilities?</B></P></A>

<P>Yes.</P>

<P>I have given a few readings over irc to people.  A few of those
people gave me permission to put the conversation logs on my web pages.
They were lost in the move, but I will try to get them back online
reasonably soon.</P>


<A NAME="order"><P><B>Is there any special order I should learn the
abilities in?</B></P></A>

<P>No.</P>

<P>There is <B>no particular order</B> you are required to learn skills
in.  However, you may find it easiest to start with psiballs if you have
no prior experience with these areas.  They help with your confidence
level, which may make a big difference in how well you learn other
skills.</P>

<P>Regardless of the order you choose to do things, please read the
Study Techniques section of the introduction to Playful Psychic before
emailing me for help.  Most problems about how to learn will be solved
there.</P>

<A NAME="isitpsychic"><P><B>How can I tell if an experience is
psychic?</B></P></A>

<P>There is a section in the Study Techniques about
how to tell if an experience is psychic</A>.  This will save you the
effort of asking me through email "was my experience psychic."</P>
