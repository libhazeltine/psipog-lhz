<P>This page is a collection of links and articles regarding the CIA
experiments with remote viewing.</P>

<P>The experiments are fairly well documented in the public view since
1995 when they were released for studying. The CIA maintains that
while the experiments did prove better than chance accuracy, they have
not been used to guide intelligence operations.</P>

<P>The articles here include the original publication to the Journal
of Parapsychology, as well as several researchers' responses and
criticisms. The articles are somewhat technical; because of this, I'm
giving a quick summary of the key points under each link.</P>

<LI><A HREF="http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~utts">Jessica Utts'</A> home page.<BR>
She was one of the scholars asked to study the data once it was released
by the CIA. She has high degrees in math and psychology.

<LI><A HREF="http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~utts/air2.html">An Assessment of
the Evidence for Psychic Functioning</A> (1995, Utts)<BR>
The original report published.
This discusses 1) whether psychic ability exists, and 2) whether it's
useful to the government.  "Using the standards applied to any other area 
of science, it is concluded that psychic functioning has been well 
established."

HREF="http://www.mceagle.com/remote-viewing/refs/science/air/hyman.html">Evaluation
of Program on Anomalous Mental Phenomena</A> (Sept 11, 1995, Hyman)<BR>
Discusses the task of
evaluating the CIA data, and the points where the scholars evaluating
it disagreed. "Although [the experimental model might not be complete], 
I tend to agree with Professor Utts that real effects are occurring in
these experiments.  Something other than chance departures from the 
null hypothesis has occurred in these experiments."

<LI><A HREF="http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~utts/response.html">Response to Ray
Hyman's Report</A> (Sept 15, 1995, Utts)<BR>
Discusses the amount of research done, funding available, reasoning
regarding concluding an effect, the predictability of effects.

<LI><A HREF="http://www.lfr.org/csl/media/air_mayresponse.shtml">A
Commentary</A> (March 1996, May)<BR>
Discusses the political environment around the studies, and artificial 
limitations imposed by the CIA on the researchers, which probably 
influenced the outcomes.

<LI><A HREF="http://www.lfr.org/csl/practical/ops_2.shtml">Examples of
Operational Anomalous Cognition</A><BR>
This is a selected list of examples from the Cognitive Sciences Laboratory
showing actual remote viewing attempts and results. It includes
photos and drawings to compare for accuracy.
