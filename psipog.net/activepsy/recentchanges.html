<P><I>We moved Active Psy to the PsiPog server.  Thanks for everything
Skywind :-)<P>-Peebrain</I><P>


<H3>Sep 3, 2001</H3>

<P>I'm happy to see that people are enjoying the new PsyPix game...
in 9 days there have been over 700 games played already. Wow! I did
fix a couple bugs with how scores showed for the game (it was ranking 
in reverse order).  It should be a bit better behaved now.</P>

<P>Within the next few days I may make thumbnail
pictures for all the targets, since viewing an individual's 200+ 
played games is taking a large bit of bandwidth.  Dropping to thunbnails
where appropriate should help that. (I would have done it before, but
I had no idea that it would be this popular this fast!)</P>

<P>Anyhow, enjoy playing!</P>

<P>Version 2 of Telepathy Practice released!</P>

<P>Try out the new PsyPix online telepathy practice game. You 
can even play it alone now! This version will let you create an
actual account and keeps your statistics over time. Give me 
feedback in the guestbook or by email if you love it, hate it,
or find errors.  Thanks!</P>

<H3>Aug 25, 2001</H3>

<P>I fixed the teacher/student database 'update' portion. It
was supposed to be emailing me the updates people requested,
and it didn't actually send an email.  It does now.
I also improved the interface a little bit.</P>

<P>I'm working on a new version of the telepathy practice
game, which will include a feature for single-person play
(clairvoyance rather than telepathy).  I hope to have it
finished and live by mid September 2001.</P>

<H3>Feb 25, 2001</H3>

<P>I repaired the telepathy cgi... archived guestbook comments
into their proper months.  Appreciated all of you, even though
I don't have time to help individuals (sorry).</P>

<P>Yes, my email address is missing on purpose.  Someday I may have 
time to help again, but for now, I leave the site information and the 
other readers to help you out. </P>

<P>Just a reminder, the teacher/student database contains over
800 people now. I'm sure you can find someone in there who
would enjoy discussing things with you!</P>


<H3>Nov 8, 2000</H3>

<P>Inspired by my recent explorations into photography and
digital art, I'm working on a redesign of my web sites. Hence
the background change for consistency with my personal web
pages, and more changes to come in the following days.</P>

<H3>Apr 12, 2000</H3>

<P>Moved a bunch of the science stuff into its own page, under research.
Moved links pages around a bit and got rid of dead links. Am working
on articles related to current psychic research, which will show up
eventually. Added quite a few links about the CIA remote viewing
experiments and publically released studies (check under science
and parapsychology).</P>

<P>Also fixed the teacher/student finder. THANK YOU to those of
you who pointed out that it was broken.</P>

<H3>Jan 19, 2000</H3>

<P>Updated Playful Psychic. The preparation section is shorter and
better organized. The other sections are slightly rearranged. I'm
working on writing a teacher's guide.</P>

<H3>Nov 7, 2000</H3>

<P>Fixed the teacher/student database and the guestbook.  They were
suffering from similar problems. They're better now.</P>

<H3>Sept 26, 2000</H3>

<P>Added a link about the CIA remote viewing experiments, to the
Journal of Parapsychology. It's in the science organizations section.</P>

<H3>August 12, 2000</H3>

<P>Fixed my guestbook by moving it to this server. Fixed its background
too. It should work again now. Also reorganized the look of the front page
a little bit, for more obvious navigation.</P>

<H3>August 10, 2000</H3>

<P>Updated the copy of Playful Psychic online. It's now downloadable as
one big file. You can curse Microsoft for the sloppy html; but I didn't
want to re-edit the html by hand for the entire book. There's a useful
new section in the appendix on statistics.</P>

<H3>July 9, 2000</H3>

<P>Added forums. I decided to use Delphi forums because I'm familiar with
them, and Delphi does all the hard work of keeping them up. You can read
it all without logging in. If you want to post, they require you to log
in.</P>

<P>Also rearranged the front page for easier fitting on screen and
navigating.</P>


<H3>July 8, 2000</H3>

<P>Fixed the guestbook. I wish someone would have told me it was
broken.</P>

<P>Astral Tours might reappear in the future; our idea needed a major
overhaul.</P>

<P>Edited the intro and practice month 2. Dodging the storm story
moved to practical uses in month 2; intro rewritten to be more playful
for the title.</P>

<H3>June 21, 2000</H3>

<P>I added the recent changes file today.</P>

<P>I renamed the Practical Psychic book to "Playful Psychic" because I
discovered there's already a published Practical Psychic.  (Oops!) I
fiddled with the telepathy program so that old sessions get deleted
properly after an appropriate number of days.</P>

<P>I added a java applet chat client so people can talk with each
other. This connects to efnet irc, but that doesn't really matter
except to those of us who irc anyway. Just pick a nickname
and talk.</P>
