<P ALIGN="LEFT">Belief is a requirement for learning psychic abilities. If you believed touch typing was impossible, and so you wouldn't even put your hands on the keyboard, you wouldn't be able to learn it. Well-informed belief is best. Read research, case studies, stories, and if possible talk with people. Learn about the psychic abilities that have already been studied, proven, and understood.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As you research, you will be more enthusiastic and interested in practicing. You will trust yourself more. This keeps you more relaxed and make practicing easier. It improves your concentration, your focus, and your accuracy.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This chapter contains worksheets to help you understand your beliefs and become comfortable with psychic abilities. Consider each question carefully, and notice your reactions. The first worksheet, just below, is to help you recognize your past experiences. Your experiences shape your expectations and influence your beliefs and knowledge.</P></FONT>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Critical analysis and doubt have their place—that is, laboratories, not classrooms. Skepticism is not specifically disbelief. It means uncertainty: "Skeptic, n.: One who is yet undecided as to what is true; one who is looking or inquiring for what is true; an inquirer after facts or reasons." (Webster’s Dictionary) Taking a realistic view in experiments is useful. Uneducated disbelief is not useful. Fanatical disbelief is as illogical as fanatical belief. Experiments are meant for learning what is true. A person can’t learn the truth if he or she has already decided what that ‘truth’ must be.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">However, new skills practice is not the time for experiments. The skills must be learned before they can be tested in a controlled situation. If a person were testing to prove whether any human could type 80 words per minute, he or she wouldn’t start with people who couldn’t type at all. Choosing people who had been typing for many years and already typed quickly would be wiser. Similarly, it makes no sense to try to prove psychic abilities in people who have not practiced with them. People need to learn first, and then they can test the skills later.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">If you have some fears about learning psychic abilities, you’re not alone. Most people are nervous, doubtful, or outright scared when they first consider learning the abilities. Spend some time understanding those feelings and discovering which ones are unreasonable.</P></FONT>

Some examples are given here for the fears listed in the worksheet. If you have a fear that’s not in the list, research it. Decide whether it’s realistic and useful to keep, or whether you want to challenge it.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychic abilities don't really exist. People can't really do that. </P>
</I><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychic abilities do exist, and have been proven scientifically. This isn't fiction or fantasy; it's here and now, in this world. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="LEFT">Even if psychic abilities do exist, only a few people have them. I'm not special. I can't possibly do it. </P>
</I><P ALIGN="LEFT">No correlation has been found between psychic abilities and anything else yet. Anyone could have the ability, and quite possibly, everyone does. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychic abilities are just too weird. I can't think about that. </P>
</I><P ALIGN="LEFT">Why are they weird? They’ve been a normal part of being human for thousands of years. We've just ignored them out of fear of the unknown. If we learn about them, then they become known and normal, and they aren't scary or weird.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="LEFT">If psychic abilities existed, I would have to change my beliefs about the world, and my stability would fall apart. </P>
</I><P ALIGN="LEFT">Changing one belief, or even several, won't shake me to pieces. Disbelieving is superstitious. Psychic abilities have existed at least as long as humans have, and the world is fine. Accepting reality won't hurt me. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="LEFT">If I try to gain psychic abilities, I might lose control of them and hurt someone. </P>
</I><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychic abilities can only be gained a little at a time. I can stop at any point and wait until I feel okay about it before moving on. They are within me to control. Just like I control my daily reactions to people, I would be controlling psychic abilities. I’m no more dangerous than I would otherwise be.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="LEFT">I don't like who I would be if I could use psychic abilities.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="LEFT">I would still be myself. Who I am is not determined by what I can do. I would be the same person I am today, and the same person I've always been. I would just have a new skill to play around with, and use in the ways that I feel are appropriate and right.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychic abilities are scary. </P>
</I><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychic abilities are only scary because I haven't learned enough about them. Any ability I gain is within my power to control, and since I am in control of it, it can't do things I don't want it to. It wouldn't be scary if I let myself learn more about it and consider it okay.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="LEFT">Meditating and the feelings I get using the abilities are too deep; I’m scared I might lose control of myself.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="LEFT">I can stop at any time. My mind and body are under my control. They can’t do anything I don’t let them do. I let go of control every night when I sleep, and I don’t have any problems then. If I go too deep into a trance, I’ll just fall asleep. No spirit can affect my body without my permission. I am totally safe, because my subconscious keeps protection around me at all times.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">When you’ve challenged the fears, and you’ve started learning psychic abilities, there are many new feelings you may encounter. Although they feel unfamiliar, they are still safe.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As you fall asleep, or as you start to go out of body, you may feel for a moment like you are falling. This is a common feeling that is the result of your mind relaxing and letting go. Many people experience this feeling. It may interrupt your concentration, but it has no other effects.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Meditation can also feel different. It may feel like a deep daydream. Your body may feel like it’s buzzing once you relax physically. This is due to your blood flow increasing, just like it would after exercise. It’s a normal part of relaxation. Your body temperature may go down a little, making you cold. This, also, is a normal part of relaxing. Take a blanket if you tend to get cold.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As you practice any abilities, you may notice feelings in your head and forehead. This is because you are concentrating on those areas when you use the abilities. Relax, massage your face a little, and the feelings should be gentle. If your head hurts, you’re probably tensing your muscles and giving yourself a headache. Relax and take a break, and then try again without getting tense.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Trusting your feelings and avoiding fear takes time. Repeat the challenge statements every time you notice disbelief or fears. You must convince yourself that you have as good a chance as anyone at learning the abilities, and that it is possible to learn them. You are just as good as anyone else. Practice, practice, and keep practicing. Stay enthusiastic and relaxed, and you’ll make fast progress.</P>

Much more is possible than you may have previously believed. Religious beliefs will influence your skill development. If you believe most of the skills are evil or wrong, you generally won’t want to learn them, or may have trouble with them.

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc440452221"></A>Ethics</A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">As with any skill, you will want to consider the ethics of psychic ability use. Psychic skills can be used in a variety of ways, almost invisibly to the general world. Psychic skills are not good or bad, just as any type of skill can not by itself be good or bad. Certain uses of the skill can have good or bad consequences, however. The question I consider when determining the ethics of a situation is, "Would this be ethical to do, if I used a non- psychic method to achieve it?"</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, that question does not give a clear answer in all cases. You will need to decide for yourself if what you choose to do is appropriate to your beliefs. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Aura vision helps healing abilities, empathic understanding, and deeper spiritual caring. It leads to a deeper understanding of human actions and relationships. Telepathy, empathy, clairvoyance, and other information skills help you understand events, relationships, and human life. A healer can help people accept and love each other, work out difficulties, and solve difficult interactions in creative and helpful ways. The abilities also simplify everyday life by giving you extra information, which helps you make wiser decisions.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892795"><A NAME="_Toc457892614"><A NAME="_Toc440642514"><A NAME="_Toc440640829"><A NAME="_Toc440452222">Belief Systems</A></A></A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">When you begin psychic skill development, your first few experiences will probably change your beliefs. A world that seemed stable, measurable, and known, suddenly has mysteries at every step. Your beliefs, habits, and interests may all change suddenly. Your restrictive beliefs fall apart, and beliefs that are more realistic replace them.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Experiences that shake up your ideas can certainly be scary at first. That doesn't mean they’re dangerous. Learning the truth is useful, and there’s no need to fear it. Trust the change without feeling threatened. Your new abilities are simply giving you extra information.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Sometimes this feels like being a toddler, just beginning to explore a vast world of new things. You will need something stable and safe to return to after a bit of exploring. Choose a special place or routine to return to each day. Lighting a candle to relax for a few minutes each night is one routine. Familiarity provides security, safety, and relaxation after a very intense period of learning.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Your perceptions will change along with your beliefs. Energy flows, emotional relationships, and spiritual interactions between people appear much more visibly. Humanity and philosophy may become more important. Astral projection and out-of-body experiences sometimes accompany this. You may have more interest in spiritual values and ethics. You’ll also continue to gain perceptive abilities.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some of this may be uncomfortable because it’s unfamiliar. You can work through those discomforts once you realize you have them. The worksheet below will help you identify your comfort zone. You may have trouble learning abilities related to uncomfortable or scary experiences. Once you know what scares you, consider whether it’s realistic, and challenge any unrealistic fears.</P></FONT>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You may find that after a period of practice, you develop several new skills at once. Then you have some time to work with them and gain comfort before another set of skills begins to develop. Skills tend to develop in waves. Practice will improve your psychic interactions, auras, and perception of events at a distance.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As you perceive and work with the psychic energy around you, you will have an increasingly strong effect on people. They will notice and consider more seriously the things you do. You may re-evaluate your beliefs to make decisions on your interactions with other people. You may reconsider your place in learning from and teaching.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Many students know they want to learn, but they aren't sure where to start or what interests them. Psychic abilities are quite varied, but fit into two basic categories, perceptive and alteration.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc440453121">Perceptive</A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The most common type of psychic ability is perception of information. Empathy, telepathy, precognition, remote viewing, aura sight, seeing ghosts, knowing about illness or injury before it happens, reading cards, telling fortunes, recognizing disease, perceiving energy, and predicting dice rolls are all perceptive abilities. Many people have experienced these abilities at least once, but may not talk about them for fear of ridicule.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc440453122">Alteration</A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The other type of ability is alteration: abilities that directly cause a change in the world. Telekinesis, levitation, healing, telepathic commands, empathic projection, teleportation, helping or hurting a plant's or animal's growth, and directing energy are alteration or projection abilities. Fewer people experience these, but the abilities are still somewhat common.</P></FONT>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Everyone prefers one sense out of sight, hearing, touch/feeling/emotion, and intuition. When you receive information psychically, your perceive it through your favorite sense.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you are a visual person, you will receive mostly images. If you understand more easily through hearing, you will hear voices or words telling you the information. If you learn more through touch, you will feel yourself in the situation. You may also be an intuitive person who simply knows the information without it taking any specific form.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Regardless of your strength, you will probably receive some information in every form, so be open to all of it. You will receive information best when you open all psychic senses.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892811"><A NAME="_Toc457892630"><A NAME="_Toc440642681"><A NAME="_Toc440642039"><A NAME="_Toc440448129">Recognizing Each</A></A></A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Visual people prefer a variety of sights and colors. They prefer pictures full of meaning, written directions and maps rather than verbal instructions. Visual people say "show me" rather than "tell me." They are able to imagine vivid pictures and scenes. They may imagine colors and pictures when listening to music. They also read books by picturing scenes more than by hearing the words in their heads.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Audio people are drawn to a variety of sounds. They consider music and speech important. An audio person asks to be "told" directions and may spend much time on the telephone. They can get more information from listening to someone talk than from reading about a topic. If they do read, they may whisper or hear the words in their heads as they read.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Touch people are drawn to textures, crafts, and other people. They enjoy working with their hands and are often very good at it. They may learn massage techniques or sports early in life. When reading, they may follow the line with a finger to keep their place. They care about temperature and textures. When they shop for clothes, they care most about the feeling of the cloth.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Emotional/empathic people do something because it feels right emotionally. They are able to sympathize very well with friends in any emotional situation. Friends who are not feeling well may depress them. Likewise, if they have friends who are feeling good, they will tend to feel good also. They understand others' situations by feeling those emotions themselves. Some emotional people are also touch people.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Intuitive people often act on impulse, doing something because they know it is right. Intuitive people know unquestionably that their choices are right, but may not be able to explain why. Their information appears as sudden inspiration, but it doesn't last long. They enjoy games of anticipation, because they have just enough knowledge of what is coming to do well in them.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">This book uses "picture" and "visualize," visual words, to describe imagination. If you are not a visual person, use mostly your own sense. Also, deeply involve as many senses as you can, so that the images are complete. That way if some of the information gets lost, there is still information left.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Learning any ability is a step by step process. Choose a skill, try it once, repeat until you are doing it properly, and then practice, practice, practice.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Practicing helps you remember how the skill feels. If you practice riding a bicycle, you learn how it feels to pedal, where your feet go, how to steer, and how to stop. Bicycling feels unfamiliar the first time, but after you do it many times, it gets easier. After a few weeks, you can get on a bike and ride down the road without thinking about how to steer.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychic abilities improve with practice just the same. You may feel awkward at first, paying attention to many details while you practice. With time, they will get easier. Learning a psychic ability involves remembering how it feels to use it. Once you know how it feels, you create that same feeling later to use the ability again.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892815"><A NAME="_Toc457892634"><A NAME="_Toc440642685"><A NAME="_Toc440642043"><A NAME="_Toc440448158">Make it Happen</A></A></A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The first step of learning a new psychic ability is the hardest: making it happen once. To remember what it feels like to use the ability, you have to use it once. Most abilities will occur instinctively in day to day life. You just have to watch for them, and notice when they happen.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Pay attention to subtle thoughts and gut feelings. If you feel you should take a different route to work or school, take it, even if you aren't sure why. If you get a vision of a speeding car as you near an intersection, wait a moment to see if one passes by. When you notice yourself worrying about someone, give him or her a phone call and ask how things are going. Respond to the intuitive thoughts you have. This encourages them to happen more often and encourages you to notice them sooner.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Read about the abilities you want to learn. Gather information on how they work. Notice when they happen, who uses them, and what effects they cause. Read experimental studies of them, especially any with successful results. Daydream about using them, and consider ways to practice them every day. What fun things would you use them for? Thinking about using them will encourage your subconscious abilities to show up more often.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As you think about the abilities and watch for them, you will begin to notice them occurring throughout your normal daily life. When they happen, notice your mood, surroundings, thoughts, feelings, and activities. Remember exactly how you felt just before they happened.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892816"><A NAME="_Toc457892635"><A NAME="_Toc440642686"><A NAME="_Toc440642044"><A NAME="_Toc440448159">On and Off</A></A></A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">After you have an ability occurring "randomly" throughout the day, you will want to learn more control. Start out by trying to make it happen on cue. Recall how you feel just before an ability happens. Try to feel exactly the same again. Don't try too hard; if you were relaxed the first time, you need to stay relaxed and calm again.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Learn to turn the ability on and off like a light switch. You may not yet be able to control it when it's on. Just practice turning it on and off. Become open to it happening, ready to receive intuition, or whatever the ability requires. The important part is being able to remember and cause the same feelings and thoughts. When you can turn on the ability a few times each week, without too much hard work, you're ready to learn more control.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892817"><A NAME="_Toc457892636"><A NAME="_Toc440642687"><A NAME="_Toc440642045"><A NAME="_Toc440448160">Direct Toward Goals</A></A></A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">You've found an ability, and you can turn it on and off. Now, you want to make it useful—direct it toward a particular goal. This can mean receiving psychic perceptions, causing something to occur, or whatever. Choose the goal you want. What is this ability to be used for? Just as you thought about the ability to turn it on and off, now think about and focus playfully on your goal. What do you want to have happen?</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Keep the same feelings you needed to turn on the ability. Stay in the same mood and same thoughts. Gently direct your thoughts to the goal. Visualize it as strongly as you can. Feel it, see it, hear it, touch it, smell it, taste it. Involve all of your senses, and focus on it. If you feel your mood change, guide it back to keeping the ability turned on.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you don't get results after a few minutes, stop, relax, and try again later. Results may not happen until you try many times. Sometimes you may find that as soon as you quit trying, it works. This means you were working too hard at it the first time. Stay relaxed and playful. If you aren't having fun, you aren't going to make progress!</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892818"><A NAME="_Toc457892637"><A NAME="_Toc440642688"><A NAME="_Toc440642046"><A NAME="_Toc440448161">Practice</A></A></A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Life is exciting—you made the ability work! You've gotten noticeable results once or twice, and you want more. Keep trying the same way you have been. Notice what works and what doesn't work. Where are your inaccuracies? Are some of your perceptions symbolic, instead of realistic? Do you consistently mistake a telephone pole for a pencil? How do you feel about the things you get right or wrong? You will probably feel some differences in your incorrect perceptions. Aim for what feels right, and remember carefully how it feels.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Don't judge your results while you are still trying to receive. This will usually cause incorrect results. Receive everything and, if necessary, write it down so you don't forget. Stay open to all the perceptions, no matter how strange they seem, until you are fully done (usually 2-10 minutes). Don't let yourself give up early; stay confident and enthusiastic, even if you think all of it is wrong. You may be surprised at the results.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Keep a journal of your perceptions. Any time you have a chance to confirm or disprove something you received, write it in. You'll learn more from your mistakes than from your successes. Your mistakes show you what to improve and help you learn how to do it. With practice, you may be able to receive details with about half or a little more of the details being totally correct. Sometimes they may all be completely correct.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Practice, practice, practice. Stay relaxed and have fun; find games to practice with daily. Use the skills every time you get a chance. If you can find an interested friend, talk about your experiences. No matter what, don't give up! I took nearly 20 years to learn one particular skill but I did eventually get it. Most skills will only take a few weeks or months, but even if they take longer, just keep trying. Practice and play!</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Seances, fortune tellers, and ouiji boards brings to mind dark rooms, candlelight, and a distinctly spooky mood. Telling ghost stories around a campfire brings up similar feelings. You may feel scared, excited, or paranoid after a few such stories. You may feel the world is magical and different for a few minutes.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Atmosphere and mood contribute to the experience. They direct your feelings and perceptions in a particular way, to enhance the story. A spooky mood may help or harm, depending on your intentions. Watch how mood affects your psychic perceptions, and learn how to use it to help get the results you want.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">When you are scared, you spook easily, jumping at the slightest sounds. Your heart races and everything that moves seems threatening. This is a normal reaction; it kept us alive centuries ago in the wilderness. It still helps us now to react to balls flying at us. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">However, your perceptions are sometimes inaccurate when you are scared. You perceive and react quickly, but your perceptions may not be correct. That creak wasn't the sound of an intruder; it was the house settling. That shadow wasn't a bat in the house; it was only a curtain flapping in front of a fan. The movement in the corner of your eye was your own reflection in a mirror. Because you are scared, the things you perceive will tend to be scary.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">For accuracy and concentration, you may want to avoid spooky settings when trying to use psychic abilities. You'll have enough doubts, fears, and new experiences to deal with. Once you are more experienced, you can use a spooky mood if you enjoy it. For now, if you get scared, your psychic abilities may perceive scary things. If you stay relaxed, you will tend to perceive more objectively. </P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Some moods are useful tools to enhance your psychic practice sessions. A relaxed, contemplative, quiet mood works best to begin with. It should feel slightly dreamy, or romantic like a plush room with candlelight. It will take you away from your daily worries. It will let you focus more completely on what you are practicing. Feeling a bit new and strange is okay; it'll help you focus as long as it doesn't worry you.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Choose a mood to create, and think about how to best create it for yourself. Do you want candles or dim lighting? Do you want a soothing bath first? Do you want special music? Will it be energetic and playful, or quiet and soothing? Choose a time when you can be alone for an hour, and decorate a room for your mood. Set up lighting, music, a fan, soft blankets, a bed sheet tent, or anything that will help the mood. Spend at least half an hour relaxing in it. Learn how it feels to be totally immersed in that mood. Let the world fall away, daydream, and enjoy.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Practice setting up moods for yourself before you practice any psychic abilities in them. They will help you feel secure and stable while you practice. If you feel best in the middle of a sunny field in July, the field is as good a place to relax as any other. Lighting level only matters in how relaxed you feel. Having practiced with various moods will help you be familiar with various states of relaxation. Familiarity helps you be comfortable and more confident, and confidence improves your ability to learn.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some moods to consider experimenting with are quiet, deep, trance-link, fluffy, light-headed, relaxed, contemplative, inquisitive, hypnotic, ritualistic, and playful. All of these can be used with other people involved, also. Cooperative, interested people will make the mood much more intense, if they are respectful rather than intrusive.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Recreational drugs are sometimes used to set a particular mood. They do not help people gain controlled use of psychic abilities, however. If they do open the abilities at all, they do so wildly and without giving the person time to learn proper control. They can cause terrifying experiences, without any of the long-term practice needed to understand what's going on.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you're already using such drugs, nothing I say will make a difference. However, don't start using them as a shortcut to psychic abilities. It would be like jumping off a cliff instead of climbing down the rope; you might get to the bottom, but it wouldn't necessarily be comfortable. Anyone can learn these abilities, completely safely, in only a few months. It's not worth risking your health for a shortcut that may not even give you the experiences.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Shutdown means stopping all psychic activity, totally but temporarily. Closing all psychic perceptions lets you stop to understand what you have experienced. It helps you recover from emotional surprise or shock and return to reality.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">When psychic experiences frighten you, take a step back and relax. Breathe. Consider whether you really need to shut down, or whether you’d do better to think things over. Shutting down means you will have to completely stop thinking about what happened. Sometimes this may not be helpful.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If thinking about the experience bothers you too much, or makes your energy feel bad, go ahead and shut down for a while. If, instead, you can stop using the ability for a few minutes, sit back, and think, do that instead. Shutting down all abilities is an extreme step. It can always be reversed, but it will take some effort to open again. The section on personal changes discusses frightening experiences in detail.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Sit quietly for a few minutes, just breathing and noticing yourself. Pay attention to how you feel and why. Let each feeling surface and then pass on without judgement. Recognize your stream of thought and let it flow. Notice how your body feels and looks, and any tension you are carrying. Notice your daydreams, ideas, and everything that is a part of you.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Also, notice anything you are feeling that may be imposed on you by others. Look for tension, pressure, or expectations. Notice how you have reacted to them, and what your feelings are in response. There's no need to change anything unless you want to. Just be aware of these things. Consider the things you want separate from the things others want for you.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As you do this, you will get a stronger feeling of yourself. With time, you'll recognize more quickly what is a part of who you are, and what is temporary or societal. This will help prevent empathic flooding, and increase control of energy work you do.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Choose an energy source you enjoy to draw energy from. Feel energy from that source flowing into you. You can picture it as a garden hose pouring energy into you, or as a waterfall all around you. You might picture it as light surrounding and filling you, or a fire warming you. The energy surrounds and fills you, raising your energy to a much stronger level.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As you feel the energy flow through you, relax and focus on staying balanced. Don’t hold the energy in; let it flow through. Bottling it up will stop the flow. Raise the energy strength as far as you can comfortably go. Then, hold the energy flow at that speed and strength for a few minutes. Practice holding it stable.</P>

Lightheadedness usually means that you have too much energy and need to let some of it go back into the earth, like grounding an electrical system. As you draw energy, take only what feels appropriate. Don't force it; just gently draw the energy. Forcing it will only make it more difficult to get the right amount of energy.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psiballs are balls of psychic energy. They can be any size, density, shape, texture, etc. They can be used to carry information, investigate an area, heal, warm, or cool an area, or simply to play with and to practice energy control.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892844"><A NAME="_Toc457892663"><A NAME="_Toc440712585"><A NAME="_Toc440638530"><A NAME="_Toc440638314"><A NAME="_Toc440637932"><A NAME="_Toc440636232"><A NAME="_Toc440636187"><A NAME="_Toc440448326">Shaping Energy</A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Draw energy and direct it outward through your hands. Cup your hands as if you were holding a baseball or a ball of cookie dough, with one hand below it and one above it. Picture the energy flowing from your body, through your arms, and out through your hands. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Feel the energy swirling and building up between your hands. Make the energy into a ball between your hands, making it denser as you add energy. It doesn't matter whether your eyes are open or closed - do whichever is comfortable for you.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Let yourself feel the energy between your hands. Notice any push or pull between your hands, any difference in heat, changing density of the air, sparks of light, waviness of the background behind the energy ball, or anything else that changes. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you have difficulty creating a strong enough psiball to feel, try drawing more energy and adding that energy to it. It may take practice to make a strong enough psiball to physically see waviness in the air, but you should be able to feel it quickly. Do not worry if you only feel it, and can not see it; that is normal. You may feel a lot of heat between your hands; this means you have drawn energy through them properly.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The sensations you feel may be very slight: tingles, pressure, or tightness. Trust your sensations. You're learning both to shape energy and to perceive it, at once. Both take some time to gain confidence with. If you think you felt something, you probably did.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892845"><A NAME="_Toc457892664"><A NAME="_Toc440712586"><A NAME="_Toc440638531"><A NAME="_Toc440638315"><A NAME="_Toc440637933"><A NAME="_Toc440636233"><A NAME="_Toc440636188"><A NAME="_Toc440448327">Learning Control</A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">After you are comfortable making a psiball, try working with friends. Each person starts by creating his or her own psiball. Then combine all of the psiballs into the center of the circle. Each person continues to add energy to the center. After a few minutes, discuss how each person perceives the energy. As a group, try changing the temperature or the density of the energy.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Practice regularly to improve your speed at creating psiballs and your control of them. As you become more comfortable making them, try variations. Make shapes other than a ball; try fire, a pool of water, a crystal, and any other shape you can imagine. Try changing the temperature of the energy, making it extra warm or extra cool. Make the energy carry different emotions, being agitated, or soothing. If you have a willing partner, try using an energy ball to tickle them.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Make a large energy ball of happy energy, and cover a friend in it. If you do it with a willing friend, but at a time they don't know what's happening, you can see how strongly it affects how they feel. (This often has the effect of making the receiver very happy and bouncy, as if they've had too much sugar or caffeine.) The energy can also be used to heal, by keeping the intention of healing as you create the ball and share the energy with someone.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Psiballs don't have many "practical" uses - their primary purpose is to learn basic energy perception and control. Beyond that, they can be used in all the same ways any energy can.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">A:</B> Try drawing more energy to make the psiballs. Since you were able to do it once, you have the technique, just not the strength. Let things happen gently, without forcing them, and be sure you are adding enough energy to make a strong psiball.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">Q:</B> I have drawn energy and tried to shape it, but I don't feel any energy ball forming.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">A:</B> Either you are not creating an energy ball, or you cannot feel the one that is there. First, open up your mind to feel any sensations around the ball, no matter how small. If you feel no sensations at all, try putting much more energy into the energy ball. It may take many times the amount of energy you expected. Also, let the energy leave your body; don't hold it in. Focus on letting go of it as it swirls around between your hands.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">Q:</B> I can make an energy ball but it immediately falls apart, or just doesn't do what I want it to.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">A: </B>Energy follows thought, so practice keeping your mind focused on the one thing you want the energy to do. As you practice, learn to keep your mind focused even through distractions. What you think and expect is what the energy will do, so as you practice, expect the energy ball to last longer and longer, until you decide to let it stop existing. You may need to continuously add energy to keep the psiball in shape.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">A shield is a bubble of energy that works like a window screen. It filters the energy that moves through it and defends against other’s negative energy. It also prevents people with psychic abilities from using them with you. Shields help empaths keep others' emotions separate from their own.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892858"><A NAME="_Toc457892677"><A NAME="_Toc440712599"><A NAME="_Toc440638544"><A NAME="_Toc440638328"><A NAME="_Toc440637946"><A NAME="_Toc440636246"><A NAME="_Toc440636201"><A NAME="_Toc440626196"><A NAME="_Toc440626168"><A NAME="_Toc440623949"><A NAME="_Toc440623898"><A NAME="_Toc440623760"><A NAME="_Toc440623183"><A NAME="_Toc440623156">Creati</A></A></A></A></A></A></A>on</A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Begin by clearly thinking through your purpose for the shield. Why do you want a shield? What exactly do you want it to do? Will it keep out all energy, or just bad energy? Will it be temporary, or will it be permanent? Will it only be defensive, or will it attack in response to negative energy?</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Once you have a clear intent, begin drawing energy and swirling it around you. Picture the energy as anything you wish. Common visualizations are soap bubbles, waterfalls, balls of light, fire, trees/vines, crystals, feathered wings or fur, tank metal, and armor. Choose an image that you enjoy thinking about and that isn’t cramped or heavy. Swirl the energy around you.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">When you feel the shield is strong enough, let go. It will maintain itself with whatever purpose you gave it as you created it. If the shield depletes over time, repeat to add more energy.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">A shield can have many effects, alone or in combination. A shield can keep energy on one side or the other, or act as a filter to allow only certain energy inside. It can convert energy from one form to another so that a filter is unnecessary. Shields help empaths keep out some of the extra emotional energy so they don't feel overwhelmed.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Shields also define boundaries in the physical world, which people will usually not to cross. Often they won’t even realize why they stopped there. The edge of a shield works as a psychic alarm. When someone physically crosses it, the shield gives the owner a psychic warning that someone is nearby.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Shields cause any effects you intend them to have when you create them. Just like any psychic ability, energy follows thought. Whatever you think about when you create the shield affects how it is created. Shield effects are not at all limited to what is listed here; anything you can think of, you can do.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Stress sometimes interferes with maintaining a shield. Under normal circumstances, a shield maintains itself for quite a while. However, large amounts of negative energy, attacks, illness, and lack of sleep all weaken a shield. This section explains how to maintain a shield under stressful conditions.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc440623186"><A NAME="_Toc440623159">Daily Stress</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Daily stress is the most common difficulty with shielding. While a shield often prevents psychic energy from adding to the stress, eventually the shield weakens. More rest, planned time alone, meditation, and avoiding stress are the best cures. Daily or weekly meditation replenishes a drained shield and helps relax you.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc440623187"><A NAME="_Toc440623160">Empathic Overload</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Empathic overload is similar to, but can be more intense than, normal stress. Large crowds, schools, and cities are filled with intense emotional energy. Empaths who are particularly sensitive to this learn to build very strong shields to keep other people's emotions separate from their own. The first few days of an emotionally intense environment can be particularly tiring if the empath has not yet made a strong enough shield.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Meditation and self-examination are important to protect from the empathic pounding of emotionally intense environments. Meditation helps relieve the stress and emotional energy in a controlled way. It also gives time to identify the difference between empathic emotions and personal emotions. By identifying yourself carefully (especially emotionally), you add an extra layer to the shield which defines "self" and "other." This helps external emotions bounce off harmlessly.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc440623188"><A NAME="_Toc440623161">Electromagnetic Fields</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Sometimes electromagnetic fields, from power lines or electronic equipment, can tear at a shield and cause it to weaken. If a person has grown up near power lines, his or her shield may already be adjusted to compensate.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">For people who have just entered electric fields, though, it can be rather intense. Experiment with drawing energy from the field and changing it into a more useful form of energy. Also, try matching your own energy to the existing electricity. With some practice, adjusting your shield to that energy takes little effort.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc440623189"><A NAME="_Toc440623162">Psychic Battle</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Shields also become weakened by psychic battles. Though most people will never need to deal with this, some can't avoid it. They may have known they were dealing with it before ever reading a book on psychic abilities. Shielding is a natural defense to psychic attacks.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">During psychic battle, people hold their shields in place by willpower and energy. Willpower controls the shield the most. Calm confidence is the best way to prevent a shield from being drained. If you are uncomfortable trusting in your own endurance, trust in the universe to do what is best for you, whether or not that is protection.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If the shield does feeling drained, draw additional energy from a comfortable source to replenish it. Keep drawing until you know you are safe. If you cannot hold up the strength any longer, place your psychic self some place safe (or even shut down) to avoid being attacked. A safe place is any place, real or imagined, where you feel secure. Attack rarely causes any symptoms worse than a headache, but headaches can be bad. Avoiding fighting is best.</P>

Start the shield tiny inside of you, and make grow bigger like a balloon until it’s around you. This prevents energy from being trapped inside it.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Visions</P>

<UL>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><LI>Visions are similar to imagination or daydreams.</LI>

<LI>Sound perceptions are words, names, instructions, and phrases that give useful information.</LI>
<LI>Sound perceptions are not rushing or ringing sounds in your ears (this just normal blood flow).</LI>
<LI>Sound perceptions are not sounds that occur naturally and you hear.</LI></UL>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">These are changes of physical objects, such as movement, floating, breaking, mending, vanishing, and appearing. They also include invisible touches, where a visible dent can be seen.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">When you investigate carefully, you'll usually find a normal explanation. Check for wind gusts, drafts, breaking or weak nails and hangers, lopsided shelves, and objects off balance. Consider normal ways to cause the same movement. However, scientists have recorded real movement and touches that have no physical explanation, so some of these events are paranormal.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">One common kind is a poltergeist, which translates as "noisy ghost." This includes cases where objects move around as if a ghost were moving them. This is usually unrecognized psychokinesis caused by a living person. If the person doesn't want psychokinesis, a counselor can help. Once the person learns to deal with stress better, the psychokinesis usually stops.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Telepathy is any communication between people or animals that does not occur by the normal senses. It can convey images, sounds, words, names, ideas, feelings, and emotions. It happens most often between emotionally close people, such as families, lovers, best friends, and pets.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Telepathy is not body language, whispers, voice inflection, lip reading, or any normal communication. If the people communicating are far apart and separated by walls, then telepathy may be a reasonable explanation.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Synchronicity is when an event occurs at exactly the right time. This may mean that people meet unexpectedly, just when they needed to talk. It can be accounted for as coincidence, but it may also involve telepathy or other psychic abilities. It is difficult to measure since there is no "chance" to compare against. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some cases of synchronicity can be explained by telepathy. Some can be explained as coincidence. The rest are still a mystery.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">All psychic abilities require some visualization. That visualization can be images, sounds, ideas, or stories. If you have trouble visualizing, try some playful childhood activities. Play pretend, or act out scenes in storybooks. Create an imaginary world to explore. Play with them when you’re feeling good, relaxed, and want to have some fun. Get enthusiastic! Dress the part. Share your excitement with nearby children.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Create an imaginary land in your mind. It can be anything - a jungle, a desert, a crater on Mars, or an underwater city. Make it something that excites you and interests you. Decide how big you want it to be, and who else is there with you. Start to explore it, looking for anything and everything interesting. If you work better by writing, write down a description of it, as a poem or a story. Make it as detailed as you can. Describe it to a friend. Do anything you can to remember your land. Come back to it often and add details and new ideas to it. If you tire of one area, create a new interesting one. Play in it!</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Find a child's storybook about adventures and surprises. The 6-9 years age group will probably have some good ones. The more silly and adventurous the book is, the better. One with lots of pictures will help if you have trouble specifically with pictures. As you read the book, make the scenes from the book as vivid as possible in your thoughts. Really get into the book and laugh with it. Be willing to let yourself feel like a child, and bring back the creative excitement of childhood.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Read the book aloud to any nearby children. Practice being a storyteller, using creative cartoon-like voices. Give every character its own body language and tones. Use crayons to draw pictures of each character showing its personality. Add another character and imagine how it would interact with the others. Enjoy yourself!</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">If you have the toys available, make a wooden block castle, a Lego dragon, or a Tinkertoy Ferris wheel. Create the same kinds of play scenes you enjoyed when you were young, and relive the ones that interest you. Draw/color/paint a picture (it doesn't have to look realistic!). Get crayons and color in a coloring book. Make it as fun and silly as you can; let the trees be purple with pink polka dots if that amuses you.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Find your creative self, and enjoy it with enthusiasm. If you have trouble with pictures, use whatever other methods you prefer to think about things. Doing the things you did as a child will help you remember how you thought about the things you created. Then you can use those same methods to access anything that requires visualization (it doesn't have to be pictures).</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">This is useful when you are dealing with a stressful person or situation. It helps clear your mind, focus your attention and energy, eliminate distractions, and keep you stable. It's also very necessary before you begin to use any advanced skill.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892878"><A NAME="_Toc457892697">Shielding</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Shielding is useful for many things. It can help you move through crowds. People will feel the edge of the shield and move away, often without realizing why. A shield set around a room will alert you when anyone crosses it. And, a shield can reduce the effects of highly emotional situations and other psychics nearby.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Overusing a shield may make you feel tired, however. So, if you use it a lot during the day, spend some time each night letting it relax and soften. You don't need to feel defensive all of the time. Relax, play, and center instead of shielding each evening.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892879"><A NAME="_Toc457892698">Game Preparation</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Everyone participating should ground and center before starting the games. Sit in a circle, and watch each other's energy until everyone is grounded and centered. None of these games have a winner or loser. They're cooperative for fun and practice. Discuss everyone's experiences as you play.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892880"><A NAME="_Toc457892699">Energy Fountain</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The goal of this game is to see how much energy a person can draw before he or she gets unstable and the flow collapses. It practices staying well grounded and holding a large energy flow.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Draw a little energy in from the ground, funnel it upward through your body, and out your head like a fountain. Stay well grounded and balanced. Gradually increase the amount of energy moving through you. Over a few minutes, try to move as much energy as you can. It's okay to get lightheaded or giggly, as long as your energy is still stable.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">When you can't increase the energy any more, or when the energy column collapses because you got dizzy, drop all the energy into the ground and relax. Lower your energy level and ground a lot until you're comfortable again. Then let the next person try.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">When you are watching someone make a fountain, practice seeing and feeling his or her energy. Notice if he or she wobbles or stays grounded.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892881"><A NAME="_Toc457892700">Simon Says Shielding</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The purpose of this game is to practice matching a description with your shields.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">One person is chosen as the leader, and names a type of shield for everyone to create, such as soap bubbles, tire rubber, brick wall, metal armor, fuzzy blankets, spider webs, etc. Everyone in the group spends a few minutes trying out that kind of shield, making it as strong and stable as possible.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Then the next person around the circle names a different type of shield, and everyone tries that. Go around the circle as long as it's fun, and discuss how the shields felt each time.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892882"><A NAME="_Toc457892701">Psiball Passing</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">This game practices stabilizing energy while letting go of it.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">One or two people create a strong psiball between their hands. Then they pass it to another person in the group, who adds energy, and passes it on. See how strong you can make it.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Each person creates psiballs and throws them against the walls of the room, like throwing sticky goo. Vary the energy in the psiballs, and let the energy remain on the walls as you throw them. If you want, say aloud what your psiball is made of just before you throw it. ("Soapy sponge! <I>&lt;Splat&gt;</I>") After a few minutes, look around psychically and notice all the energy splats everywhere.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">When you're done, take turns "washing" the walls off with a spray of energy from the palm of your hand, like a garden hose. Let all the energy soak in to the ground, and ground yourself.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Theoretically, telepathy can carry any information. In practice, it is more limited. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The most accurate reception comes from full concepts involving all five physical senses and emotions. Thoughts involving fewer senses reduce accuracy. For detailed, accurate telepathy, focus on an entire situation instead of a single object, word, or number.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Create a telepathic link the same way as an empathic link.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Focus your thoughts on the target person. Create a clear image of him or her in your mind. Create a picture of a situation involving him or her, and imagine the sounds, smells, emotions, and surrounding atmosphere.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Create an energy link between yourself and the target. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">It will have two parts: an emotional link between your hearts and an intellectual or conceptual link between your minds. The emotional part is important because connecting requires trust. Emotions and thoughts will go both directions through the links.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Strengthen both links until you feel strongly connected.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Telepathy should always be done with compassion for the other person's thoughts and feelings. You may learn personal information. If you betray this trust, future connections will be more difficult. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The target will not always consciously know that you are connecting, but will still respond subconsciously. He or she may block you out if upset with you. The receiver cannot force accurate telepathy. It only works when the sender and receiver both allow it.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">As you explore someone telepathically, you will notice many levels of thought. These levels exist in yourself and in the people you connect to. Some levels are more conscious than others.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The easiest level to reach is that of surface thoughts, the daily conscious thinking that people do in response to the environment. This level of thought is usually the least useful for telepathic communication, but it is the easiest to receive.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Sometimes those thoughts are obvious without telepathy. You see a child's eyes light up and know that he or she is excited and curious about something. Pets show their interest by pointing their eyes and ears. Remember that the communication is telepathic only if you know the thoughts without body language cues.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc441852976"><A NAME="_Toc441841770">Broadcast Thoughts</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Surface thoughts are easy to read because they are broadcast psychically. You may be talking with a friend, and suddenly both say the same thing at the same time. Or, one person may say something and the other respond, "Hey, I was about to say that!"</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This happens because one of the people is "thinking loudly," almost verbalizing his or her surface thoughts by thinking about them openly. <A NAME="_Toc441841771">These thoughts are the easiest for other people to receive spontaneously. If you don't want anyone receiving these thoughts, you will want to shield them.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc441852977">Shielded Thoughts</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Surface thoughts can be shielded with careful practice. They usually don't need to be shielded because few people will receive them clearly. However, if you associate with many psychic people, you may find that they notice more than you want them to.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some private thoughts will be unreadable by telepathy regardless. This is human nature; deeply private thoughts stay private. Thoughts about other people may seem to be private but are easily read through telepathy. They are also frequently conveyed through body language, and noticeable even without telepathy.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A person can learn to stop other people from reading any of his or her thoughts. This is usually not worth the effort for a long time, since most people aren't strongly telepathy anyway. However, it can be useful to keep a surprise secret.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Notice as you are reading or thinking how many of the words you are pronouncing in your mind. Any words that you pronounce mentally (even if you don't speak them) are loud thoughts.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You are likely to telepathically broadcast loud thoughts. If you think in pictures and ideas, or keep your mind quiet as you do pronounce words, you will broadcast less.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Observe your thoughts as you read and throughout the day. You will be able to tell the difference between your loud thoughts and your quiet ones. By changing your loud thoughts to quiet thoughts, you can make them less likely to be broadcast.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Exploring a person's thoughts is like wandering a maze of his or her life. Past and present experiences are mixed with thoughts, daydreams, feelings, and pictures. Navigating through the maze for one specific idea can be confusing, but it will get easier with practice.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Thoughts and memories are related by similarity. Start by telepathically asking for a starting point relevant to the information you want. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some images will appear. Watch for details in them. Focus on ideas related to the information you want. When new images appear, they will bring more information.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Focus in closer until you get to the level of details you need. If certain information you want isn't presented, ask a question about it. ("Show me more about your notebook. What have you written in it?") Follow the ideas that associate usefully with other ideas. You will eventually find a path to the information you want.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc441853005"><A NAME="_Toc441316367">Passive and Active Links</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">There are two ways to make use of a telepathic link, passively and actively. You can watch passively by letting the other person direct where you look and what you see. Or, once you are seeing through his or her eyes, you can watch actively by telepathically suggesting where they should look and what they should do. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The passive way will give you better realistic information about the person's interests. The active way will let you look in more detail at something that was glanced over but not examined. Use passive links just as you would normal receptive telepathy. Use active links as a combination of receptive telepathy and suggestive telepathy.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Telepathy can be used to suggest, not just to receive. This has only a minimal effect until the sender is very strong, and even then, it is suggestion only, not a controlling force. It is used mainly to ask questions of the target, to get specific useful answers.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Telepathic suggestions can not be used to make people do things that they would strongly object to. They can be used to ask for simple actions. The easiest types of suggestions are things like, "Scratch your ear," "Drop the pencil," and "Look behind you." Simple, instant, physical commands are much easier than complex commands.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">To send a suggestion, create a normal telepathic link, and then think of information traveling from your mind to the target's, instead of vice versa. Formulate your suggestion very clearly. Involve a picture, sound, and concept with it, not just the words of the sentence. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some people are able to tell when they are being telepathically influenced, and sometimes even recognize who is doing it. Work with a friend who has verbally given you permission to try to influence him or her telepathically. Then you can be sure you aren't offending anyone by doing so.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Astral projection means projecting your awareness to the astral plane. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The astral plane is a world made of energy that can be shaped by thought and emotion. In the astral plane, a person can create objects and communicate with other beings, both humans and spirits. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Remote Viewing is a form of projection, just like astral projection. The difference is that it takes you to a physical location instead of an astral one.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892905"><A NAME="_Toc457892724"><A NAME="_Toc441852986"><A NAME="_Toc441316348">Astral Projection vs. Out of Body Experiences</A></A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Astral projection and out of body experiences are not the same.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Leaving the body and astral projection are different forms of travel. The astral plane is one of many places a person can go when out of body or when projecting. Astral projection can happen while still in body and awake.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This book focuses on interacting with the astral plane through visualization. This works while you are awake and not out of body. It will not cover out of body experiences.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Astral projection requires feelings like daydreaming and being creative because they trigger psychic perceptions. You may feel at first that you are imagining what you see. That's ok. In time, you will change from imagining it to perceiving it accurately.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The level of danger is less than normal physical life. You might run into someone who will get angry with you for no apparent reason. However, as long as you don't go looking for trouble, such occurrences are unlikely. Even if someone doesn't like you, they're unlikely to do anything more than give you a minor headache.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Contrary to some common myths, you can not die from leaving your body or from projection. You can not be trapped out of your body. Demons will not take over your body while you're gone. If you get anxious or stressed, you'll just wake up naturally, like from a nighttime dream.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Choose an astral place that you would like to visit. Create a place if you think it does not already exist. If you want to visit a friend's astral home, hold the image of your friend, emotionally or visually, in your mind.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Relax and daydream. Think of the place you would like to visit. If other thoughts interfere, notice them, let them go, and return to the picture.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Continue until it becomes very clear. You will use this place as an anchor point to return to later. Become aware of seeing, feeling, and hearing the place, including as many senses as possible.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Stay open to any information that enters your mind, no matter how odd or unrelated it may seem. Some astral places are relatively normal. Others are extremely odd and may change frequently. As you examine each image, use it to find other images. Over time, you will get images more quickly and see more.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Once maintaining the picture is easy, change it somewhat. Add a tree, or move things around; whatever you imagine will change it in that way. Pick up an object and resize it, change its color, change its density, and then return it to normal. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Reshape that area of the astral plane. Practice until you are very comfortable doing this. Learn to change your shape. Walk, fly, swim, and examine the details of many objects.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The next step in astral projection is traveling to places other people have created. You succeed at this when you don't let your preconceptions change your views of them. In some areas, the things people have created maintain themselves so others can not change them. In other areas, your thoughts can change what is actually there.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Astral projection is useful for practicing perceptive and creative psychic abilities, especially telepathy. It also works as an energy source to assist healing. It lets you explore concepts that don't fit into the regular world, such as four or five dimensional space.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Exploring other people's astral creations and creating your own can be quite fun. Whatever you can imagine, you can play with on the astral plane.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Soul joining is also possible. Because you can change shape astrally, you can become fog-like. If several people do this, it is possible for them to overlap their soul energy, and eventually their souls. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This can be a very intimate experience emotionally and nearly always creates a strong telepathic connection. It's difficult to remain in the astral plane when doing this if you aren't already good at projecting. For people who are very comfortable projecting and comfortable with each other, it can be a very joyous experience.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Q</B>: I can't keep a clear picture of the astral plane in my mind. It's blurry and not very detailed.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">A</B>: You may need to work with an ability other than sight. Try listening and feeling your way around, rather than giving it a visual shape. Also, make sure you aren't being distracted by the physical world around you.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">Q</B>: I can get to the astral plane and see it, but I can't move around. I feel like I'm glued down.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">A</B>: Sometimes it takes practice to be able to move naturally. Try a second projection. Leave your astral body where it's at, as a shell, and project to a different place in the astral plane. Let the shell just sit there stuck the first few times, and eventually, you will find that movement comes naturally. This can be especially helpful if astrally you can fly but have difficulty walking.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">Q</B>: I can't see anything others create. I can only see my own things.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">A</B>: This could happen for two reasons. One possibility is that your own expectations are interfering. If so, practice the suggestions given at the beginning of this book for avoiding expectations. The other possibility is that you are not used to viewing other people's energy. Practice with psiballs with friends, and with aura vision, to help improve your ability to see other people's energy. Other energies feel a bit different, but they are all variations of the energy you can already see.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">Q</B>: When I'm trying to actually leave my body, rather than just see the astral plane while awake, I get almost out. But then my heart beat speeds up and I wake back up again.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">A</B>: A fast heart rate shows anxiety. Are you nervous about what you are doing? The anxiety could come from many things. If you are afraid of the astral plane, research it more and deal with your fears before trying to project again. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you aren't afraid of projecting, but still have a lot of anxiety, consider some other possibilities. How will your beliefs change if you succeed? Are you worried about anything that would happen to you, emotionally or mentally, after you succeed? Are you ready for the new experience? How will you handle it? What does it mean to you to succeed? If you are not ready, what would make you ready?</P>
<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">Q</B>: I want to explore the astral plane but I'm afraid it might be dangerous or unhealthy. Something keeps pushing me back in.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">A</B>: Your own fears are pushing you back in. Emotions can take form when you are in the astral plane, and you may perceive them as actual blocks to your progress. The only way to defeat fears is to face them, either by experiencing what you are afraid of, or by researching it until you know there is nothing to be afraid of. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The astral plane is less dangerous than the physical world because you can always relocate if a situation isn't good. At worst, you can simply leave the astral plane (with a full shutdown if you wish).</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Your fears will not decrease over time unless you continue to learn about astral projection. Keep reading about it, talk with others about their experiences, and practice things yourself. Do it a little at a time so that you are totally comfortable before going ahead.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Like in the Star Wars Jedi training cave, the only threats are your own fears. Face the fears, and they will show that they are illusions.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you want to feel more prepared for whatever occurs, read the section on maintaining shielding. Some of the ways of dealing with psychic battle (which is uncommon, but occasionally happens) are discussed in that section.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">An aura is an energy field around something. It contains information about the health of a creature, its emotional and mental state, and many other things. Color, texture, shape, size, and motion of the aura all provide information about the creature or item.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Relax your body, mind, and eyes. Choose an object or person to look at that won't make you nervous. Look gently at the object, focusing your eyes slightly behind it.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Look with your third eye, the psychically sensitive area of your forehead. Close your eyes and feel your focus shift up slightly, so that you seem to be looking out of your forehead. Open your eyes, and your focus shifts back down to normal sight. Open and close your eyes a few times to learn how it feels. Avoid rolling your eyes upward; that will just give you a headache.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Once you are confident of the focus shift, do it gently with your eyes open. Look out of your eyes and your forehead at the same time. This shift of focus awakens psychic vision, which is used to see auras. To see the aura, look gently just past the object, using your eyes to see and keeping your focus lifted to the third eye. When you begin to see lines of color around the object, you need to find out if it's an after-image or an actual aura.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">After-images are a biological effect of your eyes, caused by eyestrain. Look at the circle image for at least 30 seconds, and then look at the empty space next to it or a blank wall. The opposite-color image you will see is an after-image.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">To prevent after-images, blink often and don't look at one object too long. As you improve, you will see the aura within a few seconds, before after-images appear. When you first see color or lines around an object, look away to make sure it's not an after-image.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">To eliminate after-images, close your eyes for a minute or two. When you stop seeing the image on the inside of your eyes, the after-image is gone and you can go back to seeing the aura.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Auras have many shapes, sizes, colors, and textures. There is no standard interpretation because different people perceive differently. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The best way to discover the meanings of colors and other attributes is to experiment. Read about traditional meanings and use them to decide what the colors mean to you. For instance, someone who is decisive about his personal space may have a clear edge on his aura, a solid, dense energy, and sharp, clear lines.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The aura can affect and be affected by a person's health. If you are interested in learning energy healing, through chakra and aura work, read <I>Hands of Light</I> and <I>Light Emerging</I> by Barbara Ann Brennan. They are very detailed and well written, and they focus entirely on healing methods.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Stay relaxed and calm as you practice. Practice often, but don't tire yourself. Often, the moment you relax and quit trying, you will suddenly see the aura quite clearly. If things aren't working, take a break, do something fun, and try again later when you can be more relaxed and patient.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Aura vision may be easier when you are sleepy because you won't have the energy to force anything. If you have a difficult time letting things happen without forcing them, try once or twice when you are tired or sleepy.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Dim lighting can be helpful so you don't strain your eyes. Put a solid colored background behind the object. Gray, white, brown, and dark colors work well because they are not visually distracting.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The aura has multiple layers, like an onion, but with each layer reaching from the very center of the person outward. Close to the body, all of the layers overlap. Each layer out reaches farther away from the body and becomes less dense, lighter, subtler, and more difficult to see.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">First, practice seeing the inner layers. As you improve, let your awareness expand, growing lighter and softer. Reach outward with your aura to feel the aura you are looking at. Feel your vision shifting more strongly toward the third eye and clairvoyance. Remain relaxed and feeling light as your vision expands to include the outer layers.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychokinesis, less often called telekinesis, is the ability to move or affect matter with your mind. This includes all forms of affecting dice rolls, levitation, teleportation, etc.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Research has shown that psychokinesis does exist in some people. For details of scientific experiments, refer to the Journal of Parapsychology, in most large libraries. Most studies are done using random number generators, to get measurable effects. There are a few rare cases of objects levitating, vanishing, and other large occurrences, but these are notoriously hard to repeat and study.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This section investigates the causes, beliefs, and reality surrounding psychokinesis. It doesn't claim you can learn psychokinesis overnight, or even at all. If you have not learned any other ability yet, don't start with psychokinesis. Encourage your belief and experience by learning another first. Other abilities, especially ones such as empathy, are more easily accepted and learned. Then psychokinesis will be much easier.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Affecting random numbers is called micro psychokinesis. It works on small events, and its results are only noticeable after collecting a large amount of data. This is the more common kind of psychokinesis. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A student practicing usually obtains better results with micro psychokinesis, because it's more easily caused, counted, studied, and believed. This doesn't lend itself to flamboyant demonstrations, but it is scientifically valid and quite real.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc441853029"><A NAME="_Toc441314483">Macro Psychokinesis</A></A></P>

<OL>

<LI>Remove all disbelief. "Do or do not. There is no try."</LI>
<LI>Choose the goal you want. This could be a dice roll, a hand of cards, or whatever. </LI>
<LI>Visualize that goal very strongly, being very confident that it can and will happen exactly as you want it to. "My will be done!"</LI>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Pay attention to your mood, distractions, day dreaming, beliefs, doubts, questions, and ideas. Practice with your eyes open or closed. Experiment with getting results immediately or later. Learn how each affects your results. Try working with objects that are already moving; it may be easier.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you think a doubt interfered with getting your goal, then try again, and focus more on being confident. When you can clearly, confidently, and repeatedly visualize the goal you want, you will get better results. Encourage yourself. Celebrate your progress. Relax and rest.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Good results help overcome the rest of your doubts. The more you overcome the doubts, the easier it'll be to continue improving. This is one reason that practicing lots of micro psychokinesis will tend to help more than attempting macro psychokinesis. You can get good results a little at a time.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychokinesis forces matter to match your thoughts. Therefore, thoughts of disbelief won't work, only thoughts of belief will. Because it is so important, most of the necessary learning relates to believing. Faith <I>can</I> move mountains (well, dice at least).</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychokinesis does exist. Normal people do it. People who've gained control of the ability have no reason to believe that it doesn't exist. They've experienced it, and know that it exists. Society's disbelief no longer matters to them. Society's disbelief won't matter to you, either, once you've seen it with your own eyes and done it yourself.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc441853035"><A NAME="_Toc441314496">Overcoming Doubts</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">You can overcome doubts by identifying them precisely, and then one by one challenging the incorrect beliefs. Once you make the challenge statements, repeat them to break the old habit and create a new supportive one. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Stating a new idea once or a few times isn't enough to change your inner beliefs. This usually takes a few months of repetition. There's no quick way to reprogram a thought habit.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you haven't read the section at the beginning about beliefs, do so now. If you read it but don't remember much, reread it. Pay attention to the fears and challenge statements. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Any belief you have which you want to change, you can, by finding a logical challenge statement that directly contradicts the incorrect belief. This works for any area of life. When you choose what to believe based on a rational view of reality, your inner beliefs will gradually change to match the new view. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The methods just discussed can reprogram your habits to support a more realistic view of the world. It takes time, but it is necessary for success.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Results</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">People learning psychokinesis may find they explain away good results as chance, if they are doubtful, or accept the slightest variations as proof if they are overly enthusiastic. Both these trends should be kept in mind when looking over results. Statistical methods exist to show the probability that psychokinesis was involved. The methods are detailed in the statistics and measurement section below.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Someone with intense doubts may score a statistically valid score, but in the wrong direction for the experiment, or significantly less than chance. Similarly, a person who is confident, focused, concentrating comfortably, and enthusiastic may be able to produce consistent good scores.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In this way, success tends to create more success, and failure tends to create more failure. Each is a reinforcement of a belief. Challenge statements may be needed to overcome a trend of failure before it becomes too much of a habit. This can be frustrating, but success doesn't happen overnight. It happens by learning from failure.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The most common effects of psychokinesis are small variations in chance, such as dice rolls, card shuffles, and influence on electronics. These can help a person win a board game. They can force variation in a random number generator. They sometimes cause electronic equipment malfunctions, and often happen without us realizing it.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Retro Psychokinesis</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychokinesis can also work backward in time. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The experiment uses a random number generator to produce a set of 1's and 0's and records them on floppy disk. While it occurs, a person is trying to force the results using PK. Another person then looks at the numbers to see whether there are more of a number than expected. Like the flip of a fair coin, there should be about half of each result.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In one form of the experiment, a person with PK is told to force 1's before the generator runs. Then it runs, a person checks the results, and the person has successfully forced extra 1's. This is normal cause and effect, as we understand it.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In the second form of the experiment, the number generator runs first and the results are recorded on floppy disk. Then afterward, the person is told whether to force it to produce extra 1's or extra 0's. The person makes an effort, and then someone looks at the already recorded results to see if it worked. And, it does a scientifically significant amount of time. Since the floppy hasn't been touched, the results must have been there all along, in the direction asked for.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">No one, including top scientists, has been able to explain how that works. All they can prove is that it does work a significant number of times. For more details, look for studies on retro-psychokinesis in scientific parapsychology journals.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc451336218"><A NAME="_Toc441314489">Levitation</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Levitating objects is possible though rare. This can either be straight up, or moving the object across the room. For reasons probably tied to beliefs, this rarely happens when people are watching. Sometimes, though, a person will turn around just in time to see the object drop. It may account for some objects relocating across the room when no one moved them (this happens to a large number of people, in cases where it couldn't be just forgetfulness).</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In my experience, objects spontaneously levitated or moved when I was daydreaming. Typically, I was relaxed, dreamy, unfocused, and mentally energetic. I don't know how long objects levitated. I only noticed them once they fell down with a bang. Other than general mood, I haven't discovered any details for causing movement on purpose.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Chimes rang indoors without wind, repeatedly (and just one chime at a time, not the whole set). A pan floated straight up and then dropped back down onto the same shelf. A cordless phone moved to a different corner of the room while I was awake in it but not watching. A spiral handset phone cord floated in the air in front of my eyes, until I thought, "That can't float!" at which point it promptly dropped to the floor. Some of these happened with friends in the room, and they agreed with my observations. I haven't learned to control them yet, though.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc451336219"><A NAME="_Toc441314490">Teleportation</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Teleportation, which means an object vanishes in one place and reappears somewhere else, is reported occasionally but is extremely rare. Since I don't have the ability, I can't teach it. I mention it here to help people research it.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Search carefully through parapsychology journals and publications. There are stories of psychic Chinese children who can cause flowers, pills, and other small objects to teleport on cue. There are stories of a Scottish man from hundreds of years ago showing up in Europe in the 1990s, very confused about what happened to his farm. There are stories of mediums who conjure small objects during seances. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some of these have been researched in detail. Some are just reported as case studies. Because they aren't repeatable in a lab, they're difficult to verify and prove. Also, it's very difficult to get studies of such controversial topics published in the United States. Search for psychic studies from Europe, Australia, Canada, China, and Russia. </P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P></A>Causes of Psychokinesis</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Random Manifestations of Micro Psychokinesis</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychokinesis most often manifests spontaneously and accidentally as microPK. The person may not notice microPK. Strongly wanting a dice roll or a particular hand of cards, can cause microPK to happen. This may account for a person's good luck or bad luck.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Random manifestation comes from a strong emotional desire. The desire motivates the ability, which then works subconsciously to bring about the goal.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Random Manifestations of Macro Psychokinesis</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The other emotional state that often causes psychokinesis is high adrenaline. This can be anger, fear/terror, frustration, excitement, or pleasure.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Adrenaline psychokinesis can manifest in a big way: objects moving around, electronic equipment breaking, or a glass shattering. While this is impressive, it's usually not repeatable. It usually scares the person involved, although it's unlikely to hurt anyone.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This is also the ability sometimes responsible for poltergeist effects in homes. The poltergeist effects center around one person with an undisciplined psychokinetic ability and usually a lot of emotional upset and stress. The psychokinetic activity may be a way of releasing some of the stress or making it more obvious so it gets solved. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This may not account for all such cases, but it is the reason behind some of them. People who have troublesome psychokinetic activity should contact an agency with a good reputation in parapsychology - ask for their history and references - and get assistance there.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Random psychokinesis shows that the person does have a natural ability towards psychokinesis. If the person wants to do so, she or he may work on gaining control of the ability, and causing it on purpose in the intended fashion. Even if a person has not had random psychokinesis before, if he or she is willing to let it happen, it may eventually do so.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Psychokinesis can also manifest on purpose. The easiest to study is micro psychokinesis affecting random number generators (RNGs) because scientists can measure the effect. Psychic research labs have identified people who can consistently affect RNGs.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Computer programs are becoming a possibility for an at-home lab with as much or almost as much control as a scientific lab. The best of these programs use true random numbers, generated from special hardware. Simpler programs use pseudo-random numbers, which can have patterns or repetition in them, and are harder or impossible to affect. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A cheap route to practicing micro psychokinesis is to use a fair die. See the section Statistics and the Z-Score for detailed experiments and how to interpret the results.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Intentional Manifestations of Macro Psychokinesis</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Some people can also manifest macro psychokinesis on purpose. Most will not demonstrate it, or even let anyone else know they can do it. They would be harassed about the ability if they did. Don't expect any demonstrations.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In many cases, these people had random macro psychokinesis manifestations, and eventually discovered how to control them. They may not understand the ability or be able to teach it. Some methods for learning macro psychokinesis are discussed later in this page. Since few people can learn it easily, they aren't as tried and practiced as the other skills in this book.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A very large part of learning macro psychokinesis is belief. If a person believes that it can't happen, it won't. If they believe it might happen, then it might. If they can fully believe that it will happen, it will.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This is covered and explained in more details in the belief section. Disbelief is why macro psychokinesis is one of the more rare psychic abilities. It takes a lot to overcome the initial disbelief enough to manifest the ability a few times. Just like any other psychic ability, it can be learned if approached correctly.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">A 6-sided fair die is equally likely to roll any of the numbers on it. So, the chance of rolling a particular number is 1 out of 6: it will show up approximately once out of every six rolls. Out of 30 rolls, a certain number would show up approximately 5 times.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If a number shows up much more or much less than that, then either the die is not fair (trick dice? weighted?), or something else, such as psychokinesis, is affecting the roll.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Having the correct number show up extra often is called psi hitting. It's also possible to have the correct number show up much too rarely, and this is called psi missing, meaning that psychic abilities cause you to miss more often than chance. It's just as important in studies as psi hitting, since it's still affecting the roll.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you have a lot of psi missing, check that your thoughts are clear and free of doubts, and then try again. Sometimes an ability will just work backward of what's intended, and changing your approach can fix that.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Scientific Significance</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The <I>test of scientific significance</I> measures how significant a certain result is. This is a common scientific method of proving a given theory based on experimental results.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">It gives a percentage likelihood that the results of the experiment are due only to random chance. If there is less than a 5% chance that the results are due to random chance, then it is accepted as scientifically significant, meaning that the results could be due to psychic abilities.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The math behind it is somewhat complex, so the experiments listed on the following pages have simple tables to check your results. You won't need to do any math for them.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As an example, the significance test says that on 30 dice rolling trials, 8 or more rolls of the same number, or less than 2 rolls of the same number, are <I>proof </I>that something special is happening. That would mean that either the person is using trick dice, or psychic abilities are affecting the rolls.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>For Science and Math People</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">If you are interested in more detailed math, the full z-score and probability formulas are available in the appendix of this book, with a description of how to use them. Also, check the Journal of Parapsychology for their statistical methods, which are much more detailed.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you want to do more advanced analysis of your experiments, keep a list of exactly what the target was, and what your actual answer was. Write your name and the date on every experiment result. Keep all your results, even the ones that you think you did badly on. Then find a professor of statistics or parapsychology and explain that you've done some experiments and you'd like to learn how to analyze the results. Most will be willing to help you out if you're patient and friendly.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The explanation given here is for the purpose of doing simple parapsychology experiments at home. The charts will give you accurate results, as long as you are following the rules about how to use them.

<OL>

<LI>Chance needs to be one choice out of a set, with each choice equally likely.</LI>
<LI>You need to do enough trials to be able to use the chart. This is listed under each experiment. In general, you need enough trials to make the number correct by chance be at least five. So if chance is 1/4, you need to do at least 20 trials, so chance would be 5 correct. If chance is 1/6, you need to do 30 trials, so chance is 5 correct.</LI>
<LI>You need to keep track of how many answers were correct and how many incorrect. </LI></OL>

<P>Dice Experiment</A></A></A></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Preparation</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">If you are using a normal die, chance is 1/6 because there are six sides. The table below gives probability values for any results with chance 1/6. You will be making 36 rolls.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You will be doing one set to test the die and another set to try out psychokinesis. The method for each is the same. It's important that you test the die first, so that if it's lopsided, you can find a better one to practice with.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Experiment</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Here you will be trying to roll a 3. (You can pick any number, but these instructions will assume 3 for now.) Roll a single die, and record whether it came up as a 3. Repeat this for all 36 rolls. At the end, count how many 3's you had and find that number in the "Correct" column in the chart.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Results</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">If you are just testing the die, it should roll anywhere from four to eight 3's during that time. If it rolls differently from that, it's probably not a fair die. Try using a different one, especially a new one. If you are testing your psychokinetic ability, you need zero, one, or eleven, or more 3's to prove that you did it. If you get more than thirteen 3's, then you've really proven it.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Magick, in this context, refers to using rituals, objects, or habits to cause changes, either in a person's mind and attitude, or in the world. It may involve invoking a higher power to do work for you, or using a ritual to bring forth power within you to do work.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some religions use magical ceremonies for blessings, rites of passage, and recognition. Examples would be baptism, communion, weddings and hand-fastings, prayers, rain dances, and some superstitions.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The traditions around magick vary greatly. Most Christian traditions have magical ceremonies of various sorts, conducted by the priest or pastor, and involving sometimes an entire congregation. They may not be referred to as magick, but the rites fit the definition, involve God's power in some way, and have a purpose in the minds of the people involved. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Most Christian traditions restrict the use of magick to only religious officials, and only in the ways defined by the church. They discourage general people from pursuing psychic perceptions, and especially from practicing ritual magick without the church.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Other religions, such as Wicca, are much more open about who can use magick. Wicca is a nature-loving religion with a God and a Goddess. Its basic message is as long as you harm no one, do whatever you want. It supports the use of rituals to help you think differently, to accomplish things, and accepts the existence of psychic perception. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">There are many other religions that support psychic abilities and ritual magick.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Magick and psychic abilities are related but somewhat different. Psychic abilities come entirely from within, and are generally under the control of the person involved. Magick can come from within or from other sources, and may or may not be entirely controlled. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">They are two similar but different ways of causing changes in the world. They often work well together, because ritual is especially helpful for setting a mood that psi will work in.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">There are many methods for doing readings, such as runes, tarot, dice, cards, I Ching, angel oracle, freeform telepathy, and others. Learn the history and common uses of a method before using it. Anything that gives you good results is a good choice.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Regardless of the method used, once the information is recorded, it's useful to determine which parts were correct. You should only do this after all impressions are recorded, so it doesn't influence the results.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Check details carefully, for colors, sizes, shapes, similarities, word sounds, and other things that may match. Watch out for the extremely general things that don't provide useful information. "You will have difficulty tomorrow" is too general. "You will have trouble with your car at lunch time" is not general; it's very specific and easily proven.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's ok to be inaccurate at first. You will improve with time and practice. Give at least three months of readings before deciding whether you are generally accurate or not.

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="_Toc457811553">Dodging the Storm</A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">The rain began to lessen. As we sat in the restaurant, my mother asked jokingly, "Can you use your psychic </FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">powers</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> to make the storm go away, or tell us when it's safe?"</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I was nervous enough, when we hadn't been able to see this driveway through the rain. I certainly didn't want to go back onto the road, just to be chased into the next driveway. The storm terrified me so much I almost felt like I was dreaming, or in another world.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">My little sister, almost asleep on her damp pillow, was gazing half-focused out the window. Other travelers were stranded in the restaurant, too. There was a mother with three children, soaking wet and shivering. The thunderstorm caught us all unprepared, trapping us in a family restaurant amid miles of Illinois farmland.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I decided to try my psychic abilities. I wouldn't be able to affect the storm; it threatened much too large an area. Perhaps I could visualize it and learn its path, though. I finished taking in my surroundings so I could stop thinking about them, and closed my eyes.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Realizing my heart was racing, I breathed in slowly and shakily a few times. In a few moments, my muscles relaxed and I calmed down a little. I focused completely on my emotions, blocked out sounds of the storm, and let go of the fear. I needed to be calm, not anxious, to use my abilities. I relaxed.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I reached gently high into the clouds until I could look down on them from above. Then I stretched out, gradually farther, until I felt the edges of the storm in all four directions. I slid inside the storm, flowing through it like honey, mixing my essence with it until we melded.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As the storm cloud engulfed me, my heart raced. I realized there was too much information; it would overwhelm me. I needed to simplify my perceptions, to understand any of it.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I chose a simple way to see the shape of the cloud. It should show up like a weather map, but in shades of gray. Once I had decided how to handle the information, I reopened myself to the cloud. This time the information was comfortable, even easy, to understand. I wasn't scared anymore, and felt that I could understand the storm's patterns.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A weather map with the storm cloud perching above it appeared in my mind. It had eight arms, spinning slightly. It reminded me of a squid or a spinning star. I focused on each arm in turn, noting its location and intensity, studying it with the calm interest of a scientist. I looked closely for the arm near us, and examined each finger and strand floating off of it. Satisfied, I anchored a part of myself in the cloud, brought the rest back to Earth, and opened my eyes.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I must not have taken more than fifteen or twenty seconds, because my mother hadn't even noticed my eyes closed. She was looking out the window at the storm, wondering what to do.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Ok... I checked on the storm psychically. I don't know how reliable my information will be, but then, it can't be any worse than guessing." I explained the shape, size, and intensity of the cloud to her. I could probably identify bursts before we drove into them. She must have trusted my information more than I did, because she decided to go ahead and travel the next time the rain let up.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">We drove somewhat nervously through light rain for the remaining four hours of the trip, adjusting speed to avoid bursts ahead of us. Although we heard many reports of flash floods on the radio, we had no more trouble ourselves and made it home at 9:50 PM.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">At 10:00, we turned on the television for the weather. The Doppler radar showed exactly the size and shape storm I had described, with the same number of arms. Although I usually believed my skills, I still jumped with surprise that night in 1993, when the image matched exactly.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If we had left the restaurant any earlier, we would have traveled inside the arm. If we had left later, the next arm would have caught us. We had managed to travel with the lightest section of the storm. As the news reporter described all the accidents from the storm, I realized that my abilities might have saved my life.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">This game combines empathy, telepathy, and remote viewing, since it's difficult to separate them. The goal is for the receiver to accurately describe a picture that the sender is looking at.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">One person is the sender, and chooses a fairly complex picture out of a book, magazine, art collection, web page, etc. The picture should include at least four objects, and it is best if it also has emotional impact. The sender says, "Ready," and then both the sender and receiver are quiet until the receiver is done.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The receiver writes down any objects or descriptions he or she receives, and draws a simple sketch of their arrangement in the picture. Crayons, colored pencils, markers, or pens can be used. If the receiver is very young and hasn't learned to read/write yet, just draw pictures and be ready to describe what each item is.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">After the receiver has drawn the picture and is done receiving, get together and compare pictures. Discuss how well they match or are different, and how both people felt as they practiced. You might be surprised at the similarities!</P>

Then create it as you go.</P></FONT>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After someone has chosen and created an astral place, the group arrives and starts to explore. Each person should describe what he or she sees, aloud to the group. It may take some practice to stay in projection, while talking physically, but it is certainly possible. Explore and have fun discussing as long as everyone is comfortable and not too tired. This is usually easiest if everyone keeps his or her eyes closed.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">For an advanced version of this, everyone projects together, but does not discuss what they see until they are all done (about 10-15 minutes later).</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">This game is the same as normal hide-and-seek, with everyone hiding and one person finding them. The difference is that psychic perceptions are encouraged. It uses aura vision to watch for hidden people, and telepathy and remote viewing to try to locate people. Anyone hiding will need to either shield very strongly, or shutdown, to be harder to find.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">For a more advanced version, each person who is found helps look for other people. The person who stayed hidden the longest is the seeker next time.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Many other games can be invented, and variations used. Traditional dice games give a place to practice psychokinesis. Card games give a chance for empathy and telepathy practice. Try anything that seems fun.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P><A NAME="_Toc472931507"><A NAME="_Toc457970581"><A NAME="_Toc457970255"><A NAME="_Toc457894832"><A NAME="_Toc457892958"><A NAME="_Toc457892777"><A NAME="_Toc457811554"><A NAME="_Toc451336227">Teaching, for Teachers</A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892959"><A NAME="_Toc457892778"><A NAME="_Toc457811555">Responsibilities</A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Teaching psychic abilities requires strong confidence in your own skills, and knowing your strengths, weaknesses, and limits. Teaching can also be one of the best ways to become more confident.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A relaxed, consistent teacher inspires confidence in students, which makes it easier for them to succeed. A teacher encourages students to explore on their own and trust what they find. This way, the student will continue to use the abilities well even without the teacher nearby, and this reduces the long-term burden on the teacher.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The most common problem a teacher helps with is lack of self-confidence. Doubt will make students quit early, withhold information, and generally be uncooperative. Games can help overcome that, by distracting the students from their doubts long enough to get results. This is also why the basic skills start very gradually. The first skills are for building confidence.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892960"><A NAME="_Toc457892779">Experimentation and Confidence</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Scientific experimentation too early reduces confidence and cause performance pressure. Instead, play games and practice without counting results. After the student has several months of experience, then controlled experiments can be done. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If the student has trouble with feeling pressured then, practice for many more months (or years) before controlling things. You wouldn't put a 16-year-old, inexperienced driver into a rush hour traffic obstacle course. You also can't expect an inexperienced psychic student to perform under high pressure.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Young children are sometimes the best to work with, because they are extremely open to learning and play easily. Invent games appropriate to the age of the children. Play them only as long as they are interesting and entertaining. Remember, too, that nobody is too old to learn.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892961"><A NAME="_Toc457892780"><A NAME="_Toc457811556">Traditions and Methods</A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">There are many different traditions for teaching psychic abilities. If a tradition works and you like it, use it. It's usually to your advantage to research a few other traditions and see how some things are done differently. You may find something useful. Various religions have different approaches, and there are also many methods that don't use religion at all.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">One requirement, though, is that the student and teacher need to be working with cooperative methods. They don't need to be the same, but they need to agree on some basics. Discuss spiritual or religious beliefs early. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Decide whether you will use a primarily mental approach, or a primarily ritual approach, or a combination of both. Decide on a mood that works well for both of you. Be ready to resolve disagreements in your perceptions. One or both of you might be wrong, or you may both be right but from different perspectives.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Determine how much responsibility is on the teacher for providing course material and direction, and how much is on the student. It doesn't matter which person has more, as long as you both agree to do it one way. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Will you follow a predetermined order of skills? Or, will you follow the student's interest and enthusiasm? Do certain skills need to be learned first before others can be attempted? How much feedback will the teacher give on each student's progress? Is it the student's responsibility to measure his or her own progress?</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Whatever traditions and methods you choose to use, be sure you agree on them or find a compromise to which you can both agree.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892962"><A NAME="_Toc457892781"><A NAME="_Toc457811557">Aura Interactions</A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">As you work with students, your energy and aura will affect theirs very strongly. Grounding, centering, and keeping your energy stable and clean are helpful. Your energy and psychic skill use will raise your students to a higher energy level and awareness. The more active you are around them, the faster their skills will develop.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">To some extent, this is very good; you're providing stimulus to a sense they are learning to use. However, it can be overwhelming for some students. You may need to lower your energy level, shield carefully and gently, and project less energy, to avoid flooding a few of the students. Your energy is many times stronger than theirs is, and so your control also needs to be stronger and more careful.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some students appreciate an occasional flood of energy; it helps them feel connected to you and confident of the link. It will tend to cause headaches and shield failure, though, so be aware of when you are doing it.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You have the capability of, literally, forcing the student's energy and aura to shift very significantly. This can be a great help in lifting the student past a difficulty or explaining and showing a new skill. It can also be misused and cause the student pain or more difficulty. The student has opened up to you as a teacher, with trust that you will be helpful. If you are instead hurtful, he or she will eventually shield you out and leave, and you'll both be prevented from a useful learning experience.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">On some skills, such as shielding and astral projection, psychic sparring or wrestling with energy can be fun. As long as the people involved agree and understand, it's a good workout. If they don't know ahead of time, they may perceive it as a real attack.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The teacher can also observe and influence the aura interactions between students. This can help strengthen a practice session with an empathic or telepathic link. It can magnify the strength of an energy effect, or add a stabilizing ground and center. It can also cut off a link or lower energy levels.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892963"><A NAME="_Toc457892782"><A NAME="_Toc457811558">Working With a Group</A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">Working with a group is very similar to working with an individual. Mostly, it takes more time and attention.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Keeping a stable mood is very important. As long as everyone is cooperating, and the mood is set, things will generally go well. If one or a few students are interfering with the mood, goofing off when it's not appropriate, or disturbing other students, remind them of the purpose of the meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">They are present to practice and discuss psychic abilities in a fun but serious context, and if they aren't interested they can simply leave. If they persist, tell each one, "You are interfering with the group. Will you be quiet and participate, or would you rather leave? Choose now." Don't be afraid to kick them out if necessary; you're in charge.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Encourage people to talk with each other, and let them answer each other's questions. Only offer information if no one else understands what's going on. Obviously, this is different when you first present a new skill. But once practice has started, let the students work with it and figure it out. Be patient. Some of them may
take longer than you're used to.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc457892964"><A NAME="_Toc457892783"><A NAME="_Toc457811559">Teaching Summary</A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="LEFT">As a teacher, your basic job is to present information that the students need, guide and encourage them to learn it, and make sure they understand and remember it.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can choose to use your energy and skills to help them past difficulties, or you can encourage them to confront the problems by themselves. You can choose to set the mood, or you can ask a particular student to set up a room ahead of time to help everyone settle (candles, music, pillows, whatever).</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Conduct your classes any way you choose. You're in charge; it's all up to you. </P>
