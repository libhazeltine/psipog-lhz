                  <p>Hey Peebrain, My question for you is this: I have tried in the past to get articles approved or even accepted ino the articles sections regarding topics such as Lucid Dreaming and Aura reading but i never received a response; do you respond to emails containing articles or do you just decide
                  whether or not they get accepted? Also, will you or other moderators write articles regarding Psychic healing?</p>

                  <p>Re-send them. Perhaps they got lost in the internet, or maybe I just forgot about them on accident. I get anywhere from 5-10 new e-mails a day, so sometimes things get thrown into the "normal" pile. Make your subject upper-case, that might help <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>What is a "normal" chat room? You mean a normal IRC chat room? We used to, and people were evading bans, and spamming their channels in our channel, and spamming their links in our channel, and doing join/part floods, and taking over the channel, and all that great stuff that comes with an IRC
                  channel. We didn't like that. So here we are now.</p>

                  <p>People who chat on windows aren't annoyed. I don't purposely exile the linux and mac people, you exile yourself. Windows is the most popular operating system in the world, and I am just one man. I can't make it work for everyone. It's the same reason I don't make a chat client for the Apple II
                  computers out there. You have chosen to use an unpopular OS, and this is the result. If I was actually getting paid to do this stuff, or if there were more than just me working on it, I might be able to add support for linux and mac, but I can't. Sorry.</p>
