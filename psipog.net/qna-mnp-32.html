                  <p>Hi I would like to know what it feels like to you guys when psi comes out of your body to form a psi ball because I think that my psi is staying in my palms and not coming out . Also what do you do to make psi come out of your hands if it is stuck .</p>

                  <p>thanks !!!</p>

                  <p>P.S. sorry if this question sounds stupid but I would really like to know if I am actually bringing psi out or not .</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>This is a pretty complex question, believe it or not. The nervous system is a fascinating, complex, not completely understood mistress.<br />
                  For your sake I'll give the abridged version of what happens, and then proceed to answer.<br />
                  Basically the nervous system is divided into two categories: Central and Peripheral. The Central (CNS) contains your brain and spinal cord and is generally involved in involuntary responses. The Peripheral (PNS) contians the rest of your body (other than brain and spinal cord) and tends to be more
                  associated with the response to environmental or outside stiumli.<br />
                  When your receptors detect pain, neurons (nerve cells) meet at a junction called the synapse. They send the message "Ow" to your brain (CNS), where the brain responds by moving or removing you from the stimuli that causes pain.<br />
                  What I suspect you're asking is how to increase the quantity of times your neurons meet.<br />
                  This is a much more simple answer.<br />
                  Keep yourself physically and intellectually fit. Exercise, or at least stretch daily. Keep physically active. Move your butt. Staying intellectually fit is more of personal choice. But when you learn or retain information, you create new neural pathways. Read. Play chess. Take a new route home. Put
                  up a poster board that says R-E-D but written in the color yellow, and do this for all the colors. It makes you think, and indirectly helps with what I think is your ultimate goal.<br />
                  Sorry for the lengthy reply, but you asked a nervous system question to a nervous system nerd, and this is what you get. Good luck.</p>

                  <p>With making visible psi balls, is it a matter of when your psi manipulatiion skills increase a psi ball for example, naturally becomes visible, or would programming be needed with that level of skill? Or am I just talking crap?</p>

                  <p>earlier today, I made a psi-ball to help one of my friends who had trouble breathing at the time. she was fine when I had the psi-ball on her throat, but as soon as I stopped, she started haveng trouble breathing again! I tried one on myself, as everyone I know had something hurtin or they were
                  sick, and when I stopped , I was fine for a few minutes. I'm wondering if this is supposed to happen, or does the fact that they were only my 3rd and 4th ones come into play?</p>

                  <p>Hi<br />
                  When ever I try to make a Psi-Ball, I always get to the point of the energy geting to my hands. But, my problem is getting it out of my hands and forming it into a ball. Do you usually force it out or let the energy come out on its own? And after that, do you concentrate to make it into a ball or
                  will it just do it on its own? And finally, can you ever lose control and have it drift away? Thanks for taking the timt to read this!</p>
