                  <p>When I first started I practiced psiballs for like five minutes maybe three times a day. But after a few days I noticed that I was in a really bad mood, like pms but worse. It stoped after I stoped practicing.<br />
                  Is this common? Should I stop practicing forever? Am I doing something wrong?</p>

                  <p>Hello all. I am not telepathic or telekinetic, as a matter of fact I'm not anything special. What I can do is manipulate people around me. I can influence their ideas and emotions, and have spent a couple decades trying not to. I've just recently decided that neglecting this is a waste and am
                  going to start practicing and working on what skills I know I have. I am still reading article after article and all the posts you have as a starting point. Too many sites are filled with people who want me to be warm and fuzzy and full of nothing but love for the universe. Frankly, while I'm not
                  looking to cause any grief to anyone, I want to exercise and learn control. There are a few dilemnas involved, but as I said, I'm still going through the many resources here. My question is, am I in the right place?</p>

                  <p>I want to thank SunTzu and anyone who helped with my last question, I have another question. Last night I was really shocked as in I put the psi-wheel two steps away and I willed it to move and it did. I used to practise it months ago and just yesterday I tried it and wow. I was freaked but didnt
                  loose faith. Is it normal for that to happen?<br />
                  Also I have another question, my friends in school was asking about psi and if anyone does it, is it advisable for me to show it to them because am not sure.I really need your help guys.Thanks if you read this and really appreciate you works and help.</p>

                  <p>Having PK work a time period after you have stopped practicing is not unusual. For a period of 3 weeks or so, it doesn't matter much, but as you give up practicing for longer and longer periods of time, the TK ability starts to decrease (although you mentally know what you need to do, you are
                  psionically unable due to lack of practice). Think of it as an athletic activity, you were able to run a 5 minute mile, and after not running for a while, you were able to run a 5:30 minute mile. If you continue to stop practicing, it will decrease, but over a period of three weeks, it's not very
                  significant.</p>

                  <p>Whether you tell friends/family/people on the street is completely up to you. Depending on who you ask personally, you will receive differing answers.</p>

                  <p>Using psionics is the same as using any other bodily function. Everyone possesses the ability for psionics. I have neigther heard nor experienced any kind of 'demons' while practicing. If moving your arm, running a mile, using your eyes to look around you, or your ears to pick up auditory signal
                  is not evil, how can using your brain to respond to more subtle messages be?</p>

                  <p>To be entirely honest with you, I do not know why they do this. Some people have hypothesized that it has to do with the crystaline structure of the rocks in question. They might be right, or they might be totally off base. Seeing as quartz reacts to pressure and electricity, too, the structure
                  idea probably has merit.</p>

                  <p>Sheilding against the ones that absorb energy is a simple matter. It's done pretty much the same way as shielding against other absorbtion things.</p>

                  <p>This kind of fits in every catagory, so I decided to put it here instead.</p>

                  <p>I can not seem to be able to do many of the things we are suggested to do before trying to do most psionic activies such as: trance, meditating (I have had a little success with this, but not a lot), or "thinking of nothing". This is most likely because I am Edison trait and a divergent thinker,
                  while most people are convergent. This basically means that my brian works differently than most people's. Instead of taking many thoughts and putting them together (like focusing on meditating) I take one thought and make it many. It's like ADHD, yet not, and is treatment isn't given (or
                  needed).</p>

                  <p>I know these things (trance, meditation, ect.) must improve your results when doing psionic activities, and was wondering if you have heard of someone else having this probelem or have any suggestions to help me.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>The mindset for psionics is one of "paradoxical compound of detachment and excitement" to quote one of the books I'm reading at the moment (a scientific study on telepathy and ESP in relation to micro-psychokinesis). What this means in practical terms is that you must be somewhat withdrawl about
                  the situation, but not to the point where you do not care for the outcome.</p>

                  <p>If you withdraw (using trance, meditation, ect.) too much, you don't care about what happens, if you don't withdraw enough, you aren't in the mindset of psionics.</p>

                  <p>Generally, trancing and meditation (for psionic purposes) are guides to get into this mindset. My suggestion to you is to use whatever you think is available to get into this "zone". Different things help different people. I know several people that use meditation, others that use trance, and even
                  one who stares at a fan (watching one blade) to introduce this mindset. Even if you stretch out your grounding/centering exercise, it can sometimes put you in the right mindframe.</p>

                  <p>All in all, try to be relaxed and focused, whatever helps you do this, go with it.</p>
