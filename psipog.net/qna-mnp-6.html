                  <p>there are one of two things going wrong here:<br />
                  1 - the psi-ball is there but you cannot sense it and you need to work on being sensitive to psionic energy.<br />
                  2 - the psi-ball disipates shortly after tossing and you need to work on shelling it.</p>

                  <p>I recommend making a well-shelled psi-ball, then trying to see if you can find it, to see whether it is 1 or 2. Also, if you have a friend that is into psionics, you could have them see if they could sense it.</p>

                  <p>hope this helps<br />

                  <p>Yes. Usually, they are hybrid constructs using psychokinesis. Some of the common names for them are "force bubbles", "TK shields", and "psionic force fields". If you can do PK, and you can make a shield, you can probably learn to combine the two skills.</p>

                  <p>Hello, I'm 13 and have started in the process of createin Psi Balls. I have had some experience with TK but soon lost track (I think I might start again). I haven't made a Psi Ball before and I was wondering... About how long does it take to make a regular Psi Ball on your first try? I was going
                  to try tonight but I don't want to stay up "all night long" trying to make a Psi Ball... I know, I know... Practice, practice, practice; I am willing to do all of the work but I would like to know *about* how long it will take for the average person with no prior expereince with Psi Balls to create
                  one?</p>

                  <p>Once you've figured out what to do (in other words, you've read the instructions and are fairly confident that you understand them), the average time to make a psiball for the first time, is between five and ten minutes. Most of that time is taken up with the gathering and/or generating of the psi
                  to make the ball out of. The gathering/generating part gets easier and faster with practice.</p>

                  <p>This presumes that you are not trying to make the thing visible. _That_ can take years of practice.</p>

                  <p>I read one question saying that the only Psi ball the person had ever made was after eating alot of candy and getting "hyped up". I asked this question in the chat room and they didn't know exactly. Well the question is, does sugar/caffiene realy help when doing anything Psionic? I doubt it would
                  help much while doing Out of body or somthing like that but would it actually help make a Psi Ball or a Shield or somthing in that category?</p>

                  <p>There is some evidence that caffeine affects telepathic reception, but it is unclear whether it actually strengthens the reception or just mucks up the normal defences. Sugar is _required_ for any physical activity, in the form of glucose in the cells, rather than sucrose specifically.</p>

                  <p>Ok, so here's my question. Whenever I focus my energy, I get a strange tingly feeling starting from the back of my head then it covers my whole body. And whenever I focus my energy to make a psiball I get the same feeling except it goes straight to my hands; what is that I feel? Also while I'm on
                  the subject of psiballs, I seem to be able to make one in my right hand easier than making one in both hands; does that seem right? Thanks for your time.</p>

                  <p>You are probably feeling psi... and I would guess it's moving like that because of either your visualization, or something you saw somewhere to get in your head that that's how it's suppose to work. Either way, no big deal - use it to your advantage <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Re: the "rule about your dominant hand and psi".</p>

                  <p>It has been observed, particularly by the late Beverly Jaegers, that one hand tends to be more receptive to picking up psi impressions than the other; while the opposite hand tends to project psi into things more easily. Key words: "observed" and "tends". We are not sure why this is so. _Usually_,
                  the dominant hand projects, and the off hand is receptive. However, it does mean that it is not overly surprising that your right hand is easier to work with, _if_ you are right-handed.</p>

                  <p>"Programming a construct" is nothing more than establishing what the psi-stuff will do. In the case of a psiball, the programming makes it be round, and to hold its shape, and to be where you put it whther it is still or moving. Optional programming would make it cold enough to affect a
                  thermometer, for example, to to give off light if it were flared.</p>

                  <p>How to do it? Read the "how to make psiballs" articles and the "construct" articles, first. That is what they are there for. Then, if you have specific questions, ask them in the "Manipulation" section of the Q&amp;A. Your current question is far too broad.</p>
