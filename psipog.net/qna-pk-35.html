               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>When a person produces telekinetic effects which they are not controlling, by accident or on account of "stress" or during convulsions, this causes a variety of "poltergeist" phenomenon. Overloaded telepaths and teenagers with -ehem- "hormonal problems" are the usual culprits. "Poltergeist" comes
                  from the German term for "noisy ghost", and the experience was once attributed to --yes, you guessed it-- ghosts. Whether _all_ poltergeists are attributable to out-of-control pk is still open to question.</p>

                  <p>Would playing an instrument, such as the piano, help with becoming more focused? I was just wondering, since I play the piano, and that I just realized that playing a song makes me go into a very relaxed state where I think of nothing but the notes.</p>

                  <p>Yes. Technical exercises are _great_ for focus. In addition to this, your "favourite" pieces to play are good for something like grounding, several kinds of music will help induce trance (some kinds of Baroque instrumental music is known for this, as well as some kinds of "Techno"...and of course
                  the various trance genres), and you can set moods artificially with music which can be useful in learning telepathic sending, especially the empathic side of it.</p>

                  <p>1. Practicing TK while in a dream, lucid and non-lucid. This doesn't seem to help, maybe it only helps a small amount and I can't tell though. I am a lot better at controlling what goes on in my dreams though <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>2. Asking for guidance from a "dream-character" concerning how to do TK while lucid. "He" gave me a meditation exercise... I don't know if it would work or not, because I never tried the exercise <img src="blah.gif"

                  How do i enter it? and how do you focus on moving objects ?<br />
                  I really would spend ALL of my free time to learn it but...i'm afraid that this is all just nonsense and i feer that i'l be waisting my time.<br />
                  So are you also sure that this is 100% and are you also 100% sure that i have this power ?</p>

                  <p>If you want to learn TK, then practice. It's that simple. Can I give you a 100% guarantee that you'll learn it? No... But I can give you a 100% guarantee that you WON'T learn it if you don't try <img src="wink.gif"

                  <p>Yes. Check out the article on "Force Bubbles"</p>

                  <p>Since this has been posted, there was a further question about Force Bubbles. The question concerned the amount of PK skill needed to make a force bubble. If you can consistently spin a psiwheel when you want to, stop it when you want to, and reverse its direction when you want to, then you
                  probably have enough control of your pk to make a decent smallish bubble.</p>
