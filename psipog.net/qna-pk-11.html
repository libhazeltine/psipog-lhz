                  <p>i have an imortant question, a more imortant question than my last question. me and my friend are into tk and we were talking and this question came up that never really occured to me: what happens if you're skilled at tk and get mad and knock someone you care about down and they get badly
                  injured? sorry if this is a dumb question and i know i'm not at this skill leve, i'm new, and you guys usually start out by answering questions like these by,"if you're not at that skill level you don't need to worry about it right now..." and i know that's true but i want to be prepared and i'll
                  probably forget to ask the question and it'll happen and i'll be sad. thank you for considering my question. i love you guys' site! bye</p>

                  <p>Before I answer this, let me say that although I practice telekinetics, I am unable to open any locking mechanism.<br />
                  That being said:<br />
                  Typically this is done more by sliding the locking mechanism back than actually unlocking the tumbler (mainly because it requires knowledge of the internal mechanical lock). That being said, it is done by sliding the lock back, in the example of a deadbolt, you can look at the crack of the door and
                  see it, and simply slide it back. for normal on-the-door style locks, it is done by sliding the part that locks into the frame back.<br />
                  NI unlocked a bathroom door (or two?) last I knew, by simply sliding the metal peice back.</p>

                  <p>Belief is not required. Visualization is not required. Using your eyes is not required. Teaching someone actually _how_ to perform tk is exceedingly difficult, especially if the would-be teacher is "good at it", precisely because the mechanisms are not well understood.</p>

                  <p>I've been reading a lot of questions concerning the effects of telekinesis and other psychic abilities on your health, and i was just wondering, what do you guys do to prevent these? obviously common sense is one thing, i guess; not overdoing it; but aside from being sure to keep your potassium
                  levels up, and staying in shape etc (common sense again) is there anything else that could help?</p>

In simple terms, if you need to know about Statistics and Probability in order to figure out if it worked, it is micro-pk. If you don't, it is macro-pk.</p>

                  Can you program a psi ball to move an object? and if so, would that be telekinesis?</p>

                  <p>I figure it's kinda the same, since telekinesis uses psi to move things. The only difference I see is in the energy destination. On psi balls, you direct the psi to the ball, but in tk the psi is applied directy to the object. Am I right, or are they 2 totally different things?</p>
