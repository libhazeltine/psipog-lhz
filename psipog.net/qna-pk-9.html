                  <p>I was playing with the pendulum experiment at the RetroPsychoKinesis (www.fourmilab.ch) and I found that I had much more success when I tried to increase the number below the pedulum rather than affect the pendulum. I was wondering 1)if this can still be considered PK, 2)if you have experienced
                  something similar, and 3) your ideas on why this may be happening.<br />

                  <p>Hello, i was interested in TK and decided that if I could make a psi ball my first day then maybe I could move the psi wheel in one day. And i did!! But ive only been moving the psi wheel for about 3 days now, but I want to move on to pencils. Is this a good idea? Should I wait longer before
                  moving to pencils? The last thing is when trying to move the Pencil, do I use the same tequneque(sorry if I spelled it wrong) as moving the psi wheel, just with more concentration? Do I HAVE TO MEDITATE???????</p>

                  <p>1) You can move on to pencils any time you feel like it.<br />

                  3) Lots of people find meditation helpful, for various purposes, but you do not need to meditate unless you want to.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Okay. I have a bit of a problem with moving my psi wheel. I can move my foil psi wheel quite easily, but 1. when I try to move it under a container, at it's very best it twitches, and 2. I can't move a paper psi wheel in the least. And one other thing- I can only move my foil psi wheel at a pretty
                  darn close proximity, say about 1-2 feet. So: my question is, Am I really moving my foil psi wheel, or is it some other fatcor, and Can I have any tips for moving psi wheels under containers? Thanks for your time.</p>

                  <p>At that distance, you are _probably_ doing it. As for the container thing, try starting with just a partial barrier, such as a book stood up in front of the wheel, before going to a complete containment. It _may_ just be a "mental block"; and if so, this should help.</p>

                  <p>unfortuneately, until you are VERY good at TK, it is virtually impossible to incorperate it into your everyday life. Typically, perceptive skills are easier to incorperate into your everyday life, whereas affective skills are a bit more difficult (you don't really need a psi-ball most of the
                  time). The only way I know of to use TK in your everyday life is to build a practice schedule, sorry.</p>

                  <p>First off, this website is amazing.</p>

                  <p>Over the course of my life, I've learned I can withstand VERY cold things. When I was little, I could finish cold treats in few bites, and think nothing of it. In the winter, I wear what I would wear during summer, and in reading your Fire and Ice article, found I can already hold ice cubes in my
                  hands until the melt without feeling much pain. I've always taken icy-cold baths. Does this mean anything?</p>

                  <p>We've known all along that the psi-wheel can be moved without TK. Convection currents, for example, will move it. In fact, we've been pointing this out for _years_. The fact that the effect can be produced by other means does not disprove the existance of TK. The psi-wheel is an exercise, not a
                  proof.</p>

                  <p>If you are looking for something that can't be duplicated without TK, stop a radiometer without interfering with the light source.</p>
