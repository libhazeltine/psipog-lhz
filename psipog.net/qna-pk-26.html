                  <p>This is probably a bad question, but I was jumping on my trampoline today. I tried to pick up a leaf and it moved! The more static I tried to obtain, the more it moved! Then I tried to control, and it worked a little! I can't do telekinisis, so that was pretty cool. My question is; was that a form
                  of telekinisis?</p>

                  <p>With the possible exception of some approaches to microPK, if you are practicing for...half an hour, was it?...and you don't feel tired at the end of it, you probably were accomplishing exactly nothing. If you _have_ tired yourself out, trying to merely change the kind of object you are affecting

                  <p>Wouldn't micro PK be considered a form of precognition? Are you really altering the outcome of something, or predicting what it will be? The question has been kind of bugging me, because the two skills seem so similar.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>In some cases, it is difficult to tell whether you precogged the event or affected it (microPK), but they _are_ different things. If you want to test it out with, for example, a pair of dice, try to force the dice to come up snake-eyes, every time, in a string of a hundred or more rolls.
                  (Snake-eyes: "one" on each of the two dice) If you can do that, it's almost certainly PK..._if_ the dice are not weighted (accidentally or otherwise) and thus _always_ come up snake-eyes no matter what you do, and _if_ you are not using some trick of the throw.</p>

                  <p>If you run a series of dice-throws where you try and get different results each time, then it is much harder to say whether it was precog, or whether it was PK.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>There are two types of psychokinesis: Macro and Micro. Macro-Psychokinesis (Macro-PK) is when you move an object with your mind. Micro-PK is when you alter the probability of something happening, like using a Random Number Generator (RNG). For example, if you use your will power to make a cell
                  phone fly across the room, then that is Macro-PK. If you roll a single die 100 times and get 60 number 2's, that's Micro-PK.</p>

                  <p>By the use of micro-pk is it possible to change the channel of a radio? The reason I ask is because the tuning of the radio changes the channel, so you'd have to turn the nob with regular pk, but seeing as it is an electronic, then there might be some kind of micro-pk way of doing it. Which is it
                  and why?</p>

                  <p>If you don't need to use statistical analysis to determine whether or not the pk attempt "worked", it is generally macroPK. Most approaches that would be used for that effect with the radio would be macroPK.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I started practicing TK about a month ago, when I first stumbled onto this site. Luckily, I was making progress immediately after watching the video here and reading your articles. The only problem is... I was practicing around 4 to 5 hours at a time, thinking the more time I practice, the better
                  I'll get, ignoring the warnings here saying that I should only practice 1 to 2 hours. Unfortunately, I got the headache that so many people warn about. Unfortunately, once I got over the headache, which was about a week later. I have been unable to move the Psi-Wheel. I have been practicing regularly
                  for almost two weeks now, with no results. The question is: Is this something that I will eventually over come, or did I burn out something when I was practicing too much earlier this month?</p>

                  <p>I'm really disappointed with myself since this happened. I was doing good, but ruined it all by trying to achieve too much. Well, if anything maybe this will show the new people out there not to make the same mistake that I have made, but hopefully, it's something that I will be able to get
                  through it without ruining my chances at doing TK.</p>

                  <p>Hey, I've hit a bit of a brick wall with my PK practice. The only thing I've tried at the moment is to spin the psiwheel, and I've succeeded. In fact I can spin it quite fast at a constant rate, but I can't get any control over it. I also have to have my hand by the side of the psiwheel in order
                  for it to spin, and my right hand makes it spin anti-clockwise while my left hand does the opposite. If I put a hand on either side it just wavers in the middle but doesn't really spin.</p>

                  <p>What's going on here? Why can't I stop it or change the direction, and why do I need my hands near it? Thanks.</p>

                  <p>Two obvious possibilities:<br />

                  <p>I had the same results when trying to move two pinwheels. The old one would go nuts, and the new one (that I was focusing on) would just sit there. This is what I think is happening. You are saying to your subconscious "hey, perform TK", and your subconscious says "ok... well there is the
                  pinwheel, lets move it". Now when you change the object, you are giving the same command with different intent. "hey, perform TK". Subconscious does the same thing it did last time. Instead, try this: "hey, perform TK on the red pinwheel". Then switch to "hey, perform TK on the blue pinwheel". Switch
                  back and forth. Then try "hey, perform TK on the pencil". See what I mean?</p>

                  <p>If you can levitate, then you can easily move the pinwheel. So, first learn the pinwheel, and maybe a few other hundred exercises (like moving pencils, marbles, forks, books, etc...), THEN <i>AFTER</i> ALL THAT worry about levitation. It's a waste of time to worry about it now. Start small, work
                  your way up.</p>
