                  <p>ok, i'm not sure if this belongs in perception or if it's even psi-related, but i've noticed that when i look at anything, the image i see are made up of tiny dots. Sort of like the dots you see if you look closely at a computer/tv screen. These "dots" are easier to see if you look at a blank wall
                  and they aren't after images, they're there also when i look at the sky or close my eyes. I was just curious, is this energy i'm seeing, or is this just how the eye sees things, and not psi-related?</p>

                  <p>This question has been bothering me ever since I came on to your website. Is it possible to use telepathy on non sensitive people and people that don't even know what psi is? Can you do things like pinging, sending, scanning, probing and dreamwalking?</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I was wondering if how i recieve impressions about things and people is similiar to how other (lack of a better word) "psychics" receive, because from my research is does seem that atleast those claiming to be psychics tend to recieve through their senses such as.. they "feel" someone touch them..
                  or "see" a vision of something.. or "hear" the thoughts of others.. i know that this is not exactly literal in the way they see, feel, hear, and taste the things they recieve, but you see i don't get any real visual or audio impressions.. i get (like ive mentioned in other posts) just something i
                  call a "vibe".. an emotional feeling which is the same everytime i feel it but by concentrating on it.. i kind of just understand what it means.. ive heard of things like a "sixth sense" and stuff like that.. but even that seems to involve flashes of images or hearing something.. does this just mean
                  i need to develop my skills more (their natural so ive never really tried) so that i can begin to get responses using my senses..or is this just another way to recieve..</p>

                  <p>The important question is how accurate the perceptions are, not the method your mind uses to interpret them. Your "vibe" sensations are not as common as visual impressions, but they can be just as useful...or more so.</p>

                  <p>Start simple. You said you can people what they are feeling better than they could. Start with that, and try to expand on it. Exercise what you CAN do, and try to amplify it. Play with it. Don't be afraid to experiment.</p>

                  <p>i am writing you this e-mail because i have some what of a problem and could use some assistance. The problem that i am facing is not realy how to use telepathy but realy how to turn it off. i'm not realy sure how this has happened or realy what to do about it. All i know is that i've tried
                  everything imaginable but have come up with almost no solutions. It's like almost every were i go and any place i am at. it seems like every single person can here what i am thinking. I try making phi shields and imagining lights geting turned off in my mind but neither realy work. There must be some
                  way to turn it off or put it away or something. So if there is any solution that could sugest that could help me turn off me telepathy. I would greatly appreciate it.<br /></p>

                  <p>Based purely on what you have written, I would very seriously suggest that what you are experiencing might not be telepathy at all. There are certain medical conditions that can produce the impression that everyone else can hear your thoughts. You might want to consider consulting your local
                  health-professional person.</p>

                  <p>Consider also, why does it seem that _every_ single person can hear you? Even if you were speaking aloud, not everyone would respond.</p>

                  <p>Remote Viewing is more "what to do with" psychic abilities, rather than being a method (or set of methods) for actually doing the psychic part of it.</p>

                  <p>What you're looking for is a method rather than a protocol, which is why your search has been unsuccessful so far. Clairvoyance, Precognition, Telepathy, and Psychometry/Retrocognition are all used in various protocols. Try looking them up, instead.</p>

                  <p>i was wondering if i can create a fear barrier around myself to get people to leave me alone when i don't feel like talking to anyone? i am not the best at empathy i am better at seeing the future, and thats about it. I want to learn this and i don't want to learn how to read others fealings
                  because i now the cons that come with it. i had it for a while but then i lost it when i stoped caring about anything anymore that over-rode my empathy. i don't want empathy back so: is there a way around that.</p>

                  <p>Can you, specifically? I have no idea. It can be done. One of the simpler methods is to Shield yourself, and program the shield to produce an empathic projection of fear. Of course, if you yourself cannot produce such a projection, you might find it difficult to program it into a construct.</p>
