                  <p>Do you have to visualise the psi ball when it is being created, or is it necessary only to feel it? I'm honestly far better in imagination within the scope of the mind than with visualisation in connection with the physical world, so the feel method is better for me.. the problem is that any
                  feeling just dissapears when I spread my hands from the supposedly finished ball...</p>

                  <p>You don't actually _need_ to do either. The "visualization" is only a crutch. If "feeling" works for you, run with it. You are not the first, and are unlikely to be the last, to do it that way.<br /></p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hi. My question is the following, i have read about psi and ki in several websites, and i noticed that ki is a lot more agressive then psi. By that i mean, the ki websites teach how to actually knock someone down (in intermediate training, you can imagine the expert training, and the psi websites
                  teach how to do shield, psi-balls, protection, healing and so on. Is ki really that powerfull? Or they just assume that ki is powerfull because of DBZ?<br />
                  Thanks in advance</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Interesting question there. In fact, it could be said that "ki" is less aggressive, if you went by the Reiki and related sites. In fact, however, the two terms are fairly broad, and overlap considerably. If it is a "subtle energy" (for lack of a better term...technically it is not an energy at
                  all), and you can knock someone down with it, if qualifies as "psi", by the usual definitions in scientific literature.</p>

                  <p>For some practical purposes, some people regard "psi" as being one distinct type of "subtle energy", rather than the mechanism or mechanisms which allow for psychokinesis and telepathy. Such people generally consider the stuff regarded as "ki" by the Reiki folks as a separate substance.</p>

                  <p>"Ki" effects done in the context of various martial arts might use any of a number of "subtle energies", the aforementioned "specific psi" among them. "Ki" effects mentioned on many websites, however, are products of their writers' imaginations.</p>

                  <p>Okay. If I ever Suceed in making a shield, what do you think I should program it to do. Should I just leave it with no programing only so i can feel it. Is that a good start for beginners.</p>

                  <p>If it is not programmed at all, it is not a Shield. It is just a bunch of psi-stuff that will probably dissipate rather quickly.</p>

                  <p>Seeing if the Shield is there is better done by having someone _else_ look for it.</p>

                  <p>Ok... i've been practacing for about 6 hrs straight now, i started out with a 1/2 in x 1/2 in piece of tin foil on a pinwheel, i used that for about 3 hours, then i made a 2in x 2in pin wheel, and used that for the past 3 hours, now i made a 5in x 5in piece... i can spin it, i cant control the
                  direction thou or stop it... i've never tried anything like this before tonight and i can spin the 5x5 pinwheel easily... does this mean that im gifted to a certain degree? or everyone does this on thier first day? im kinda freaked out a little bit but yet i keep trying heavier items... is there
                  anything else that i can do to make it even more of a challenge... i even put a cup over the 2x2 pinwheel and spun it, very slowly, but that just proved to me that wind was not a factor in this... i need guidence...</p>

                  <p>Slowly build up to it. Start with psi balls. When you can easily make a psi ball, start making bigger ones. Over time, keep making them bigger, and eventually try to make a "psi ball" around you (aka "shield"). Of course, it won't do anything productive if it's just a big psi ball; you have to
                  program it differently via visualization if you want some functionallity out of it.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I've been practicing psiballs and constructs... I can make shapes, float them around rooms, and sense where they are... however, when I program them to say, "stick together for 30 minutes and then self-destruct". I have trouble getting them to stay the entire duration, they usually end up fading
                  out after a few minutes unless I feed them more energy, I did program one to self-destruct after five minutes and I kept it alive for the whole five minutes and the self-destruct part worked... So my question is, Does longetivity come with practice or am I just doing something wrong?</p>

                  <p>Usually, it improves with practice. You've gotten it to work correctly for a duration of five minutes, so my guess is that --in your case-- it is simply a matter of continuing to practice what you've been doing. Keep the duration under ten minutes for a few weeks, until it is absolutely reliable.
                  Then, increase it in five minute increments, until you reach "one hour". After that, you can increase the increments to quarter-hours, half-hours, and whole hours, until you get it to a day or more.</p>

Do they like put their hands between my hands, but
                  would that break the psi ball or at least disturb and they cant feel under it or over it coz my ball always has pressure on the left or the right (unless i'm fooling myself lol) wel what do u suppose i do?</p>

                  <p>That's a good sign. There is always a possibility that you're fooling yourself though, so if you want to be 100% sure, try to find some people to confirm the psi ball. Personally, I used to put my psi balls on thermometers, and the temperature would rise. That suggests that it wasn't just "in my
                  head". Try to think of ways to confirm it.</p>

                  <p>I have a question about energy used to make psiballs. I know there is moon psi, sun psi, and earth psi. If you wanted to use light energy, it would be the sun, right? and Dark would be the moon? I'm really into the darkness thing and would love to use dark energy to make psi balls, butI don't know
                  what to use for the energy. I was thinking "Why not a shadow? It's supposed to be the dark side of you, so I'll use that" but I just wanted to ask about it first since I'm very new to this.</p>
