PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #24, for January 14th, 2006

"I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which
is to be flexible at all times."
- Everett Dirksen


Dear PsiPog Users,

Alright! The big news is: the forums are online and working! If
you haven't stopped by to check them out, then I encourage you to
surf to: http://www.psipogbb.net

The second thing I want to address is that I'm sorry for the
constant delay in newsletters. Hopefully you will forgive me.

Another update I've been working on is the updated backbone of
PsiPog.net. Along with this update comes a new PM system, which
I think is pretty cool. If you are curious, then check out this
link: http://www.psipog.net/bn/login.php

If you want to see how it works, then you can compose messages to
yourself, or you can send messages to a friend that you know will
be checking the new inbox. This new inbox is completely seperate
from your old inbox (which is good and bad).

Other than that, let's jump into the mail bag.

"I read the last newsletter and it said something about making a
construct that produces sound. But couldn't it also be
theoretically possible to make a construct appeal to any sense,
like smell, taste, (and no, not fashion sense)? Thanks!"

My comments: I suppose you can think of ways that ANYTHING can
theoretically be possible :-). However, looking specifically at
constructs designed for different senses... I suppose one way to
accomplish it could be to implant the perception of the sense
into the target's mind. I.e., maybe the construct doesn't
physically produce the sound waves in the air, but maybe it makes
the brain receive the same signals as if there were sound waves
in the air. OF COURSE: this is all in theory! Which means it
means nothing! For those curious, I suggest not sitting around
and thinking about how it can work, but instead to go out and
TRY SOMETHING.

"Such a construct can be created and 'sent'. It may not manifest
as you expect, however. I know this for a fact. As I sent such a
noise (more like a moan of discontent). I was even surprised when
"it" manifested. I was informed of it by the recipient. Wanted
you all to know it's possible. Took a week though to 'build'. It
was not easy, but simple... AND it was emotionally based energy."

My comments: Cool. I suggest trying to find a way to measure this
type of construct in a scientific sense. Perhaps turn on your
microphone for your computer, and try to create a sound. Then
later analyze it.

"I have had numerous psychic experiences, not the least of which
include many events which are commonly labeled as synchronicity.
A case in point occured last week. I had found out about an old
fort in my area where some children had been kidnapped 150 years
ago by Commanche Indians. One child was named Cynthia Ann Parker.
She was 9 and spent 25 years or so with the Commanche. She grew
up, married a chief and had three children of her own. One of
those turned out to be the last Commanche Warrior chief, Quanah.
I took pictures and uploaded them to a web so my wife and
daughters could enjoy (they living 300 miles from where I'm
working). My oldest daughter sent me a return e-mail stating how
she just happened to be reading a book about children kidnapped
in the Texas Hill country by the Commanche. She had just read
about Cynthia Ann Parker at more or less the same time I was
touring the fort. As stated I have had numerous events of this
sort, some more, some less profound. My question to you, and also
my biggest concern with these events is simply -- what does this
say about "free will"?"

My comments: Synchronicity is some I do hold a strong belief in.
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity ). Basically, it
means that there are some coincidences out there that are just to
bizarre and meaningful to be random. You have a good question,
and obviously I'm in no authority to ANSWER it, but I do have
some ideas that you might find interesting. I started having
these experiences after I developed a strong communication link
to my subconscious ( art-fire-and-ice.html6 ).
I don't think it violates free will at all. I think that instead
it relies on the belief that we are all connected in some way,
and can communicate in ways which we aren't aware. In your
example, perhaps you and your daughter had communicated in an
unconscious way, and came to the conclusion to explore
interesting facts about Texas Hill country. You may have both
unconsciously found that fact to be interesting, and then found
a way to make this interesting fact conscious. I.e., the free
will doesn't go away - it's just being expressed through
unconscious decisions instead of conscious ones. Keep in mind,
this is just a random idea, and by no means am I trying to say
that it must be how reality operates :-).

"I was trying to make a psiball the other day, I could not
concentrate enough so I tried the breath counting thing. It took
me over 30 mins to get to 20 without my mind drifting (I have a
very short attention span). I tried the psi ball again and it
literally burned me... I mean not like it was hot but I have burn
marks on my hands (not severe but still). I tried this a few more
times using advice from the site but only got to either extreme
heat or extreme cold. Could you maybe give me some advice on
controlling the temperature of a psiball? I want to do more
experiments with them but with this going on I can't hold onto
them long enough."

My comments: Well, the obvious solution would be to not hold onto
them! Set them down on some cement or something. If you want to
control the temperature, then you can try not putting so much
"oomph" into the ball. Move slower and monitor the construct's
progress. Change your visualization to something more tranquil.
For example, try visualizing the psi as water. And don't hurt
yourself!

"Me and my friends were in a circle watching me move peppermint
sticks. I was doing it succesfully taking only 15 seconds on each
until I tried to move one but instead 2 other candy canes moved.
How did this happen?"

My comments: LOL. That is a wonderful question. I have no idea.
And I wish I did have the answer.

Nirok writes:
"I wonder if you can drain a battery and use it like an energy
source. So I was thinking about taking two new batteries and
keeping one the same and doing nothing to it. To the other
visualize little shiny yellow balls being sucked out of the
battery into you. Then check the one you experimented on and see
if it has less energy. I have an mp3 player that shows how much
energy is left so just as an example I would use that to check."

My comments: Awesome! This is a wonderful idea. This is very
healthy skepticism and a good example of how to use logic to test
an idea out and see if it has any merit to it. Give it a shot
and see what happens!

Nerd It Up writes:
"I know it's a little late now, but in this past July's issue of
Discover magazine, there was an article about out of body
experiences and near-death experiences called "Extreme States."
A link to it is here:
http://www.discover.com/issues/jul-05/features/extreme-states/
but I don't know if you will have access to the complete article.
It was interesting that the magazine, a respectable science
resource, is not at all disparaging out of body experiences. The
article also mentioned quite a few studies of near-death
experiences--the one I am more doubtful of--and all of the
accounts seemed to be the classic idea including "such standard
fare as long tunnels, bright lights, giant rainbows, dead
relatives..." I'm interested in what effect these classic images
have on those experiencing the phenomenon, and also those
participating in other psychic activities."

My comments: Sweet, thanks for sharing the link!

"I've been practicing things such as basic energy manipulation,
psi balls, and tk on-and-off for about a year. Now, I have never
been very interested at all in things like remote viewing or
precognition. But the other day, when I was just-waking-up-but-
still-sort-of-asleep, I thought for some reason of calling
someone on my cell phone once I got up. I remembered that I had
left my cell phone on a counter in the kitchen the night before,
and when I thought about going to get it, I visualized the
counter and said to myself "but my mom or someone else who's
already up has moved it from that spot, because I don't see it
there anymore." I thought this was kind of odd that I could "see"
that without actually having seen the spot since the night
before, so I continuted to "look around" and noticed a cup
sitting on the counter as well. I also took note of the exact
position of the chairs and table in the dining room, and then
woke all the way up. When I was later out in the kitchen and
dining room, I was surprised to see that two out of the three
things I saw were correct. My phone was gone, and the chairs were
exactly as I had seen them, but I had only imaginied the cup. I
thought it was really weird that I had "seen" these things when I
had never even practiced remote viewing. Just wanted to share; do
you have any comments?"

My comments: Yes, and my comment is this - COOL! :-). The next
time you find yourself in the same state, try again, and note
your results.

"My friend and I were experimenting with psi balls when I was in
a bad mood. I then tried out something new- because the articles
said to experiment. If you are mad, sad, or guilty, try to make
a strong psi ball. Then put your bad feelings into it. Then,
terminate it! You will feel relieved afterwards. Just thought
you might like to know about that."

My comments: Heh, cool :-). This sounds similar to grounding.
