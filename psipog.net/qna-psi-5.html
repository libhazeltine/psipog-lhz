                  <p>From what i understand, most people believe that a calm collected mind is the most conductive state for ESP. I have seen eeg's of different people, one of the guys was doing remote viewing, and it showed that most of his brain was theta wave while a certain section was in beta going towards
                  *gamma*.<br />
                  What i am basically wondering is why emotions, and basically stress, which would be a beta brainwave producing feeling, be conductive of spontaneus ESP.<br />
                  I dont really understand how it can go both ways, calm collected, or stressed, and be effective.</p>

                  <p>I have been trying Psionics on and off for a while, and I have been wondering wether they truly do exist. I have found a way that this can be finally confirmed. The James Randi Educational Foundation at www.randi.org is offering $1,000,000 to anyone who can demonstrate psionics in action at their
                  controlled environment. You can apply at www.randi.org/research If you refuse to do so, please tell me why with a reasonable explanation. Thanks.</p>

                  <p>Hello! Great, interresting site by the way. I'm wondering about a skill which I don't believe you have brought up here, and I don't know if it fits in. It is the ability to communicate with animales. The reason I bring this up is because I know of a woman in my area who can. I find that it might
                  fit into the perception cathegory. And perhaps is there others who has the skill.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I've read the book 'The Elegant Universe' (thanks to Rainsong for suggestion btw) and I have a couple of thoughts/questions to share:<br />
                  If I understood the chapter 'Microscopic weirdness' correctly, at any given moment there is a very small but non-zero chance of all kinds of crazy stuff happening, quote:<br />
                  "The mathematics of quantum mechanics shows that the greater the energy barrier, the lower the probability that this creative microscopic accounting will actually occur. But for microscopic particles facing a concrete slab, they can and sometimes do borrow enough energy to do what is impossible from
                  the standpoint of classical physics -- momentarily penetrate and tunnel through a region that they do not initially have enough energy to enter. As the objects we study become increasingly complicated, consisting of more and more particle constituents, such quantum tunneling can still occur, but it
                  becomes very unlikely since all of the individual particles must be lucky enough to tunnel together. (...)<br />
                  But the probability rules of quantum mechanics -- and, in particular, the actual smallness of &#295; in the real world -- show that if you walked into a solid wall every second, you would have to wait longer than the current age of the universe to have a good chance of passing through it on one of your
                  attempts. With eternal patience (and longevity), though, you could -- sooner or later -- emerge on the other side."</p>

                  <p>So, could it be that "using psi" is not generating some kind of force, but rather somehow altering the probability of a particle spontaneously "borrowing" energy? It says earlier in that chapter that such fluctuation can happen between the measurements of it's energy (again, if I understand it
                  correctly, a "measurement" happens every time a particle interacts [collides?] with another particle?), which in normal conditions is a microscopically small time scale. Does that mean that one could increase the probability of such fluctuation by somehow decreasing the frequency of energy
                  measurements? Or maybe temporarily and locally increasing the Planck's constant? Well, honestly I don't know, reading this book makes my brain hurt sometimes :P, but when I read that part it struck me that it HAS to have something to do with psi. Think I'm on the right track?</p>

                  <p><br />
                  Ps. This site could seriously use a book section similar to Links but with a list of good (as opposed to "fluff") books about psionics and related topics</p>

                  <p>I am a bible believing christian and do not believe in the use of witch craft or any type of occult majic witch comes from satan.

                  just pure plain old nevous system generated realy cool physical energy? I hope we all believe psi balls are science and not from weird spirits that I don't believe in.</p>

                  <p>There is a science behind psi balls though. I mean... that's kind of the point of this website. We're NOT stressing religion, and presenting the science behind it. Maybe "Satan" is just fooling all of us? I don't know. What I do know is that many people, of many different faiths, practice
                  Psionics. The same way many people, of many different faiths, practice baseball. It's a skill. Can you be mean and use your skill to do bad things? Yes. That is your decision though. I would not recommend it, but that's your choice. Can you be super nice and help a ton of people with your new skills?
                  Yep. That's your choice.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>People always seem to use psi and energy interchangeably. Psi is supposedly some substance excreted by the nerves, while energy, I guess, is used to mean some form of psionic energy, a variation just like light energy, sound energy, kinetic energy, etc. A psi-ball is called a ball of psi, and yet,
                  it is also called a ball of energy. This can't work. Peebrain mentioned heavy constructs and heavy shields that he could feel weighing down upon him, but if constructs are energy, then they can have no weight. I'll admit that using telekinesis or telepathy most likely involves some sort of energy
                  wave, but if so, I don't see how they involve the use of psi. Does anyone have any ideas on this subject? I did think of one thing, however. Einstein theorized that light is actually made of particles called photons, which are quanta, little "packets" of energy. Could this be how the psi/energy thing
                  works?</p>

                  <p>Another thing: In his psiballs article, Peebrain says to take energy from any source to make your psiball. Are we supposed to take this literally? People mention *actually* taking energy from the sun, moon, Earth, and the like, but this isn't really physically possible. If psi is a substance, or
                  even a particle, excreted by the nerves, then what would it be doing inside stars, planets and moons? And if it's energy, how are we even taking energy from these places? I started to think that he said this only for visualization purposes, but then I went back and reread the article. "You can use
                  your energy, but you will run out faster and get tired" and "Usually planets/stars/moons are a good choice because they have a lot of energy" both stood out. Apparently, the "take it from any source" thing is meant literally. And if "You can use anything as your source of energy," why not use
                  something billions of light-years away? The only problem would be, unless the psi/energy moves faster than the speed of light, it will take billions of years or longer to start making your psiball. I'm guessing that most "nons" won't want to wait that long to start out in psionics. Anyway, the
                  article obviously expects instantaneous energy drawing, which is a physical impossibility and a contradiction.</p>

                  <p>I hope I don't make anybody mad by writing this; it's a good article, Peebrain, and it works, and I thank you for writing it.</p>

                  <p>What is the truth? I don't know - figure it out! Practice, experiment, figure it out for yourself, and then maybe one day write an article for PsiPog explaining YOUR point of view. None of this is written in stone, and as you've noticed, some things contradict. We all are learning on our own path,
                  at a different pace.</p>

                  <p>Okay, here's a question that's been going on in my head. How does any psi skill bit work? Remote viewing, telekenetics, etc. etc.? Not as in what you visualize, but as in what's causing the change? Nanites, heat waves, what?</p>

                  <p>The mechanism is pretty-much unknown still. Evidence points to it _not_ being electromagnetic in nature, although it has some properties in common with electromagnetism. It also has some properties in common with plasmas. Heat-waves are out, because they don't maintain their "strength" over the
                  distances at which psionics can operate.</p>
