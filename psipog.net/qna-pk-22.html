                  <p>Two 2 part questions about TK:</p>

                  <p>1.a. Is it possible to use TK to do stuff you could normally do with your hand? Like tap someone on the shoulder, punch someone in the face, or shape play-doh into a very specific shape.</p>

                  <p>1.b. If so, could you use your TK "hand" to feel things? Like sticking it outside to feel if it is raining, or to feel if something is hot or cold.</p>

                  <p>2.a. Is it possible to use TK through things, like a glass bowl?</p>

                  <p>2.b. If so, is there anything that you can't TK through?</p>

                  <p>1a) Yes.<br />
                  1b) You have mistaken your metaphor for reality. PK affects things. The other psionic effects perceive them. The effect described in (1a) does not involve a literal hand.<br />
                  2a) Yes.<br />
                  2b) Yes, but these are few and far between, generally involving exotic forms of Shielding.</p>

                  <p>Making an iceball involves cooling down some water to the point of freezing. The spheroid shape could be problematic, but I'd suggest round "ice-mould trays", or perhaps a water-balloon. Fill with water, and chill until it freezes.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>A litle while ago I asked about a mentor in telekinesis. Well see the thing is, I am a witch, and I had been having premonition-like prophetic dreams about telekinesis. So I figure that the lord and lady are trying to tell me something. So through my best interpretation, I can only deduce that I
                  am ment to have this power. I don't know why, maybe I had it in a past life? But I do know that I would know have had these sighs about if if I weren't meant to have this ability. So I ask one again, will any of the teachers here be willing to mentor me in telekinesis?</p>

                  <p>If the Q&amp;A section were a FAQ in practice, this question or some variant of it would be in the top five.</p>

                  <p>It is not entirely impossible that one or another of the (other) writers here might take such a querant under his or her wing, but it _is_ unlikely. The sheer number of such requests, combined with the rather limited number of "teachers" here, further combined with the commitment and effort
                  required to mentor even one person, conspires against it.</p>

                  <p>Dreams of Psychokinesis are not uncommon among folks with an interest in psionics, or indeed with an interest in science-fiction, anime cartoons, or stage-magic.</p>

                  <p>If your Lord and Lady desire this of you, Zeladene, perhaps some effort on your own behalf should be shown. Try out Peebrain's and NI's instructions, read other accounts of how to accomplish it, give it some practice on your own. Such devotion might please your Gods, and even if it doesn't, the
                  fact that you had put forth some effort and initiative might convince someone to put the effort into helping you.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Please forgive me if this question has been answered somewhere within the depths of the Q&amp;A area, but searching through 12+ pages for one answer isn't exactly my idea of a fun night. Anywho, on to the question. I have been practicing PK for awhile now, and I am getting sort of adept in
                  spinning the psiwheel. What I am wondering is, when I don't have something covering it, I can control it rather well, though it does have the tendancy to spin counter-clockwise, but when I cover it, I can't make it budge. I know it isn't air currents, ect., because I have control of making is stop,
                  go, somewhat with direction, and speed. So I guess what I am asking is: How do I kill this mental block? And how can I get it to spin clockwise better? Thanks.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>I'll answer the second one first: to get the clockwise spin to work better, you might need to give it more time in the practice. Most people have a direction that they work better in, for spinning in figure skating, direction that sketched animals face, and yes, for pushing psiwheels with bits of
                  oomph. Don't worry about it. As long as you can change the direction even a little bit, you have the basic tk stuff under control. Finesse comes with practice.</p>

                  <p>As for the mental block, be sneaky. Start with just a little "wall" in front of the psiwheel.....in fact start with a wimpy wall. Hand a paper towel or a handkerchief in front of the wheel, and peer over the top of this improvised drapery while spinning the wheel. Then, repeat with a book or
                  loose-leaf binder standing on end, in front of the wheel. Add another wall, by standing the book on end open at roughly ninety-degrees....and so on. If you have access to an empty plastic pop-bottle or clear plastic tumbler that you can cut, make a partial dome by cutting a whole "for the oomph to
                  get through", and put the dome over the wheel. When you can make it spin in the cheater-dome <img src="wink.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       border="0"
                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" /> , _then_ you should be ready for a "real" dome enclosure.</p>

                  i have an idea and it seems to get good results with pyro pk<br />
                  well first you fill the object with energy and then make that energy become excited like all moving fast and randomly and this seems to get the atoms going as well heating up the object so far i've tried this on a pin wheel and one of the corners shriveled up and turned black as if it were burnt but
                  with out the flame</p>

                  <p>so what do you think is this actualy pyro pk or just manipulation?</p>

                  <p>Blue to green and back isn't all that odd. To keep it in check, other that the reflected changes according to what you are wearing, keep your emotions even. Colour changes in the eyes are usually on account of changes in bloodflow. Biofeedback is the way to go, here.</p>

                  <p>Or coloured contacts.</p>
