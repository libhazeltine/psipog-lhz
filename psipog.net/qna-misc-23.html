                  <p>If you are asking how you can find out whether you can do telekinesis, the obvious answer would be: try it. Give it some serious practice for a few months and see what happens, or doesn't.</p>

                  <p>Practicing one of the perceptive skills consistently tends to increase skill in other perceptive skills. The same trend is _not_ apparent in affective skills. I don't know why. My _guess_, and it is only a guess, is that the perceptive skills overlap in the actual nature of the abilities.</p>

                  When i practice psi, ive always felt pressure building in the general "third eye" area, and i recently made an exercise to "open" when I was done i noticed psi was much easier to munipulate. Has anybody heard of this before?<br />
                  Thank you for your time. oh and if it sounds like a good idea, should i post an article on it?</p>

                  <p>The use of the Chakra paradigm is relatively common in energy work of many kinds, and it has been known to show up in some psionic methods. Generally, the Chakra methods in question are based loosely on Theosophical teachings. I personally do not believe in Chakras, but if that method works for
                  you, run with it.</p>

                  <p>Hey there. I guess it's an individual thing, but I am curious as to how much your morals are involved when using psionic skills. For example, cheating in exams, winning money in bets etc. Me? I guess if I had it I'd use it, however another person's judgement could say that I'd be unfairly taking
                  advantage. At what point do you say "no"? Are there people that don't say "no", like those mentioned by Peebrain in reply to flip's question? Thanks!</p>

                  <p>"Psionics" is a set of skills. How you use your skills is a matter of personal ethics. If you would cheat in exams by other means, there is not much stopping you from cheating psionically. If you like to use your other abilities, to help others, then you can use psionic abilities to do so, as
                  well. Morality and ethics are no more and no less connected to psionics than to any other set of skills.</p>

                  <p>Do you think it is possible for there to be psi activated things that can only be used by psions? Like walk through mazes that need special skills to get through obsticals, or even boats, planes, or vehicles that use psi to be controlled or turned on, maybe security systems that can only be turned
                  off by psions, or maybe even using psi to compact light into a solid beam like a light saber? What are your views on this? (okay that last part about the light saber was a bit fluffy, I admit. :p)</p>

                  <p>I have found that to be proven false, actually. I know people who use psi in a VERY malicious manor, and they've been doing it for quite a while now. As for ethics of a certain action, that is up to you to decide. We all have our own moral beliefs and such... One concept that I use is: if I
                  couldn't use psionics, would I still find a way to accomplish the goal? For example, is it right to use TK to trip an old lady? Well, for me, no, because I wouldn't do that normally if I didn't have TK.</p>

                  <p>Flip, you ask a very good question. Somehow the White-lights-and-fluffy-bunnies brigade have managed to establish a myth that "psi can only be used for good and selfless purposes". The myth in question is totally bogus. Some of its _possible_ origins are:<br />
                  a) excuses for why a working did not work,<br />
                  b) excuses why a certain person's methods don't work for anybody other than (allegedly) the (guru-wannabee) writer<br />
                  c) a method of scaring newbies into not trying to use their skills for unpleasant purposes<br />
                  d) transferring beliefs from some "magickal" traditions.</p>

                  <p>If using one's abilities for malicious purposes immediately stripped one's "powers", I would not --repeat _not_ have any psionic ability any more. Unfortunately, pk and telepathy are not that easy to get rid of.</p>
