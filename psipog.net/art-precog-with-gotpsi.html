         <p><em>by Vigil</em></p>

         <p><a href="http://www.gotpsi.com">GotPsi.com</a>, put together by the Boundary Institute, has several tests to statistically record results of people while they attempt to receive information using "psychic ability." The test that I have the most experience with is the Location Test, although I've spent a
         lot of time with the Card Test too. Both of these tests are attempting precognition of an event (either the location of the target or selecting the card) the computer will randomly select AFTER you have made your selection.</p>

         <p>I'm getting pretty burned out on the games, so I'm taking a break. I wanted to get the information out to everyone who had encouraged me to write an article. I'll be using the Location Test for this article but I believe the things I'm talking about here are applicable to just about any type of psionic
         receiving.</p>

         <p><b>What worked for me?</b><br />
         Well I was going to spend a lot of time and explain all the different methods I tried, but I've changed my mind. I've decided to give some guidelines that the methods I used had in common (when they worked).</p>

         <p><b>State your desire and release it.</b><br />
         You have to tell your subconscious what you want. I did this a number of ways for the location test:</p>

         <ul>
            <li>Visualizing the mark on top of the target</li>

            <li>Vividly imagine feeling the success as you get perfect score (<i>not</i> the glory you'll receive from everyone when they find out how cool you are)</li>

            <li>Simply ask yourself where the target is</li>

            <li>Imagine yourself as microscopic and falling towards the center of the target, the red "bulls eye" spreading from horizon to horizon.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>Releasing the desire sounds a bit tricky, but it's not. Just shift your focus to something else and let the request take care of itself. Know that it's taken care of, just like if you asked a trusted friend to do something.</p>

         <p>As you practice doing this you'll start to see yourself releasing/trusting yourself to do it. To me this feels like a trance that gradually (or sometimes, suddenly) comes over you. Like when you're watching TV or reading a book and realize hey I'm kinda zoned out here. Pay attention to this feeling and try
         to act/click on the target when it occurs.</p>

         <p><b>Focus.</b><br />
         You have to focus on the outcome you desire, not the consequences of the outcome you desire. If you are so caught up in how cool it will be when you tell everyone your score (that's my favorite) or anything else that might distract you, you are not focused on the desired outcome.</p>

         <p><b>Keep it light and fun.</b><br />
         I found that keeping a carefree attitude really had a huge influence on my accuracy. It really helped if I thought of the target as "alive" and "playing" with me (ok, don't laugh, I know it sounds dumb).</p>

         <p>If you find yourself getting frustrated or burnt out (and your scores plummeting) take a break. Putting a lot of pressure on yourself to perform is a good way to get aggravated.</p>

         <p><b>Finally.</b><br />
         Just a few side notes before I close. This was my first attempt at sustained psi activity. It really had it's ups and downs. I was really new to PsiPog and psionics in general when I started. But I've noticed that when I was practicing the Location Test daily my shielding benefited as did my practice sessions
         with the gang on #psipog chat doing "ping" and "guess the shape."</p>

         <p>It seems that all this stuff is related somehow. This is why it doesn't bother me to move on to another project even though I haven't mastered the Location Test. So, if you're burnt out trying to move the psiwheel or make a visible psiball (or whatever is your long-term goal) don't be afraid to take a
         little break. Come back to it later, just work with something else for a while.</p>

         <p>As long as I'm practicing and trying to improve one area, I think that everything benefits to one degree or another. I might add that this is true for all areas of life, not just psi related skills.</p>

         <p>Well I'm pretty much done. Thanks for reading my rambling and I hope that it is helpful to someone.</p>
