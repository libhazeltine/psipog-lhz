                  <p>Hurray!<br /><br />Using ErikJDurwoodII's ideas, JoeT and myself have reproduced results on my 
geiger counter.<br /><br />So what exactly happened?<br /><br />Erik came to me a couple weeks ago, and was excited 
about his ideas and theories, and that he would be able to test them out.  If you don't know Erik, he's basically a mad 
scientist.  He is <i>very</i> knowledgable in science, and has some really cool ideas.  Plus he's down to earth at the 
same time, and while he has crazy ideas - he recognizes that they are crazy and can laugh about it.  So he's a cool 
guy.<br /><br />One night, he got JoeT and some other people on <a href="http://skype.com/" target="_blank">Skype</a>.  
I wasn't there for that experiment, but he basically got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger_counter" 
target="_blank">geiger counter</a>, and something he called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer" 
target="_blank">transducer</a> (I think?), and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope" target="_blank">oscilloscope</a>.  Using these devices, he had JoeT focus on the transducer, and by mistake he noticed his geiger counter going crazy.  He checked the basics to make sure JoeT was the one actually affecting it, and it turned out correct.<br /><br />So the next time I saw him, he was really excited about his first successful experiment, and told me his theories (which I barely understood) about what was happening.  My reaction was to buy a geiger counter as fast as I could so I could reproduce it in my room <img src="s_smile.gif" width="12" height="12" />.<br /><br />I purchased the <a href="http://www.blackcatsystems.com/GM/products/GM10GeigerCounter.html" target="_blank">Black Cat System's GM-10</a> geiger counter for about $170 after shipping.  When it arrived in the mail, I was really excited to test it out.<br /><br />Erik first reproduced his experiment, but this time with me watching, so I could see how it was setup.  Over his webcam, he showed me his geiger counter, transducer, and oscilloscope.  First, I tried to get the geiger counter to go crazy, like he described JoeT doing it.  I failed.  Roy tried.  He failed.  So finally we invited JoeT to do it again... The average detection range for a geiger counter sitting in a normal room is anywhere from 8 to 25 counts per minute (CPM)... and it'll usually average between 12 and 15.  When JoeT focused on it, he got the counter to max out at 47 CPM.  Very significant.<br /><br />So I was thrilled!  I posted <a href="2006/06/geiger-counter.html" target="_blank">this</a> entry in the blog out of excitement.  However, we still hadn't reproduced the effect on my geiger counter.  When JoeT tried, he was pretty burnt out, and we couldn't measure anything significant.<br /><br />Just today, myself and JoeT were messing around with my geiger counter.  Erik's counter is analog, but mine is digital, and I wrote a program to graph the results.  Below is a 10 minute span of a normal graph:<br /><br /><center><img src="normal-geiger.gif" width="300" height="158" style="border: 1px solid black;" /></center><br /><br />Sorry it doesn't have any units on it, but basically the X axis is time (in seconds), and the Y axis is CPM.  The normal resolution is 600 x 315 (600 seconds equals 10 minutes), but I resized it to make it fit in this blog.  The green line represents the average, and the gray line represents the "highscore" (in the graph above, the highscore is 22 CPM).<br /><br />When JoeT and myself were messing around, we tried a few different configurations.<br /><br />1. 10:40am - First, JoeT tried sending to the geiger counter itself, without a live video feed.   Nothing.  (As a side note, Joe was really screwing up his monitor because he was using that as a sending point.)<br /><br />2. 10:56am - Then I thought maybe the steel transducer in Erik's experiment was doing something, so I stuck a metal lock in front of my geiger counter (the next closest thing that I own <img src="s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" />).  And then I set up a live video feed for JoeT to target through.  Still no luck. (As a side note, Joe did fry my internet connection at this point.)<br /><br />3. 11:23am - I put some radioactive marbles in front of the counter so we could make sure the counter actually was working - and it spiked at 68 with the marbles.  So the geiger counter was working fine, but we just wern't getting results.<br /><br />4. 11:45am - So JoeT had the idea of putting a <a href="../artimg/paper.gif" target="_blank">psiwheel</a> in front of it, and Joe would try to move the psiwheel and see if the geiger counter was affected.  Nada.<br /><br />As usual, we were just sitting around talking in the chat, sort of thinking about what to do next.<br /><br /><tt>[11:55] &lt;JoeT&gt; I can't hit the target for shit today.<br />[11:55] &lt;peebrain&gt; it happens<br />[11:56] &lt;peebrain&gt; I can't hit stuff right in front of me, so dont feel bad ;-P</tt><br /><br />After I sent that message, I thought to myself, "Well, I haven't actually played with a psiwheel in over a year... I could at least try."<br /><br />So I focused on the psiwheel for maybe 30 seconds, just trancing out a little bit.  I got a solid connection to the wheel, and "saw" the energy field around it.  I started to play with it a little bit, and tried to spin in.  It didn't spin, but it started to do the wobble thing (those who practice with psiwheel's probably know what I mean).  Anyways, I looked up, and the graph had maxed out at 36 CPM!  I freaked out.  Joe kept telling me to try to do it again, but it was too late... I was already really excited and way too scatter brained to get into a trance again <img src="s_smile.gif" width="12" height="12" />.  I took a screenshot of the graph:<br /><br /><center><img src="spiked-geiger.gif" width="300" height="158" style="border: 1px solid black;" /></center><br /><br />You can see a clear spike in activity, and it's much higher than normal.  It occurred <i>exactly</i> when I started focusing on the wheel, and ended <i>exactly</i> when I looked up and noticed the huge spike, and freaked out.  You can see the gray line maxed out at 68 from messing with the marbles, at the very top (which we did 35 minutes prior).<br /><br />Now that I've reproduced the effect on my end, I'm blown away.  I'm definitly going to start practicing more, especially now that I have measurable results that I can compare against from day to day.  If anyone wants to reproduce the experiment, there is more than enough information in this post to do so.  If you'd like to use the same graphing software, you can contact me in the <a href="2006_06_01_archive.html" target="_blank">chat</a>, or drop me an e-mail at: peebrain@psipog.net .<br /><br />Exciting times!<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>I haven't actually coded for the new PsiPog in a while, but I've finally started at it again.  I've coded over 800 lines this weekend, and everything is going really smoothly.  I will probably code some more after this break.<br /><br />Either way, I'm excited about it <img src="s_smile.gif" width="12" height="12" />.  I am a computer nerd, and I find elegant code and design to be very satisfying <img src="s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" />.<br /><br />I'm hoping to have a prototype up by August.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>ErikJDurwoodII, from the <a href="http://labs.megatroniconline.com/">PRG</a>, has discovered a way 
to measure psi.  Scientifically.  I witnessed it with my own eyes (and ears) just last night.  I'm close to getting the experiment replicated in my room, and once I do, people will be able to get an actual number that represents how much they're affecting matter using psi.<br /><br />This will be a huge step forward, and it's crazy to think that Erik has accomplished something that no scientist in the past has done.  Hit me up in the <a href="2006_06_01_archive.html">chat room</a> if you'd like to hear the current status of this project, and help experiment.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>Wow.<br /><br />I never thought I would say this, but I am 99.9% done with the new database structure, and I'm actually happy with it!  Imagine that!  I'm a very anal programmer, and when programming I am always in a constant struggle between effecient code, and "correct" code.  If you're not a programmer, you might not understand the difference... Basically, if I don't have an elegant solution to a problem, that is both fast, and makes perfect sense, then I become very irked.  A lot of times you need to sacrafice one for the other... so you have a system that works mostly, but has a few awkward bugs because of the sacrafices you made for speed.  Or you have a system that is very robust and complete, but slow as hell.<br /><br />Over the past three days I've been busting my balls on getting this structure elegant, and I've finally finished <img src="s_smile.gif" width="12" height="12" />.  Luckily, it was already in pretty good shape from previous "eurika!" moments (like <a href="2006/03/ideas-on-psipog-in-motion.html">this one</a>).<br /><br />Ahhhh what a sigh of relief.  Now I can safely code the PHP with confidence that the datastructures are perfect.  And who says perfectionists never get anything done?!<br /><br />~Sean</p>
