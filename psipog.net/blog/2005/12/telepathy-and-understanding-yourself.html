                  <p>Hey hey <img src="../../s_smile.gif" width=12 height=12 />,<br />I wouldn't say I could read someone's thoughts, but I would say I can read their thought patterns.  By this I mean, if you think of something, I might be able to lock onto it and see it... but if I watch you operate for 5 minutes, I can <I>easily</I> see the natural thoughts and decisions that go through your head.<br /><br />I can read your natural emotions, read the thoughts as they emerge in your head, watch it unfold into the physical movements you make... I can track the decisions you make and the underlying philosophies you hold that direct these decisions.  I see the motivations behind each thought, and why that thought even existed in the first place... sometimes I can even track these thoughts back to memories in your head.<br /><br />Now, one curious question is: is this psychic?  Is information being transmitted to me by some unknown means?  Or maybe I'm just good at reading body language?  Again, I address this issue in previous posts: I believe the answer is - BOTH.<br /><br />We form the idea that our psychic acts must be seperate from our "normal" acts, and that we decide when to "be psychic", and then we decide when to turn it off, and "be normal".  I believe this entire seperation is an illusion, and ultimately, it's stupid and will cause you to misread and fail.<br /><br />Complete integration is very important.<br /><br />Now, onto a different topic... I believe a lot of my understanding of others' thoughts come from understanding my own thoughts.  Take the realization that: the thoughts you have are 99% similar to the thoughts of everyone else.  It's not hard to predict thoughts and understand motivations, when you can inject a personallity into your mindset and watch the natural thoughts unfold.  If I want to predict your thoughts and decisions, I can just inject your background and complete perspective into my mind, and let my mind make decisions ONLY BASED on what I injected (not other information that is in my personal brain that makes up my background of experiences).<br /><br />The more I understand myself, the more I understand others.  It's easier to probe into my own mind than to probe into the minds of others.<br /><br />Soooooo..... what have I done with this?  Well, just recently I had a talk with my mother about the thought patterns she displayed, and why I thought they were bad decisions.  At first she was very defensive (which is normal when someone attacks the decisions you are making), but as my predictions starting getting in synch with other areas of her life, then she started to trust my opinions more.  For example, if I can tell her something about her life, that there's no way I can normally know, then while she will want to act defensive, the bigger part of her is sitting there thinking, "How can he see this?  If he sees this, which I have kept very hidden, then what else can he see?".  Very rarely do I actually unload all the observations I make to the person I'm observing, for obvious reasons that a lot of times they won't like you afterwards.  But I have found that if you show understanding, and show an intent to honestly help the person, AND also are extremely accurate and can nail things that they would never think was possible, THEN they will actually be very open to your suggestions and look to you in the future to see "your take" on it.<br /><br />I nearly forgot - I had a (sort of) OBE last night (this morning).  I had this OBE at my Grandmother's home in Flordia, which brings the total OBE locations to 10 I think.  (That means I've OBEd in 10 different locations, and every OBE to this point has correctly happened in my current location - which is strong evidence that it isn't a dream).  The OBE lasted about a minute, and consisted of me bending my body in strange directions... I never really got "out" entirely, but I did manage to bend my legs through the bottom of my bed <IMG SRC="http://psipog.net/blog/s_smile.gif" width=12 height=12 />.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>I'm the same way. I read into peoples body movements. I think it boarders more on psi. Each movement you know the reason behind that movement/action.<BR/><BR/>I found myself laughing at things my friends did cause i knew the stupid reason they did it but no one else picked up on it. I would figure its just something everyone can do but then realized not many people can view things from my perspective. Thats when I knew it was more psychic then common sense.<BR/><BR/>~BoomBoom</p>
