               <div class="blogPostBody">
                  <p>I've read psychic books that say my "psychic personallity" is one where I do a lot of psychic things, but reason them off with logic without giving them much thought, because I consider them "normal".  I find that interesting.  One area where I find the most problems is precognition (the other area being telepathy).<br /><br />In precog, we supposably predict the future - however, I also think of myself as mostly smart, and I reason that I can accurately guess the future pretty good.  I reason that I'm using my intelligence and "normal" predicting capablities, and nothing psychic is going on.  However, sometimes things are a little iffy, and it makes me think.<br /><br />Recently a lot of my predictions have been coming true.  For example, I needed to complete paper work to leave my current base (I'm in the Air Force).  I predicted that the paper work was done incorrectly (even though I was told it was correct twice), and that I would have a problem with it.  It turns out it <I>was</I> incorrect, and I <I>did</I> have a problem with it close to my departure time... which caused me a lot of stress (luckily I got it fixed in time and left on schedule).<br /><br />Now this sort of things happens to me a lot.  However, I can reason that there are a lot of ways I could have figured it out that aren't psychic-related.  In this example, I knew the person who said it was correct was actually an idiot (from previous encounters with him).  I knew he was lazy, and didn't care if paper work was correct or not.  I knew it was "too easy" to fill out, and had a hunch that it was suppose to be a lot harder.<br /><br />But another part of me says: yes, I can see all of this...... in hindsight.  I correctly predict something psychically, then reason using hindsight how I must have deduced it logically.  Maybe.<br /><br />Honestly, I have had predictions that have impressed myself.  A lot of my predictions come true, but 80% of them I would label as just smart guessing (and I've had some that don't come true too, of course).  How do you detect if something psychically is going on?  I suppose the best thing to do is to write down your predictions, then later check to see which ones happened, and which ones didn't.<br /><br />But then how do you check against how logical the prediction is without psychic involvement?  How do you check whether you are just guessing intelligently, or you are actually doing something psychic?<br /><br />I believe this is a big problem - but I also believe this thought pattern is actually illogical in itself.  I know that I should be trying to prove to myself whether something is psychic or not (let's say I'm concerned with proving whether psychic experiences exist).  But the <B>reality</B> of the situation (in my opinion) is that I use BOTH precognition and smart guessing.  I use psychic functions to direct my logical arguments.  Remove the psychic function, and I don't have as many correct predictions.  Remove the logical function, and I don't have as many correct predictions.<br /><br />Allow them to work together in one seamless experience and decision making process: much higher success rate.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, I believe in two schools of thought:<br />1. If you are a scientist dedicated to proving and testing how psychic functions work, and whether they exist or not, you need to have strict methods of seperating the psychic function from other "normal" functions.<br />2. If you are someone who actually wants to use psychic abilities in normal every day life, you have to INCORPORATE them into your "normal" functions.  Don't think to yourself, "ok, right now I'm going to do something psychic" - this is as silly as thinking, "ok, right now I'm going to do something logical".  Do what you want to do.  Use your psychic abilities with your other awesome abilities of the mind.  Use it all together!<br /><br />I hope my point gets across (my mind is a little scattered <IMG SRC="http://psipog.net/blog/s_blah.gif" width=12 height=12 />) - I have this thought process a lot, so you might see it pop up in other posts.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>Hey Peebs,<BR/><BR/>That's a pretty good conclusion that you've popped out right there! I can recall that I used to incorporate my "logic" into my "psychic". Often times you only seem to need the subtle psychic clues to unfold great "logical" ones. I remember doing this at the "height" of my power so to speak. It's really cool to see that you have come to the same conclusions, and that my past experiences can be affirmed. Good Show! Keep up the cool posts.</p>

                                <p>This happens to me sometimes.  I'll be getting ready to go out and I'll think to myself that my boyfriend is going to be late today.  Then I laugh it off... but later, he really is late.  I predicted that he would come early a couple of times, too.  And I've never thought that he would be early/late incorrectly.  It's only happened a few times, but I still think it's cool. =)</p>

                                <p>Hello,<BR/>   I liked this one a lot because you illustrated a theory of mine that nothings ever simple. I assume that most things (psychic ablities especially) are usually composed of several different factors. So i dig this one it made sense to me and helped me realize how realistic and honest you are about your experiments. Which is only important because you own and operate this site. Anyway, thanks.</p>
