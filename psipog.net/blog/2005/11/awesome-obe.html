               <div class="blogPostBody">
                  <p>This being my first real post, I figured I would start off strong.  Today is November 21st, 2005, and a week ago on the morning of November 13th, I had a crazy Out of Body Experience (OBE).  This is a long story, sorry <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width=12 height=12 />.<br /><br />I had jacked up my sleeping pattern by taking a nap close to bed time, which caused me to be slightly restless when I laid down for bed later that night.  (As a side note, this is a great technique to induce OBEs... it's worked for me on multiple occasions).  When I finally got to sleep, I drifted through different states of consciousness.  Eventually, I honed in on the OBE mind-set, and knew right away when I hit it that I could "leave".<br /><br />I have a lot of trouble moving around and seeing things correctly during OBEs.  I rarely get more than a few feet from my bed, and this time was no exception.  I'm also obsessed with proving to myself that OBEs are <B>real</B> (to some extent) and not some lucid-dream type of fluke.<br /><br />While floating around my bed, I had a hard time seeing.  I used my sense of touch to guide myself over to the side of the bed, and my vision got a little more straight.  I was looking under the bed at that point, and I noticed a black plastic washer, about the size of a quarter.  Trying to get some proof, I plucked some white plastic washers from underneath my bed, and laid them out in a specific pattern on the floor, along with the black washer.  I reasoned that when I returned to my body, I could get up and check to see if the washers were in that design, and could confirm that the OBE was real.<br /><br />I willed myself back to my body, with the strong intention of getting up and checking right away.  As soon as I was back in my body, I realized how foolish it was - there aren't any plastic washers under my bed <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width=12 height=12 />.  There isn't <I>anything</I> under my bed.  I laughed at myself, thought of how retarded I was, then went to bed without checking.<br /><br />The next morning, I was getting dressed and thought to myself, "You know, it can't hurt to just <I>check</I>, so I might as well take a look".  I bent down on the foot side of the bed, and looked... and nothing.  Just as I predicted earlier, there wasn't anything under my bed.  I shrugged it off, re-enforcing the thought of how retarded I am to be fooled by the OBE, and went about my day.<br /><br />The following day I was walking around my room, and noticed the structure of the side of the bed.  I noticed that the feelings I got while searching around blindly while out of body was from the <I>other</I> side of the bed (the head side, not the foot side).  Feeling slightly perplexed, I got down and looked under the head side of the bed...<br /><br />No, I didn't find plastic washers in a strange pattern... what I did find was a black plastic guitar pick.  Needless to say, this blew my mind <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width=12 height=12 />.  It's easy to imagine how slightly distored vision could confuse the black plastic guitar pick for a black plastic washer.  I have no idea where the white ones came from in my OBE (I suspect they were created by my mind).<br /><br />Perhaps others don't find this amazing, but I personally do.  This happened to me, and it has proven to me that OBEs are something more than just hallucination or an altered type of dreaming.  There is <I>something</I> going on.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>Cool post Sean :)<BR/><BR/>OBE's tend to have some pretty interesting stories/experiences. OBE's do differ from lucid dreaming and It's great that you proved it to yourself by experiencing it first hand. Also, Alot of people who have OBE's do tend to have a slight vision problem. When I first leaned/started I had that same problem. I had a little conversation with Robert Bruce (Which I have saved if your interested :P) and he suggested that the next few OBE's I have, I should focus on improving my vision. The next time your "out" locate something in your surrounding area and focus on it. It will soon become more "clearer" and easier to see. Hehe, Although I wanted to explore and fool around while my time "out" I did do it and it has helped. I currently have excellent vision while I'm "out". So try it out, It could help ;). <BR/><BR/>Also, I know you have the book called "Astral Dynamics" by Robert Bruce. Check out pages 307-308. <BR/><BR/>Very cool post Sean, I look forward on reading more :)<BR/><BR/>Take care bro.<BR/><BR/><BR/>                      -JoeT</p>
