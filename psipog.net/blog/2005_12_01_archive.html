                  <p>Lately I've been using psi to help locate people.  What happens is that a group of us go to the store, then I run off and get distracted by something shiney... so to find my way back to the group, I connect with one of them.  Then I just follow the direction of the link.  Pretty cool, and has worked multiple times.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>Alrighty,<br />Had another OBE this afternoon.  The power was out all day, so I decided to meditate/sleep for a few hours to kill some time.  I meditated with the intention of disconnecting myself from my physical senses.  After trancing for a while, I hit the OBE state.  I couldn't move very much, but I heard the loud ringing.  I decided not to really try to do anything with it, and just let it run it's "natural" outcome.  It led me into a dream, that was somewhat lucid.  This OBE marks another new location that I've successfully OBE'd in (couch in my dad's living room), so I think I'm up to 11 now.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>Well,<br />I think I'm going to start writing an actual book.  Of course, this is one of many hundreds of other projects I am working on, so we'll see if it actually gets finished, but it has been on my mind and I know I can make it work.  My goal is to make it around 200 pages, and price it at $11.95 (most of which would go towards printing and setup fees of publishing).  Of course, I have to actually WRITE the book first, but I think I can do it <IMG SRC="http://psipog.net/blog/s_smile.gif" width=12 height=12 />.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>The OBE yesterday just didn't feel like quite enough, so I managed to pull another one off this morning <IMG SRC="http://psipog.net/blog/s_smile.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=12 />.<br /><br />In this one, my physical body was laying in bed on it's back, and my other body was connected at the head, but my feet were pointing downwards (so my other bodies feet were through the bed, and below the floor).  I couldn't move around a whole lot, but I was very relaxed and conscious during the entire thing, so it was cool.  The sun had already risen (it was around 9:30am), so I could see things clearly in my room.  <br /><br />I raised my OBE-hand, and was looking at it for a while... a lot of times while I'm out I just stare at my hands because they are so cool looking.  This time they would fade in and out, and parts of my hand would look completely normal, while other parts were very glass-like and refracted the light, and even other parts were completely transparent.  I know this doesn't compare to the awesome special effects were used to seeing in movies, but when it's actually happening in front of you, it's really amazing to watch and play with <IMG SRC="http://psipog.net/blog/s_smile.gif" width=12 height=12 />.<br /><br />So I did that for about 2-3 minutes, then went back into my body.  No exciting adventures this time, but oh well <IMG SRC="http://psipog.net/blog/s_blah.gif" width=12 height=12 />.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>Hey hey <img src="s_smile.gif" width=12 height=12 />,<br />I wouldn't say I could read someone's thoughts, but I would say I can read their thought patterns.  By this I mean, if you think of something, I might be able to lock onto it and see it... but if I watch you operate for 5 minutes, I can <I>easily</I> see the natural thoughts and decisions that go through your head.<br /><br />I can read your natural emotions, read the thoughts as they emerge in your head, watch it unfold into the physical movements you make... I can track the decisions you make and the underlying philosophies you hold that direct these decisions.  I see the motivations behind each thought, and why that thought even existed in the first place... sometimes I can even track these thoughts back to memories in your head.<br /><br />Now, one curious question is: is this psychic?  Is information being transmitted to me by some unknown means?  Or maybe I'm just good at reading body language?  Again, I address this issue in previous posts: I believe the answer is - BOTH.<br /><br />We form the idea that our psychic acts must be seperate from our "normal" acts, and that we decide when to "be psychic", and then we decide when to turn it off, and "be normal".  I believe this entire seperation is an illusion, and ultimately, it's stupid and will cause you to misread and fail.<br /><br />Complete integration is very important.<br /><br />Now, onto a different topic... I believe a lot of my understanding of others' thoughts come from understanding my own thoughts.  Take the realization that: the thoughts you have are 99% similar to the thoughts of everyone else.  It's not hard to predict thoughts and understand motivations, when you can inject a personallity into your mindset and watch the natural thoughts unfold.  If I want to predict your thoughts and decisions, I can just inject your background and complete perspective into my mind, and let my mind make decisions ONLY BASED on what I injected (not other information that is in my personal brain that makes up my background of experiences).<br /><br />The more I understand myself, the more I understand others.  It's easier to probe into my own mind than to probe into the minds of others.<br /><br />Soooooo..... what have I done with this?  Well, just recently I had a talk with my mother about the thought patterns she displayed, and why I thought they were bad decisions.  At first she was very defensive (which is normal when someone attacks the decisions you are making), but as my predictions starting getting in synch with other areas of her life, then she started to trust my opinions more.  For example, if I can tell her something about her life, that there's no way I can normally know, then while she will want to act defensive, the bigger part of her is sitting there thinking, "How can he see this?  If he sees this, which I have kept very hidden, then what else can he see?".  Very rarely do I actually unload all the observations I make to the person I'm observing, for obvious reasons that a lot of times they won't like you afterwards.  But I have found that if you show understanding, and show an intent to honestly help the person, AND also are extremely accurate and can nail things that they would never think was possible, THEN they will actually be very open to your suggestions and look to you in the future to see "your take" on it.<br /><br />I nearly forgot - I had a (sort of) OBE last night (this morning).  I had this OBE at my Grandmother's home in Flordia, which brings the total OBE locations to 10 I think.  (That means I've OBEd in 10 different locations, and every OBE to this point has correctly happened in my current location - which is strong evidence that it isn't a dream).  The OBE lasted about a minute, and consisted of me bending my body in strange directions... I never really got "out" entirely, but I did manage to bend my legs through the bottom of my bed <IMG SRC="http://psipog.net/blog/s_smile.gif" width=12 height=12 />.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>So this is what my sister said to me today:<br /><br />"Grandma needed an idea for a gift under $20, and I came up with the perfect idea, and I want to tell you but I don't want to ruin the surprise - but just know, when you open the gift, that the idea was mine."<br /><br />So I say, "ok".  About 5 minutes later, nothing good was on the radio, so I start in a conversation: "Hey, you know All-American Rejects came out with a new CD?  It's pretty good."<br /><br />She replies: "That was the gift!"<br /><br />Some people might argue coincidence... which it could have been.  It's always hard to examine one event and figure out if something psychic happened or not.  A lot of the time, when you first start practicing, you start having "coincidences".  But then they keep adding up.  One particular event isn't that awesome, but a series of 10 coincidences starts to make you think: "What is really going on here?".<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>I've read psychic books that say my "psychic personallity" is one where I do a lot of psychic things, but reason them off with logic without giving them much thought, because I consider them "normal".  I find that interesting.  One area where I find the most problems is precognition (the other area being telepathy).<br /><br />In precog, we supposably predict the future - however, I also think of myself as mostly smart, and I reason that I can accurately guess the future pretty good.  I reason that I'm using my intelligence and "normal" predicting capablities, and nothing psychic is going on.  However, sometimes things are a little iffy, and it makes me think.<br /><br />Recently a lot of my predictions have been coming true.  For example, I needed to complete paper work to leave my current base (I'm in the Air Force).  I predicted that the paper work was done incorrectly (even though I was told it was correct twice), and that I would have a problem with it.  It turns out it <I>was</I> incorrect, and I <I>did</I> have a problem with it close to my departure time... which caused me a lot of stress (luckily I got it fixed in time and left on schedule).<br /><br />Now this sort of things happens to me a lot.  However, I can reason that there are a lot of ways I could have figured it out that aren't psychic-related.  In this example, I knew the person who said it was correct was actually an idiot (from previous encounters with him).  I knew he was lazy, and didn't care if paper work was correct or not.  I knew it was "too easy" to fill out, and had a hunch that it was suppose to be a lot harder.<br /><br />But another part of me says: yes, I can see all of this...... in hindsight.  I correctly predict something psychically, then reason using hindsight how I must have deduced it logically.  Maybe.<br /><br />Honestly, I have had predictions that have impressed myself.  A lot of my predictions come true, but 80% of them I would label as just smart guessing (and I've had some that don't come true too, of course).  How do you detect if something psychically is going on?  I suppose the best thing to do is to write down your predictions, then later check to see which ones happened, and which ones didn't.<br /><br />But then how do you check against how logical the prediction is without psychic involvement?  How do you check whether you are just guessing intelligently, or you are actually doing something psychic?<br /><br />I believe this is a big problem - but I also believe this thought pattern is actually illogical in itself.  I know that I should be trying to prove to myself whether something is psychic or not (let's say I'm concerned with proving whether psychic experiences exist).  But the <B>reality</B> of the situation (in my opinion) is that I use BOTH precognition and smart guessing.  I use psychic functions to direct my logical arguments.  Remove the psychic function, and I don't have as many correct predictions.  Remove the logical function, and I don't have as many correct predictions.<br /><br />Allow them to work together in one seamless experience and decision making process: much higher success rate.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, I believe in two schools of thought:<br />1. If you are a scientist dedicated to proving and testing how psychic functions work, and whether they exist or not, you need to have strict methods of seperating the psychic function from other "normal" functions.<br />2. If you are someone who actually wants to use psychic abilities in normal every day life, you have to INCORPORATE them into your "normal" functions.  Don't think to yourself, "ok, right now I'm going to do something psychic" - this is as silly as thinking, "ok, right now I'm going to do something logical".  Do what you want to do.  Use your psychic abilities with your other awesome abilities of the mind.  Use it all together!<br /><br />I hope my point gets across (my mind is a little scattered <IMG SRC="http://psipog.net/blog/s_blah.gif" width=12 height=12 />) - I have this thought process a lot, so you might see it pop up in other posts.<br /><br />~Sean</p>
