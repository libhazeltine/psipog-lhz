                  <p>For those trying hard to have an OBE, I <i>highly</i> suggest the following technique:<br />1. Get 2/3rds your normal sleep (for me that's around 6 hours)<br />2. Go to work/school for the day<br />3. Take a nap after dinner, for around 1.5-3 hours<br />4. Wake back up, stay awake for a few more hours<br />5. Go to bed for the night at your normal time<br /><br />Nearly every OBE I have results from the pattern above.  The goal is to be restless for Step 5 - it puts you in the perfect condition to have an OBE.<br /><br />So anyways - using the above technique yesterday, I (unintentionally) had an OBE this morning at around 4:30am.  Needless to say, it was crazy/scary as hell <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Blah" />.  When I returned to my body, I immediately grabbed my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009Y7IK2/sr=8-4/qid=1144944239/ref=pd_bbs_4/002-3510709-1103228?%5Fencoding=UTF8" target="_blank">voice recorder</a>, and narrated my experience into it.  The beginning of the narration I was still in trance-like state, because I just returned, but I wake up as the time goes on.  I'm writing the entire transcript as a log for myself, but you can read it if the entire thing interests you.  Some parts are repetitive.  Below is a transcript of what I said:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />I had an out of body experience... it was really cool.  The most important part was that I stayed conscious the entire time.  From start to finish.  I think...  Now I'm not sure if I stayed conscious.  When I left, I was playing around with how to move, and I learned better ways to move around.  It was very exciting and I'm kind of stirred up about it.  I turned my [astral] body around, to see my physical body, and stared at my physical face for a little while - so I'm freaked out about that.  I then opened my physical eyes, and from my out of body [astral body], I could see my physical eyes opened.  I don't know if that was real or not - that was crazy.<br /><br />When I was returning to my body, right before that to look at my face, there were waves of energy coming off my body.  It was bizarre.  Also, the method that I used to leave was basically mess around with my feeling of where my body parts are, kind of.  Until it becomes so pliable, that I can leave my body.  I am kind of freaked out right now, heh.  I had pretty good vision.  At one point, my body didn't like uh ... I had pretty good vision, but my movement was kind of tough.  But I was getting better, I was getting practice.<br /><br />At one point I floated above my ceiling, and saw like, a crystal/plastic necklace type of thing.  And I grabbed it in my hand and felt it.  I thought about how, that there ... at first I was thinking that if there is someone that lived above me, then they would have a necklace, but then, while I was still out of my body, right after I set the necklace down, I realized that no one lives above me - I'm on the top floor.  And then I noted, after that, how it was good of me to note that, heh.<br /><br />I didn't notice any entry or exit problems.  I did almost have a false awakening, after I returned, but I battled through it.  I detected it, and battled through it.  I honestly don't remember what I did to have an out of body experience, specifically.  I remember laying - if I go backwards in my memory - I was laying in bed, playing with the sensation... I don't even remember.  It was almost like a dream, kind of.  I don't remember "waking up".  I don't remember blacking out, really.  I don't know what the hell I did.<br /><br />I tried to go out in the hallway, but it didn't work.  I realized that my focus played a HUGE role in where my body moved.  A bigger role than I previously assumed.  If I just remotely THINK of a direction to move in, I will move in it [1].<br /><br />I don't remember how I got the out of body experience, I remember laying in bed and playing with, like my feet, I think.  I was playing with the feeling in my feet.  Now... what the hell was I doing... I don't remember.<br /><br />When I floated up to the ceiling, I had a glove on my left hand, a white glove.  I thought that was bizarre [2].<br /><br />I don't remember what I was doing.  And I'm really hot right now - like it's really fucking hot.  The temperature in here has got to be 84 I bet... 85 maybe [3].  The entire thing, or the entire thing I can remember, starting from before I left my body, was maybe 8 minutes total.  I don't remember how I left.  That bothers me.  Because it <i>feels</i> like it was continuous.  But I can't remember trancing out, or anything like that.<br /><br />I remember playing with how my body felt.  Like playing with ... I'm kind of freaked out.  I was playing with how my body felt, like how each of my limbs felt.  Mostly I was playing with my feet.  I remember playing with my feet.  I remember being really scared, actually.  I'm kind of scared right now still, but there was no reason to be afraid, but I still feel a really potent fear right now.  But I still had an out of body experience anyways.  I mean I remember making that decision - that I was feeling really afraid, and I said, "No, I gotta do this".  And I did it anyways, that was cool.<br /><br />[voice gets a lot more clear/faster here, I was waking up and becoming more alert]<br /><br />I think, I honestly remember, feeling some sort of hands on the back of my ribs before I left my body.  But I don't really remember exactly what it was.  It was almost like I came out of a dream state, and I was in my body playing with..., it was like I was playing with... - I was in a playful mood.  But I was so really fucking scared.  I was playing with altered states of consciousness.  I was playing with how my body parts FELT.  Like, where I detected they were.  And I realized that I could turn it into an out of body experience.  So I went through the normal process of ... I gradually made sure I understood what I felt, and I took my mind to where it was suppose to go, and then I floated in an upward position, and opened my out of body eyes, and looked around.  And it was working, so of course, so that was good.<br /><br />So I floated upwards, and I never really ended looking down the entire time.  I kept floating upwards, towards the ceiling, and then maybe the first and second time I floated up to the ceiling, maybe the second time I noticed the glove on my left hand, then I turned back to my body, and I floated up for a third time, and that's when I noticed the necklace.  Which of course, probably doesn't exist, right? Heh.<br /><br />Ohhhh, the one time I was floating up, this is important, the one time I was floating up I looked down and I could see the light fixture, the inside of it.  But, it LOOKED LIKE my New York light fixture [4], looking back on it, I remember commenting to myself how it was cool that I could see the top of the light fixture.  But now that I'm looking at the actual light fixture right now, it's not the same light fixture.  The one I remember is like the one that was in my New York room.  That's what I remember it looking like.  But the one in my room right now doesn't look like that at all.  Anyways...<br /><br />So I floated up again, and I saw the necklace.  It kind of was floating in mid-air.  I understood it to be that I was looking - like um - I floated through the ceiling and I couldn't see anything except my room, so I was looking through the floor [of the room above me], and this is fucking crazy, heh.  But the necklace was floating, supposably... well not really floating, it was on something, but I couldn't see what it was on - I was looking through that - and I was getting the images of my room from underneath, so I could see my room underneath me, like maybe I don't know - like 10 feet down, or maybe like 12 feet down.<br /><br />But anyways, so I picked [the necklace] up and was thinking about how what I was focused on would disorientate my perceptions.  How that if I picked up the necklace, I would feel along the necklace, but that was really my perception of the necklace moving along the edge of the necklace.  Not that ME actually picking up the necklace, but that was the only way I could express it.  And then when, I thought, if I dropped the necklace, it wasn't of course really dropping the necklace.  But it might confuse my perceptions because now I am expecting to perceive things with this dropped necklace, and now my perceptions might be trying to compensate for that, even though the reality of the situation was that I was moving my focus ALONG the necklace, so I was thinking that while I was actually grabbing and picking up the necklace and putting it back down.  I was very aware.<br /><br />Then I floated back down, and I thought, you know it's silly, I'm on the 3rd floor and no one lives above me.  And then I thought, "Alright, well I tested that one thing, and it turned out to be false.  So I'll try to test something else now."  So I went back to my freaking body, and kept my eyes open, and gradually spun around.  It took, I mean, I was moving around pretty quickly normally, but when I got back to my body, I was moving slower.  And I gradually spun around, and while I was spinning, hovering directly over my body... heh, fucking scary is what it was.<br /><br />I saw waves like emanating like that clear glass waves [5], emanating from my body, it looked like.  Kinda like waves, kinda like ripples in the air.  And I slowly turned until I saw my face.  I looked at it, and I was just like, "Ok, that's cool", and I sent the command to open my eyes, and I saw my bodies eyes open, and I opened my mouth and closed it again.  But I honestly don't know if that really happened, like I don't remember - I don't know if my actual physical body DID open my eyes, and open my mouth.  Which would have been great to have a freaking recording of it - a video recording - but oh well [6].<br /><br />That freaked me out, but that was ok, so after that I was like really freaked out, but I decided to float out of my door, and go into the hallway, but my perceptions were starting to get really distorted.  And I was starting to flicker back and forth between out of body, and in body, so I decided to just go back in my body.  So I unfocused on my body, er, I mean I focused on my physical body, but I stopped focusing on my out of body body, and I could feel my out of body moving around, and swooshing around, and I kind of just focused on my body lightly until I felt that I had came back to my body and was inside of it.<br /><br />I wasn't looking, I didn't know I was actually there, but I just felt - you know - I waited, until it got all aligned and situated, and then I woke up.  But that was a false awakening.  Like I thought I woke up, but I didn't really.  But I caught on to it, because the idea was immediately when I woke up, I thought the best way to record this would be to reach over and grab my recorder, and talk into it.  So I reached over and grabbed my recorder, but it didn't feel right.  Something didn't feel right.  So I immediately realized that I still hadn't woken up.  Or maybe I was still out of my body, I don't even know, I think I might have still been out of my body honestly.  Because it was still the same state of mind.<br /><br />So I tried harder, I guess you could say, to <b>wake up</b>, and I made it a little bit more clear that that's what I wanted to do.  And then I could open up my physical eyes AGAIN, and then it was very hard and lethargic to get my arm over, but eventually I got my arm over to grab my recorder, to hit record, and record this message.  And now I'm actually kind of awake - it's 5 in the freaking morning, and I gotta wake up in 4 hours, but anyways heh - that's what happened.  And I'm glad I have this recorder to record it.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Notes:<br />1. This is the main lesson that I learned - that focus plays a huge role in movement.  Of course I've read about it in books, but I've never witnessed it in such an obvious mannor until now.  The way I was moving was by reaching my arms up, and focusing on my hands - and the act of focusing on my hands above me made me move upwards.  Which meant my hands went up too, and so did my focus, so I kept moving in that direction.<br /><br />2. The white glove was very odd.  In a past OBE, I discovered that my expectations and will could change what clothes I was wearing (I changed my boxer color in a previous OBE), so for some reason I wanted or projected a white glove on my hand.  One important note might be that I went to the dentist two days ago, and also this morning - and they wear white latex gloves to work on my mouth.  Perhaps I was thinking about my dentist appointment, and it projected a white glove onto my hand.<br /><br />3. My thermometer registered a maximum temperature of 87.6 degrees.<br /><br />4. My New York light fixture that I'm talking about was just the light fixture in my old room.  It was glass, and was shaped like an inverted pyramid, that collected bugs in the top.  The fixture I observed in my OBE looked just like it, with bugs inside of it as well.  The real fixture in my dorm room doesn't look like that at all - it's bigger and flat (recessed into the ceiling).  I do see some bugs in there though.<br /><br />5. The clear glass wave effect is something I notice a lot when I'm out of body.  I see the effect in probably half of my OBEs, so it's pretty common.  It looks like perfectly clear glass that distorts the light behind it, like looking through a wavey glass cup.<br /><br />6. A few weeks ago I wanted to purchase a camcorder so I could record myself having OBEs - but the business I tried ordering it from denied my order because my shipping address wasn't on file at my bank.  So I was pissed about that.  Had I gotten the camcorder, I might have been able to see if my physical eyes really did open, and if my physical mouth moved.<br /><br />If you've read this far, wow.  Good job, you must be bored <img src="../../s_smile.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Smile" />.  I didn't post this with the intention of people reading it, I just wanted to record a transcript so I could erase the message on my recorder, and save this for future reference.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>I'm going to try the suggested method to OBE I've been trying for a while. <BR/><BR/>Are your perceptions and reasoning capabilities really that distorted? I was told by a friend that when he OBEd he could everything more clearly and his reasoning capabilities were normal. <BR/><BR/>The reason why you might have seen the light fixture from the place you used to live may be because you made the assumption in your trance-like state that the fixture should be that way. Robert Peterson said assumptions can effect your OBE.</p>

                                <p>I agree that assumptions and expectations can distort the environment.  Don't get me wrong - you are more aware in the OBE state than you are in the normal dream state.  The OBE state is similar to the lucid dream state - where you are aware and conscious of whats going on around you.  You can reason pretty good, and you have a pretty good grasp of what is going on around you - MUCH better than a normal dream.  But also, it isn't clear cut.<BR/><BR/>Honestly, I think that a lot of times we walk around in normal life in a trance-like unaware state.  In OBEs, I think this is just about the same - except in physical reality, our environment doesn't change based on our unaware state :-P.<BR/><BR/>Good comments, thanks.</p>

                                <p>That would be pretty scary. But that did sound like a dream to me, i don't know. i once was asleep and my jaw felt locked into place, later i felt sort of jerked into place and fell asleep. They could both be dreams, but i wouldn't rule out the possibility of an OBE.</p>

I AM bored... >.<<BR/><BR/>Anywayz... that sounds kinda cool, kinda scary... wish i'd had more OBEs... i think i've only had 1 that lasted longer than 10 seconds... and it was when i was really young .<BR/><BR/>Good luck with your further experiments. <BR/><BR/>Peace,<BR/>Jared</p>

                                <p>It's crazy, the things you incounter in an OBE, but did you ever think that ObEing could have a danger in it. I mean you said it took you two trys to get into your body and when you did it was hard to move so what if one day you cant get back into your bady at all,or if you come back and cant move?</p>

                                <p>Cool story.  By the way, I recommend getting a voice recorder like that, to anybody else who's reading this.  I have a similar model and it works great.  I love it.  But I never thought of using it to record OBE details.  That's a good idea, actually--it's much easier than writing.  Thanks :)<BR/><BR/>~no_one</p>
