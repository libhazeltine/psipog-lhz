               <div class="blogPostBody">
                  <p>One of the most important aspects of learning psionics is working with yourself.  You either need to work within your belief system, or change your belief system.  Changing your belief system can be a real bitch, so a lot of times I suggest working with the belief system you already have set up.<br /><br />So what is a "belief system"?  It's basically your opinion on how reality works.  The mind builds an internal model of reality, so that it can function and understand what's going on around it.  When you use psionics, you need to work WITH your internal model of reality - not against it.<br /><br />It's hard to figure out what your internal model is - mostly because the things you think seem obvious.  They are so obvious to you, that you don't question them, and you barely notice them.  On top of that, anytime you witness something that goes against your internal model, you usually reject it in one form or another.  We all have coping mechanisms.  Coping mechanisms are how we deal with the differences between our interal reality and the reality that exists outside our mind.<br /><br />Whenever you feel angry or stressed, this is an indication that reality is not playing by your rules.  Your internal reality is throwing a hissy fit because the external reality isn't acting how it's "supposed to".  Whenever you feel angry or stressed, take careful note of what circumstances surround it.  These can hold vital clues as to how your internal model of reality is incorrect.<br /><br />Back to the point: use your internal model to your advantage.  Work within it.  Let me show you an example, so you can see what I'm talking about.<br /><br />One technique for telepathy is to visualize a link forming between your mind and the mind of your target.  You visualize the link connecting your two minds, and the information being transfered through the link.  Then you receive the information, and get a sense of what your target is thinking about.  Sounds simple, right?<br /><br />Well what if you don't believe in an invisible energy that forms a link between your minds?  What if you think, "You know, that sounds pretty interesting, but ultimately I think it's bullshit.  An invisible 'energy link' doesn't form between minds, it's just too silly of an idea."  What should you do?  Should you try the exercise anyways, and see if you get results?  Sure, you could do that... but chances are you won't get results.  So that just confirms your first belief that the energy link idea is bullshit.<br /><br />What can you try instead?  Well, the energy-link technique above doesn't fit into your model of reality.  So create a technique that WILL fit within your model of reality.  Find something else you do believe in, and attach a telepathic concept to it.<br /><br />Perhaps you think the energy-link idea is bullshit, but you DO believe in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlocality" target="_blank">non-locality</a> (a quantum physics term).  The belief of non-locality says that things don't have to be next to each other to affect each other.  Of course, it's a little more scientific/complicated than that, but that's the basic idea.  Well, here you have an opportunity to attach a telepathic concept to this belief!<br /><br />Instead of visualizing an energy-link between your two minds, picture that you are exercising the non-local nature of reality, and by doing that, a part of your mind is in the same "spot" as the part of your targets mind.  This overlap allows you to read the thoughts of your target by focusing on the section of your thoughts that overlap.<br /><br />Try it!<br /><br />Let's say you've never heard of non-locality, because you aren't a physics guy.  Perhaps you are a music guy, who works as a DJ, and a lot of your life is focused around listening to music, and broadcasting music to your listeners.  Here is another opportunity to attach a telepathic concept to your beliefs!  Picture that thoughts actually emit a low-frequency sound - picture that the subvocalization in your mind is actually being broadcasted out.  Picture your targets thoughts making low-frequency sounds in the air, and emiting outwards.  Then listen for the thoughts.  Use your superior listening ability to hear the thoughts.<br /><br />All of these techniques will work.  Not all of them will work with everyone though.  Perhaps the non-locality idea makes no sense to you, and you think it sounds stupid.  Well, then it probably won't work for you <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Blah" />.  This is what I mean by working with yourself - working with your belief system.  What beliefs do you have that you can attach telepathic concepts to?  What rules do you have in your head that could allow for telepathy to happen?  USE THEM.<br /><br />You can apply these same ideas with any perception or manipulation psionic skill.  Come up with your own techniques on psychokinesis.  Come up with your own techniques for remote viewing.  Do what makes sense to you.  Work within your belief system, and make it work for you.<br /><br />~Sean</p>
