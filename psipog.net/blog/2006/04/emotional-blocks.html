                  <p>I was reading <a href="http://2ndperspective.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">NI's blog</a>, and it got me thinking about PK again.<br /><br />And I've come to this realization.  If I saw myself perform PK, I honestly wouldn't believe it.  Now, I can convince myself of a lot of things intellectually... I mean, I've seen others do PK, I've done PK myself, I've researched how PK could be possible, and found that PK really isn't that far fetched.  I intellectually understand the procedures for how to accomplish PK, and I understand the mindset.<br /><br />I can grasp it pretty easy intellectually.  But if I saw it with my own eyes, my gut would not believe it.  And I think that is a big problem.<br /><br />One theory that I believe in is that belief plays a major role in psychic abilities.  I theorize that belief has a limiting factor - if you disbelieve in something strongly, then you will not be capable of witnessing it.  This sounds kinda crazy at first, but there is a lot of evidence that supports it (that I won't get into now).<br /><br />So the fact that my emotional gut reaction to PK is that it's impossible, DESPITE my intellectual understanding, means that I am very limited in PK.  And that really bothers me.  My intellect constantly bombards my emotional self with evidence, theories, encouragement, and wonderful ideas... but the emotional self really doesn't care about that stuff.  For some reason it has a death grip on the idea that PK is impossible, and no matter what, it won't let go.<br /><br />I believe that this problem exists in many people, and not just about PK.  That we have these limiting beliefs, and even though we intellectually know we want to remove them, we emotionally can't.<br /><br />So how can I remove this emotional idea that limits myself?<br /><br />I read a lot on personal development and self-help stuff, which is aimed at attacking emotional blocks like this.  Some of the things I read work pretty good, and some stuf doesn't work so great.  Tony Robbins, for example, seems to have the opinion that the brain is a computer-like machine, that we can reprogram to behave however we want.  Now, I sort of like that idea, but it doesn't really ring true to me.  Do I really want to brainwash myself into believing something so that I have the correct emotional reaction?  Not really.<br /><br />Steve Pavlina speaks more of my language.  His goal seems to be more truth-orientated.  I.e., if we find the truth, and become aware of it, then we can't become un-aware of the truth, and we are FORCED to change.  The main reason why I like this strategy the best is because I've done it for a long time.<br /><br />For example, I can tell you that KFC tortures genetically mutated chickens to deliver tubs of chicken to you, the consumer.  In fact, I can post videos of it, and bring up all the evidence in the world.  I can sit there and reason with you, and explain to you how terrible it is - and you can agree with me.  But if you only agree on the intellectual level, then you will still have the same behavior of going to KFC when you want some chicken.  You intellectually understand that it's wrong, but you do it anyways.<br /><br />However, if when I show you the evidence, you have an emotional reaction, and begin to believe in the problem emotionally - then you have become truly <b>aware</b> of the problem.  You feel it.  And because of this, you couldn't force yourself to go to KFC even if it was the only place open.  You have no decision, and your behavior is FORCED to change, because of this awareness.<br /><br />My point being: the intellect is a great thing, but it really doesn't do shit for behavior.  Behavior is 100% driven emotionally - and if you have your intellect drive some of your behavior, it's only because you emotionally feel that your intellect is good for some decisions.  I.e., the emotional self gives the intellect power, if it feels like it.  The intellect can't take power, even if it reasons it should have it.  The emotional self is the gate keeper.<br /><br />So anyways... back to PK.  My emotional self simply doesn't believe in PK.  My entire belief system and behavior has invested too much in the beleif that PK doesn't exist to change at the whim of the intellect.  So I have to get to the root, rip out the core, and replace it with truth.  Emotionally.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>Cool post man, I really enjoyed it.<BR/><BR/>I think it was "Descartes" who said something along the lines of if we can't mentally grasp something, it won't exist... I wonder if that sort of rings true here? Then again, I think I'm misquoting it. I get your point. Work on Brother.</p>
