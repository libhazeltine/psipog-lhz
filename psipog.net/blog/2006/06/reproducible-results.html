                  <p>Hurray!<br /><br />Using ErikJDurwoodII's ideas, JoeT and myself have reproduced results on my 
geiger counter.<br /><br />So what exactly happened?<br /><br />Erik came to me a couple weeks ago, and was excited 
about his ideas and theories, and that he would be able to test them out.  If you don't know Erik, he's basically a mad 
scientist.  He is <i>very</i> knowledgable in science, and has some really cool ideas.  Plus he's down to earth at the 
same time, and while he has crazy ideas - he recognizes that they are crazy and can laugh about it.  So he's a cool 
guy.<br /><br />One night, he got JoeT and some other people on <a href="http://skype.com/" target="_blank">Skype</a>.  
I wasn't there for that experiment, but he basically got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger_counter" 
target="_blank">geiger counter</a>, and something he called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer" 
target="_blank">transducer</a> (I think?), and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope" 
target="_blank">oscilloscope</a>.  Using these devices, he had JoeT focus on the transducer, and by mistake he noticed 
his geiger counter going crazy.  He checked the basics to make sure JoeT was the one actually affecting it, and it 
turned out correct.<br /><br />So the next time I saw him, he was really excited about his first successful experiment, 
and told me his theories (which I barely understood) about what was happening.  My reaction was to buy a geiger counter 
as fast as I could so I could reproduce it in my room <img src="../../s_smile.gif" width="12" 
height="12" />.<br /><br />I purchased the <a href="http://www.blackcatsystems.com/GM/products/GM10GeigerCounter.html" 
target="_blank">Black Cat System's GM-10</a> geiger counter for about $170 after shipping.  When it arrived in the mail, 
I was really excited to test it out.<br /><br />Erik first reproduced his experiment, but this time with me watching, so 
I could see how it was setup.  Over his webcam, he showed me his geiger counter, transducer, and oscilloscope.  First, I 
tried to get the geiger counter to go crazy, like he described JoeT doing it.  I failed.  Roy tried.  He failed.  So 
finally we invited JoeT to do it again... The average detection range for a geiger counter sitting in a normal room is 
anywhere from 8 to 25 counts per minute (CPM)... and it'll usually average between 12 and 15.  When JoeT focused on it, 
he got the counter to max out at 47 CPM.  Very significant.<br /><br />So I was thrilled!  I posted <a 
href="geiger-counter.html" target="_blank">this</a> entry in the blog out of 
excitement.  However, we still hadn't reproduced the effect on my geiger counter.  When JoeT tried, he was pretty burnt 
out, and we couldn't measure anything significant.<br /><br />Just today, myself and JoeT were messing around with my 
geiger counter.  Erik's counter is analog, but mine is digital, and I wrote a program to graph the results.  Below is a 
10 minute span of a normal graph:<br /><br /><center><img src="../../normal-geiger.gif" width="300" height="158" 
style="border: 1px solid black;" /></center><br /><br />Sorry it doesn't have any units on it, but basically the X axis 
is time (in seconds), and the Y axis is CPM.  The normal resolution is 600 x 315 (600 seconds equals 10 minutes), but I 
resized it to make it fit in this blog.  The green line represents the average, and the gray line represents the 
"highscore" (in the graph above, the highscore is 22 CPM).<br /><br />When JoeT and myself were messing around, we tried 
a few different configurations.<br /><br />1. 10:40am - First, JoeT tried sending to the geiger counter itself, without 
a live video feed.   Nothing.  (As a side note, Joe was really screwing up his monitor because he was using that as a 
sending point.)<br /><br />2. 10:56am - Then I thought maybe the steel transducer in Erik's experiment was doing 
something, so I stuck a metal lock in front of my geiger counter (the next closest thing that I own <img 
src="../../s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" />).  And then I set up a live video feed for JoeT to 
target through.  Still no luck. (As a side note, Joe did fry my internet connection at this point.)<br /><br />3. 
11:23am - I put some radioactive marbles in front of the counter so we could make sure the counter actually was working 
- and it spiked at 68 with the marbles.  So the geiger counter was working fine, but we just wern't getting results.<br 
/><br />4. 11:45am - So JoeT had the idea of putting a <a href="../../../artimg/paper.gif" target="_blank">psiwheel</a> in front 
of it, and Joe would try to move the psiwheel and see if the geiger counter was affected.  Nada.<br /><br />As usual, we 
were just sitting around talking in the chat, sort of thinking about what to do next.<br /><br /><tt>[11:55] 
&lt;JoeT&gt; I can't hit the target for shit today.<br />[11:55] &lt;peebrain&gt; it happens<br />[11:56] 
&lt;peebrain&gt; I can't hit stuff right in front of me, so dont feel bad ;-P</tt><br /><br />After I sent that message, 
I thought to myself, "Well, I haven't actually played with a psiwheel in over a year... I could at least try."<br /><br 
/>So I focused on the psiwheel for maybe 30 seconds, just trancing out a little bit.  I got a solid connection to the 
wheel, and "saw" the energy field around it.  I started to play with it a little bit, and tried to spin in.  It didn't 
spin, but it started to do the wobble thing (those who practice with psiwheel's probably know what I mean).  Anyways, I 
looked up, and the graph had maxed out at 36 CPM!  I freaked out.  Joe kept telling me to try to do it again, but it was 
too late... I was already really excited and way too scatter brained to get into a trance again <img 
src="../../s_smile.gif" width="12" height="12" />.  I took a screenshot of the graph:<br /><br 
/><center><img src="../../spiked-geiger.gif" width="300" height="158" style="border: 1px solid black;" /></center><br 
/><br />You can see a clear spike in activity, and it's much higher than normal.  It occurred <i>exactly</i> when I 
started focusing on the wheel, and ended <i>exactly</i> when I looked up and noticed the huge spike, and freaked out.  
You can see the gray line maxed out at 68 from messing with the marbles, at the very top (which we did 35 minutes 
prior).<br /><br />Now that I've reproduced the effect on my end, I'm blown away.  I'm definitly going to start 
practicing more, especially now that I have measurable results that I can compare against from day to day.  If anyone 
wants to reproduce the experiment, there is more than enough information in this post to do so.  If you'd like to use 
the same graphing software, you can contact me in the <a href="reproducible-results.html" target="_blank">chat</a>, or drop me an e-mail at: peebrain@psipog.net .<br /><br />Exciting times!<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>This is very interesting...especially what this suggests the human mind can do. That is of course, if you're actually creating radiation not just messing with the circuitry of the Geiger counter. Cool experiment, very useful for proving psi to skeptics.</p>

                                <p>Did you keep all body parts at an equal distance from the devices at all times?  The human body does contain some radioactivity, thus moving your hands closer would cause a slight increase.  If this is legit, it's fantastic--just be sure that nothing else is causing the spike (like hands).  To ensure accuracy, no one and nothing should be moving at all, and the level of ambient light should remain steady (IE, the sun coming out from behind a cloud may increase ambient radiation level as well).<BR/>I wait to hear more before judging this discovery.<BR/><BR/>--Winged Wolf</p>

                                <p>Well done.<BR/><BR/>Intersting that it was found using a geiger counter: somehow what you did manifested in ionizing radiation. Aside from atomic decay, that could be done from ionizing various atoms in the atmosphere into an energetic state. <BR/><BR/>Besides what mad hatter said, this shows that psionic abilities are very chaotic and have a much farther reach than previously believed. It seems that psionics can influence things on the microcosm of subatomics or in the macrocosm of entire objects. That leaves the question, why is it so hard to work psionics?<BR/><BR/>So close to answering the Great Mystery, but also, so far.<BR/><BR/>I would like to point out that it would not be easy to reproduce this evidence. It is a use of abilities likley beyond the strength of some psionicists at the moment.</p>

                                <p>While it's easy to get caught up in the moment, we need to keep this in perspective.  Personal opinions aside, this experiment is far from the "proof" that we all seek.  It IS however, a wonderful starting point to further active research.  There are still some lofty conditions to this experiment that still need investigation and need good testable theories to pair with, but for the most part, we witness a measurable disturbance that is TTI (timed to intent).<BR/><BR/>We're definitely getting there though. ^__^</p>

                                <p>To answer a few questions...<BR/><BR/>I did test my hands afterwards to make sure my hands didn't cause the spike.  I put my hands in all sorts of different positions, and no spike was detected.  I haven't tried sunlight, but I will tomorrow morning.  I've tried all sorts of things... people have told me cell phones radiate as well... but my cell phone doesn't cause flucuations either.<BR/><BR/>It doesn't take long to test a theory on a different source of the spike.  Only a minute or two.  Feel free to come up with more ideas I can test.<BR/><BR/>~Sean</p>

                                <p>Interesting results, guys.  You're got potential for a proof of principle test once you frame a hypothesis - just because you've already managed to have two separate groups reproduce the effect.  Hopefully your observation will lead to a consistently reproduced effect that can withstand lab testing.  We'll be purchasing a geiger counter up here to see if we can reproduce the results.  We'll let you know either way.  Good luck with further testing.  <BR/><BR/>--Aphanas (and Rainsong & Jael)</p>

                                <p>This is awesome, but people, don't jump to conclusions. This doesn't mean that PSI is alpha/beta/gamma ray, it just means that a geiger counter can measure it. <BR/>For example, a scale can be used to measure mass and weight. (As long as it is on Earth and you use a conversion) But, this doesn't mean that weight is mass.<BR/>Just want to make sure no quick-conclusions are made.<BR/><BR/>The SmartAss</p>

                                <p>Hey man thats awesome. That really is cool. What i think you should try is making a psi-ball in front of it, and see if the activity has a positive correspondance with the amount of "oomph" you put in. If so, we finally have our scale for how to measure psi!<BR/><BR/>CONGRATULATIONS!</p>

Small samples of Uranium-235 produce around 25 CPM at 6". The human body should have a value significantely lower than that.</p>

                                <p>This is all very interesting and such... but isn't  TK(PK) just the movement of something? And doesn't it have the same principles as Psyonics? The acute ability to manipulate energy or matter? How would a geiger counter, that measures radiation, really prove were moving anything? Basically, doesn't it mean were sorta creating radiation? or kinda, manipulating that in particullar? And if so... wouldn't it be dangerous if those levels of radiation became significantly high???<BR/><BR/>Thanks!<BR/><BR/>-Figgeh</p>

                                <p>The scope of these experiments are not to prove that we ARE moving anything.  We already got that down.  Done deal.  What we are investigating is the energetic reaction that facilitates motion.  It's like saying the a car moves BECAUSE it has wheels, but giving no reference to the engine that does the work, or even the fuel that powers it.</p>

Maybe if you tried having an OBE and while in that OBE you try moving your hand over the counter you may be able to tell if it was a dream or not,and also if the counter really works since your not in your body and the radiation levels would be sure to not come from you.</p>

                                <p>I was curious about what 'smartass' said.  What type of radiation was being detected, and did you do a backround survey prior to starting the experiement?  Therefore, you can eliminate such things as external vairables, atmosphereic anomolies, etc.  If rad is the case, then the concept of psi might move from a 'feeling' force function to more of a visualtion of multitudes of atoms being moved via.  As you said, you saw the field.  it might have been a reaction...a micro-nuclear process in the cup of your hands.  Very, very interesting nonetheless.  Now that it can be recognized that psi is being used, being able to monitor growth and manipulation can take on a more structured method, no?</p>

                                <p>Bear in mind that in any 'usual' experiment that deals with radiation in any way.. The counters are set for a day (at the very least, several hours) in order to 'calibrate' against the background radiation.<BR/><BR/>Without this calibration, the results might simply be caused by natural fluctuations in the radiation that's beaming down on us and radiating from all around us.<BR/><BR/>Interesting experiment, but it requires proper methodology and setup to make it a 'fair test' before anything can be proved.<BR/><BR/>If you throw a dice twice and it happens to land on six both times, would you then take it that the dice always lands on number six? :)</p>

                                <p>There are several things you should test.<BR/>(1) Is it only with TK? Does it work with psi balls/ constructs/ other things?<BR/>(2)Is it belief bassed? If you can find someone who knows nothing about the counter or that they are besing tested will it still regester resoults when they do psi stuff? Or will it only work if one is aware of the counter.<BR/>(3)How big an effect/ how much psi is required for it to regester? Will it regester weak effects?</p>

                                <p>Not very spectacular at first... such graphics can be influenced directly, without a geiger counter or such device. Maybe your subc did just that.<BR/><BR/>But maybe you're on the right trail... but then, why the geiger counter? Radioactivity can't move objects. Could be a sort of side effect of "psi" or whatever.<BR/>Whatever... just keep experimenting, we'll see then. Some other test persons and other experiment set-ups would be good.<BR/><BR/>(Maybe a person able of doing TK moving a object and the geiger counter is hidden near it, without the person knowing of it?)<BR/><BR/>Good luck.<BR/>~ice][tea</p>
