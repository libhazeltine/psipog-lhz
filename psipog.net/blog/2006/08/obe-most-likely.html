                  <p>I'm fairly sure I had an OBE this morning.<br /><br />First, it's probably important that I read the entire book <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i> yesterday.  I bought it at the book store, started reading, and couldn't put it down.  I finished at about 2:15am.  The book is a fictional adventure story, but also has a lot of intelligent and wise ideas (labelled "Insights") throughout it.  It talks about coincidences, energy, control dramas, and better ways to deal with people.  (It even has techniques to see energy, which I plan on testing out <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" />.)  All of the advice seemed really good, even though the book was a story.  I got a lot from it.<br /><br />(As another note, please don't take this to mean it's healthy to read fictional books, and lose your grasp on reality.  Stories are stories, and written for entertainment purposes.  Nonetheless, that particular story had some interesting ideas speckled in it, which are worth my time to think about.)<br /><br />For my OBE, I woke up in the morning, laying in my bed face up.  I was staring at my ceiling fan.  I don't even remember what made me think of having an OBE - all I thought about was "charging" myself with energy.  As I breathed in, I took in energy at my heart location.  I did this for a short while, and noticed that there was a blueish-purpleish light in the corner of my room (to the left of my ceiling fan).<br /><br />I realized that the light wouldn't normally be there in my room... so I started to look at it closely.  When I did, it started getting finer in detail.  It was around this time I figured out that I was ready for an OBE (I think... can't really remember exactly).<br /><br />I didn't really try to leave - instead, I just took my left hand, and tried to reach the ceiling fan like I did <a href="../07/obe-haha.html">in my last OBE</a>.  I stretched my arm, and tried to feel for the fan, but couldn't feel it.  When I put my hand in front of the blue light, and focused on the area, my hand became visible.  It looked almost like <a target="_blank" href="http://robertellisonimaging.com/framesetdocs/graphics/galleries/3-d/hand%202/images/Hand-2-Top-Smoothwire.jpg">a wireframe hand</a>, made out of blue wires.<br /><br />I stretched my hand out, trying to feel for anything, but couldn't feel anything.  I faded in and out of consciousness... trying to figure out if I was having a legitimate OBE or not.  At one point, I put my hands over my eyes, to see if I could see through them.  I could.  At first I thought I was looking through my physical hands, but then I realized that I didn't move my physical hands when I put them over my eyes.<br /><br />I called for whoever was out there to help me.  To grab my wrists and ankles, like "they" have in the past.  Nothing happened.  I wasn't scared, or angry, or feeling frustrated.  I was stuck in my body (while out of body <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" />), but it didn't really bother me like it normally does.  I just sort of played around with my states of consciousness, played around with what I was seeing, and had fun.<br /><br />This entire experience probably lasted around 20 minutes.  I don't have memory of the entire experience, but I do remember most of it.<br /><br />There are two main reasons why I think this OBE was legit.  One, my vision was in the correct orientation as my physical body, and my vision was representative of my correct environment (except for the blueish light).  In a false awakening, usually things are not that clear, and everything is jacked up.  Plus a lot of false awakenings don't happen in the same location as your physical body (for example, I've had false awakenings where I wake up at my old home in New York).<br /><br />Two, because at one point in the OBE, I saw a blurry skin-colored triangle at the bottom left of my vision.  I thought it must be my hand - my knuckle resting on my cheek.  After that, I didn't pay much attention to it.  Now that I think back to the experience, it was obviously my nose <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" />.  I must have been predominantly looking through my right eye.  The fact that I incorrectly labelled it, and it still existed and behaved like a nose after this incorrect belief, is good evidence that this experience wasn't a dream.<br /><br />Fun times <img src="../../s_smile.gif" width="12" height="12" />.  Also, I recommend that book to anyone who is interested in psionics and truth.  It's sweet.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>Go meditate. Clear your mind, then remember the experience. Focus on the memory for a long time and use all of your mind to wonder 'why'. The memory should be enough, eventually to invoke a conscious understanding & eventually conscious control of OBE?<BR/><BR/>Just a suggestion.</p>
