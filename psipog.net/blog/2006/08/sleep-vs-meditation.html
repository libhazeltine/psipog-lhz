               <div class="blogPostBody">
                  <p>I started getting into psionics at the age of 15.  I started my initial OBE training at 16.  This consisted of a lot of meditation and finding a balance between being awake, and being asleep.<br /><br />When I turned 17, I graduated high school, and moved to Georgia with my parents to go to college at The University of Georgia.  It was somewhere in here that I adopted the habit of sleeping... a LOT.  I've read that altering your sleeping schedule is one way the body deals with stress (chemically).  Perhaps that's one reason why I screwed with my sleeping schedule so much.<br /><br />The good side effect of doing this was that I was constantly in different states of consciousness.  Some days I would take 4 hour naps, stay awake for another 4 hours, then go to sleep for the night for 6 hours.  And other times I would pull all-nighters just for the fun of it.<br /><br />From the ages of 17 until 22, I slept a lot.  My record for continuous sleep is 18 hours.  My record for most sleep is 24 hours out of 36 hour timespan (slept 14, awake 6, slept 10).  My record for staying awake without caffiene or pills is 42 hours.  During this time, with all the blurry states of consciousness, I logically attatched meditation to sleep.  When I went to sleep, I would try and meditate beforehand.  Sometimes I would get bored, and just roll over and say "screw it".  Other times I would get deep meditation.  And other times I would meditate for 5 minutes then knock out.<br /><br />This worked wonderfully for OBEs (although I wouldn't recommend doing this <i>just</i> for OBEs... if you're already doing this, then you might want to try OBEs in addition to these bad habits <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" />).<br /><br />Lately, I've been challenging myself to sleep no more than 7.5 hours a night, and sometimes only allow myself 6 hours a night.  No naps during the day.  Go to sleep at the same time every night (2am).  Eat healthy, exercise, no alcohol.  This has really purified my physical body, and I'm turning: healthy!  Go figure <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" />.<br /><br />In this process, my meditation has gone down the crapper.  When I lay down at night, I don't feel like meditating.  I feel like going to sleep.  For the past month, I've constantly been strugling with this "Sleep or meditation?" question every night.  Most nights I say "screw it", and just go to sleep.  Other times, I force myself to meditate, and do terrible.<br /><br />While running today, it dawned on me.  Sleep or meditation?  Both decisions are bad.  Therefore, there must be a third alternative... and in this case, there was a pretty obvious third alternative once I realized I was stuck in this situation.  Sleep AND meditation! Duh.<br /><br />Once I made that realization, it dawned on me how my old sleeping habits worked great for meditating before sleep.  But now that I'm getting healthy, and my body's chemistry is healthy, it doesn't work.  So I should sleep when I want to sleep.  And then schedule time during the morning to meditate.  The plan I have is such:  Go to sleep at 2am, wake up at 9:30am, go running at 10:15am, shower at 11:30am, and meditate afterwards.  I hope to change this structure so that I sleep 6 hours eventually, but this is a good stepping stone.<br /><br />Anyways, just thought I'd share that with everyone.  If you have healthy body chemistry, and cyclic sleep patterns, then don't force yourself to choose between sleep OR meditation.  Sleep when you want to sleep.  And make time during the day to meditate.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>Sup.<BR/><BR/>Here is something you should try, and IT would catapult your abilities to the next level.  <BR/><BR/>I believe that in our true state of Felt-Oneness with the Divine Source of Life, there Source of the Psi energy you use to create Psi-balls, we are supposed to be living meditation as the natural experience of life, fully intune with the Universe and living through a deeper and higher awareness that we currently live at.<BR/><BR/>From my own meditations, what I've come to know is that the very question you pose "Sleep Vs Meditation", is infact the question that will open the portal to the Unified Field of All Possibilities.<BR/><BR/>When man can learn two manifest what he dreams simultaneously in Real-Time as his physical reality, he'll know his Divinity as deeply as God HIMSELF knows his Divinity.<BR/><BR/>To do this, to bridge the cap between existing as a body with a spirit, and to a spirit with a body, is to realize that the only time of day that we live as spirit is when we are sleeping.  We are at the deepest level of mind (Delta).  That is when our Astral (Spirit) body awakens and lives.  In essence we live 2 lives.  One of a physical nature and one of a spiritual nature.  <BR/><BR/>We are attached to these waking moments, which could just quickly be considered our sleeping state, and our DreamConsciousness our awakened state.  In a sense it is like this, from our Astral or Spirit self's perspective.  <BR/><BR/>When one learns to Merge the two together, then one unlocks the keys to the universe.<BR/><BR/>The way to do this from what I know is to start Meditating instead of Sleeping.  That means, if you sleep for 6 to 8 hours a night, you meditate for 6 to 8 hours a night, instead of sleeping.  You see, sleeping is sub-conscious.  Deep, inner meditation is super-conscious.    <BR/><BR/>Therefore, we can then direct our sub-conscious to heal our bodies, remove toxins, and rejuvenate our bodies, and spend that time consciously aware of our higher selfs as us, and not just apart of us.<BR/><BR/>One month of this meditation style is equal to spending 8 months meditating for 1 hour a day.<BR/><BR/>A famous Yogi called Paramahansa Yogananda, taugh Kriya Yoga, which contained the Hong-Sau concentration meditation, to lower your heart rate and breathing rate, while recharging your Divine Consciousness and prana. <BR/><BR/>It may suprise you to think of going 8 hours without breathing, but when you are Spirit, you don't need to breath to live.  Your body experiences freedom from relentless to stay alive at those higher states of consciousness.<BR/><BR/>The meditation is actually online for free from http://www.ananda.org/meditation/support/simplemedtechnique.html<BR/><BR/>Check it out.<BR/><BR/>Paramahansa Yogananda also said that if anyone wants to become a master in this life, one needs to spend at least a minimum of 1 1/2 to 2 hours a day meditating.  When he was a kid, he did "meditation for sleep" and did so for over 8 hours at times.<BR/><BR/>He is one of the most widely known Yogi masters here in the west.<BR/><BR/>You should read his book, "Autobiography of a Yogi"<BR/><BR/>His foundation that supports his teachings after his passing, has placed a copy online for anyone who wants the deep truths of the Yogis, which is for ALL:  http://www.ananda.org/inspiration/books/ay/index.html<BR/><BR/>Namaste<BR/><BR/>Anthony</p>

                                <p>Here are those links again for the exercises you can use to live meditation at night instead of sleeping.  It will obviously take practice, but when you get there, you'll be able to spend the other 16 hours of the day with great love and joy in your heart.  You essentially won't need to 'schedule' time to meditate, as you will naturally meditate when you're ready to 'repair & recharge'<BR/><BR/><BR/>The free online book, <A HREF="http://www.ananda.org/inspiration/books/ay/index.html" REL="nofollow">Autobiography of a Yogi</A><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>The <A HREF="http://www.ananda.org/meditation/support/simplemedtechnique.html" REL="nofollow">Hong-Sau Kriya Yoga Meditation</A> you can use instead of sleeping</p>
