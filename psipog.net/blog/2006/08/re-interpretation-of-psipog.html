               <div class="blogPostBody">
                  <p>You might want to read <a href="my-purpose.html">my previous post</a> before you read this one.  At least read the very end.<br /><br />Why did I create PsiPog?  A month ago, I would have probably answered that I created PsiPog to grow and learn about psionics, and share with others what we've learned.  Teach, help, and continue to grow on everyone's collective discoveries.  This is partially true, but it's also partially a lie.<br /><br />PsiPog makes more sense once you realize why I really created it.  Please don't think that I purposely lied to everyone over the years - I wasn't aware of the full reason why I created PsiPog until recently.  In fact, just in the past day have I really grasped what was going through my head.<br /><br />The reason I created PsiPog was to prove psionics to myself.  I was a very hardcore skeptic, and even though I intuitively knew psionics was real, I demanded a lot of proof.  An unreasonable amount of proof.  This was good, and a lot of people identified with my goal.  They wanted hardcore proof of psionics as well, and were sick of all the new age people who believed without this strict proof.  So we all united with this common goal of proving psionics to ourselves.<br /><br />So, we got to work.  We practiced, but also felt threatened by the practice at the same time.  We wanted proof, but also feared it... this balance between the two was hard to maintain.  I guess what we really feared was being proven wrong.  We all intuitively know that psionics is real, and we know that the world is a mysterious place.  But we can't help but be skeptical, and even cynical at times.  We live in a society where reality is perceived as a huge machine.  In our hearts we knew that this wasn't completely true... but intellectually, we couldn't find another way to express it.<br /><br />So psionics was adopted.  The PsiPog version of psionics was designed for proof.  That's why we only focused on newbie exercises.  We unconsciously knew that that's where we needed to focus.  That's where we would find our proof.  Talking about "advanced" stuff was a waste of time... we were looking for proof, not actual skill.<br /><br />But this fear of being proven wrong also lingered over us.  We wanted to believe that the world was magical, and we were sick of this mechanical outlook on life.  But we also feared that the mechanical outlook on life was correct.<br /><br />Practice was constructed in such a way that we would easily sabotage our own efforts.  After all... what happens if we honestly practiced our hardest, and didn't get the proof we were looking for?  Then we were forced to conclude that psionics wasn't real, and therefore the cynical cold mechanical world must be true.  So we made backdoors.  We constructed a practice in such a way that if we failed, we could make an excuse, so that we could still believe in this mysterious world.<br /><br />But these backdoors also hurt us.  These excuses built underlying resentment, and deep down we knew something was wrong.  Things didn't work... but we didn't know why.  But we knew the mechanical world couldn't be true either, so we floated around, unsure of what to do.<br /><br />Think about it.  Why do we keep psionics a secret?  Why do we feel the need to shut up and not tell others about it?  Because when we say it, we feel like fools.  It's not because people think we're crazy... it's because we fear that they're right.  We fear that the mechanical world is correct.  And we fear that if we become outspoken about psionics, then the mechnical world will bitch-slap us back to the cold reality.<br /><br />I knew unconsciously that once I found undeniable proof, that I would be forced to deal with the fact that the world was mysterious.  Which is also scary.  I knew unconsciously that once I found this proof, that PsiPog would have to be deconstructed.  So this caused a lot of tension... I wanted proof, so that I could put the mechanical world behind me.  But it also scared me that the world was so unknown.  And it also scared me to think (unconsciously) that I would have to get rid of all my hard work (PsiPog) once I found this proof.  So this caused a lot of conflicting actions and fear.<br /><br />What changed it for me?  The entire geiger counter experience.  You can look back in this blog and see the change in me.  Before the geiger counter, I was focused on this vision of the "perfect" PsiPog.  Focused on programming, and doing tedious work.  That was my excuse.  Why wasn't PsiPog living up to the purpose I consciously believed it had (learning, teaching, sharing)?  Because I had to finish this system!  I had to make it better!  Then it would work!<br /><br />But what was really going on?  I was just waiting for proof.  There is always a way to make something better, and there are an unlimited number of ideas.  To put all this emphasis on the programming was my way of excusing myself.  There were no new articles, because there was nothing more I could write about that would bring about proof.  We had everything we needed, but the proof wasn't coming.  More articles wouldn't solve that.<br /><br />Then the geiger counter proved it to me.  That proved it, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that the world is a mysterious place.  That psionics is real, and psychic abilities are real.  Without any doubt.  Now I know others are skeptical of the experiment - that's fine.  The important thing was that I proved it to myself - I lived up to my own strict hardcore standards.<br /><br />After that, my entire belief system started to disassemble.  I had my proof, and everything that was constructed to produce this proof started to return to equalibrium.  Look at my posts after the geiger counter experiment.  They are not my "normal" type of posts.  Shit was going on in my head.<br /><br />I "channelled" my subconscious.  I put forth evidence that dreams are more real that people give them credit.  I created a way for articles to be published on PsiPog.net (there hadn't been new articles in months/years).  I got a psychic reading.  I decentralized the psipog server (before the update, PsiPog.net was the "main server".  Now pbwhere.com is the "main server", and PsiPog.net is a child off of it).  I emphasized correct meditation habits.  I read a fiction New Age book, The Celestine Prophecy (the last fiction book I read before that was 5 years ago).  I posted about how skepticism is unhealthy (even though skepticism is a fundamental belief on psipog).  I posted realizations I've made over the years.  And then finally, I posted on my purpose.<br /><br />All of these posts were a result of my beliefs disassembling.  I acquired my proof that psionics is real.  PsiPog has fulfilled it's purpose.<br /><br />So now I'm left with: psionics is real.  Now what?  Now I need to use this knowledge towards a bigger goal.  Bigger than just teaching kids to feel energy balls between their hands, or spinning paper using PK.  The only reason those goals were adopted in the first place was because they were methods of finding proof.  But now that we have proof... what is the bigger picture?  Do we really want to sit around and spin paper?<br /><br />What is the implication of this proof?  Back to our original fear: the implication is that the cold mechanical world is false... or more accurately stated, the cold mechanical world isn't the complete truth.  The world is a mystical place, not this impersonal robitic world that society holds on to.  We can stop being cynical.<br /><br />Our intuition was correct.  The world is not figured out - not by a long shot.  We're not at the end of civilization - we're at the beginning.  We're reaching the point where this awareness of a non-physical world is starting to become conscious in society.  We're reaching the point where people are getting sick of this cynical cold world, and are asking for more.  That's why we've become interested in psionics, and this is where society is headed.<br /><br />But society doesn't give two shits about psi balls.  Sorry to break it to you.  Society doesn't give two shits about spinning a piece of paper on a tack.  We've used these tools up until this point to push ourselves over the edge.  But now that we are over that edge, we can return to our larger goal.<br /><br />Our larger goal is the awareness that there is a non-physical reality.  That we are more than our physical bodies.  That the world isn't a cruel experience, followed by a painful death.  There is more.<br /><br />That is why my new purpose is focused on OBEs and spirituallity.  I believe OBEs are my way of moving between the physical and non-physical.  I don't think OBEs are the <i>only</i> way, but it's the way I am wired for.  The way I have been preparing for since I was a little kid - even before I believed in psionics.<br /><br />Does this mean the ideals of PsiPog are thrown out the window?  In a way, yes.  In another way, no.  Don't get me wrong - healthy skepticism and forcing people to explain things without relying on religion is very good.  It's very healthy.  But it's not the end.  We must eventually face the fear that skepticism is hiding us from, and face the truth that the world is a spiritual place.<br /><br />Both skepticism and absence of spirituallity exist because of this fear that the world is mechanical.  Once you overcome that fear, then skepticism dissolves, and spirituallity becomes your focus.<br /><br />So yes - skepticism and absence of spirituallity are healthy in some ways.  They are healthy because it's a more positive manifestation of the fear.  It's taking our fear, and creating a system to attack it.  For example, a more negative manifestation of the fear would be a belief that human life is worthless because we all die anyways.  This belief is another way for the fear of the mechanical world to manifest, but it is obviously very negaitve.  However, skepticism and absense of spirituallity are more positive manifestations of that same fear.  It's the manifestation right before we overcome it.<br /><br />But we must eventually leave this behind.  We must identify the fear that causes skepticism and absense of spirituallity, and see for ourselves that the world is really a mystical place.  Once we understand that, then skepticism seems anti-logical, and spirituallity seems obvious.<br /><br />That is the shift that society will be going through.  We will move, as a society, through this transformation.  From an unconscious fear of the mechanical world, to a conscious realization that the world is a spiritual place.<br /><br />And my purpose is to help make this transformation happen.<br /><br />The method by which I plan to help is using OBEs and the dream state.<br /><br />This is my purpose.  I hope this has cleared up a lot of things for people.  If not, and you think I've gone off the deep end, then that's ok too :-P.  Just keep doing what makes sense to you.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>I know where you are coming from. I'm on the edge that you just went over, I think. I've always been more on the side of the spiritual, but not in the traditional sense. I really would like to OBE, so I can decide for myself what "life" really is. I've held back on PsiPog, and tried to be skeptical, and logical. I used to be about as logical and skeptical as is possible. Then something started happening, and now I'm completely different. Once I experience an OBE I think the decision will be cemented. Whether to return to the "mechanical world," or to stay the path of transcendence. <BR/><BR/><BR/>Also, to bring this into perspective, remember one of the first things Monroe said in his book? <BR/><BR/>Paraphrase: Most people take OBE's as proof of the existance of something outside the body. This is a flawed assumption, as the body is alive and operating while an OBE takes place.<BR/><BR/>I look forward to seeing whatever your next project is, whether it is online or no.</p>

                                <p>First off, I deeply respect your transformation, and I'm proud that you are so head-strong about it.  However, I don't believe in the statement:  "oh great...I can move paper...oh well, I guess this is proof enough, and I'm just going to forget all the training it took to get the proof, and all that I learned along the way" (yeah, a bit too long).  I believe in the statement "oh great...I can move paper...ok, that's proof for me, now let me try an advanced psionic practice to focus on to hone these skills recently proved to me."  I know this isn't what you are saying, but it's close.  <BR/><BR/>I think that since we have reached this point of understanding, we should now strive for a point of achievement.  That is, a focus on more advanced or straight-forward skills.  Ones that can actually aid us more than feeling energy balls between our hands.  Maybe use PsiPog as a beginer's site, then the next as an "advanced" site.  I know you have your own vision and enlightenment; and I'm not trying to change it, just offering alternatives to basically throwing PsiPog away.  <BR/><BR/>It's a little depressing to come to find one of the best sites in psionics is being archived, especially one that helps newbies out as much as this one.  I've gained more friends on this site than I did on any other site, and it's a shame to know that all that work we all did to help out others is vanishing.  Again, I deeply respect your choice, and I am very happy you are so head-strong about this transformation, but is there a way to keep the forums?  Or keep them as logs at least?  This way more newbies can at least look at all the questions asked over the years, and try to find guidance in the advice kept over time.  <BR/><BR/>But, like mad hatter said, I look forward to seeing your next project, and I wish you the best of luck in whatever it is you want to accomplish, and your journey throughout life.</p>

                                <p>After reading your latest blog peebrain I just felt compelled to say a few things. I've felt psi between my palms and others palms, I've moved a piece of paper and the fan in my room. I've even done a little telepathy and been inches from an OBE but it wasn't enough to curve the doubt in my mind. I don't know if there is something beyond the tangable but just reading your words have inspired me to find out. If I find that you are indeed correct then I'll be one of guys rooting for you to make a project on spirituality and power of consciousness. I'll never reject critical thinking though. So, is this the end of psipog as we know it?</p>

                                <p>I understand why your leaving psipog, but do you have to "kill" it? Think of the hundreds of young psions who are just starting, where will they turn? There are not many begginer friendly places to turn.<BR/>Is there no one who can take over?</p>

                                <p>I see what you mean. I understand how you feel too - deconstructing your ideas and beliefs can be a hard thing. I myself have gone over the edge - way over - to develop my own theories, thoughts and methods. However there is something I disagree with you on: "killing" PsiPog. What you are suggesting is, in fact, not "killing" PsiPog the site (as the contents will remain) but PsiPog the society. Actually, one can say that instead of taking PsiPog from the psions, you take the psions from PsiPog and I ask: where's the good in that? you might as well just edit all of the articles into a book and publish it.<BR/><BR/>It is the people that make PsiPog what it is and it is them who changed it from what you first intended it to be into what it is today.<BR/><BR/>The articles can go to hell (forgive me all authors - nothing personal). Anyone can teach a person from his experiences without the need for a disclamer at the top of the page. We teach each other and learn from each other - PsiPog is just the medium.<BR/><BR/>Remember what you had to undergo in order to achieve your...enlightenment (no mockery here - you have my respect). By keeping the site interactive you enable others to undergo the same things too. After all, not all people are ready to accept your ideas that will become the core of your new group.<BR/>In that you were right: PsiPog is just for the basics, to jump-start people on their way and to push them towards realizing their inner intuitions about the world.<BR/>However, people need those basics. You can try to teach them from your end of the road you have taken (not that you have finished walking it) but in the end, after dealing with psionics as long as you have, you must also know deep down inside of you that there are no shortcuts. Everyone must travel the entire length of their path if they are to get somewhere.<BR/>This is why you should leave PsiPog: as a signpost directing people on their way.<BR/>The way I see it (and I may be wrong) PsiPog isn't based on the seperation of religion and spirituality from proof and logic. It teaches you an important lesson - use your own mind to figure things out, what is right, what is not right. Choose your own path. Should it conflict with your beliefs you are free to do whatever you wish with it. That is what PsiPog eventually encourages, even with all of the articles and sharing.<BR/><BR/>This is why I ask you to keep PsiPog running as it is. You can transfer the managing of it to someone else if any wish it.<BR/>I would appreciate it if you do.<BR/><BR/>P.S. - Sorry for bad grammar, spelling or paragraphing but english isn't my native language.</p>

                                <p>Sean, I have been led through your guidence for alomost 2 years now. It was enjoyable experiencing the path which was marked, and finding things out. I completely understand that you want to further yourself, I applaud you for that. I myself see the small proof of spinning paper to inspire others. And, after reading your last two blogs you opened my eyes, I realized I was afraid of the "mechanical world". It has been a long and good trip.<BR/>Thank you. <BR/>               <BR/>               ~Zoolions~</p>

                                <p>I can't express my greatfulness to you, Peebrain.  In the short time that I've been a member of Psipog you've been like a teacher to me.  I must say that I'll be sad when/if psipog is 'killed', but I find it inspiring at the same time.  Others will pick up the torch and carry on where you leave off.  I find excitement in PK, my goal is to push the laws of physics to their limit and find out what the mind is really capable of.  I knew this was what I wanted to do because when I thought about it I got butterflies in my stomache.  I am truely going to miss your guidance, but hopefully one day you might return.  May you find happiness in the path you've selected.<BR/><BR/>-mikeofmind-</p>

To admit that the mental fortress, you had built for yourself through your words and actions, suddenly has crumpled due to the revelation of information took much guts. Where ever life may lead you, remimber you always have people to support you.<BR/><BR/>Life may seem cold, uncaring, harsh. But through it all if you know what you want, it wont matter!</p>

                                <p>I'm both very surprised and quite sorry to hear that POG may be shutting down after all this time.  I can understand the positive and negative points you see in either handing it over to someone else, or simply archiving and closing it.  I wish you luck in your future endeavor, and hope that you will be happy with whatever decision you eventually make.  It can be difficult to give up a brain-child, and the next person at the helm may not do things the way you would.  On the other hand, POG does serve a purpose for many young psis seeking help, and I know many of them will be sorry to see their options narrow.  Still, as an archive, POG could provide most of these resources in a non-interactive fashion, and still remain a valuable resource. So regardless of what you decide, I don't think your prior work will 'go to waste'.</p>

                                <p>Sean,  I just want to take a few minutes here to tell you what I have taken from psipog.  First, I was raised to believe that all psycics were crazy, or lying, or both.  However, a year or so ago when i went through an extremely stressful time in my life and in my marriage, I started to experience odd things happening to me along the lines of telepathy, which made me confront people like my husband, my parents, even my neighbors, because i didnt understand it.  They all said i was crazy, literally tried to institutionalize me, and i almost went. Since then, I tell NO ONE what I experience on a day to day basis.  The flood of "conversation" has only recently started to quiet down, since i now know how to shield correctly, from psipog.  But more than that, is that the articles I found and read, (which is almost all of them) confirmed things that were told to me over a year ago, in the begining of my experiences.<BR/>Shielding, broadcasting, the mirror shield, the bubble shield, combat, and shutting down, these are just a few things that I recieved as messages during my crisis.  So what did psipog do for me?  Confirmation.  It allowed me to admit for once that I know what I continue to experience is real, and not the need for some serious medication.  I still cannot share this with my family, or husband, because of their previous reaction.  but now I understand it a little more.  I respect your decision, and i understand your need to follow your heart instead of your imposed obligations from others.  But I wanted you to know how this site has helped me. Ive only known of this site for about a month, but Ive spent 3 to 4 hours a day researching archived forums and Q&A as well as the links offered.  I hope that you post easy access to your new site, so those that are still interested in what you have to say, and teach, can find you.  thank you for all of your hard work and research that is avaliable at the click of a mouse for me.</p>

                                <p>First and foremost I’d like to thank you Sean for everything you have done to date.  You essentially took the idea from Dimensional Doorways years ago and actually made a very informative resource void of much the fluffy chaos of the past.  I’m proud to have joined PsiPog in the past, however I, as well as a few others, have noticed PsiPog’s unwillingness to move on.  Many of us respected your decision to keep PsiPog at an entry level but I feel we’ve lost quite a number of good people in past due to their inability to grow at PsiPog.<BR/><BR/>However I must admit, your site has allowed many of us to grow rapidly compared to other places due to how the material is presented to the people.  Had the material not been governed with your strict guidelines I feel the effectiveness would be reduced.  With that said, please let some of us know about your new site you are creating.  A few of us have been waiting for you to take this next step and have been quietly watching and waiting for some time now.  Say the word and you will have valuable resources in attempt to help you reach your new goals as well have familiar faces working with you once again.  Many of us would love to have the opportunity trail blaze new territory in proper fashion in attempts to serve the ultimate goal of everything you’ve done; finding the truth.</p>

                                <p>i was wondering when you were going to get here.<BR/><BR/>ive been following psipog since the start... i think you should pass it on to someone younger, psipog is a great place for starting out and as much as these "techniques" are useless, they help to build a 100% confidance that this is real, everyone needs that to progress right.<BR/><BR/>for most from this point on you have to go solo... thats the only way u can truly get your head around it all. other people just make a noise in your head.<BR/><BR/>but<BR/><BR/>start an obe group...  i know elite-ism is horrible but at this stage it's needed, people that are here are the only one's who would bother with it anyway i think.<BR/><BR/>ive always wanted to meet with someone out of body... it happened once but it wasnt pre arranged, it scared the crap out of me, but that was proof to me that you can interact with others out of body.<BR/>i think with a big enough group of ppl all prepare ing and trying at a certain time, it might be possible.<BR/><BR/>ill stop going on but i have alot of theorys and things id like to discuss, psipog was too NO! on the whole spiritual thing and most other place's belive without questioning, reciting crap from old books and not proving these things to them selves.<BR/><BR/>what we need is the curiosity and experiment of psipog but with the understanding that come's with expeirence. no more proving to them, but improving ourselves.<BR/><BR/>tom li.<BR/>tomliuk@hotmail.com</p>

                                <p>Ya know, there is a good part of me that wants to dance around you saying I told you so, I told you so, but I'm too nice for that.  Besides I really do respect you as a psionic.<BR/><BR/>If you've looked at my site, you'll see I did the same as you, but much faster.  When I first came to PsiPog, I didn't know what spiritual was, I just knew it was bad.  I didn't know that I was spiritual and anyone who talked to me long enough would find that.<BR/><BR/>When I created my site, first using MSN (ok so I was new at making sites) I wanted a strict, non spiritual site.  It wasn't until I made my third version of PsiWorld that I was open enough to let my members, friends and other sites know I was spiritual.  I thought if I told people I was supportive of spiritual talk and obe every night I might as well said I was gay.<BR/><BR/>Well I can tell you this from exprience, being non spiritual has it's limits.  Anyone who trains hard for a good two or more years will find that out.  At some point science has nothing more to teach you with psi.  But when you "go over" to the spirit side, you'll find so much information that is real and can be trusted that you'll be busy for the rest of your life.<BR/><BR/>It took me months and months to find that.  I had to face friends and say they were right.  I had to get humble.  A lot of spiritual articles are fake and untrustworthy, but a few out there, if you know where to look are wonderful.<BR/><BR/>So instead of gloating in your face, I'm thanking you.  I know frome exprience it's hard to come out like this.  I know that you're worried this may be the end of any site you ever make.  It's not.  There is a MUCH bigger community of trustworthy, smart, with a healthy sense of reality spiritual people out there, just begging you hear what you have to say.  I know.  I'm one of them.  You will always be welcomed on my site and will always be welcomed to talk to me as two well trained, exprienced, but still new when it comes to OBES psionics.</p>

                                <p>Hey Sean.  I'd just like to thank you for psipog, first of all.  It was the first site I ever saw that was related to psionics, and if it wasn't for the psiball exercise, I probably would never have gotten into psionics or any deeper into what isn't considered "logical".  I also wouldn't have the beliefs I have now.<BR/><BR/>I respect your decision, because in all honesty, I think a LOT of us got into psionics to fill that "spiritual" or even "philosphical" hole that many of us have.  I like the way you put it:  we have a fear of a "machine" world.  I've been thinking about what you've been thinking about for a while, except I haven't actually come to a decision yet (I've always been thinking "Who am I?  What's my purpose in life?  What's the point?  And so on).  All your work never went to waste, because I'm sure there are dozens of others in the same boat as me.  Sure, we could have found out about stuff elswhere, but who REALLY knows?  It'll be a great archive.<BR/><BR/>Also, I'm looking forward to seeing your new OBE group/website.<BR/><BR/>Anyways, good luck on all your future work.  Hopefully you'll find what you really enjoy and can continue with it.<BR/><BR/>(It was pretty late when I posted this, I hope it was coherant.)</p>

                                <p>Sean, I've visited your website a great many times in the past, and I thank you.  Before I found this wonderful website, I was very interested in psionics and didn't know where to go... I hate to know that it is going, but I respect where you're coming from.  I haven't been there myself, but I really think I know where you're coming from...<BR/><BR/>I would like to ask you something though... Would you mind passing the website along to someone else that you can trust with it? I know that you need to go on your own path, but I think that others like me would thank you forever if you passed on this wonderful website on instead of archiving it.<BR/><BR/>I think that this would be a great way to keep Psipog thriving for all of the people that need the help that your website and everyone in it has given me, and let you be on your own personal path.  I respect your decision, whatever you choose...<BR/><BR/>And I don't think you have gone off of the deep end, and I don't think that many others do.  Your path is your own.  I'll still visit Psipog and the other website you make from time to time daily looking for updates like I have done for over a year and a half now, and I hope you make the decision that you feel is right.</p>

                                <p>Sean, I respect your decision. I want to thank you for all the information you have given to me on PSIPOG  though I will miss some of the things on here, you can be sure I'll be ready to help and learn on your next site. (should you make one) By the way, with OBE's I may be able to provide some information, before I found PSIPOG i was fixated on OBE's and have had about 11-12 of them that I can remeber.  Anyway, Good luck with everything.</p>

                                <p>you should do what makes you happy yes, however there are plenty of us who are still looking for proof, and at least I feel that its a mistake to take out all the interactive parts of the site. to me , being able to see others have the same experience as I, and being able to talk to them and share experience provides a little reassurance and sort of moral support that I'm not alone in this, to know that there are thousands of people out there trying hard just like I, and being able to contact them is very helpful because a lot of us aren't lucky enough to have people we can talk to about this stuff face to face, much less talk to someone who's had a lot of experience. I for one find it very hard to talk about it with even my most personal friends. they just stare at me and think I'm crazy. I even stopped talking to them (and most people) about psionics and its not because I'm afraid of being wrong or I'm afraid that they think I'm crazy, its because some people are just so connected into the mundane that they cant see how far human potential can go and I choose to not waste my time.<BR/>I totally support you going for the OBE site because the ability which intrigues me the most to master is out of body experiences and astral projection, so trust that I will totally read it if its available. however don't take out the interactive part of Psipog there are still a lot of beginners here (including me) who are dying to learn and talk to people who wont just stand there and listen to them without being taken seriously. <BR/>I think this has been a very successful site which has gained a lot of respect and I hope that you don't let it go because it no longer does anything for you. if you don't want to handle it anymore, maybe you could give it to someone else that you trust who is willing to take care of it.</p>

                                <p>I'm Alexandra from the forum(incase you were wondering..)<BR/>Psipog is my favorite site and forum. It's been that way for 2 years, or something around that.<BR/>I would be very dissapointed if it would be closed down :(<BR/>I've been a member for quite a long time and I don't want to see it getting closed down :(<BR/>I do wish you a lot of luck and I hope to see your new site soon. But please don't close down the forums and the site. Do you really want to destroy that, that you've worked so hard for?<BR/><BR/>When I draw something or create something, I never throw it away(unless it's a very crappy drawing from when I was 8....)<BR/>I always get very attached to everything I have. If I create something that I don't like anymore when I grow older, I don't destroy it, that would hurt me too much.<BR/><BR/>..... That was a very bad comparation.... ugh...<BR/>anyway: please don't close the site and the forum.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>I wish you good luck on your path. And may you grow into a very spiritual person<BR/><BR/>~Alexandra</p>

                                <p>¡Please don't! I understand your transformation... because it's the very same thing that happened to me. I wanted to believe there was something more than just flesh that would rot. But I didn't want to believe in a lie, I had to see proof. I can't use psi yet (newbie), but I saw telekinetic proof of what I wanted in an ouija session. Not that my life wasn't  spiritual before, but that discovery took away the fear: there is something more, the so-called soul, or spirit, or whatever. I still have a physical life, but fear has gone away.<BR/><BR/>I discovered your website and I love it. I just registered into the forums. Please don't kill Psipog! What about the newbies? What about all the kids that are scared of death and just want proof of something "more" to lead spiritually meaningful lives? I knew a guy who got into hard drugs only because he thought "it didn't matter". If he had seen psipog, he may have had another point of view. Not that he wouldn't have made the same choice, but it would have been more of a choice, having more knowledge about everything. (He's in rehab after giving his family hell for ten years).<BR/><BR/>I know what you feel: I've felt it, too. I was skeptic, because I'd rather cope with the mechanical world than base my reality in lies. But until I found proof, I was scared of everything. And maybe there are other many seventeen year-olds out there who would inmensely benefit from psipog. If you go on your way to spirituality, that's a great thing. But, why not keep psipog, and make an attached site? Maybe you can let another person have psipog. But please, please, please, in the name of the many teenagers and young adults who may have felt what I did, please don't shut psipog down. <BR/><BR/>And, whatever you choose, thanks for putting it up.</p>

                                <p>Here here, I totally understand and agree. I am a very religious person, God is pretty big in my life, but I also always new there was something more than the physical (or mechanical as you call it). Even in our church i can see the transformation that people are no longer afraid of the more supernatural parts of the world.<BR/><BR/>I confided in my pastor the other day that i was telekinetic, and instead of excomunicating me or trying to drive spirits out of me (as i thought he might) - he was actually rather excited. This is from a very right wing, conservative church pastor. <BR/><BR/>Anyway my point is... I understand your moving on, it is part of life, and in this case you are forwarding the cause of psionics. Believe it or not, but you, Sean, are the forerunner of psionics in the world... one of the first and foremost in the field of actually trying to prove psi - and now, as you said you have. Move on to greater things. The world needs people like you, who make things happen. Gallileo said the earth travelled around the sun, and the world almost crucified him for it, - and now we remember him for it.<BR/><BR/>May the world remember you Sean Connelly as a great propounder of spirituality, a fore-runner in the world of psionics and the godfather of change for the better in this messed up world of ours.<BR/><BR/>I solute you friend, and will be forever greatful for all you have done for me, both through the site and through archiving it.<BR/><BR/>Peace out brother.</p>

                                <p>Mmmm... Hi, I'm Natsufan again. I was reading into the forums and I have re-thought again. I was pretty selfish to ask you to keep psipog, and I'm sorry I even did. It's your choice, and if you have transcended psiwheels, and have chosen to go to higher goals, I have no right to ask you to keep with the maintenance costs of psipog. Only thing I would ask is to be able to copy all articles, handbook and all that and get security copies. I still haven't got the psiball correctly, and I haven't made an archive of the whole website.<BR/><BR/>Chris Pretorius is right... You may appear in History books in a few years. It would be so great if spirituality was taught at schools... And could be taught with proof of its existance. And that it was the same for every human being, regardless of organized religions... How many problems would disappear from this world... Sorry for having asked to keep psipog. I was just thinking of the time when I was scared and needed proof of "something". I wish Psipog had been there 10 years ago.<BR/><BR/>But, whatever you choose, it's your choice. Sorry for having tried to interfere, I suppose I was only letting my feelings loose. You've done enough already, and if you can reach higher, then it would be stupid to ask you to fly lower. Stupid and selfish.<BR/><BR/>Whatever you do I wish you good luck. I'll be following your investigations :)  <BR/><BR/>Thanks for everything.</p>

<!--

I remember writing this post.

Looking back, the thing I regret the most is that I didn't involve anyone before posting it.
I think of all the moderators, authors, and the visitors who really were a big part of this
community.  And I just came out of left field, and basically said: THIS is the new
interpretation, bye!

Man, I regret that.

If I could do it again, I wouldn't have done it this way.  Not that the post doesn't have
truth to it -- it certainly does, and it certainly represents some of all of our
frustrations at that moment in time.  But the fact that I just posted it, without a thought
of what OTHER people had invested in PsiPog... I regret that.

If I was a moderator at a website, and the guy in charge just threw everything out of the
door... I would be pissed.

I can respect the sort of courage it takes to do something like that -- but I also know that
I didn't write this post due to anything courageous.  I wasn't acting couragously; I was
being selfish.  Even if everything I said was true, I should have had more respect for the
other people heavily invested in PsiPog.  Maybe we could have talked about it before doing
something drastic like this.  Instead, I just made the decision in a bubble, with no input
from anyone else, and just blurted it out with no respect for anyone else.

I'm not saying that PsiPog didn't need to be archived.  It did.  I was done, and there
wasn't anyone around who I trusted, and who had the free time, and technical skill, to
maintain the website.  PsiPog *had* to be archived.  I just wish I had done it more
gracefully.  Man, there's so much I could have done better in that regard.

And part of that selfish attitude I had was due to the fact that I had tried involving other
people (in past ideas), and was mostly disappointed.  Some people would step up to the plate
and DO some tedious but needed work.  But many times, if something had to get done, I had to
do it.

Even still... there were plenty of people invested in PsiPog, and no amount of disappointment
from previous endevours gave me the right to ignore their investement.

Overall, it was a failure on my part.  Not the action of archiving PsiPog, but the manner in
which I came to the decision and announced it.
