                  <p>A few weeks ago I bought a copy of <i>Far Journeys</i>, by Robert Monroe.  I read the book a few years ago, but I thought I would re-read it and see if my new experiences would help me pick out new and useful information.  In it, Monroe talks about the research his institute has done, including Hemi-Sync and the Gateway Experience.<br /><br />It just so happens I have the Gateway Experience.  The Monroe Institute gave me a copy a few years ago (but a few years after I read the book).  Now that I'm re-reading the information, it's bringing up new ideas since I actually have gone part way through the Gateway Experience training.  It's interesting.<br /><br />Anyways - the point is that the Gateway Experience is basically 18 CDs with a bunch of hemi-sync meditation tracks that you listen to.  The audio tracks help alter your brainwaves, and also guide you through different levels of consciousness.<br /><br />Focus 10 is the state where your body is asleep, but your mind is awake.  I can go there easy peasy.<br /><br />Focus 12, however, is the state where your consciousness is perceived as expanding past your body.  It's hard to describe.  In my <a href="../../../show.php@id=10166.html">product review, on PsiPog.net</a>, I talk about how I couldn't really tell much difference between Focus 10 and Focus 12.<br /><br />Well, since I've restarted the training because of my new found interest, I've just discovered what I think is Focus 12.  This happened about 2 minutes ago (I woke up and immediately came to post this).  My consciousness was not perceived just inside my head... but it wasn't exactly an out of body experience either.  It was open.  It's something I haven't experienced before, which is very exciting!  I will have to play around more with this Focus 12 - now that I understand what it's suppose to feel like.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>"Easy Peasy." What are you smoking?!<BR/><BR/>Just kidding!<BR/><BR/>So, tell me... What is the advantage of using these Hemi-Sync CD'S? What advantages do you think it brings to "Psi" if any? <BR/><BR/>Also: After you reach focus 12, is it merely a "feeling" of your consciousness surpassing your body, or do you actually feel that you are more than just your body?<BR/><BR/>Yeah, you'll probably need some more time to answer these.</p>

                                <p>It brings well documented checkpoints in states of consciousness.  A helpful roadmap that multiple people can independantly check out, and springboard from them to other states.  Focus 10 nearly anyone who meditates knows about - it's your basic mind awake, body asleep.  Focus 12 (what I believe I experienced) is a different state that I've never experienced until now.  It isn't "far" from Focus 10, and is identifiable.<BR/><BR/>But yeah, to answer the rest: I don't know yet :-P.  We will see.</p>

                                <p>I found the CDs on a bittorrent somewhere, and I've finally gotten ahold of focus 12.  It's a lot like having a feeling that your consciousness is separate from your body, as if you're no longer bound by it.  I had to try this lesson a few times to finally reach it, but when I did. I could tell.  I visualized myself moving my consciousness out of my body upwards and I felt it and it completely shocked me and I woke up.  Then I tried it again and kept my cool, and the freedom you can have in this state is amazing.  It also helps you explore your subconscious - I use it when I need ideas for art projects for school. :) Great CDs, too bad they're like what, $500?</p>
