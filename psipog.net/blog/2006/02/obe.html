                  <p>Finally had an OBE... it's been a while since my last one (a little over a month!).<br /><br />This marks the 13th original location.  Here is a list of all the places I've had OBEs:<br /><br /> 1. Bed in NY home (both orientations)<br /> 2. Keith's house in NY<br /> 3. Scott's house in NY<br /> 4. Jason's house in NY<br /> 5. House in Buford, my room<br /> 6. Hotel room for Dianne's Publix thing<br /> 7. Apt 94<br /> 8. Dorm room in FL<br /> 9. Dianne's apt in SC<br />10. Grandma's FL room (twice)<br />11. House in Buford, the couch<br />12. Dorm room in MD<br />13. Second dorm room in MD<br /><br />I keep track of the locations I've OBEd because it provides very good evidence that OBEs are not the same as lucid dreams.  In a lucid dream (or any other dream), you almost always dream of yourself in a different location than your body.  In some of my dreams, I even dream of "waking up" - but I will be waking up in the wrong location.  Normal dreams and lucid dreams show a very consistent pattern of almost always happening in locations other than your body.  OBEs, on the other hand, have exclusively happened where my body is.  This shows that OBEs are different than LDs, and also supports the claim that your consciousness leaves your body (as opposed to it being a hallucination).<br /><br />While you don't even know the locations above, I thought it would be good to list them out anyways.  I keep the list updated on my computer, and can recall specific OBEs I've had in each of those locations over the years.  One that is really interesting is the hotel room I was staying in for one night.  The environment was completely new to me, and I didn't take any time to "get used" to it.  I stayed there one night, had the OBE in the morning, and checked out right afterwards.<br /><br />Anyways - what did I do this OBE?  Well, since my Grandmother just died (Jan 27th), I tried to call out for her.  Nothing happened.  Then, for some reason, I flashed to a scene with my younger cousin.  It was in black and white and she was waving at me through her sliding glass door.  Then quickly flashed back to my room.  This is bizarre because I rarely see other people while OBE, and also she lives in NY - I'm in MD.  I suspect I might have hallucinated it, but it's always hard to tell.<br /><br />I still had the same troubles moving around.  I tried some different approaches to give myself more freedom.  I didn't get aggrevated like I normally do, and just tried to experience it and go with the flow, while at the same time try and move around.  I don't know how it ended, but that was about the entire experience.  It probably lasted 10-15 minutes.<br /><br />One cool thing about this OBE was that, before I went to bed, I told myself, "You know, it would be really cool to have an OBE tonight.  I would really like that."  But then I didn't even try my normal methods.  I tried for about 5 minutes, got bored, and decided to just go to sleep.  It turns out I ended up having an OBE anyways - so that was cool.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>Thats really cool to have OBE's in that frequency, i should try your methods, i guess i can find them on psipog.<BR/>my OBE's wasn't always near my body, sometimes it started in other places, in most cases it was all of a sudden while lucid dreaming, like a flick and then i'm somewhere else, sometimes near my body and sometimes in other places.</p>

                                <p>Sorry about your grandmother :(<BR/>Now about your limited mobility. In Robert Monroe's book, Far Journeys he said that he noticed a second body laying next to his physical body and that it looked a lot more physical than his other one. He also said it was a lot harder to move in, so that might be your problem right there. Or it might be something entirely different. He also said that he could notice leaving it when he went OOB. so next time you try leaving see if you can feel leaving another body besides the physical.<BR/> <BR/> your fellow psion,<BR/> ratlord</p>
