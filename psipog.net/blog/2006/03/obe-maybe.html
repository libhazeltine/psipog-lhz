                  <p>I had something like an OBE just now.  Really though, I'm not sure what the hell it was <img 
src="../../s_smile.gif" width=12 height=12 />.  It felt like I left my body... but at the same time, 
what I actually experienced reminded me of dreaming.  I really don't think things are as simple and distinct as dreams 
and OBEs... I think there is a lot of overlap and blurred experiences.  OBEs exist... but so do experiences that are 
like 50% OBE and 50% dream... and like 72% OBEs and 28% dream... etc...  Things are weird, that's for sure.  If it was a 
dream, then I did a great job of staying lucid and aware during it.  I asked very conscious questions that were logical 
and well thought out (for some reason, a lot of times logic and reason get deactivated during dreams/OBEs).  Perhaps one day I will figure this out.<br /><br />EDIT: I was sitting here thinking more about it.  Some parts were definitly a dream... I remember one point when I was luigi playing dodgeball in my old highschool gym.  That strikes me as too strange to be an OBE (not like I would know, but I'm just going on basic ideas here).<br /><br />Also, I forgot to mention that the OBE/dream <i>did</i> start out in my room, in my bed.  This is the basic break down: Laying in bed, tranced out, started flapping and vibrating in the wind like a flag, snuck out the bottom of my body, stood up on my floor, couldn't see, but could walk around and feel stuff... after messing with this state back and forth, I eventually was able to see.  Once I could see, I don't remember where the switch was, but at one point I remember being in my house in NY and running and jumping in the air.  It was raining outside, and I was lucid.  Everything after that point was very dream like.<br /><br />Perhaps that switch was when I went from the OBE into a dream.  I don't remember the transition from inside of my room, to my lucid NY experience.  Oh yeah, now I do!  Once I began seeing, I went through a door in my room, and walked into the bathroom area.  However, the bathroom area was NOT the same layout as my bathroom in real life.  From there, I met some people in the bathroom area... then somewhere along there I transitioned into the NY experience.<br /><br />So it sounds like my transition happened when I walked through the door into the bathroom area.  HOWEVER - before that happened, when I still couldn't see correctly and was bumping into things in my room, I remember picking up my chair, and feeling the texture.  The texture was all wooden, yet my chair in real life has padding.  I noted this differece while OOB/dreaming (which shows how conscious I was during the experience, normally things like that wouldn't be noticed until after I completed the experience).<br /><br />Also, while in bed and slipping in and out of body, I was playing music in my head.  I could select a song, and hear the music.  At one point, I knew my alarm was going to wake me up, so I turned over and gave myself another hour (did I do that in real life? or was it a false-awakening?  I can't remember or tell - THIS IS WHY I NEED TO VIDEO TAPE MYSELF WHEN I HAVE OBES).  After reseting the alarm, I had to lay back down and take another minute or so to trance out to the level where the music was playing again.  Then I could leave my body.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and one more memory: while leaving my body at one point, I was getting frustrated.  Then I heard someone say something along the lines of, "This is something you need to experience." <img src="../../s_stare.gif" width="12" height="12" />.  Bizarre.<br /><br />I have no clue.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>Haven't read your blog in a while; Alot to cover and I don't really want to write very much about it. It's good to see you pulling through your perceived problems right now; I've run into a wall myself.<BR/><BR/>I had a semi-lucid weird experience lately while I was sleeping; It seems like I was dreaming, I could recognize it, and I was half awake... In my dream I was talking; While I was talking, though, instead of speaking out loud (this is in the non-dreamworld) I was convulsing. I could feel myself talking in my dream, but in reality my body was jerking around.<BR/><BR/>Good luck on your stuff man.</p>
