                  <p>Finally freaking got internet in my new room, hurray!!! <img src="../../s_happy.gif" width=12 height=12><br /><br />Had an OBE this morning, around 4:30am, in my new dorm room (that makes 12 places).<br /><br />I was pretty scared the entire time, but I tried hard to calm myself down and relax.  I had the realization that my inability to move around in all my previous OBEs had been from fear and deep rooted beliefs that I can't exist outside of my body.  I'm still figuring out exactly what the fears are, and working on dealing with them.  I do know that in this OBE, I felt the fear very strongly... and I couldn't move that much because of it.  However, since I knew that the fear was what kept me from moving, I did manage to calm down and give myself more freedom than I've had in a long time.<br /><br />My OBEs over the past few years have been very boring and my "other"-body was always almost glued to my physical body.  In most OBEs, I could get a limb free and move it around, or even float around a little bit uncontrollably in very close proximity to my body, but I very rarely got more than 10 feet away.<br /><br />In the OBE last night, I didn't manage to get more than 10 feet away, but I did feel the fear directly and could notice that it was the fear specifically that kept me close to my body (in past OBEs, it was a mystery what kept me close).  After I targetted the fear specifically, I gave myself a lot more freedom.<br /><br />I floated up and had pretty good control over my "other"-body.  My vision didn't flicker or distort badly, like it usually does.  I floated up to my ceiling, then came back down so I was standing on my physical body's shins.  (My physical body was laying in bed, face up, while my "other"-body was floating in the upright position).  I looked down at my "other"-body and for the first time, I actually saw my "other"-body as solid.<br /><br />In the past, I either couldn't see my "other"-body, or it was like glass that refracted the light behind it.  This time, my "other"-body looked very solid - it looked just like my physical body.  I was wearing white boxers.  When I saw the boxers, I looked back up and thought, "Hmm, this is the first time I've seen my other-body as solid... I guess I'm wearing the same thing I went to bed in, however, I went to bed in blue boxers, not white ones...".  I looked back down to see the boxers again, and they were blue.<br /><br />After that, I called out mentally for someone to take me somewhere exciting.  I called out for someone to help take me to a place where I could learn to control my OBEs better.  But no one showed up <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width=12 height=12>.  Then I started getting strange sensations - I couldn't tell where it was coming from, but I quickly figured out it was coming from my physical body.  So I got back in.  After I was fully in, and opened my physical eyes, I noticed that the strange messages were from my body actually falling completely asleep.  It was bizarre, and very hard to put into words.<br /><br />Either way, this was not one of my normal OBEs, and it definitly sticks out in my mind (as you can probably tell from this long post).  Most of my OBEs are somewhat boring and repetative... this one did not follow the normal mold, and it challenged me to face some of my fears and beliefs about what OBEs are.  It was really cool and interesting.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>I have an idea that you could try in your next obe. Try transforming your "other" body. for example change one of your "other" body's arms into a blade or materializing armor around your "other" body.</p>
