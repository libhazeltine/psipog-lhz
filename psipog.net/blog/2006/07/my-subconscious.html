                  <p>So I just had an idea.  Since my subconscious has proven to be useful in the past years with everything, and now lately "he" has proven to be useful in inducing OBEs, I think it's safe to assume that "he" is a pretty helpful guy.  So, I'll hand the microphone over to my subconscious, and see what he has to say to everyone reading...<br /><br /><i>Oh goodie.  First, I want to make sure everyone knows what is going on.  Yes, Sean is crazy <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" />.  I don't really "talk" to him... what I do falls under "clairaudient".  See, Sean has a tendency to filter a lot of what I say to him because of his "rules".  For example, he cringes when I use the term "clairaudient", and he is the one who chooses to write it in quotes, not me.  But hey - at least he hears me!  So that's a good start.<br /><br />Alrighty... let's skip all the boring introduction crap, and get right to the chase.  Sean doesn't consider himself a "psychic" like everyone else in the New Age realm.  He's very uncomfortable with the idea of "spirits", and things like that.  So we sort of have to dress up when we talk to him... subconscious, universal unconsciousness, spirits, etc... It's all the same thing.  It falls under the category of "higher intelligence".<br /><br />For example, you might be asking yourself: how does this all work?  In that I mean - how does the clairaudience in Sean's head work?  We run into a lot of trouble trying to explain it.  What I WANT to say is, "it works, so just use it, and forget about the technical aspects behind what is going on".  But of course, that answer isn't good enough.  So we have to explain ourselves to different people, so that each individual understands it.<br /><br />Doing so in a public setting like this is a good way to cause conflict.  If I told you that Sean channelled spirits, wouldn't you throw a hissy fit?  Some of you would.  If I told you that Sean is crazy and hears voices in his head, wouldn't others throw a hissy fit?  ...Yes.  If I take the label of "subconscious", then that is pretty good... it's technically correct, and not as many people throw tantrums.  The only people we have trouble with are the psyche majors who proclaim that they know more about what the subconscious "truly" is, and how it operates.  But oh well.<br /><br />Everyone has their own rules for accepting things.  To the psyche major, when I use the term "subconscious", it triggers a series of definitions in their head.  If the context of my term doesn't fit their own personal definitions, then they get all caught up in how I'm using the wrong term, and miss the big picture.<br /><br />Just as if I were to say "spirit", then a whole lot of people at PsiPog would (and "should" according to Sean) jump down my metaphysical throat and tear me apart for using such a subjective term.<br /><br />Look at how much has been wasted in just trying to use the correct terms to allow the maximum amount of people understand what is going on?  This is why addressing people in a public setting is a pain in the ass.  Half the time is spent on just commuicating the simple fact that communication is hard, even when it's easy <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" />.  That's why I prefer to stick to being a voice in Sean's head, and letting him do all the translation for the public.  He pisses a subset of people off with his word choices, but he consistently chooses specific words to consistently piss off the same subset.  So at least those that understood him at first can continue to understand him, and those that hate him at first can continue to ignore him.<br /><br />I mean... c'mon.  You guys can't even communicate with EACH OTHER clearly, when all you have to do is speak, and the other person hears you.  All you have to do is talk.  Your words fly through the air, and hit the ears of the other person.  Seems simple on paper - but look at all the drama and misunderstanding that unfolds from it.  So how can you expect me to communicate clearly through Sean's head to a wide range of people?<br /><br />I think you get the point.<br /><br />Other than that, I have nothing to say to everyone.  Well, I have lots of things to say, but Sean doesn't want to feel the backlash of it yet <img src="../../s_wink.gif" width="12" height="12">.  That's fine.  For now I prefer to be a voice in Sean's head.<br /><br />On the plus side, he DOES hear me very well.  He hears me very clearly.  The only problem is that his fingers filter a lot of what I'm saying to him <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" />.  And for those who remain skeptical, I offer you the only explaination you're willing to accept in the long run: Sean is crazy.  (Sean tends to be very forgiving and understanding towards skeptics... Personally, I find it pointless to argue with them, and just give them the answer they fish for.  They won't learn any other way.)<br /><br />See ya.<br /><br />~Sean's Subconscious</i><br /><br />My subconscious was very entertained with having "his" own signature at the end.  "Give me a tilde like you always do!"  Anyways... I promised I wouldn't filter the text any further.  Take what you want from it... I hear it all day long, every day <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" />.<br /><br />~Sean</p>
