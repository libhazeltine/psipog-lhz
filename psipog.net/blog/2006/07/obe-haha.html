                  <p>I had my OBE, as planned!  This is another new location, now making a total of 14 different locations I've had an OBE.<br /><br />This OBE wasn't very exciting, but the actual events surrounding the OBE were very bizarre.  A week ago, I was having a conversation with my subconscious.  I was talking about how I was kind of depressed that I haven't had an OBE in a long time, and that I really wanted to have one.  My subconscious made a deal with me - if I realized/learned something over the next week, then I would have an OBE on Wednesday morning.<br /><br />Of course I was somewhat skeptical - I haven't learned to have an OBE at will yet, so I can't just do it when I want (although I do have some control).  But the deal was made, so I went through the week.  On Sunday, I made the realization.  It had to deal with why I was upset with my mom, and is a little personal, so I'll leave it at that.  My subconscious congratulated me on my realization, and told me that "he" would fulfill his end of the bargain on Wednesday.<br /><br />Now, of course my obvious reaction is skepticism.  I'm hearing voices in my head - I'm probably crazy.  But, at the same time, I had already been amazed at my crazy voice's ability to help me have an OBE in <a href="../05/obe-hands.html">a previous event</a>.  The voice helped me in the past, so while I was very skeptical last night, I was also pretty excited because there was a chance it could happen.<br /><br />My subconscious said I had to put SOME effort into it, and not just pass out to Ren and Stimpy cartoons, like I normally do at night.  I agreed.  I tried to trance out, but didn't get very far, and passed out and started dreaming.  It was a really bizarre dream.  But during my dream, I woke up.<br /><br />It was night time, and everything was dark.  So I was freaking out a little bit, because it's just a little spooky when you're in a strange state of consciousness, and your room is dark and glowing.  But I knew I was in the right state to have an OBE.  I pulled my arms/hands into the air, and tried to look at them.  Normally when I look at my hands, they look like they're made of glass, and I can tell where they are.  This time I couldn't see anything... I just saw my ceiling fan (which was the direction my head was pointed in).<br /><br />I tried to get out of body, but it was really hard.  I slid to the left and right of my body, but kept getting sucked back in.  Eventually I broke free for a little bit, and managed to get over to my window.  My vision the entire time was really awkward, and it was really hard to tell what was going on.  When I got over to the window, there was a mirror (there isn't a mirror in real life over there).  I looked in the mirror, trying to see myself.  I couldn't see myself.  I could barely make out a faint outline of my head, but other than that, I didn't see anything.<br /><br />I got snapped back into my body.  I decided the reason I suck at moving was because my "astral" body was dirty, and needed to be cleaned up.  So I took my hands, and started scrubbing my body with them.  I started at my head, and moved down.  When I got to my upper-back, I got distracted from my goal of cleaning my body.  Now I was curious if I could feel anything attatched to my body, like the infamous silver cord.<br /><br />So I felt the rest of my body, looking to see if my body parts were there, and looking to see if I could feel anything foreign.  My ears were there, and really well defined.  My ... family jewels were there.  Phew!  <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" />.  When I reached around my abdomen region, I noticed that I had a belt around me.<br /><br />This belt reminded me of a thick seatbelt.  It went across my waist, and the angle of the belt made it seem like it was going around my entire bed.  I'm not sure if I hallucinated that or not - perhaps it was my mind's attempt to explain why I felt so stuck in my body.  After that, I grabbed my legs.  I decided to have some fun, so I twisted my legs in impossible positions, like silly putty.<br /><br />I twisted them in loops, and let go and they would spring back to normal shape.  I thought that was pretty cool, and it gave me an idea.  Since I could distort my body, maybe I could reach my hand up, and make it longer.  That way I could reach my ceiling fan, grab it, and pull myself up.<br /><br />Sounded like an OK idea... so I started to reach for my fan with my right hand.  I used my left hand to push my right hand closer to the fan.  My vision was really crappy at this point, so I couldn't tell if I was accomplishing anything.  During this time period, I "clicked", and suddenly saw/felt hands grabbing my wrists and legs, pulling me through the air.  I knew it must be the same guys from before, who grabbed those same locations to pull me out.<br /><br />But then I "clicked" back to my body, where I was trying to reach the fan.  I decided to wake up, since I had accomplished my goal, and was pretty amazed that my OBE happened on schedule.  During my wake up, I made a specific effort to stay conscious the entire time.<br /><br />Now, I agree that a lot of this stuff sounds crazy.  I also agree that things happen that don't make any sense - which definitly supports the idea of it being a hallucination.  But even then... I can go from an out of body state, and transition into my normal waking state, and be conscious during the entire transition.  In this OBE, I was staring at my ceiling fan.  I decided to "wake up", and my vision stayed locked on the ceiling fan.  My body started to wake up, and the only period of time where I wasn't looking at the ceiling fan was the 0.5 second it took for me to open my eyes once I became aware of looking through them.  My consious mind was ... CONSCIOUS.  The entire time.  I was in a very aware state of mind, where I was making logical and deliberate decisions, and stayed (mostly) calm.<br /><br />Like I said before - this OBE wasn't really important about what I experienced inside of it.  The important part was that my subconscious followed through with it's deal.  This is another little piece of the puzzle.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>cowboy: It sounds a little weird, but try to trance out or do some self-hypnosis methods to try and talk to that voice in your head. At first, like peebrain said; you'll probably think you're talking to yourself, going crazy, or it's just your imagination. However, it might be likely you're talking to your sub-c. It's not feelings, or stuff like that; it's silencing your concious mind to hear your sub-concious.. or thats what I use anyway. I talk to mine, he's quite stubborn -.-</p>
