                  <p>Being that I HAVEN'T had an OBE in over a month, which is very unlike me, and an anonymous poster asked for some help in the previous post... I decided to write this mini-tutorial on how to have an OBE.  This is just one example technique you could use.<br /><br />It's friday night, and you don't have to go to school/work tomorrow, hurray!  You normally go to bed at 2am and sleep in Saturday morning until noon... but since you want to have an OBE, you set your alarm for 8am.  You fall asleep at 2am, and the alarm wakes you at 8am.  You're in a pissy mood, but hey, it's ok - you're about to have an OBE, and it'll be sweet.  While groggy, you go to the bathroom, get a drink of water, and pick up your favorite article/book on OBEs.  After reading about OBEs for 10 minutes, you're ready to give it a shot.<br /><br />So you lay back down.  You're really tired still, but sort of inbetween, and your body is a little confused/pissed that it was forced to wake up early.  That's ok... now your body can go back to sleep.  You lay flat on your back, with your arms to your side, with your blankets loosly draped over you.  You're really comfortable, and ready to go.<br /><br />The first step is putting your body to sleep.  Since your body is already half way there, this is pretty easy.  You itch everything on your body that could possibly itch (so you don't have to worry as much about itching later), and then get into a position where you WILL NOT MOVE no matter what.  Close your eyes, and then keep thinking to your body "sleep".  You keep sending that "sleep" command to your body.<br /><br />After about 5 minutes, your body is knocked out pretty good, and your mind is almost drifting away.  You force your mind to stay aware.  Then you keep repeating the phrase in your mind, "I will now have an out of body experience", over and over again.  You repeat it for a few minutes, then catch yourself thinking some random thoughts.  You notice that you've drifted from your phrase, so you start over again, and keep repeating "I will now have an out of body experience" in your mind over and over.  You drift a few more times, but keep bringing it back to that phrase.<br /><br />You repeat the phrase in your mind for what seems like forever.  You drift out again, and then drift back in and notice you aren't repeating your phrase.  But then you notice something else... you can see.  At first it seemed normal, but now you realize that you SHOULDN'T be seeing since your eyes are closed... but you're seeing anyways.  Now what?  Now you are ready to leave your body, but first you gotta disconnect a little bit more.  Instead of repeating your phrase, you just think of nothing for about a minute.  It isn't that hard in this state of mind.  As you think about nothing, you start to hear a loud ringing in your ears.  If you focus directly on the ringing, it goes away... but if you continue to think about nothing, the ringing gets stronger.<br /><br />You continue to think of nothing, and the ringing keeps getting louder.  You stay calm, and now the ringing starts to get on your nerves.  As it gets louder, it starts to make you really uncomfortable, and it quickly escalates to an unbearable amount of noise.  You continue thinking of nothing.  Your entire consciousness starts to vibrate with this loud ringing sound... so now you not only hear this unbearable sound, but you also feel it.  You shake violently.<br /><br />You begin to fear for the safety of your body.  This can't be healthy... your entire body must be having a seizure in bed!  You start to question it... why did I listen to that crazy dude on the internet anyways?!  I'm going to have a heart attack!  Holy crap... this is fucked up!  OOOOOUUUUUUUCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!<br /><br />Click.  All of the sudden, no noise.  No vibration.  You see clearly.  You try to move, but you can't.  You focus all your energy on moving your arm... you try to look downwards to see it, but you can't move your neck.  You can barely move your arm... it's like moving it through syrup.  You slowly get your arm into view, and you notice that it's like glass.  You can see through it, but it also refracts the light a little bit too, so you can tell it's there.<br /><br />You spin your hand around and stare in awe at it.  This isn't some hollywood special effect in a movie... this is your hand, sitting right in front of you.  It feels normal, minus the fact it moves slowly.  But it ripples.  It's colorful, but clear at the same time.  After about 3 minutes of just staring at your arm, you get a little bored of it.<br /><br />You try to stand up, but you can't.  You're stuck.  Now what?  You relax a little bit, and try to be more playful.  You sink in a little, and get used to what you're feeling.  You relax, and become more passive.  Then, in a relaxed manor, picture rockets attatched to your back.  They ignite, and push you up.  You begin to float upwards towards the ceiling at a constant rate.<br /><br />You get the feel for how to move.  You will yourself to an upright position.  Then you hop out of the air, and land on your bedroom floor.  You walk towards your door, and then realize that you don't really need to go out your door... so instead you look up, and float upwards... You go straight for the ceiling.  As you pass through it, you see the layers, and feel the layers inside of you.  You feel the drywall, the paper, the paint... inside of yourself.  Crazy.  You float upwards more.<br /><br />Then everything goes black.  Now you're back in your body.  You can't move.  You try to move your arm, but it moves like it's in syrup.  You relax, and let go.  You become passive, and just let go.  Click.  You start to fall.  First you fall through your bed, and then through the floor... and you pick up speed.  You fall further and further, and all you can see is your ceiling getting smaller and smaller, with blackness around it.<br /><br />Click.  You're back in your body.  You try to move, but you're stuck.  This is annoying.  You decide to wake up.  You force yourself awake... You will your body to wake up.  You remain consicious during this entire process... you feel yourself becoming in sync with your body.  You keep telling your body to wake up.  Wake up.  Your vision goes black, but you remain conscious... and you realize you're looking at your eyelids.  You open your eyelids.<br /><br />Then you freak out.  You've just had an out of body experience!  Hurray!  You run to your computer to type the entire thing out, in as much detail as you can.  You swear you wouldn't forget it, but you can tell that some of the memories seem a little iffy.  So you write as much as you can.<br /><br />Then you e-mail peebrain@psipog.net, and freak out.  You tell him how crazy it was.  He gets your e-mail and laughs.<br /><br />Below is an e-mail I actually received today:<br /><br /><i>OMG, I just remembered that I had a OBE last night!!! OMG, It's coming bit by bit. FUCK, I can't believe I had one. I'm FUCKING excited man! It felt SOOO REAL. Man...</i><br /><br /><img src="../../s_wink.gif" width="12" height="12" /><br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>Me too! The only two almost-OBEs I've ever had were from this waking-up type of method, so I reckon I'll give it another go tonight. Or, y'know... tomorrow morning. =)<BR/><BR/>I tend to just flop back down and fall asleep again the second I wake up, though. I'm not a morning person, evidently. :P</p>
