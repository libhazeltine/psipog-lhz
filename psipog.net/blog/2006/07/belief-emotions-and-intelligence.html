                  <p>So I was thinking <img src="../../s_evil.gif" width="12" height="12" /> ...<br /><br />I've always had a conflict with my theories regarding psionics.  I flip flop between two ideas.  One idea is that belief plays a huge role, and you are only capable of doing what you believe you can do.  The other idea is that belief isn't that big of a deal, and that reality determines what you can and can't do.  This sort of goes back to my conflict between <a href="../05/objective-and-subjective-reality.html">subjective and objective reality</a>.<br /><br />I think I found a balance.  Emotional intensity.<br /><br />Humans are emotional creatures.  Our intelligence likes to be a little egotisitcal, and proclaim that its reason and logic is how we work... but when you take an honest look at people and how they make decisions, the majority of decision making is done based on how that person FEELS.  It's emotional.<br /><br />Advertisers and salesmen know this.  The number one rule in selling is that if your client feels they need something, they will find a logical way to achieve it - price isn't really an issue.  Intelligence is used as a servent of our emotions.  We first feel something, then we invoke our intelligence to help us understand what we feel, and possibly accomplish the goal our emotions have dictated.<br /><br />Emotional intensity plays a huge role in psionics.  If you feel that you must accomplish a psionic task no matter what, and put a lot of emotion behind it - you have a much higher chance of succeeding.  I think of emotion as the currency of existance.<br /><br />So where do beliefs fit into this?  Beliefs dictate emotions.  If I believe that when I experience a disagreement, I should feel angry... then I will.  Any time I experience something I label as a "disagreement", I will feel angry.<br /><br />What are my personal beliefs that dictate my own emotions?  I have one belief that affects this a lot - I believe that intense emotion is "bad", and that the best state to be in is calm and collected.<br /><br />This is great for receiving in psionics.  With a calm emotional ocean, I can detect the smallest ripples that collide with it.  However, this is really bad with psychokinesis... I need to muster up waves of emotional intensity, but I believe that emotional intensity is "bad".  So, that belief overrides my emotions, and I can't muster the power needed to affect matter.<br /><br />This is all really obvious now that I type it out.  Everything I've stated almost makes me say, "well DUH!" <img src="../../s_blah.gif" width="12" height="12" />.  But I believe this is the answer to the question I posed to myself in <a href="../01/skepticism-long-post.html">this post</a> in January.  The question was: why do I emotionally disbelieve in psychokinesis?  The answer is: because I believe that emotional intensity is bad, out of my desire to be calm and collected.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                                <p>What we are left with, out of all the possible debates and discussions I could have typed here, is an insufficient understanding of how any of the metaphysical arts may be achieved.<BR/><BR/>My theory is this; the sum output of your actions is like a campfire surrounded by nice little stones to keep it under control, in a forest of flameable material. You could slap a big dry log on the fire in an effort to do something, however, first you would need to find a dry log, and second, you would have to transport it. Additionally, the fire would likely get out of control and start a forest fire, which is dangerous for your health (...remember all of Rainsong's warnings? The poor Russian woman?).<BR/><BR/>To get this metaphorical fire large enough for something, like say psychokinesis, you not only need to increase the size of the container, but also furnish more fuel into the fire to make it larger, while maintaining control. Here, it also helps to know how to build a fire, i.e. some nice applied esoteric metaphysics such as that I'm interested in. <BR/><BR/>At that point, theoretically, you should be able to effect things to the extent of the fire that you contain; from psychokinesis to large telepathic effects to controlling the weather. At that point, its "simply" spreading around the fire you have to the target objects in question, and controlling  the end result, though all of these are different elements of action that I won't discuss at the moment. <BR/><BR/>Salve (Go well, be healthy, et cetera)<BR/><BR/>Ancheron<BR/><BR/>(P.S. it is difficult to discuss things like this here in the  way my sub. c wants me to do it. I'll probably contact you in another way.)</p>
