                  <p>A few weeks ago I bought a copy of <i>Far Journeys</i>, by Robert Monroe.  I read the book a few years ago, but I thought I would re-read it and see if my new experiences would help me pick out new and useful information.  In it, Monroe talks about the research his institute has done, including Hemi-Sync and the Gateway Experience.<br /><br />It just so happens I have the Gateway Experience.  The Monroe Institute gave me a copy a few years ago (but a few years after I read the book).  Now that I'm re-reading the information, it's bringing up new ideas since I actually have gone part way through the Gateway Experience training.  It's interesting.<br /><br />Anyways - the point is that the Gateway Experience is basically 18 CDs with a bunch of hemi-sync meditation tracks that you listen to.  The audio tracks help alter your brainwaves, and also guide you through different levels of consciousness.<br /><br />Focus 10 is the state where your body is asleep, but your mind is awake.  I can go there easy peasy.<br /><br />Focus 12, however, is the state where your consciousness is perceived as expanding past your body.  It's hard to describe.  In my <a href="../show.php@id=10166.html">product review, on PsiPog.net</a>, I talk about how I couldn't really tell much difference between Focus 10 and Focus 12.<br /><br />Well, since I've restarted the training because of my new found interest, I've just discovered what I think is Focus 12.  This happened about 2 minutes ago (I woke up and immediately came to post this).  My consciousness was not perceived just inside my head... but it wasn't exactly an out of body experience either.  It was open.  It's something I haven't experienced before, which is very exciting!  I will have to play around more with this Focus 12 - now that I understand what it's suppose to feel like.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

               <div class="blogPostBody">
                  <p>Alright.  This is a little complicated - so if you're interested, try and follow along with these thoughts... sorry if they come out jumbled <img src="s_blah.gif" width=12 height=12 />.<br /><br />I had a possible OBE last night.  The tricky part is that during the possible-OBE, I identified it as an OBE, and it was not in the same location as my physical body.  I'm sleeping in my Maryland dorm room... and the possible-OBE was experienced in my parents' old room in upstate New York.<br /><br />Now, there are two categories of different possible explainations for this:<br /><br />1. It wasn't an OBE. ("Then what was it?", "Then why did you identify it as an OBE during the experience?", "What does that say about previous OBEs that you identified as OBEs?", "Does a real OBE even exist?").<br /><br />2. It was an OBE. ("Then why wasn't it in the same location as your body like your previous 70+ OBEs?").<br /><br />So, let's assume that it wasn't an OBE, and I simply mis-identified it during the experience (very possible).  If it wasn't an OBE, then it's most likely a dream.  It could have been mistakenly identified because of my desire to leave my body, and my intention before I went to bed to have an OBE.  This intention could have manifested in the dream, and produced a false OBE based on what I expected to experience (the mind does this for lots of things... for example, if you are thinking about skiing right before bed time, you might have a dream about skiing... I just happen to be thinking about OBEs right before bed time, so my dream was reflecting that).<br /><br />Now the important question: how do I determine whether or not my past OBEs were dreams based on wish fulfillment?  I.e., if it's possible for me to fool myself into incorrectly identifying an OBE, then how do I determine what are <i>real</I> OBEs, and which are false ones?  Do real OBEs even exist?  Perhaps I am just misidentifying every single OBE! (wrong: because this wouldn't explain some expereinces I've had in the past).<br /><br />The point still exists though: how do I determine if I've had an OBE?  If I am capable of fooling myself, then what methods can I use to prevent that from happening?<br /><br />Ok - now let's backtrack to the other possibility: I had an OBE.  Why wasn't it in the same location as my body, like all my other OBEs?  Well, there could be a million explainations for that.  Perhaps I was unconscious when I left my body, and unconsciously travelled to my parents' old bedroom... then "woke up" consciously in that location, confused.  Perhaps I left my body, but since visual perception in the OBE state is very shakey, my mind incorrectly interpretted my surroundings as my parents' old bedroom.  Perhaps a million other explainations.<br /><br />I have experienced something that contradicts my 70+ past OBE experiences.  Both categories of explaination produce very strong questions.<br /><br />What do I personally <i>feel</i> happened?  If I probe my intuition, it feels like... it wasn't an OBE.  It feels like I incorrectly identified it as an OBE during the experience, and that it was really a dream based on my desire to have an OBE.  If this is true, then the question becomes: have I done this in the past?  I think the answer is yes.  Although, I don't think I've done it a lot.  Perhaps 5-10 times.<br /><br />For those hardcore skeptics: no, this isn't evidence that OBEs don't exist.  It's evidence that the mind is insanely more complicated than the normal OBE-theory can accommodate.  Things are not clear cut.  It's not as simple as just popping outside of your body and floating around "like a ghost".  There are serious problems in perceiving the external world, and determining what exactly you are experiencing.  But, at the same time, it is something more than dreaming.  You <i>can</i> perceive your immediate external environment and get real results.  But it's not easy, nor does it happen a lot.<br /><br />But it is possible.  And it does happen.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>Had a dream I was laying in bed trancing out.  I was receiving precog information and relaying it to my sister.  It was very bizarre.  One precog was about the death of a dad from a kid I know from highschool.  Figured I should post this, just in case some of it comes true. <!-- Nick Penepent father John Hayes Something... fuck, I can't remember now.  There was two more names. --><br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>So for the hell of it, I decided to make a psi ball the other day.  I honestly can't remember the last time I made an old school construct... definitly months, possibly years.<br /><br />It was cool.  I just got the psi flowing to my hands, played with it, and then focused it into a ball, the size of a golf ball.  I was curious if I would get visibility, specifically if I could make it emit light.  After the first minute I got the white-strand-visibility, and then when I focused it into a ball, I got light distortion, but I never did end up getting light emission.<br /><br />Amazing shit.  I don't know if I'll ever be bored with this stuff.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>I've grown so accustomed to empathy that a lot of times I don't label what I do as "psychic".  It's so normal and fluent.  When I look at people, I can watch their emotions evolve as the conversation moves forward, and a lot of times can trace the emotion to a specific belief or idea, and even thoughts sometimes.  It's fun.  For example, today I correctly predicted a woman's emotional evolution towards trying to get me on a date.  She hasn't asked me yet, though I predict it will materialize either tomorrow or the day after.<br /><br />I remember when I was younger and didn't have empathy, and I would have died to know if a girl "liked" me or not.  I remember being in high school, and talking to my buddies about how confusing women were, and how I didn't know how to act around them.  Now it's so clear it's funny... I understand all the "strange" behavior behind women, and why they do the things they do.  It's not that I laugh AT women... it's that I laugh at the entire situation, of how men are mostly clueless, and women have these complicated ways of testing men, etc.  It's funny how I used to be completely clueless, and that progressed to being overly sensative to emotions, to now where I can have the emotions flow through me and maintain my own sense of identity.<br /><br />For those empaths that are having trouble, then I hope my message gives you strength: there is light at the end of the tunnel, and things will get better.  There will be a time in the future when you can experience the freedom of feeling another's emotions, while at the same time not struggling with your own.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>Finally had an OBE... it's been a while since my last one (a little over a month!).<br /><br />This marks the 13th original location.  Here is a list of all the places I've had OBEs:<br /><br /> 1. Bed in NY home (both orientations)<br /> 2. Keith's house in NY<br /> 3. Scott's house in NY<br /> 4. Jason's house in NY<br /> 5. House in Buford, my room<br /> 6. Hotel room for Dianne's Publix thing<br /> 7. Apt 94<br /> 8. Dorm room in FL<br /> 9. Dianne's apt in SC<br />10. Grandma's FL room (twice)<br />11. House in Buford, the couch<br />12. Dorm room in MD<br />13. Second dorm room in MD<br /><br />I keep track of the locations I've OBEd because it provides very good evidence that OBEs are not the same as lucid dreams.  In a lucid dream (or any other dream), you almost always dream of yourself in a different location than your body.  In some of my dreams, I even dream of "waking up" - but I will be waking up in the wrong location.  Normal dreams and lucid dreams show a very consistent pattern of almost always happening in locations other than your body.  OBEs, on the other hand, have exclusively happened where my body is.  This shows that OBEs are different than LDs, and also supports the claim that your consciousness leaves your body (as opposed to it being a hallucination).<br /><br />While you don't even know the locations above, I thought it would be good to list them out anyways.  I keep the list updated on my computer, and can recall specific OBEs I've had in each of those locations over the years.  One that is really interesting is the hotel room I was staying in for one night.  The environment was completely new to me, and I didn't take any time to "get used" to it.  I stayed there one night, had the OBE in the morning, and checked out right afterwards.<br /><br />Anyways - what did I do this OBE?  Well, since my Grandmother just died (Jan 27th), I tried to call out for her.  Nothing happened.  Then, for some reason, I flashed to a scene with my younger cousin.  It was in black and white and she was waving at me through her sliding glass door.  Then quickly flashed back to my room.  This is bizarre because I rarely see other people while OBE, and also she lives in NY - I'm in MD.  I suspect I might have hallucinated it, but it's always hard to tell.<br /><br />I still had the same troubles moving around.  I tried some different approaches to give myself more freedom.  I didn't get aggrevated like I normally do, and just tried to experience it and go with the flow, while at the same time try and move around.  I don't know how it ended, but that was about the entire experience.  It probably lasted 10-15 minutes.<br /><br />One cool thing about this OBE was that, before I went to bed, I told myself, "You know, it would be really cool to have an OBE tonight.  I would really like that."  But then I didn't even try my normal methods.  I tried for about 5 minutes, got bored, and decided to just go to sleep.  It turns out I ended up having an OBE anyways - so that was cool.<br /><br />~Sean</p>
