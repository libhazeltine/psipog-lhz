                  <p>Howdy howdy,<br />I had a cool sequence of dreams last night.  I'm working on a new affirmation, which goes like this: "I will quickly, easily, and peacefully be able to noticably move large and small objects by just willing them to move".  In my dream, I even remembered my affirmation, and was moving objects.  It was cool.  At first I was trying really hard and focusing intently, but then I thought of my affirmation and relaxed.  Objects then moved easily.  Of course, this was in my dream, so whippdie freaking do <IMG SRC="http://psipog.net/blog/s_blah.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=12 />.  Oh well, it was still cool.  Plus I woke up at exactly 1:11pm.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>I was sitting in my room, and thought to myself "I wonder if my friend will knock on my door, and if so... when?".  I received an answer that he would be knocking in around 20 minutes, which turned out to be correct.  This wasn't predicted by any normal means (i.e., I didn't ask him to come over, or set a specific time when he should come over), it was a completely random occurance.  I thought it was cool.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>Had another dream with some flying in it.  Flew on top of some small buildings.<br /><br />Also, last night I took a test.  I got a 94% on it, with an average class grade of 78%, so I did good.  I also used some direct communicating with my subconscious on a hand full of questions... one in particular I had my subconscious overlay a yellow highlighting mark on my sight over the correct answer.  So from my vision, the correct answer was highlighted.  This is a cool thing to try during tests where you aren't sure of the answer, and check later to see if you were right.<br /><br />Brings up an interesting question: do you consider that "cheating"?  I got the answer from myself... just in an unconventional way.  Do you consider using telepathy to get the answer off of someone else "cheating"?  RV'ing the test paper next to you?  Precog'ing the questions/answers before the test?<br /><br />Me personally?  I don't know one way or another.  But I got a 94%, so I'm not too worried <IMG SRC="http://psipog.net/blog/s_cool.gif" width=12 height=12 />.<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>I was getting my hair cut today, and the barber was talking to an old man across the room.  I was reading her and the old man during their conversation, out of boredom I guess... I saw her thought pattern, and could pick up the techniques she used to manipulate the old man.  I thought it was interesting, but then I thought if there was a way I could confirm the information some other way...<br /><br />Eventually I concluded there wasn't any way I could confirm what I read.  This made me question: how can I be sure I'm reading things correctly?  Or that I'm reading at all?  And on the other side of the argument, how can you be sure you AREN'T reading someone?  I believe empathy is very natural for human beings to do, and I believe that we do it more often than we think - so often that we take it for granted.<br /><br />The skeptical side of me says "If you can't confirm when it's happening, then how do you know it's happening at all?" - this argument makes sense.  But an important realization is that the opposite argument makes just as much sense... "If you can't confirm when it's happening, then how do you know it when it ISN'T happening?".  For some reason, skeptics say we must "default" to the former argument.  I believe there is no "default", and honestly, that the latter argument is a better question.<br /><br />One phenomenon I've witnessed recently is interesting... (it's rated PG-13).  A new girl that came to our tech school is a whore/slut.  Now, immediately when she arrived, and the first time I saw her, I could tell... and so could everyone else.  But how?  Body language?  Is it related to empathy at all, or is something else going on?  Probably something else, but I still can't figure out how everyone got the same vibe from her instantly.  You can just TELL... but HOW? <IMG SRC="http://psipog.net/blog/s_blah.gif" width=12 height=12 />.  (Little things like this bug me a lot... I suppose others just gloss over it and accept she is a whore/slut right away... I don't care about that, I care about how I came to that conclusion so quickly.)<br /><br />~Sean</p>

                  <p>This being my first real post, I figured I would start off strong.  Today is November 21st, 2005, and a week ago on the morning of November 13th, I had a crazy Out of Body Experience (OBE).  This is a long story, sorry <img src="s_blah.gif" width=12 height=12 />.<br /><br />I had jacked up my sleeping pattern by taking a nap close to bed time, which caused me to be slightly restless when I laid down for bed later that night.  (As a side note, this is a great technique to induce OBEs... it's worked for me on multiple occasions).  When I finally got to sleep, I drifted through different states of consciousness.  Eventually, I honed in on the OBE mind-set, and knew right away when I hit it that I could "leave".<br /><br />I have a lot of trouble moving around and seeing things correctly during OBEs.  I rarely get more than a few feet from my bed, and this time was no exception.  I'm also obsessed with proving to myself that OBEs are <B>real</B> (to some extent) and not some lucid-dream type of fluke.<br /><br />While floating around my bed, I had a hard time seeing.  I used my sense of touch to guide myself over to the side of the bed, and my vision got a little more straight.  I was looking under the bed at that point, and I noticed a black plastic washer, about the size of a quarter.  Trying to get some proof, I plucked some white plastic washers from underneath my bed, and laid them out in a specific pattern on the floor, along with the black washer.  I reasoned that when I returned to my body, I could get up and check to see if the washers were in that design, and could confirm that the OBE was real.<br /><br />I willed myself back to my body, with the strong intention of getting up and checking right away.  As soon as I was back in my body, I realized how foolish it was - there aren't any plastic washers under my bed <img src="s_blah.gif" width=12 height=12 />.  There isn't <I>anything</I> under my bed.  I laughed at myself, thought of how retarded I was, then went to bed without checking.<br /><br />The next morning, I was getting dressed and thought to myself, "You know, it can't hurt to just <I>check</I>, so I might as well take a look".  I bent down on the foot side of the bed, and looked... and nothing.  Just as I predicted earlier, there wasn't anything under my bed.  I shrugged it off, re-enforcing the thought of how retarded I am to be fooled by the OBE, and went about my day.<br /><br />The following day I was walking around my room, and noticed the structure of the side of the bed.  I noticed that the feelings I got while searching around blindly while out of body was from the <I>other</I> side of the bed (the head side, not the foot side).  Feeling slightly perplexed, I got down and looked under the head side of the bed...<br /><br />No, I didn't find plastic washers in a strange pattern... what I did find was a black plastic guitar pick.  Needless to say, this blew my mind <img src="s_blah.gif" width=12 height=12 />.  It's easy to imagine how slightly distored vision could confuse the black plastic guitar pick for a black plastic washer.  I have no idea where the white ones came from in my OBE (I suspect they were created by my mind).<br /><br />Perhaps others don't find this amazing, but I personally do.  This happened to me, and it has proven to me that OBEs are something more than just hallucination or an altered type of dreaming.  There is <I>something</I> going on.<br /><br />~Sean</p>
