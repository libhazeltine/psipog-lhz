         <h1 class="pageTitle">Phasing; an Update (23 August, 2002)</h1>

         <p><em>by Rainsong</em></p>

         <p>For any of you stupid or masochistic enough to want to try phasing, yourself, this update might be useful to you. I still have not attempted to re-create the effect deliberately. However, unlike previous accidental times, during the most recent, I was sufficiently functional to be relatively aware of what
         my body and mind were doing. There was no witness to this event, except for my spike of distress being noticed by another 'path, in the form of a sudden headache.</p>

         <p>When this incident occurred, my shields were in rather bad repair, and my field as a whole was pretty badly shredded. Usually, my Shields seem to have been successful in preventing this.</p>

         <p>That said, several folks were chatting idly in the PsiPog chatroom about such exotic topics as shadowing, teleportation, and phasing. Tired and allowing my mind to wander, I was foolish enough to allow myself to picture phasing through a certain wall while joking around with some friends. It may be
         significant that in the idle, and ill-advised, daydream, I went through the wall backwards, as though "melding into the woodwork". The scenario repeated itself three times before I caught myself and stopped it. Each scene lasted no more than a second or two, but completely engulfed my awareness. After sternly
         returning to reality, I leaned back in my chair - bad move - and phased into the wood. Fortunately, it was only a partial phase, and I was able to extricate myself by merely leaning forward again.</p>

         <p>Predictably, the experience was sharply painful, during the phase and for some time afterwards. You have been warned. It did answer the question of what happens if the heart and lungs phase through something, though. In that one incident at least, only a small part of them went into the wood and contact
         was very brief, and function was not noticeably impaired. The effect of longer juxtaposition is still unknown.</p>

         <p>So, if you're one of those morons who wants to try it anyway? Fine; fill your boots. Develop a vivid visualization of an incident, in first person, and repeat it several times while in trance, while also fluffing out your field as thin and wispy as possible. IF applying my observations to a deliberate
         attempt is a valid method (and it may not be. It hurts like you wouldn't believe, and I'm not stupid enough to play with it), then this might get you skimming through your walls and upholstery. Why you would want to is another question entirely. But that is your problem.</p>

         <p>For those who haven't figured it out yet, this is not fun. Phasing hurts like H*ll. It is dangerous. It can kill you. You wanted an update, and by misadventure, I was able to give you one, but I most emphatically do NOT recommend that you try this.</p>

         <p>Short version: Phasing = bad, hurt, not fun.</p>
