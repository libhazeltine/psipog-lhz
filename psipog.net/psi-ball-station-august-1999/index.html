<P>Welcome to the Psi Ball Station. Psi is pronounced "sigh" so the
title does actually flow. Im so clever <IMG SRC="smile.gif">.
If at any time you have questions or just want to share some
experiences, by all means, e-mail me:<CENTER><H3><A

Alright, so now you're wondering what the heck this site is
about... well:</P>
<A NAME="what"><H2>What is Psi?</H2></A>
Psi is a greek letter (the symbols in the title at the top). It
means "psyche." That means like psychic stuff. So, is this a page
on all psychic stuff? Oh God NO! That would be nearly impossible.
Instead, this just covers one topic really really good. That topic
is Psi Balls. No, its not some new sex toy, its a way for new psychics
to learn how to control energy.  We'll get to that in the <A
HREF="training.html">training</A> section.
<A NAME="who"><H2>Who are you?</H2></A>
Who me? I'm a 16 year old psychic. Im not a witch or anything. I just
stumbled upon this psychic stuff in Feburary of 1999 and havent
stopped since. I know some people out there are thinking right now:
"Man, this guy is NUTS!" - and, well, I suppose you have the right too.
If I would have read this page a year ago, I would have thought the
same. But, luckly, my life has changed. No, Im not a religious nut
either... actually, I was an athiest before I became pagan. And all
you people out there who think Im stupid for believing in this stuff,
and you think that Im not being logical, I say this... I'm the most
logical person I know. I hate english - especially writting poems
<IMG SRC="ugh.gif"> - and I LOVE math and science. Math is just makes
SOOO much sense to me. No "Maybe" answers - I hate those... I like
facts, hardcore data. None of that "I feel..." crap. It's "I know..."
Sorry for all those psychics out there I offended. Im not a bad guy-
really <IMG SRC="smile.gif">!
<A NAME="why"><H2>Why do this?</H2></A>
Hmmm. I ask tough questions <IMG SRC="smile.gif">. I like to teach.
Maybe I'll become a math professor when I grow up... anyways- Im not
finding much information out there on this subject so I figured-
What the heck, lets make a page! I already have a programming page and
I had another psychic one but I got rid of it. Its fun making pages...
If you like surfing the web, you'll love making your own site. If you
ever need help, just e-mail me. Wait... Im getting off track... I like
to teach and inform people on things - thats why I do what I do.
<P>
Alright, enough of this. You should start learning to create and
control Psi Balls. First, you should learn what they are before you
start making them so... click on the training section on the left.
