There could be a million different reasons why its not "working."
Most likely, it IS working and the Psi Ball just isn't strong
enough to feel yet. Other reasons is that you don't have enough
practice. Don't read the How-To and automatically think it will
work the first time. Practice for one or two days - if you don't
feel anything after that, you might not be doing it right. Read
the step-by-step part carefully and do exactly what it says.
Maybe its not working because your visualizations arn't solid
enough, maybe because you arn't trying hard enough, maybe because
you have other stress in your life that is distracting you or
maybe because you arn't waiting long enough. Sometimes I work
on ONE Psi Ball for 45 minutes. Try it. Just dont give up!

<H2>Why can't I feel it?</H2></A>
Because it's not strong enough. Keep practicing and keep
compacting the ball and make it denser and denser. Try not to
break your concentration. Don't be distracted by things around
you. Close your eyes if its to distracting with your eyes open.
Play some soft music to realx you, or don't play any music at
all if that will break your concentration. Practice and it will
come. Also, you might be feeling it, your just ignoring it
thinking "Naa, that wasn't it." Trust yourself! Trust
your feelings!

<A NAME="q003">
<H2>Why can't I see it?</H2></A>
Oh, probably because its REALLY hard to make a visible one. If
you are a beginner, don't wait around for it to be visible.  The
ones I make that I can see are made like any other one and happen
when I least expect it. Sometimes when you have more emotion
behind it, it will be stronger and visible. But don't think it is
going to look like a big plastic ball in your hand. It can take on
a lot of different forms:<UL>
<LI>Sparks*
<LI>Wavy, colored, worm-like lines*
<LI>Fog (like when you look at a popcicle and you see the fog coming
off of it)*
<LI>Wavyness in the background (like when you look over a hot
stove, you see the background gets all wavy)
<LI>Ball of light
</UL>
The ones with the stars are the types Ive made. Im sure there are
more. Why can't you see yours? Because you dont have enough
practice!

<H2>What are Psi Balls for?</H2></A>
For beginners, not really anything except learning how to control
energy. They are fun to play with, I throw mine around the room
and catch them!

<A NAME="q005">
<H2>What are the sensations I should feel?</H2></A>
You <I>should</I> feel? Nothing is written in stone. You CAN
feel a lot of different sensations. You don't nessicarily HAVE
to feel them. Heres some I've read/felt:<UL>
<LI>Cold breeze*
<LI>Soft Warmness*
<LI>Pulling/pushing on your fingers*
<LI>Pulling/pushing your whole hands
<LI>Extreme heat (so much, you must stop)
<LI>Extreme cold (so much, you must stop)
<LI>Just a presence (hard to describe)*
</UL>Again, the ones with the stars next to them are the ones
I've personally felt. If you've felt something a little different
than the ones here, please tell me.
<H3>What do you mean "Just a presence"?</H3>
Oh, its like, umm... ya know when sometimes you just feel that
someone is staring at you? Kinda like that but a little different.
You just know for some strange reason. Intuition, your gut feeling.
