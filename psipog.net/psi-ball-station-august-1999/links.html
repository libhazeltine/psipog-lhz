<H3>Psychic Sites:</H3>
Educational pages for people who like learning.<BR><BR>
<B><A HREF="http://www.tadma.net/psychic/">Active Psy</A></B> -
Only the greatest psychic site in the world!  This site taught me,
not only about Psi balls, but a ton of other things. Its awesome.
Go there - NOW!<BR><BR>
<B><A HREF="http://www.tanega.com/astral/astral.html">Astral Projection
Home Page</A></B> - Covers the topic of Astral Projection (Out of body
experiences) great!<BR><BR>
<B><A HREF="http://www.winternet.com/~rsp/obebook.html">Out of Body
Experiences</A></B> - Great book!!! This book is not only online (so
its free) but it's totally new information on OBEs. This book got me
into leaving my body - which is a wild experience.<BR><BR>
<B><A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/9598/">Istion
Ascension and Clearing Page</A></B> - Whatever that title means... ???
It's got a great links section - I havent really looked at the page
itself.<BR><BR>
<B><A HREF="http://www.spiritweb.com">SpiritWeb</A></B> - Huge site,
it's pretty good too. I would suggest going here to anyone.<BR><BR>
<B><A HREF="http://www.crystalinks.com/">Crystalinks Metaphysical and
Science Page</A></B> - If your looking for a topic, its probably got
a couple pages on it - check it out.
<H3>Skeptical Sites:</H3>
Yes, you have to have these sites. Where would the world be without
skeptics? They keep people from being idiots (but they are human so
they do make mistakes too)<BR><BR>
<B><A HREF="http://www.randi.org">James Randi Educational Foundation
</A></B> - James Randi's page. He's a really smart guy so just because
he doesn't believe in this stuff doesn't mean something is wrong with
him. I will admit, he comes off as extremely cockey though <IMG
SRC="smile.gif"> but that just shows you how confident he is.<BR><BR>
<B><A HREF="http://www.skeptic.com/">The Skeptics Society</A></B> -
Another popular site, I havent had time to check it out but its pretty
big thats for sure.
<H3>Other:</H3>
Whatever else I think is cool.<BR><BR>

best band in the world <IMG SRC="smile.gif">!<BR><BR>
