First thigs first, I'll assume that you will be making Psi Balls
with your hands... here are the few different positions I use:<BR><BR>

<TR><TD><IMG SRC="hands.gif"></TD></TABLE></CENTER><BR>
Number 1 is like your packing a snowball nice and tight. I use
that the most. Thats the position I used in my journal entry in
<A HREF="facts.html">"Is this for real."</A> It's kinda hard to
see in that photo, its like from a birds eye view, your hands make
an X. The other two are pretty straight forward.  Number 2 I put
in front of my belly button and the third one I use when Im in
school.  If you rest your elbows on the desk and put your thumbs
in your eyes (not IN them <IMG SRC="smile.gif">) and look down,
it looks like your concentrating on your work.</P>
<P>So, which one is right for you? I don't know - what's more
confortable? Choose one there or make up one - it doesn't matter.
Or you can just make the Psi Ball on your "third eye." If you 
don't know where your third eye is, heres a Homer Simpson, helping
you out:<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="homer.gif"></CENTER><BR>
There! Thanks Homer. That blue dot is where Homer's third eye is.
Its like 45 degree angle from your eyes to your forehead, like where
the lines would intersect. Ya know those girls in India and how they
wear those dots on their heads? Thats where their third eye is. You
understand.</P><P>
Here I am, I just keep blabering on and on and you don't even know
HOW to make one. Alright, heres a step-by-step procedure you can
use to make them:<BR><BR>
1. Decide where you want to make it and get in the right position.<BR>
2. Relax and Breath!<BR>
3. Close your eyes IF you think you should (do what is confortable).
<H4>From now on I'll assume your using your hands, you can easily adapt
it to where ever your making one.</H4>
4. Visualize energy coming from your energy source (I use the Earth)
and into your body. Let the energy FLOW - don't force it, direct it.<BR>
5. Visualize your body starting to glow because of the energy filling
you up (see figure to help).<IMG SRC="glow.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<BR><BR>Notes:<UL>
<LI>The picture is just an example of what you COULD be visualizing.
It doesnt have to be like this at all, just as long as the idea of
your body filling with energy is in your visualization.
<LI>The energy doesn't have to be red, actually, I visualize white
but I couldnt do white on white.
<LI>The energy doesn't have to be pulsating either, I just did that
because its cool to look at <IMG SRC="ugh.gif">.
<LI>Make sure you don't FORCE the energy, I still have a lot of
trouble with this. You just have to let it fllloooooooooowwwwww
<IMG SRC="smile.gif">.
</UL>
6. Direct the energy inside of you (through visualization) down
your arms and into your hands.<BR>
7. Visualize the energy twisting/swirling and balling up into
a sphere.<BR>
8. While directing the energy into your hands, make sure you're
still absorbing energy from your source so you have a constant
flow from source to body to hands.<BR>
9. When the ball fills your hands, compress it down (not with your
hands physically, with your mind psychically).<BR>
10. Keep adding to it until your done.<BR>
11. When your done just let it go and difuse into the air.<BR><BR>
Tada! Now you can make Psi Balls! Well, maybe you can't but at least
you know how to. If you have questions, please e-mail me:<BR>
<A HREF="#">Peebrain1@hotmail.com</A><BR>
But before you go asking me a ton of questions, read the FAQ (that
stands for <B>F</B>requently <B>A</B>sked <B>Q</B>uestions) and
make sure I didn't already answer it in there.</P>
<P>One more thing, don't think that right away you'll be able to
make this ball of energy that you can see and throw at things and
all that cool junk. It takes <B><I><U>TIME</U></I></B> and
<B><U><I>PRACTICE</I></U></B>. Don't forget that
<IMG SRC="smile.gif">!</P>
<P>Oh, I've gotten a couple e-mails about this. No, this is not the
only way to make a psi ball, there are as many techniques and psychics.
This is how I do it, you can edit it however you like, it doesn't
matter as long as it works.</P>
