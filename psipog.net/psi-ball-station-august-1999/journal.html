Here is my journal for all those curious minds out there. I obviously
can't keep this updated everytime I write in my journal, but you'll
get a lot of my entries.  Here it is, my
unedited journal - copy and pasted directly from the source:<BR><BR>
<TT>
Sean Connelly's Psychic Log:<BR>
<BR>
Started psychic stuff on Feb-1-1999 because of the movie "The Rage: Carrie<BR>
2".  I saw the previews on TV and saw how the girl had telekinetic powers and<BR>
I said "I want to do that" so I did a search online and almost 2 months later,<BR>
Im here.<BR>
<BR>
=============================================================================<BR>
<BR>
Mar-21-1999:<BR>
This is my first entry.  I just want to keep a record of everything I do that<BR>
is related to psychic stuff.  I read a online book about out-of-body<BR>
experiences and the guy there kept a journal, so I figured I should.  I<BR>
havent gone out-of-body yet but I have done some cool psychic things.  Lets<BR>
start with the things I've done:  I can make energy balls in my hands.  They<BR>
are called PSI-Balls and I can now make them in about 5 seconds.  I feel like<BR>
a cool wind is being blown over them and my hands get tingly sometimes.  Its<BR>
cool.  I just started making sheilds by projecting energy out my whole body<BR>
instead of just my hands but I havent perfected it yet.  I tried telekinesis<BR>
and failed so I decided to start more basic.  The only physical proof I have<BR>
of this other than what I feel is I tried to light a candle with my mind when<BR>
I saw a very small spark.  I got freaked out and decided to not do that<BR>
again, but I did about an hour later and saw a swirl around the wick and got<BR>
freaked out again and stopped.  That was 2 days ago.  I spent the night over<BR>
my best friends house (SW), and he had trouble getting his Play Station<BR>
going.  He doesnt believe in all of this yet.  He said "Why dont you make my<BR>
Play Station work with your mind if your so great" so I told him to turn it<BR>
back on and I concentrated on telling the PS to keep trying.  It worked and<BR>
he was a little freaked out but he still thought it could have happened<BR>
because of chance.  Later that night I got it going again on my second try.<BR>
I have to do some work but tonight I'm definitly going to try to go out-of-<BR>
body (OBE) and write tomorrow what happened.  I can't wait...<BR>
Oh yeah, I should tell you about an experience I thought was weird I had,<BR>
um, in around November of 1998 - before I believed in all that psychic stuff:<BR>
<BR>
I can't remember it that well because it was a long time ago.  I know the<BR>
next day was a school day because I had to get up early and I was thinking<BR>
about it all day.  This is what I remember... I fell asleep like any other<BR>
normal day.  I might have been doing hypnosis stuff, because I used to try<BR>
and meditate and do stuff like that back then but I'm not really sure.  I<BR>
remember waking up in the middle of the night, it was dark all around and I<BR>
could tell I was lying there in my bed.  I think my eyes were closed.  I knew<BR>
I could move my body parts but I didnt feel like it because I was confortable<BR>
and didnt want to do anything but enjoy the free time before a long day of<BR>
school.  The next thing I know I hear people around me.  It wasnt a dream or<BR>
anything because it was real.  The sounds were probably in my head because<BR>
no one else woke up.  I heard something like I was standing in the middle of<BR>
my school hallway and people were walking by me and I was hearing everyone<BR>
have all these different conversations.  I heard my friends voices, people I<BR>
didnt even talk to, people who I played soccer with (CW), just like I was in<BR>
the middle of the hallway and everyone was walking around me.  I didnt see<BR>
anything, it was all sound.  But it was in stereo and I could tone out other<BR>
people and listen to someones conversation like you could do in real life.  I<BR>
couldnt believe what I was hearing but I thought I probably wouldnt get this<BR>
chance again so I just listened.  I suppose I should of experimented but I<BR>
was in shock.  I just couldn't believe what I was hearing.  People walking by<BR>
me in school talking to their friends while I was asleep in my bed!  I really<BR>
can't remember what happened but I think I got a little freaked out and I<BR>
tried to move my arms.  Instantly the sounds went away and I was just laying<BR>
there in my bed.  I tried to forget it and go back asleep but I kept running<BR>
through what just happened and couldnt fall asleep.  Eventually I think I<BR>
fell asleep and woke up the next morning to my alarm clock.  It was so cool,<BR>
I wish I could do it again and I think I can.  I am now understanding what it<BR>
could have been.  I just want to explore more and find out though...<BR>
<BR>
=============================================================================<BR>
<BR>
Mar-22-1999:<BR>
<BR>
Well, I tried it last night [go OOB] and I think I just fell asleep trying.<BR>
Im now reading a new method: Robert Monroe's Method, which is the same<BR>
technique an author of another OBE page used.  I figure I'll memorize it and<BR>
try it tonight.  It says to do it after you wake up but I dont have a lot of<BR>
time. Maybe I'll go to bed early so I'll wake up naturally.  Or maybe take a<BR>
nap. I dont know but I'll end this entry here for now.  I might write more but it<BR>
would be at a different time today - IM ENDING IT HERE.<BR>
------<BR>
Another entry, Im going to bed now - I think it will work... I cant wait to<BR>
try... :-)<BR>
<BR>
=============================================================================<BR>
<BR>
Mar-23-1999:<BR>
<BR>
Well, its the morning and I had a real weird experience.  Unfortunatly I have<BR>
to go to school so you'll have to wait unitl 4:30-5:00 when I get back from<BR>
baseball practice.  I'll try some psychic stuff during the day.  Some magik.<BR>
See you later...<BR>
------<BR>
Well, I just got home.  Now for my experience.  Ok, I'm laying there in bed,<BR>
and Im laying on my side because thats how Im confortable.  I put my hand up<BR>
so when I started to drift off I would feel the blanket with my hand.  I<BR>
tried to fall asleep and stay awake at the same time.  I started at around<BR>
9:00-9:10 and Id say around 15 to 20 minutes later I kinda wake up.  It was<BR>
a weird wake up though.  The whole time I was keeping from my concious mind<BR>
from going away but at the same time bringing up my sub-concious mind.  I<BR>
dont know if it worked but when I woke up (it seemed like I drifted for a<BR>
second)  my vision was a little blury and it was like my eyes were closed<BR>
but open at the same time.  Immediatly I started to panic.  I wanted to stay<BR>
calm because I knew I wasnt in any trouble but since it was a new experience<BR>
my heart started to thumb louder and faster.  I would have stayed in the<BR>
state but I was really afraid I would have a heart attack.  My heart started<BR>
to go faster and faster and it didnt seem to stop.  Once I knew I couldnt<BR>
stay like that I close my eyes and I started to calm down almost instantly.<BR>
That was just my first one.  After I calmed down and I had a semi-normal<BR>
heart beat, I tried again.  I wanted to know exactly how this worked and I<BR>
wanted to explore more.  I started the procedure again and it took another 10<BR>
to 20 minutes before I woke up with the same sight.  I made myself calm down<BR>
and I started to do some tests.  First I wanted to "Get out of my body."  I<BR>
read about how people were stuck in there and couldn't move anything so I<BR>
wondered if I was stuck or if I could go fly around.  So, makeing sure to<BR>
remember the feeling, I tried to move.  I tried very softly, not hard because<BR>
I didn't want to snap out of it or something.  I kinda felt held back but I<BR>
knew if I wanted to really move I could.  So I just started to relax and get<BR>
used to it.  I noticed my vision, how I was feeling, how my heart was going<BR>
for a good minute or so.  Then I thought - ok I got how this is, now I gotta<BR>
try and leave.  So, I tried very softly and couldn't move that great.  Then<BR>
it was like my back was arched but it wasnt.  Like my shoulder blades were<BR>
touching but were also flat at the same time.  It was weird.  Once I noticed<BR>
that I just felt it for a while.  It was like my back was arched but like<BR>
I was still laying in bed.  It was like nothing Ive ever felt before.  So,<BR>
I got sick of just sitting there and I sat up.  I looked back to see if I<BR>
could see my body but I sat up with my body.  That was a disappointment.  I<BR>
hoped I would look back and see my body but, unfortunatly I was in my body.<BR>
Then I started to question whether I actually started to go into an OBE or<BR>
not.  I didn't feel any electricity like others described but I definitly<BR>
wasn't in a normal state.  Its hard to say what I do think really happened.<BR>
Maybe I just opened my eyes and I saw what I would normally see and the rest<BR>
was in my head or maybe I started to go into an OBE but my body wouldn't let<BR>
go of me.  Im not sure.  I cant wait till tonight though.<BR>
Also, during today I was trying to do some telekinetic stuff.  The other day<BR>
I was trying to influence people to scratch their shoulder or turn around<BR>
with no success.  Today I tried to move the spring in my pen with my mind.<BR>
Now for the weird part...  The spring was laying on my notebook nice and<BR>
stable and I tried to move it.  After a couple of tries it moved a little.<BR>
Believe it or not, thats not the weird part.  The weird part was I didn't<BR>
freak out.  I accepted it.  I was suprised later that I accepted it but didnt<BR>
notice that I didnt freak out until later.  It was a relief.  My new reality.<BR>
I tried again in other classes and failed but I was pretty happy with me and<BR>
my sub-concious for understanding it and believing in it.  Well, I havent<BR>
eaten in 5 hours so Im gonna go eat.  I hope I do a full OBE tonight.  I'll<BR>
chat and read more and see if I can understand what happened last night.<BR>
<BR>
=============================================================================<BR>
<BR>
March-24-1999:<BR>
<BR>
Well, I got some advice last night after I wrote the last entry.  The guy on<BR>
Yahoo! chat said he goes OBE all the time but he is a skilled mage.  He said<BR>
it is possible to get lost or find someone else in your body but he said it<BR>
is like saying its the same as a plane crashing into your house.  I hope hes<BR>
right.  For now though Ill stick to Telekinesis and PSI stuff.  I want to be<BR>
a skiled mage before I attempt OBEs again.  Im gonna go practice TK now...<BR>
------<BR>
Well, I practiced some TK stuff with little success but its better then no<BR>
success.  What else was cool was that I had a random macro-TK.  I was taking<BR>
apart a hard-drive with my dad when a screw flew at my screwdriver.  My dad<BR>
said he didn't do it and I knew instantly it was TK.  Cool.  My dad just<BR>
brushed it off like nothing was out of place.  Ah well, I hope he sees what I<BR>
can see someday...<BR>
<BR>
=============================================================================<BR>
<BR>
March-25-1999<BR>
<BR>
 Im not gonna attempt OBEs again.  Im gonna go practice TK now...<BR>
<BR>
=============================================================================<BR>
<BR>
March-28-1999<BR>
<BR>
 Couple days off - I think I might of had random TK, Ill tell ya later...<BR>
<BR>
=============================================================================<BR>
<BR>
March-29-1999<BR>
<BR>
 Well, I'll tell you about my random TK.  I was eating pizza and SW was<BR>
talking about he accidently tried to put the cap of the pop in his cup<BR>
instead of the bottle and we all laughed.  I then imagined that the cap was<BR>
in the cup.  Then, when SW was screwing it onto the bottle, it flew out of<BR>
his hands and landed into his cup.  Thats weird.  Later that night I was<BR>
asking about how that happened and he said he squeezed it and it just flew<BR>
and happened to go in his cup.  I told him my theory about my random TK and I<BR>
told him about the hard-drive one from March-24-1999.  He said that it was<BR>
really weird and he didn't know really what happened.  Maybe he thought I was<BR>
crazy but I think he knew how I felt.  Maybe it was just an accident and I<BR>
had nothing to do with it, maybe I saw the cap flying and my sub-concious<BR>
directed it into the cup, or maybe my sub-concious forced the cap out of SW's<BR>
hands and into the cup.  I don't know.  Im gonna keep practicing though...<BR>
<BR>

April-1-1999<BR>
<BR>
 Yesterday I saw my PSI ball which was cool.  I was in lunch and WB's brother<BR>
was picking on JT.  He was just being mean.  It was starting to piss me off<BR>
so I decided to give him an illness.  I balled up all the negitave energy I<BR>
could get my brain on, into my hands.  I cupped my hands differently so I<BR>
would get it more compacted but it was completely surrounded by my hands so I<BR>
couldn't see it without opening my hands.  I opened my hands to look inside<BR>
and I saw a blue wavy worm like thing go from one side to the other.  That<BR>
broke my concentration so it went away.  I made another one and looked in and<BR>
saw the worm thing again.  I tried not to break my concentration but it was<BR>
too hard.  I then made my third one and leashed it onto WB's brother.  He'll<BR>
be feeling it later.  I also made someone levitate with my mind today too...<BR>
april fools!  he he he...<BR>
<BR>

April-6-1999 OBE #1<BR>
<BR>
 This morning I had an OBE.  It was the coolest thing in the world.  I used<BR>
the SunEye method.  I set my alarm for 5:11 am and went to bed at 11:00 and<BR>
started looking at my third eye (without straining my face) with my eyes<BR>
closed and saying to myself "Today will be the day I have an out of body<BR>
experience".  I did this for a long time.  I forgot what I was saying a<BR>
couple times which was weird but eventually I fell asleep.  I woke up again<BR>
at 3:12 am and I thought "Oh great, I woke up before my alarm, it wont work<BR>
now", but I continued anyways.  I fell asleep and woke up again at 5:05 am.<BR>
No need for the alarm so I turned it off.  I got up and was feeling real<BR>
drowsy but what do you expect.  I started to read the book I set up eariler<BR>
but I had to go to the bathroom.  I went downstairs, did my business, washed<BR>
my face (thats part of the method) and came back upstairs.  I read in full<BR>
light at my desk area.  I read the section on Astral Travel once and it was<BR>
only 5:15.  Since you had to be awake a whole hour, I read it again.  5:30.<BR>
So I thought, "Im not reading it AGAIN... I'll do something else".  So I<BR>
picked up the SunEye method printout and read through it.  Then I started<BR>
looking through these other books and started looking at the pictures.  They<BR>
were cool, but the whole time I was thinking about OBEing.  It finally rolled<BR>
around to 5:50 and I thought "Close enough" and went back to bed.  I focused<BR>
on my third eye like before and said "I will now have an out of body experie-<BR>
nce".  I did that for a while and kept forgeting what I was gonna say but I<BR>
eventually fell asleep.  I also remember feeling all tingly but I cant<BR>
remember when that was and I dont think it played a big part anyways.  I fell<BR>
asleep and woke up again at around 7:15.  The SunEye method said I would wake<BR>
up in an OBE, Lucid Dream, or False Awakening.  I thought "Crap, all that<BR>
work for nothing", so I went back to sleep.  It was kinda hard to get back to<BR>
sleep this time because it wasnt that early and the sun was shining but I<BR>
remember talking to myself saying how Great Britain shouldn't let anyone be<BR>
king and queen, they should at least be there a couple years and get the hang<BR>
of the government, then I remembered you were born into it (duh...) and I<BR>
started laughing at myself.  Then *BANG* I was out of body.  No strange<BR>
noises or loud hissing like things Ive read before say, just zip.  I was<BR>
floating outside my body so that my head was facing east but my body was<BR>
facing north.  It was the weirdest thing, then about 3-5 seconds later *BANG*<BR>
Im below my body with my arms going through my bed.  I started feeling what<BR>
my hands were on.  It felt like wood.  Then I thought "Ah, man, this is<BR>
awesome, I gotta get out..." so I started wobbling back and forth, piviting<BR>
on like my sternum.  I went up on my left side and then *BANG* - back in my<BR>
body.  I wish it lasted longer but it still rocked.  I was awake - not like<BR>
disorentated or anything like when you wake up, I was just laying there play-<BR>
ing what happened over and over in my head so I would remember it all.  The<BR>
weird thing too was I didnt feel the weight of my blanket - I didnt really<BR>
think about this eariler but I didnt feel it at all.  I realized this when I<BR>
tried to rock beck in forth like I did in my OBE in my body.  I found it<BR>
a lot harder than it was because of my blanket and gravity.  Both didnt<BR>
effect my OBE person.  It was a wild experience.  I cant wait till tonight.<BR>
From now on, when Im OBE Ill call me - the part out of body - my soul.  Even<BR>
though Im athiest, it makes it a lot easier to type.  Ill call my body - the<BR>
part I left behind - my body.  Just so its easier for me to type and so you<BR>
can understand. :-)<BR>
<BR>
=============================================================================<BR>
<BR>
April-8-1999<BR>
<BR>
 Man, I got so close this morning.  It was so anoying.  Well, I heard and saw<BR>
a lot even though I wasnt OOB.  I heard 5 5 7 8.  Maybe its the win 4 or<BR>
something but I had to write it here for proof.  I gotta go to practice now.<BR>
<BR>
=============================================================================<BR>
<BR>
May-23-1999<BR>
<BR>
 Holy cow - Something really cool happened today.  I was over at SW's house<BR>
spending the night.  He had this knife that was pretty sharp from the last<BR>
time I remembered seeing it.  I asked him: "Did you get this knife<BR>
sharpened?" and right after I asked it I thought "Well, yeah, a little while<BR>
ago" - then I was like - cool this is what he's gonna say - My mind is<BR>
telling me the answer before SW actually says it.  Then SW answered "No." and<BR>
I thought - crap, I thoguht it was gonna work too, then, like 2 seconds later<BR>
he said "Well, yeah, a little while ago." - I didn't freak out either.  I was<BR>
like "Yeah - thats how it's supposed to go".  Very cool.<BR>
<BR>
=============================================================================<BR>
<BR>
May-30-1999<BR>
<BR>
Well, for the past month or so I've been trying to go out of body.  I've had<BR>
a lot of weird experiences but too many to type really.  Most were just from<BR>
meditation.  Ya know - getting used to it.  Im now starting to go into deep<BR>
meditation during the day instead of just at night.  It's hard to find time<BR>
though - if I disappear into my room for a long time when my parents are<BR>
home, they'll see what Im doing and mess me all up.  They think that I've<BR>
stopped all this psychic stuff too.  I have to keep a low profile so they<BR>
dont think Im crazy.  Every day I experience something psychic though.  Now<BR>
Im trying to see auras too.  No success but its my first day.  Every night<BR>
Im gonna try to go OOB but I've only been out 3 times.  The first time is<BR>
already in here.  The second time I went OOB but I was stuck.  I couldn't<BR>
move.  It lasted about 30-45 seconds.  The third time I was having a really<BR>
weird night.  That day I started asking myself "Am I dreaming?" every 15 min.<BR>
or so so I could catch myself in a dream and go lucid.  My night was really<BR>
REALLY really! weird.  A lot of confusion.  I had a dream that I had an OBE<BR>
but I knew it was a dream when I woke up.  Then later that night I woke up<BR>
and my soul fell through my bed.  OBE #3.  Once I hit though I was snapped<BR>
into a dream though.  Very fast.  Im gonna keep trying... I hope I dont<BR>
forget to write to you like I did in most of the month of May and April :)...<BR>
<BR>
=============================================================================<BR>
<BR>
May-31-1999<BR>
<BR>
Well, something pretty cool happened last night.  I was reading this thing on<BR>
how micro-TK can make chances fall one way.  I already knew that but then it<BR>
was talking about how you can sub-conciously stack a deck in your favor.  So<BR>
I tried it out.  First try - I wanted to get the Ace of Spades on the top of<BR>
the deck.  Pretty simple but statisticaly impossible.  1/52 tries I would get<BR>
it according to probability.  First try - fail.  Second try - fail.  Third<BR>
try - Success!  If that doesnt make you think...  I was pretty amazed and I<BR>
just stared at the card for a couple minutes absorbing what just happened.<BR>
Mind you, I kept my eyes closed most of the time when I was shuffling - and<BR>
the only time I opened my eyes was when I was looking at the design on the<BR>
back of the cards.  Oh yeah - I check the card underneath the Ace of Spades<BR>
and it was the Ace of Diamonds.  Then I tried a couple other things with no<BR>
or little success - just that one time, that was pretty amazing.  I pushed<BR>
the logic out of my head and just let my sub-concious control the deck.  It<BR>
worked.<BR>
<BR>
=============================================================================<BR>
<BR>
June-23-1999<BR>
<BR>
Well, I've been trying to have OBEs more and more.  I've had a lot of lucid<BR>
dreams though which is really fun.  The other night I had the wierdest lucid<BR>
dream.  I kinda woke up and I knew I was in bed.  I visualized I was jumping<BR>
really high on my road.  The more I visualized the more it seemed real.  I<BR>
started seeing myself jumping up and down on the road (1st person) but I could<BR>
still feel myself in my bed.  Gradually, I was just in a dream where I was<BR>
on my roading jumping really high.  It was really cool.  I jumped on my road<BR>
about a half-mile (didn't take long since I was going so high) and I thought,<BR>
"This is dumb, I should try to wake my concious up totally while in a dream."<BR>
Usually when I notice Im dreaming I get distracted and forget about it (??) so<BR>
I have to make a good effort to "wake" myself up in my dream so I can go<BR>
around normally.  So, in my jumping dream I tried to wake myself up totally<BR>
while still being in my dream but blacked out or something because I dont<BR>
remember anything else.  But the reason Im writting in now is because what<BR>
happened today.  It was around 2:30 in the afternoon and no one was home so<BR>
I decided to try and go OOB.  I went up in my room and layed down.  I started<BR>
to breath slowly and just feel the air cool my body down.  Then, my head felt<BR>
like it just shook a little.  It was like my head was rubber and someone<BR>
flicked it and it vibrated back and forth.  I thought "Cool, I should experi-<BR>
ment with this" so I tried to spread it throughout my body.  It worked and my<BR>
whole body felt like jello blubbering around.  It didnt move that much but<BR>
it was still pretty weird to feel, expecially since I just started trying to<BR>
have an OBE.  After messing around with that for like 2 minutes or so it<BR>
seemed like a trap door just flew open underneeth me and I fell down like 3<BR>
floors then something cusioned me and brought me back up - only to be dropped<BR>
again.  I could still feel my bed underneeth me, it just felt like I was<BR>
falling though.  After about 3 minutes I kinda lost it and blacked out.  I<BR>
woke up to my mom that was yelling at me.  I was really mad for some reason.<BR>
It was cool though.  Im definitily gonna try tonight.<BR>
<BR>

August-13-1999<BR>
<BR>
I had an OBE this morning, I'll type more tonight.<BR>
<BR>
=============================================================================<BR>
<BR>
August-14-1999<BR>
<BR>
Ok, I had another OBE last night, first I'll talk about the one I had on the<BR>
thirteenth.<BR>
<BR>
It was morning.  I was like just going in and out of sleep and my dreams<BR>
where fading in and out.  I would wake up for like 30 seconds then go back<BR>
to sleep then wake up a half hour later for 30 seconds and go back to sleep.<BR>
I did this for a while.  One time when I woke up though, I was playing with<BR>
my arm.  It seemed like my arm was floating and if I concentrated on it, it<BR>
could rise so it was level on my bed and I could lower it into my bed.  I<BR>
know how strange this seems but I didn't find it out of the ordinary.  Then,<BR>
it dawned on me - "What? My arm can't go through my bed!!!" And I started to<BR>
see that I was OOB.  It took me probably 3-5 minutes before I noticed I was<BR>
not in my body though.  So, I decided to get OUT of my body.  I saw my<BR>
physical arm lying there.  Then, I moved my arm and I saw my soul's finger-<BR>
tips.  I couldn't move my head though.  I tried to push off the wall with my<BR>
soul's finger tips.  I push myself a little bit but the wall got out of my<BR>
reach and I didn't know what to do.  So I tried to "feel how nice it would<BR>
be to float up to the ceiling" like Monroe always says.  But I couldn't get<BR>
a clear view of the ceiling because I couldn't move my head.  I tried to<BR>
float up for about 2-5 seconds but quit (I don't know why - I think because<BR>
I couldn't see the ceiling well and it was bugging me).  The next thing I<BR>
remember is just being in my body.  That was it.  I didn't black out - I<BR>
don't think - but I'm not really sure.  Oh, I almost forgot.  One of those<BR>
times when I woke up, before my OBE, I said to my over-soul "If I have a OBE<BR>
today, I'll try to spend less time on the computer and actually get some<BR>
excercise today.  Heck, I'll try to run a mile in under 6:00 min."  I thought<BR>
there was no way I would actually get out, but I did.  So, yes, I did run.<BR>
I couldn't make it a mile though, I went 3/4 of a mile in 4 minutes and was<BR>
too tired to go on.  Good deal!<BR>
<BR>
Now for my weird OBE last night:<BR>
I went to bed at around 4:00 am.  I really didn't feel like trying to leave<BR>
but I thought "I have to keep trying, I just had one the other night - there<BR>
is no way Im giving up." So I tried.  I was thinking earilier (when I was<BR>
running and excercising) that the only times I've gone OOB was when I wasn't<BR>
trying and was just relaxed.  I didn't use a specific method, it just<BR>
happened.  So I said - "Well, I'm going to try but not really TRY, just relax<BR>
and let it happen".  I think that is important in getting out.  I layed down<BR>
and thought of something to try to keep my mind clear of thought.  It is to<BR>
say to yourself (in your head) two things:<BR>
1) "Any thought I have will end right away and I will have a clear mind"<BR>
2) "The longer I have a clear mind, the harder it is to not have a clear mind"<BR>
Let me tell you, I said those two lines (not WORDS, just the idea really)<BR>
like 2 or 3 times but it was getting hard to think it.  It worked!  So I just<BR>
layed there.  I just watched myself getting a clearer and clearer mind.  No<BR>
thought was getting in and the thoughts that did get in vanished immediatly.<BR>
I was suprised but not for long.  After like only 1 minute or so of having<BR>
a clear mind, I feel asleep or blacked out or something.  I did have a dream<BR>
but I can't remember if it was after or before my OBE.  Thats the only thing<BR>
that sucks about OBEs when your a beginner, you can't remember anything!  I<BR>
know it'll get A TON easier in time... Anyways, I remember waking up and I<BR>
knew right away I was out of body.  It was dark but I just knew where things<BR>
were.  I don't know, it was like everything had a glow to them.  Not like a<BR>
light or anything, just a - Ah, words can't describe it.  It's annoying trying<BR>
to describe it when nothing you say (or type) will show what it was.  There<BR>
wasn't any color, I'm sure of that.  Everything had just a gray glow.<BR>
Anyways, I didn't really wake up in my body, out of body :), I woke up like<BR>
kneeling on my bed where my physical knees were.  Like I just lifted myself<BR>
up.  I got out and stood with my back to the wall.  All of the sudden, I got<BR>
yanked backwords.  I was doing back flips over and over and over agian.  It<BR>
was pretty scary.  A lot of thoughts raced through my head.  First I thought,<BR>
"What the heck is going on?" then I was like "Help! Someone help me!" then<BR>
I thought, "I want to be back" and I was.  Just like that I was standing where<BR>
I first took off.  I don't know why, but I wanted to try to go flying again.<BR>
This time without all the rotating.  I turned towards my window and jumped<BR>
out.  I kicked a little too much and was doing forward flips through the air.<BR>
I was still scared but just thought "I want to be back" and I was.  This time,<BR>
I jumped out my window but with less kick so I wouldn't rotate.  I started<BR>
going through the tree outside of my house and I was flying out.  The bad<BR>
part was I could only go in the direction I kicked off in.  I couldn't<BR>
steer or anything which really made me scared.  I think now I just have to<BR>
control my fears and try to go with the flow, like just relax my thoughts and<BR>
think of what I want to do.  Like I was saying, I was getting really scared<BR>
so I thought "I want to be back in my body" and BOOM, I was.  Just like that.<BR>
That was such a wild experience.  I'm going to "try" again tonight.  It's<BR>
sounds so fun looking back on it but it was a pretty terrifying experience<BR>
for me.  Just because I thought I didn't have control, but looking back on<BR>
it I can see that I did actually have control, my fears just got in the way.<BR>
It's funny.  You read and read and read about others experiences and you<BR>
think that you're ready and that you would love to be out and that you can<BR>
do it and not be unlogical and afraid like everyone else, but once you are<BR>
ACTUALLY out, you're just a beginner.  I guess nothing can prepare you for<BR>
an experience like that.  I once thought I could do telekinesis.  But when I<BR>
actually did it, I was freaked out and my mind went a little nuts.  I thought<BR>
I could do it but that was just on the surface.  Deep down, I thought, "I<BR>
don't know - this can't be for real..." but when it happens, you get shook up<BR>
because now you TRUELY believe in it and you KNOW how it is and you EXPERIENCE<BR>
it.  When you havent done it, you think that there is a small gap between<BR>
what you hear/read about and when it happens.  But when you do it, you look<BR>
back and see how enormously huge the gap was.  It's 1000000x bigger than I<BR>
thought it was.  No joke, I'm not over reacting.  Remember<BR>
Not True:<BR>
Belief .. Experience<BR>
<BR>
True:<BR>
Belief ..................................1000000x.......... Experience<BR>
<BR>
I'll never forget that.<BR>
