<P>Oooooh, the kinesis' all packed into one file - YIPPIE!  Alright,
lets first list the kinesis' I know and what they're about - then
you can click on them and see what I could come up with on them:
<UL><LI><A HREF="kinesis.html">Telekinesis (TK)</A> - Moving stuff with your
mind.<LI><A HREF="kinesis.html">Psychokinesis (PK)</A> - Bending stuff with your
mind (by definition, it also includes TK).
<LI><A HREF="kinesis.html">Pyrokinesis (PyroK?)</A> - Setting stuff on fire with
your mind.
<LI><A HREF="kinesis.html">Pagokinesis (PagoK?)</A> - Freezing stuff with
your mind (it doesnt really have a name, Pago is "ice" in Greek so I
figured this would be an appropiate name).</UL>
<HR>
<A NAME="t"><H2>Telekinesis</H2></A>
<TT><B>tel·e·ki·ne·sis</B> (têl`î-kî-në`sîs, -kï-), <I>n</I>.
The movement or objects by scientifically inexplicable means, as by the
excercise of an occult power.</TT>
<P>This is a damn cool skill.  I havent mastered it yet but I have made
things move.  I love practicing it though, it's a lot of fun.  Most of
your time and energy, when practicing this, should go into your beliefs,
not your brain.  This is the things you should <B>NOT</B> do (unless they
work for you <IMG SRC="smile.gif">, this is aimed at beginners though):
<UL><LI>Stare at something for a long time hopeing it will move
<LI>Ask an object to move
<LI>Try to 'will' it to move
<LI>Try to force it
<LI>Obsess with it
</UL>Now, stuff you SHOULD do:<UL>
<LI>Concentrate
<LI>Be relaxed
<LI>Have fun
</UL>
The most important thing, other than belief, is to <B>Just do it</B>, or,
as Yoda is famous for saying: "Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try."
You have to learn to do it like how you learned to move your arm.  You
don't think "Arm, move!" - it just does.  You shouldn't think "Ball, move!"
- it just should.  E-mail me if your serious about learning telekinesis 
(<A HREF="#">peebrain1@hotmail.com</A>) - I've taught beginners how to
make it happen the first time - which is usually the hardest.

<HR><A NAME="p"><H2>Psychokinesis</H2></A>
<TT><B>psy·cho·ki·ne·sis</B> (sï`kö-kî-në`sîs, -kï-) <I>n</I>.
The production or control of motion, especially in inanimate and remote
objects, purportedly by the exercise of psychic powers.</TT>
<P>
Everyone knows Uri Geller, the 'psychic' that could bend spoons, keys,
and nails.  I think he is fake, well, not 100% fake, but he's not 100%
real, thats for sure (read James Randi's book, "The Truth about Uri Geller").
But, just because magicians can look like psychics doesn't mean that
psychics don't exist.  Im not sure if I have done this yet.  I know when
I was done concentrating on a key it was bent a little but it might have
been bent before I tried (I didn't check - stupid stupid stupid me).
I can't offer a lot of advice on this subject. I assume it is a lot like
TK, but I don't have a big urge to bend things with my mind. It's just
not what I want to work on.... yet.
</P>
<HR><A NAME="r"><H2>Pyrokinesis</H2></A>
<TT>It wasn't in my dictionary</TT>
<P>I couldn't find any information on this at all. In my journal, there
is an entry where I try to light a candle (Mar-21-1999) and I saw some
sparks. I think (Im no expert) that it's just a matter of practicing
and working on it... I can't really give any new info on it until I can
do it.  Sorry!
</P>
<HR><A NAME="f"><H2>Pagokinesis</H2></A>
<TT>It wasn't in my dictionary</TT>
<P>Pagokinesis, whats that? One site said that the skill to freeze something
with your mind exists. It also said it didn't have a name - but that was all
it said. So... I went to a translator online and typed in "ice" and hit convert
to Greek, I got "Pagos" or something so decided that Pagokinesis would be a
great name... you come up with a better one! This skill I'm totally in the dark
one. Maybe someday I'll learn it but for now, I don't know the slightest thing
about it. Try just training your mind like you would with any other kinesis,
it could work.  E-mail me if you get results too (<A
HREF="#">peebrain1@hotmail.com</A>) because I'd like
to hear how and what happened.
