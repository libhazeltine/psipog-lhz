                  <p>What inspired you or why did you make this website? I mean there are a lot of other psions out there that don't care if you believe in psi or not.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>When I first started, I wanted to find a website like PsiPog to help me figure things out. I used to think to myself "someone should make a site without all that religion, and make it more scientific, that normal people can understand and learn how to do things..."... etc...</p>

                  <p>Eventually I came across Active Psy, and thought it was great. It presented the material in an easy to understand manor, without any emphasis on religion, and it sounded like it was based on personal experience. I liked the teaching philosophy... Then one day, a friend emailed me about this site
                  he was going to make, where people post articles online about Psi. He asked me to write an article on telekinesis for him, so I did. It was pretty cool... After a while he said he wasn't going to be able to make the site he was hoping to make, so he gave up on the project. At the time, I had already
                  made a few websites (I'm a computer nerd <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       border="0"
                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />), and already had one dedicated to how to make a psi ball. So, I took my psi ball website down, took my unpublished telekinesis article, and asked around for people to help to start making my own site. Rainsong started helping right away, and I put the site up...</p>

                  <p>I guess what originally inspired wasn't that I wanted other people to believe... I really don't care if other people believe (as you said). I am more interested in making a type of website that I would personally like to visit. I've held a lot of different opinions concerning psi at different
                  points in my life, and I want to make a site that would be useful to those points of view, because I understand where people who think that way are coming from (since I once thought that way).</p>

                  <p>Long answer..? heh. I guess it's a build up of a lot of things...</p>

                  <p>You can change your "timezone" preference in the option area. Go to <a href="index.html"
                     target="_blank">index.html</a> while logged in. There should be a timezone field... just select your current time. Then when you go to the calendar, it should display it in your selected time. PsiPog, internally, uses U.S. Eastern Time -5. To get the official PsiPog time,
                     check <a href="index.html"

                  <p>"Psi" is a Greek letter (that trident shape in the top left of the page). It seems to be spelled much the same way in most Western European languages, and so is probably still "psi" in Spanish.</p>

                  <p>It's almost impossible to schedule an online seminar at a time that is convenient for everybody in an international community such as PsiPog is. Therefore, it makes sense for the seminar to be taught at times convenient, or at least possible, for the one who is presenting. And, if the instructor
                  is American, chances are that a time early enough to be workable for the Europeans would have him/her still at work or at school. And some folks don't have the weekends as an option, either. However, your request is noted.</p>

                  <p>It is a PHP script with a MySQL backend. It's somewhat basic... the MySQL table is like "from user", "to user", "subject", "mesasge". Then it's just a matter of inserting the data, displaying the data, and deleting the data <img src="blah.gif"
