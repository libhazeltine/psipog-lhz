                  <p>I've been thinking; wouldn't it be best to use balls of different sizes and materials, rather than use different things for different activities, ie. psiwheel for spinning, pencil/pen for rolling, leaf or feather for levitating... Any thoughts on this?</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hello, I'd first like to say that you provide a lot of great info on this site. I've read all regarding PK and they are very valuable. Ok now that thats out of the way, onto the question.</p>

                  <p>Ok, I've tried a few diffrent 'tools' to get started, such as hanging a piece of paper from the ceiling and making it spin? I've always been intrested in this subject but have not yet made a 'dedicated' start to it, such as trying on a schedule.</p>

                  <p>Now what happens is I set my wheel, aluminum foil piece, pin needle, get it all set-up. I get it balanced on aswell. Now when I tried it the first time with a very small piece of tin foil, nothing happend when I tried the 'just do it' technique, along with getting into a very relaxed state of mind
                  etc.</p>

                  <p>Then I made another one, this time the tin foil was big, I'd say about 2 inches x 2 inches. I got that balanced, and when I'd try, it would spin slowly about 180' stop then spin the opposite direction 180' stop and basically repeat. I'm pretty convinced that some how drafts in my room are causing
                  it to do this. Although when I would be on the computer not paying attention to it, I'd quickly look up and notice it dead still, so I'm actually not quite sure.</p>

                  <p>Is this some sort of control issue? Am I truly making it spin, or is some other non PK'd involved force? Is the reason it wouldn't spin when it was smaller be because it didn't catch this draft?</p>

                  <p>Could you give me some advice on how to set up a pseudo-genuine experiment to make sure it's not some other force? Like to set it up in an upside down gold fish bowl or something?</p>

                  <p>I also highly doubt on my first time of really trying I would be able to make it move like that! Espically with being somewhat sceptical about it?</p>

                  <p>Just looking for some answers, thank you!</p>

                  <p>A psiwheel is a toy. It is fun to play with, but subject to too many variables to use in serious experimentation. If you set it up inside a glass jar, you'll cut down on drafts, though: attach the base of the psiwheel to the inside of a jar lid, and put the jar upside-down over psiwheel, closing
                  the lid.<br /></p>

                  <p>I've used a method similar to that...</p>

                  <p>I would create a ball around it, and get the ball to "grip" the edges of the pinwheel. Then I would start spinning the ball. It really didn't seem like it was psi on the ball, felt more like a mental crutch. Nonetheless, it worked for me.</p>

                  <p>My opinion on methods boil down to: if it works, use it.</p>

                  <p>Hello,</p>

                  <p>I've been unwilling to practice PK for the longest of times, because of this one lingering fear that I might "succeed" in my mind but actually only be completely hallucinating it... and then when I show it to a friend or try to do something similar, I will end up actually hallucinating them
                  acknowledging, saying "Wow, that was great!", when in reality they are staring at me laughing.</p>

                  <p>I think the main question I want to ask is: is it possible for an individual to completely distort their touch with reality because practicing things that involve a great deal of focus, ie. some methods of doing pk? I guess I have a really big fear of going insane.</p>

                  <p>Hello, i am a little unsure about telekinesis.<br />
                  I mean, all videos ive seen on the net this far is quite easy to explain. If you know magician methods such as Invisible thread, magnets and stuff, all can be used. The pinwheel videos on this site can easly be repeated with bodyheat. I actually tried it myself. I made a pinwheel,and covered a glass
                  with my hands, off course the air went hot and the wheel started to move!</p>

                  <p>I did it witout a glass, and it started moving as well!</p>

                  <p>I dont know if its to much, but something it would really appreciate was a video with a little piece of a paper or something that you cant control using a magnet. SO NO COINS. I would like a video with that covered with a glass and that someone try to move it in more than one direction. Like move
                  it against you, to the left, right and away from you.</p>

                  <p>That would kill my sceptism and it would help me reaching the truth.</p>

                  <p>The answer to this question seems hard for some of you folks to grasp. Therefore, I shall say this in short simple words:</p>

                  <p>Videos are not proof.</p>

                  <p>They do not prove _anything_, at all, except that someone was able to make a "movie" clip. The contents of the clip, no matter what they are, prove _nothing_ themselves.</p>

                  <p>It does not matter what form of pk is displayed, if it is on a video it can be faked. If it is on a video, it is not proof that pk exists, and it is not proof that the person performing it can do pk.</p>
