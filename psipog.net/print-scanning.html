   <h1 class="pageTitle">Scanning</h1>

   <p><em>by annie</em></p>

   <p>I'm told every good article starts with a joke. Yep, a joke. Upon spending the past few days with my eight month old nephew, I have a great joke that works every time. OK. Ready?</p>

   <p>Peek-a-boo! No, wait, it goes like this. PEEK-A-BOO!</p>

   <p>Tough crowd, tough crowd. I'm actually here, today, to discuss a number of subjects, the first one being scanning. For those of you who've been around a while, this article basically combines the last two articles (no longer available) and adds some more information. It is part one of a very cool series.</p>

   <p>I'm often asked by the Internet folk how to scan. These are the following questions I am going to answer on scanning:</p>

   <ol>
      <li>What is scanning?</li>

      <li>How do I create the 'link' in which to scan someone? What should I visualize?</li>

      <li>How do I get the kind of information am I looking for once I've created this link?</li>

      <li>Will you scan me?</li>

      <li>Is scanning ethical?</li>

      <li>How do you read someone's mind?</li>

      <li>I still can't locate my target, what can I do?</li>

      <li>Does your target have to know you're scanning them?</li>

      <li>How do I know if I'm being scanned? Can I prevent scanning?</li>

      <li>Will you scan me?</li>
   </ol>So, here we go. One question at a time.

   <p><b>1. What is scanning?</b></p>

   <p>Scanning is defined in the <a href="art-telepathy-manual.html">Telepathy Manual</a>. But, because you're special, I'll paste it again here for you:</p>

   <p><i>6) Scanning: Scanning, as far as telepathy goes, is a method of finding information about a target via telepathic means. Scans vary in depth and accuracy. While a surface scan may turn up very little, for example, a shield shape and possibly surface thoughts, an in depth scan can uncover basically anything
   any one individual is thinking or has thought, without them necessarily having to be thinking it at the time.</i></p>

   <p><b>2. How do I create the 'link' in which to scan someone? What should I visualize?</b></p>

   <p>This is where you start to OVER think. (At least, those of you capable of thinking.) You're the ones who have printed out this article and are waiting for a step-by-step instruction scanning ritual. Sorry, suckers, ain't happening. While telepathy may be a science of it's sort, I like to think there's still a
   bit of art to it. So just chill the heck out and go with it, dammit! Still, I'm going to relay a couple of popular visualizations.</p>

   <p>My favorite is the Utility Belt Link. (Now, in the past I have been made fun of for naming names of superheros who didn't actually wear utility belts. But don't you worry, readers, I made sure those nerds knew who was boss.)</p>

   <p>I'm pretty sure Batman had one, because of that one scene with Kim Basinger... nevermind. So Batman is our example. When Batman needs to climb a wall, he unleashes that anchor-looking thing with a rope attached, and up he climbs. This is the general beginners method, as it's that "climbing" feeling and practice
   which increases your familiarity, comfort zone, speed, and in such, your accuracy.</p>

   <p>Acquire target. Shield. Do not proceed before until you've done both. After you've acquired your target, visualize your utility belt. And if you're the type of person who has to manipulate from the sternum, a utility sports bra. Take a moment to gather, program, and then send towards the target. This anchor is
   just an extension of you. Navigate around your target and see what you see.</p>

   <p>This is basically the same as the tendril technique described in the Telepathy Manual. The tendril technique seems to work best for people who are more often heavily shielded and have the awareness and control to just plum extend themselves into a target's mind.</p>

   <p><b>3. How do I get the kind of information am I looking for once I've created this link?</b></p>

   <p>This might be an anti-climactic answer, but look for it. Poke around (gently!) and find the information you seek. Also, a programming of your extension (anchor, tendril, whatever) can be crucial.</p>

   <p><b>4. Will you scan me?</b></p>

   <p>No.</p>

   <p><b>5. Is scanning ethical?</b></p>

   <p>Neither PsiPog nor I are the appropriate people to ask this. Ethics are a personal thing. Decide your own and go from there. But don't lecture me; it makes me grumpy. If it is a matter of religion, speak to your spiritual advisor.</p>

   <p><b>6. How do you read someone's mind?</b></p>

   <p>First of all, if you're seriously asking me this question: I hate you. Second, "mind reading" and "scanning" are somewhat interchangable, in a slang situation.</p>

   <p><b>7. I still can't locate my target, what can I do?</b></p>

   <p>If you haven't been practicing this for at least a month, do not ask me this. Practice. Keep practicing. Baby steps, people, baby steps. You can also read Gnome's <a href="art-sensitivity-manual.html">Sensitivity Manual</a> and practice being in tune with the feelings that occur during change
   and even during moments of stillness. If all else fails, I hear golf is a good game.</p>

   <p><b>8. Does your target have to know you're scanning them?</b></p>

   <p>No. Although some scanners can feel like a bull in a china shop no matter how "subtle" they try to be. This, too, comes with practice and being comfortable with the navigation.</p>

   <p><b>9. How do I know if I'm being scanned? Can I prevent scanning?</b></p>

   <p>I don't know. How do you know when your foot itches? How do you know when someone behind you is staring at the back of your head? It's just a matter of sensitivity. And yes, you can shield against scanning. Use the same visualizations you would to keep all other probe types out.</p>

   <p><b>10. Will you scan me?</b></p>

   <p>Again, no. I am not a circus act, nor do I wish to be watched like two mating monkies at the zoo. If you have a legitimate need and know how to find me, I'll try to be accomodating. But the default answer is still no.</p>
