                  <p>My question is that what Psi balls can do in whole. I am Usui reiki master. And in one mansul i have read about making reiki energy balls and sending to those who needs healing.<br />
                  So Reiki can also be sent to future or past. so Using Reiki energy ball does it possible to send it future.<br />

                  <p>Yes, that can be done. Admittedly, psiballs are usually just used as elementary construct exercises and cat toys, but they can be used for other purposes, if you feel like it.</p>

                  i was practicing hot and cold Psiballs on a digital thermometer and at one point i was trying to make a cold psiball and the thermometer turned off by itself. DO you have any idea what that may mean?<br />

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Check the details for the thermometer. Presumably it is a digital one, because you say it "turned off". Some of them turn off automatically after a certain period of time. If you can't turn it on again, you might have fluffed up its inner workings by running too much psi through or near it,
                  though.</p>

                  <p>Doubtful. However, you _can_ make a shield that amplifies the incoming signals. For many people, that would amount to the same thing. Be sure to make the first one of very limited duration, though; it hits harder than you expect.</p>

                  <p>It is indeed possible to make a psiball in one hand, as Peebrain states clearly in his basic Psiball article. Belief in chakras of any kind, third-eye or otherwise, is not required for psionics.</p>

                  <p>I've heard something about psi-wards. In "Fire and Ice" article they are referred as a kind of barrier, however I haven't found it at any shield article. What are exactly psi-wards?</p>

                  <p>Wards are similar to Shields. In some communities, Wards are Shields that remain in one place, while regular shields move with the object/person being defended. In some communities, a Ward is simply a very strong Shield. In still others, a Ward is a Shield set a specific way, or even a different
                  kind of defense. In "Fire and Ice", considering that I wrote the essay in question, I can safely say that the "ward" in question was of the first variety.</p>

                  <p>I couldn't find a construct section, so i figured I should put this question here. Anyway, I was wondering: would it be possible to program a construct with the strength/ complexity of a skateboard or something of the sort? What I mean is, could you program a part of a construct to be "absolute"
                  while having other parts of the construct attached to be moving (like wheels) and still have the construct hold together Hope someone can answer this. Thanks.</p>

                  <p>If you want to actually stand on it, you'll need some pretty serious PK programmed into it. Other than that, a skateboard-type construct is not very difficult.</p>

                  <p>Usually people start off with them 1. because they're pretty simple compared to other skills, and 2. they exercise the foundation of most psionic skills: manipulating, and perceiving psi. Psi balls are a specific type of construct - and constructs are used for all sorts of things. If you want some
                  fun things you can do with your psi balls without learning new skills, check out Rainsong's article: <a href="art-fun-with-psiballs.html"

                  <p>Ok, I am very confident that I can make a psi ball. I have read up in the articles and have confirmed everything that I feel when I make a psi ball is just like you tell us how it would feel.</p>

                  <p>The question I'm asking is can other people feel the psi ball without any training? I have passed a psi ball through a few people and have got no results. But I did found one article on this website stating the opposite (can't seem to find it, I believe it was done by Peebrain. He said his mother
                  was in the kitchen and he flew a psi ball through her, and She reacted by asking if anyone felt something. I believe it went something like that...)</p>

                  <p>Would you have to program the psi ball to catch the person's attention? I don't remember the article well, but it was just something that confused me ever since I started practicing with psi balls.</p>

                  <p>Actually, it was in a car ride. I held the psi ball out with my palm and she put her hand on top of it, and said she felt something (followed by a sigh from my dad, upset that she was encouraging me <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>In the case with my mother, I didn't program the psi ball to do anything other than "be a round psi ball".</p>

                  <p>i have been practicing psi balls for about 3 weeks and i still don't know if i am making them. In other articles and answered questions people see (when makeing a psi ball)small sparkles, lines etc. Though i am always seeing them i have been since 7th grade or erlier, i still don't know or didn't
                  know what to make of them until i read your artilcles, i am hopeing you could possibly provide me with an answer perhaps it is something common to everyone or not. Also when i practice psi balls i feel like a repel between my hands and it reminds me of the times were i used to make objects out of
                  possibly psi when i was younger.<br />
                  please give me your thoughts on this. Thank you.</p>

                  <p>It sounds like you're making them to me. If you can see them, then they are probably there. (Maybe try getting a friend to see them, too?). If you feel repelling, that's usually a good sign. What makes you so unsure that you aren't doing them? You can see and feel them... what else do you want?
