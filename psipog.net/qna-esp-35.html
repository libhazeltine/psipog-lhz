                  <p>Call me crazy, but I really want to get started with telepathy. I've tried most of the exercises on your site, meditation, the whole lot, but I just can't seem to get it going. I can't even ping someone properly. Am I doing something wrong? Or is it just that it will take more time (I've been
                  trying for about a month)? Thank you in advance!</p>

                  <p>Alright, "you're crazy".</p>

                  <p>First, figure out what result you are looking for when you Ping. You say you can't do it properly. Can you do it improperly?</p>

                  <p>Then look at what _exactly_ you are doing. I know how hard it is to describe the actions precisely, but try it anyway. You may well find that, comparing your description with the Ping instructions, that you have missed something crucial. "Short-cuts" are to be left until _after_ you have
                  consistent results, preferably consistently _good_ results.</p>

                  <p>Simple answer: There are lots of topics the regular authors could write about, but haven't...for lack of time, or lack of interest....Some of these topics, the regular authors _have_ written about, but haven't bothered to submit the articles yet. And, some articles that _were_ posted, were removed

                  <p>Hi Peebrain &amp; Pispog crew !<br />
                  Q: I am very good at telepathy, recently I think I'm "borrowing" my freinds intelligence and he is copying my personality. It sounds profound, but is it possible? I think it might be a psi problem. Do you think a sheild will stop it?<br />

                  <p>Is it possible? Yes, it is. However, if you have to wonder whether it "might be a psi problem", the sharing in question might be a more basic situation: people with close emotional bonds often start to think and act in a similar manner, copying mannerisms subconsciously, and engaging in similar
                  (accustomed) patterns of speech and thought.</p>

                  <p>I initially asked this in the chatroom. However those present had no idea, so I'm sending it here.</p>

                  <p>Here is a question. Premonition a psychic fortelling of events? Or the subconcious picking up subtle hints and leaping to a plausible but not always true event?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>A premonition is a "feeling" about something happening in the future, like a hunch. The word usually implies psychic foretelling, but it is often very difficult to distinguish between an an actual psychic premonition, and a nudge from your subconscious as a result of more "mundane" clues picked
                  up, but not consciously recognised. In either case, the subconscious is nudging the conscious mind.</p>

                  <p>Quite often, "premonition" refers to vague foreboding, rather than detailed foretelling. However, the specific usage varies with location and context. In any case, it falls under the category of "Precognition", literally "knowing before".</p>

                  <p>Is there a surefire way to tell if the emotions you are feeling are that of your own or really somebody elses? I was just wondering because my mood changes from when I'm around a lot of people and a small group of people or by myself. Also, can perceiving too many emotions at once cause a
                  headache?</p>

                  <p>A sure fire way? Not really...</p>

                  <p>It's good to know your own personallity in and out. If all else fails, you can use logic and the knowledge of your own personallity to figure out what you are feeling. The most popular way to tell your emotions from someone elses is to note what your emotions are BEFORE receiving the emotions, and
                  then figuring out what has change when you start receiving emotions. If you are constantly bombarded with emotions, I suggest a shield.</p>

                  <p>For your second question: yes, that is possible.</p>

                  <p>Your thoughts are pretty scattered, but I'll try to answer to the bets of my ability.<br />
                  When one has their shields down and is receiving random information from surrounding people (something I don't recommend), I think it feels like an outside source. Not everyone would agree with me. Some people have difficulty distinguishing others' thoughts from their own. These folk tend to get
                  easily overwhelmed and even depressed.<br />
                  I hope you understand that it's not as black and white as you're making it out to be. Distinguishing between other peoples' thoughts or emotions comes with time and practice. I suggest doing this practice with people you trust and are comfortable with, as opposed to trial by fire with the general
                  public.<br />

                  <p>To get around cloaking, I would not think that rp would be the best approach. It you are simply trying to locate the person, map-dowsing would be more efficient. For more strictly psionic activities, track the sig rather than the shield.</p>

                  <p>I recommend that you practice regularly. Get a buddy involved, or come by the chat room if you want to practice. And I recommend all the articles <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Ok, that answer is slightly lame, so I'll give one personal tip (keep in mind, I am a beginner at telepathy, just like you): Turn off your logical mind. Don't try to "figure out" what the answer is. Wait for it to come to you, and if it doesn't come to you, wait longer. Waiting is better than

Depending upon the source (book, site, person), an "aura" might be anything from the electromagnetic field surrounding the body to some kind of "energetic double". Some forms of "aura vision" have been more-or-less disproven.</p>
