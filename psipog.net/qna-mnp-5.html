                  <p>Okey, this is kinda weird, and purely theoretical, but...</p>

                  <p>The current method of Shielding seems highly inefficient to me, and I'm not just talking about bubble shields. Almost every method seems to involve a shield that covers the entire body. Now, I don't claim to be a master psion, but why would you defend the entire body against effects/attacks that
                  likely originate and strike at specific points? Wouldn't it be better to create a psionic disk using the same techniques as a shield and program it to move in front of attacks, spin around you at very high speeds, or use some similar method of getting between a psionic effect and you? This would
                  allow for much less psi per shield and also provide better shield intermixing.</p>

                  <p>Then again, this might be crazy, so can you guys tell me whether or not any of you have tried it and if it sounds viable to you?</p>

                  <p>Thanks,<br />

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I have a question about a shield combination. In the guide in the articles section is recommends to not put the mirror shield under any other shields. But if you were to put it under a marshmallow shield, wouldn't it be beneficial? If anything isn't completely absorbed with the marshmallow shield,
                  it'll bounce of the mirror and have to go through the marshmallow shield again doubling the absorption, right?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>The problem is that the bounce-back will further damage the marshmallow shield. However, you do have a point, if your marshmallow is stronger than your mirror. Either way, if the incoming "energies" get through the outer shield far enough to hit the second one, it has caused damage. Marshmallows
                  can be programmed to "fill in" holes, sort of, so your approach could work. Thanks for bringing this up. It's always good to think through one's shielding strategies.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I have being trying to make Psi Balls unsuccessfully for 3 days before I finally was able to create what I think was a grouping of Psi, yet not quite a ball. My question is whether or not what I felt was Psi. Here is what I did: I visualized energy coming from my energy source (the sun in this
                  case) and sent it to my right hand, after a while I began to feel a tingleing, then I moved my left hand over to feel it, and it felt like there was somthing there, almost like I had a magnet in each and the negative charge was pushing my hands away. I realise that I do not need to see it to know
                  that it is there, but because this is not really a shape more of just a ...puddle of Psi, if you will, does that mean that it is just my mind playing a trick on me?</p>

                  <p>Without verification from a third party (ie, having someone else feel it), you can't be absolutely sure of these. However, your description fits the usual experience of them. It isn't unusual for psiballs to be "not quite balls" at first.</p>

                  <p>At least some of the "experienced" psionicists eventually "will it" to happen without the other procedures. It is a matter of habit and long practice. Even so, when trying something new, they still tend to go step-by-step. Short-hand is for well-practiced stuff.</p>
