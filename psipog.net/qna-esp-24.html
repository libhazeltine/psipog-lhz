                  <p>Hi I am fairly new to this site and I just have to say thanks. I have gone to many others and I could not even get a psi ball to work, but now thanks to this site I can do that and more.</p>

                  <p>Now for my question!</p>

                  <p>Okay I am not sure wether this is RP, RV, or OBE.</p>

                  <p>I concentrate on my awarness and sortof shape it into a humanoid form with a tail instead of legs. Then since that is my awarness I notice things as if it was my physical body. I also use this to go into the future. So can anyone tell me what it is?</p>

                  <p>Thanks in advanced!</p>

                  <p>Yes, to both questions. Other people have also done it. Generally speaking, waking someone in this manner either annoys them or frightens them, depending on their prior experience with telepathy.</p>

                  <p>I wonder about "destiny", like some people are known clairvoyant, they've proven them selves more then enough, but is this a proof for destiny? like if I suddenly have a dream of an event, and that event happens exactly like I dreamt it a week later, same people there, same weather, the people
                  talk about exactly the same subjects of what I dreamt they would talk about.<br />
                  Does this mean that we can't do anything about our future?<br />
                  it's not like this concerns me, I just want to see what I might get as an answer.<br />
                  I find it very funny to be reading minds ^^ I think of exactly what the persons mind I'm reading is thinking and saying =) is there anything more "challanging" I could try when practicing TP? thank you for your time</p>

                  <p>I was going to practice empathy, but then I saw the warnings.<br />
                  1. is it possible to be overrun with the emotions of people if you can't shield properly?<br />
                  and<br />
                  2. If you train enough with empathy is it possible to focus on one person without having to create a shield?</p>

                  <p>1) Yes. It is less likely in the case of someone learning from scratch, but still a risk. The "better at it" you get, the higher is the risk.</p>

                  <p>2) Focusing on one person is a matter of skill, and not very much skill, at that. In other words, yes, it can be done. The Shield in question would be to keep from being flooded by other input. At a crowded party with a lot of noise, it is still possible to focus in on what one person is saying,
                  but the rest of the noise is still there. Roughly the same situation here.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>1)I was wondering if there are any general rules of edicate for telepaths.<br />
                  I have read many of the articles and more and more of he q&amp;a and many times there is mention of things bordering on combat and thimgs that are starting combat. I was wondering what kind of things might be considered rude or a challenge. As I practice and mess around with psychic skills I'd rather
                  not anger a skilled psion.<br />
                  2)I was also wondering if, as my awareness and sensitivity increases is it easy to tell a psion from a non? If so how? Also if so, is there a way to program your shields to make you "appear" to be a non?</p>
               </div>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1) There are no absolutely-established rules of etiquette, which apply everywhere, no. However, if you want to avoid ticking off other psionicists, ask permission before doing anything with or to them, including scans. Beginners' scans often feel quite rough, for one thing, and in any case, such
                  "reconnaisance" is sometimes considered a prelude to assault. Any close telepathic contact is intimate in nature, and such contact can be similar to rape in its effects on an unconsenting subject. (Loud broadcasting and the like is disconcerting to "regular folk" and annoying to other psionicists,
                  but tends not to be viewed quite so dimly as telepathic scans, probes, and so on).</p>

                  <p><br />
                  2) This one qwould depend on your definition of "non". If you are using it in the Psion Guild's manner (local usage was borrowed, very loosely, from there), then it is supposed to be possible to detect differences in "tone" between "nons" and the other sorts of folk. I, personally, cannot do this
                  with anything remotely resembling accuracy, nor can I vouch for the accuracy of anyone else in this question.</p>

                  <p>If you simply mean "someone who doesn't do psionics", then looking at their field will _often_ --not always!-- tell you. Best way to learn, is to look at folks's fields (with permission, see above), and compare appearance/sound/feel.</p>

                  <p>Of course, the easiest way to determine whether or not someone is an active psionicist is to watch them "do" something. ;)</p>

                  <p>It is possible to make your field look like that of an "inactive, not-psionic" type of person. For a lot of folk, dropping their Shields, dirtying up the field outline, and letting a few months' worth of debris accumulate will do the job. For other folk, careful Shielding in a not-reflective mode,
                  and covering the shield with uncleaned stray "psistuff" and assorted debris (think "hermit crab") can get the job done. Some folks' fields are difficult to conceal.</p>

                  <p>Don't worry so much about getting your body to lose awareness. Choose target sites that you have not seen, but can get verification of details about. For example, RP to a museum which you have not visited, and _then_ either visit it or check out their website to check your accuracy. If it is
                  accurate, then why worry if it is "imagination". If it isn't accurate, then at least you know where you stand, and have a place to work from.</p>
