                  <p>The answer to this question depends rather heavily on whether or not you have any ability with Empathy. If you do, you are likely to find practicing it without Shields, in a room full of people, to be intensely unpleasant.</p>

                  <p>Im not sure if this is the place to ask about this or not but here goes.<br />
                  I was reading your Communicating with your Subconcious(sp) arctical for the....hum....5th time and i never understood it. But i recently read EVERY word and found near the bottem it talking about ow you can program it to wake you up at a certin time. I have been doing that for awhile now. What i do
                  is think of the time i want to wake up, picture it on an anologe clock and then picture it on a digital clock, and finaly picture myself waking up at that time and cecking the clock to see that it is the time i wanted. And not that im braging but everytime ihave done this i have woek up b/w 10min
                  bfore the time, at the time, or 10min after. Am i doing this right? and if i am is this a simple way or a good way for everything to talk to the subconcious?<br />
                  Thanks ahead of time and if you dont understand ill try to rephrase.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>A really wierd thing happened to me at a gig one night and to tell you the truth it really freaked me out. My friend was all upset and stuff cause his girlfriend broke up with him so i wen't out to the alley with him to have a cigarette and he was crying. I tried to bond with him and kept sayin i
                  know how it feels and all of a sudden i started to feel very strange. I looked around me and i started feeling what everyone else felt. Anyone i looked at it was all just coming in and i can't explain it. Sadness, love, adrenaline all of it. I wouldn't stop and i ran out but i couldn't stop it so
                  after about 10 mins i remembered the article on shielding and i tried it but it didn't work so i just kept trying it and eventually it worked. Could you please tell me what happend to me cause it still really freaks me out even now. It hasn't happened since but i can still practice empathy on people
                  but i really want to know what happened to me that night. Do you know what this could be?</p>

                  <p>Actually, this is not as uncommon of an occurence as you may think it is. In fact, we even have a name for it here. We call it "telepathic (or empathic) overload)". This is defined as when you are being bombarded with the thoughts (or emotions) of those around you to the point where it is
                  difficult to feel your own thoughts/emotions. Of course, the best way to stop this is to get fairly good at shielding, or leaving the room (both you did, wise choices).<br />
                  Unfortuneately, if you practice empathy of telepathy, this will occasionally happen, just as if you practice telekinetics, you will sometimes experience geisting (uncontrollable telkinetic bursts) unless you shield constantly. As Sean (peebrain) says, the benefits of using these abilities far
                  outweight the risks and inconviences, so instead of being discouraged about your burst, be encouraged that you are getting better. And, of course, practice shielding when you are in larger crowds now ;)</p>

                  <p>my girlfriend seems to be fairly strong at telepathy, and hates hearing peoples thoughts, but ive tried telling her how to sheild,(she NEVER listens to me when i explain it) and tried sending her to this site, she doesnt get it, so i tried sheilding her but all my constructs drain energy so it
                  ends up worse than before, finally i thought that if it was made of her energy the problem might go away, is there some way i can use her energy to make the sheild?</p>

                  <p>The fact of the matter is that 'yes', it would help her. However, you should not be shielding someone who does not want to be shielded. If she has so much as told you that she doesn't want to be shielded, then it is not your responsibility to do so (and indeed, doing so can be construed as an
                  attack, although probably not in this case). As a general rule verbal guidance works occasionally, but the decision is up to her.</p>

                  <p>Different people shield differently, and some people can shield naturally as well. There is almost no limit on the variations of shields/fields you will find as you scan them, so try to keep an open mind about what you see. You say that you just felt *nothing*. Perhaps this is a shield to conceal
                  them, or hide them from your physics probes. Perhaps it was a shield designed to stop your probe from sending back information. The easiest way to know is to ask. The second easiest way to know is to take guesses on its nature, and try different kinds of probing to gather more information.</p>
