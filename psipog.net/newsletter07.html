PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance

Newsletter #7, for December 7th, 2004

"It is better to realize mind than body. When the mind is
realized, one need not worry about body. When mind and body
become one, the man is free."
- Mumon


Dear PsiPog Users,

First things first: PsiPog.net has been updated! The new design
is up and running, and seems to be doing pretty good. I don't
have the Search feature done yet, but hopefully I'll get that
online soon. I've also added those articles I talked about:

Annie's Healing Manual:
art-outline-to-shielding.html163

My Telepathy Lecture/Practice:
art-outline-to-shielding.html162

I have a few more articles floating around that I need to go
over, and a few that I want to write myself... but that might not
happen for a little while.

One more reminder: send all your comments, questions, suggestions
and anything else you think is cool to: newsletter@psipog.net
Don't be shy! :-P

=================================================================

Matthew asks:
"How do you use psi to health yourself of any ordinary sickness?
Eg. cold, flu, fever etc."

My comments: Since I'm not the brightest guy to ask about
healing, I pasted the question to annie, and this is what she
replied with:

- - - - -

This is a great question as we in the northern hemisphere enter
into the "wheasy sneezy season". I, however, have some bad news
for all of you. There is no cure for the common cold. I'll give
you a moment to digest that bad news.

Cure or not, there are things we can all do using psionics and
other homeopathic methods to alleviate some of the more annoying
and painful symptoms of the common cold and flu. As always, psi
is awesome for healing, but doctors are better. If you have any
preexisting conditions, or your symptoms don't go away in a
reasonable time frame, SEE YOUR DOCTOR.

Reducing your fever should be your first step if you have one.
While a fever is the body's natural reaction for healing
infection or virus, it also causes most of the uncomfortable side
effects of said. This is simple Bio-PK. Relax. Breathe. Get
into a state of comfort and rest. Slow down your heart. Follow
your breath. Sense and feel your blood - how it moves, it's
warmth, what the current task is. Focus on the affected areas of
the virus or infection. Say to yourself, inside your head our
aloud, "It is time to cool down. It is time for each of my
organs and for my blood to relax, to cool off, to be at its most
optimum for the most beneficial healing of my body." Visualize
if you want. Make something up that works for you. Cool breeze,
a shot of ice water through the veins, whatever. See my other
healing articles for tips on healing headaches, stiff backs and
necks, and other cold/flu symptoms. Keep up the vitamins and
fluids. Your multivitamin should include high doses of A, C, and
E. If you have an iron supplement around the house, that will
help too. And as always, water water water!

"Hey there,

I just watched an interesting video about remote viewing, there
is an organization called Psi-Tech which teaches remote viewing.
I found the video from UPN news on their website
(http://www.psitech.net/) which gives a live demonstration of
remote viewing. They obviously make quite a bit of money as their
website is pretty stylish heh. Heres the link to the realmedia
video:

http://www.psitech.net/media/trvdemo_local.rm "

My comments: Ya, that video is sweet :-). Very cool.

=================================================================

One more quick question, then we'll call it a newsletter.
Yellowjacket asks:

"Can you form a psi-ball into a sword?"

My comments: Sure... but then it wouldn't be a psi-ball. It
would be a psi-sword :-P. Try it and see how well you can make
a psi-sword, and see how well you can keep it together. You can
do it by changing your visualization, or just by slightly
altering your normal psi-ball making procedure that you're used
to using.

=================================================================

Alrighty then... Rememeber: e-mail me some cool things to put in
the next newsletter! It makes it a lot easier on me so I don't
have to think of something new all the time :-P. Thanks for
everyone who contributed this week - I'll see you on the 21st!

Hope everyone had a Happy Thanksgiving, and I hope everyone's
Christmas and New Years is super spectacular as well :-P.
