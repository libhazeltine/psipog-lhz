                  <p>I think I misread your first question (I thought you were referring to telekinesis for some reason). You want your subconscious to take over... what? Your mind? Your body? Psionics? What is your goal, and what have you been trying for 5 months to achieve your goal?</p>

                  <p>Hi, I'm just curious -- have any of you guys successfully used Pyrokinesis? I need more confidence, and though I'm trying my darndest to instill it in myself, there just isn't a lot of information around about it. I want to focus on this skill and this skill solely just like Not_Important did for
                  9 months with TK, and develop it. There is great good that can be done with such a skill. Please tell me any progress that any of you may have made. Thanks a lot, and thank you very much for providing such an EXCELLENT resource for Psionics. Take it easy.</p>

                  <p>Where are the videos and the pictures? I don't mean to sound like a non-believer because I believe whole heartedly in psychic abilities, but where is the proof? There are millions of people who claim that they can suck the energy out of people (psi vampires), create psi-balls, accomplish
                  telekinesis and other forms of kinesis, instant psychic healing, but not a single instance has been video taped even by the people who claim that they can do it willingly. Wiccans especially. Video and pictures should be possible since most involve energy. I'd especially expect a movie of somebody
                  making a psiball considering how there are so many wiccans talking about how they can create them all willy-nilly. Such phenomena should not be considered as such since so many people claim that they are doing it. Capturing it on video should be possible given that they are visible by human eyes and
                  they are composed of visible energy. It would be just like taking a picture of the sun, or a lightbulb.</p>

                  <p>Two-part answer:<br />
                  1) There are video-recordings made in formal experiments, and many such _have_ been made. Your basic premise is false. The fact that you have not seen any such video does _not_ mean that they do not exist.<br />
                  2) Video-recordings are not proof. They are merely documentation. Videos are too easy to tamper with, as are still photographs, to be proof of anything other than the ability to make the video or photograph itself.</p>

                  And I was thinking:"Oh, I think Ill try to se if I can press some weight on it with my PSI"<br />
                  Well, It did not work. However, some day later, I was down there again, and i saw a sign on it:"Out of order"</p>

                  <p>Could it have anyhting to do what I did to it? Like, electro disturbance or something?</p>

                  <p>Me personally? I don't meditate at all before moving the psi-wheel. Meditation isn't required... think of it like this: If you were lifting weights and exercising, you don't have to eat perfectly to get in shape. It will definitly help, but you don't have to. Meditation is like that.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Messing about with electronics, and messing about with electrical objects (which is a rather broader category) by means of psionics is part of psychokinesis. Telekinesis is the same thing as psychokinesis. Therefore, to say that a form of pk is more dangerous than pk itself is invalid.</p>

                  <p>That said, I personally have both messed with electronics and witnessed others doing so....and psychokinetically messing up other sorts of electrical objects such as lightbulbs is relatively common.</p>

                  <p>These effects include blowing up lightbulbs, causing lights and screens to flicker, erasing the data on computer disks, interfering with the data on the harddrive, and affecting the function of cd and cassette players.</p>
