               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I am 33 y/o--my name is Stephen.</p>

                  <p>Around 6 months, 13 days ago (exactly) I had a neighbor &amp; his boyfriend (gay couple) unexpectedly start a conversation using telepathy. This "conversation" was exactly as if we ALL THREE were on a "phone chat" line.</p>

                  <p>I have always noticed being able to "scan" people throughout my life and finish their sentences from time to time. Most times it was in some type of heated or intense conversation and finishing the other person's sentence for them got me in trouble.</p>

                  <p>Going back to what I was saying about my neighbors...<br />
                  They never physically introduced themselves to me and at this point in time we are ALL THREE LINKED together. Non-stop---while dreaming and awake. To this day, I am at the point of trying something drastic to do these things:</p>

                  <p>#1 Meet them and get and exact response to all of their insults &amp; ridicule they have put me through<br />
                  #2 Try to break this link</p>

                  <p>Unfortuneately this has cost me much time due to loss of income--trying to figure out who was communicating with me and also both neighbors have moved. I have travelled approx. 300+ miles from the link location just to try and break it--but of course--To NO AVAIL.</p>

                  <p>I have both people's names who are linked to me and am considering going to the CIA for further help with this matter as it seems I am a strong remote viewer. Lie detector tests will prove everything that I say to be true.</p>

                  <p>Any suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated. I have always been aware of ESP but in NO WAY imagined it to be as clear and precise (more precise most times) than speaking in person--telepathy to me is a breach of privacy and because to the 2 people who linked to me being "Scared, evasive, and
                  rude"---it has become a very big problem.</p>

                  <p>Please help if possible.</p>

                  <p>Thanks.</p>

                  <p>Hopefully you have taken the time to read some articles. If not, obviously read the ones on telepathy, empathy, and especially linking.</p>

                  <p>first - your link will not dissolve with time, nor with distance, so you personally have to do something about it (you can get others to help when you do, but it can result in backfire so I advise against it).</p>

                  <p>attempt to establish and break a link with several people (not neccessarily get any information, just practice). After you have some comfort level in breaking links that are not established as well, you can move on to this link.</p>

                  <p>Sit somewhere quiet. Now, just try to block all thoughts from your mind. Allow yourself to think of nothing (meditation, trance, just relaxing, whatever works for you). You say that you have scanned before, so take a mental step back and try to scan yourself. Look for the link that you have with
                  these two people.</p>

                  <p>Now, you should be primed for an action and can 'see' the link through your scanning. Picture it (as vividly as possible) dissolving or melting away. Do this repeatedly (until you feel that it is time to quit), alternate forms of link dissolving are visualizations of scissors, sudden severing,
                  using energy to blobk and dissolve it, or just dissappearing; all coupled with a mental sense of quietness and not receiving any infomation from this link.</p>

                  <p>At this point you should be completely separate from them, if not, try the same exercise again. If this ios not working, seek professional help.</p>

                  <p>Hope this helps and Good Luck.<br />

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>As far as accidentally learning telepathy, many of the people that find themselves with TP/EP find that they have eigther a) trained it or b) just started feeling the effects one day. It is very possible for an ability such as this to randomly crop up. As far as whther you can be harmed if
                  unshielded, you can. Please read the articles on shielding for more info. on this subject.</p>

                  <p>I have become very skilled in psychometry.<br />
                  To make sure my subconscious was not tracking cards, I used a random number generator, and was unable to guess the number. I thought maybe I was just tracking the cards, so I got a friend to mix up my cards. I was able to do it. So maybe psychometry does not work on machines that use pixels? Also,
                  how does Micro-TK influence RNG's? That seems more like remote electron tampering.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Going from the bottom first. As far as I have seen, no one is exactly sure how microPK works. Being able to read cards vs. predicting numbers is actually not all that uncommon of a problem. some of the people that I have talked to about this related it to not being able to 'see' them as well. For
                  me personally, when I can hold te card in my hand, I get predict more accurately than when I am just looking at a computer screen (I am not that good at the Psiarcade games like that).<br />
                  One of the the things that I found that does help is to run my mouse of the object an see what I can bring up.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>this is how it feels to me: Close your eyes. Now, think about how the room around you feels. It isn't exactly as if you have a third eye somewhere and can perceive everything that is going on. However, it is not like you are completely blind, you still have your "sensitivity" sense about you, and
                  can get a good idea on your surroundings from that (at least for me). So in answer;<br />
                  feels normal, more like a sense, "seeing" is a relative term, more of a perception or awareness.</p>

                  <p>When I was younger, I could "smell" pain (It didn't smell like anything else, it's very hard to describe). However, as I aged, the ability became less accurate and eventually stopped altogether. However, recently it has been happening again. It's not as accurate as when I was young, but I think it
                  is improving. Could I have had Empathy/Telepathy back then that has been reawakened by my practicing psionics?</p>

                  <p>Yes, by definition, it is a telepathic influence over other's. Whatever you are projecting is not actually there, but is in the mind of the person that you are projecting to.</p>

                  <p>Instead of focusing on what you are trying to see, try to focus on what is there now. I know that it is difficult to keep objectivity. One of the exercises that I use to try to keep myself from doing the same thing (which is close to the AOL effect) is to mentally think of everything as black (or
                  blue) until I actually sense what is there.</p>
