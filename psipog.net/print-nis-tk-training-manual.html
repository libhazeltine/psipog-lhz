   <p><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>

   <p>Once again I speak to you guys about Telekinesis / Psychokinesis. In this manual I'll try to be more specific and explain my method to do TK, as easily understandable as possible.</p>

   <p>Some of you might know that I have a TK club in my school and I am proud to say that many of my students progressed a lot since we started to have the meetings. So basically you have very good chances, too. TK can be taught and it can be learned. The only serious difficulty I think is that you mostly don't know
   anyone who could show you how TK is done. I personally know a girl who could do TK almost instantly after having seen it in action in one of our meetings. Later she had problems like everyone else, too, but that's not the point. The point is that sometimes people can repeat it instantly if they see it. Don't ask me
   why. I don't know.</p>

   <p>As I said, you have very good chances... Ahemm, let me put it this way: You can do it. And you will do it. The effort is the key. The result is proportional to the effort you invest. But before I start to explain my method to "perform" TK, I'd like to express some theories that in one way or another might
   explain how TK itself works. I might be wrong and you are welcome to prove such.</p>

   <p>I personally have never seen any 100% evidence that confirms that there is an invisible substance created by the nerves called "psi". And I doubt that this substance is responsible for telekinesis as well as for telepathy &amp; co. And since we are the people who do the research, I don't think it's good to rely
   on the legends, or facts, that "The Russians" or "The CIA" might have done some kind of experiments that prove the whole "psi" thing.</p>

   <p>But anyway, the "how" or "why" telekinesis works does not affect your practice in any way. I just think that it might help you to understand my method and therefore get a good basis to start with.</p>

   <p><b><u>Theories &amp; Thoughts</u></b></p>

   <p>Let's start with the most simple. I don't think it's a big secret and probably every physics teacher will confirm that we all are made of the same stuff: atoms. And all atoms are made of energy. They only differ from each other in size. So basically everything around us and we ourselves are pure energy. You can
   imagine the whole universe as a lake of energy and yourself as a drop of water in it. But how can you distinguish where that drop starts and where it ends? You are right. You can't. Separation is just an illusion. The computer in front of you is a part of your own energy field as well as you are a part of its
   energy field. You don't end at your skin. And this leads us to the conclusion that you are one with all the things around you (Screams of horror <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile"
        class="smileyImg" />).</p>

   <p>Separation is a useful illusion. Mankind would never progress if we thought that one being is a part of another being and we all are one. That would be a paradox for the competition between the human beings and therefore a break for the whole evolution.</p>

   <p>In many cases it's very useful to think about objects as separate things. In other cases, like in telekinesis, it's necessary to keep in mind that the psiwheel in front of you lies in your own energy field and therefore it can be affected by your energy. You don't believe it? Now touch that psiwheel with your
   finger. Did it move? Of course it did, because you used your energy in form of atoms of your finger to accelerate the molecules of the paper. Clever, huh?</p>

   <p>But even if you don't use your finger, it's possible through some mental processes to alter the state of your energy field and therefore to influence the paper on pin that lies inside of this field. It's possible to make objects move without direct physical contact. But at the end of the day it's still being
   affected by physical forces. They are just not present as the physical matter, atoms. These forces are based only on the energy. Atoms, the matter, are just a state of the energy, according to my school's technical library. Now that only means that energy doesn't have to be "visible" or "touchable" and it means
   that it's not only inside of yourself, but also lies around yourself.</p>

   <p>Did you ever think why gravitation exists? Nobody can explain why two objects attract each other. Think about it. According to astrophysics, even an object that lies thousands of light years away from you influences you in a very small way with its gravitational field. A gravitational field is an example of an
   energy field that never fades. It gets weaker but it never disappears completely. And that's another important principle: The Chaos Theory. The world is based on causes and consequences.</p>

   <p>You can find a math book about the Chaos Theory. The Chaos Theory says that no matter how small the cause may be, it will affect the whole system, the whole universe. Imagine a butterfly flying somewhere over India. The theory says that even this small movement may and does influence in a very small way the
   weather in United States. No matter what you do and how small and unimportant your actual actions are, they do change the whole universe. No matter how small the mental process in your head might seem, it does alter, in one way or another, the paper on pin in front of you.</p>

   <p>The stronger that mental process is the more effect you'll see.</p>

   <p>So how can a simple mental process, twitches of the nervous system, be strong enough to move an object outside the physical body?</p>

   <p>I can't answer that question. But if you think for example about the following situation it might show you a possible answer.</p>

   <p>Imagine yourself meditating and suddenly something explodes in front of your window. In the same moment your meditation is over. You get up and run away to see what's going on. It happened because the energy provided by the explosion was stronger than the energy invested in your meditation.</p>

   <p>Now imagine yourself meditating very deeply. Someone outside calls your name, but you don't realize it. Your body still hears it physically, but you don't realize it and keep meditating. This time the energy invested in your meditation was stronger than the energy used to call your name.</p>

   <p>Maybe it's just a crappy theory, but I'm 100% sure it's true. Energy flows where attention goes. Just think of playing pool / billiards. You shoot one of those balls and you miss. Now if you pay your whole attention and even visualize it happening you are most likely to succeed.</p>

   <p>The more attention and concentration you put forth, the more energy is provided to move the object in front of you.</p>

   <p><b><u>Step 1: Prepare yourself</u></b></p>

   <p>Before you try to do TK it's very important to have your mind clear. Think about it as a computer. Your mind is the RAM memory. Telekinesis requires 100% of this RAM. Now if your mind is full with other stuff, like the party tomorrow afternoon <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile"
        class="smileyImg" />, you can't provide the whole memory, which means you can't pay the whole attention you have. And if you have read the theories you know how important it is.</p>

   <p>Energy flows where attention goes. Just remember it for now. You don't have enough power if there are other things in your mind.</p>

   <p>But how exactly do you calm down, clear your mind and raise your concentration / attention / focus level at the same time? You guessed it: meditation. I suggest the meditation techniques which are more passive and don't require much brain activity. An example is the candle method. You don't even really need a
   candle, only a point somewhere that is brighter than the environment. For example, a clear coin reflecting the sun's light. You sit down, take few deep breaths and watch it. Don't control your eyes; allow them to lose their focus. The bright point is relaxing for your subconscious. Don't try to think just watch.
   With some practice you'll just forget about everything around you, and lose yourself. The breathing will become deeper, the mind clear and your whole state calmed.</p>

   <p>Another good method is where you concentrate on your deep, slow breathing. This one seems more difficult to me. It's mostly done with closed eyes and the mind starts to wander easily if your eyes are closed.</p>

   <p>No matter which meditation method you practice, it'll help you to get the right state of mind and the basics needed for telekinesis. I suggest you meditate 20-30 minutes before you start.</p>

   <p>By the way, when you practice telekinesis it's very important not to drain yourself. A drained mind tends to lead to depression &amp; frustration. And if you are frustrated, you have zero chances to move it, believe me. Besides it gives your subconscious a feeling of being a loser, which means you'll not get
   much co-operation from your inner self. Therefore, it's important that you don't train more than 1 hour in one sitting. I suggest 30-40 minutes. If you are a wild one, you can practice 40 minutes in the morning and another 40 in the evening <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile"
        class="smileyImg" />.</p>

   <p>Having established the times when you want to practice, it's time to prepare the instrument you want to practice with. There are many possibilities like keys on strings or needles floating on the water's surface. I recommend you take the most popular one: the psiwheel / paper on pin. But I suggest you to take
   aluminum foil instead of normal paper. You have to be careful making it, one wrong movement and you have a hole inside of the foil <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile"
        class="smileyImg" /> (laughter). Take a piece of 1.5-2.0 cm (inches?). This is optimal for the psiwheel and extremely easy to move. The friction between the aluminum surface and the metal pin is less than paper's friction.</p>

   <p>Having finished to meditate and having prepared your psiwheel, it's time to start <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile"
        class="smileyImg" />.</p>

   <p><b><u>Step 2: Become one <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile"
        class="smileyImg" /></u></b></p>

   <p>As the next step you basically have to realize the first principle and apply it. Remember: there is no separation between you and the psiwheel. It lies inside of your capacity field like your fingers or any other part of your body. What you do is to take few deep breaths and focus on the object.</p>

   <p>You tell yourself that the psiwheel is a part of you. Try to find a link between you and the psiwheel. Try to feel what it is like to be the psiwheel (Laughter in the auditorium)... I'm dead serious. Try to see all the little features the psiwheel has. Try to remember how the psiwheel moves and define it as your
   own movement... Try to hear the sounds it may produce. Try to see it in your head from different viewpoints, without actually moving yourself. Try to sense its surface as you sense the surface of your skin...</p>

   <p>It's difficult to explain, but all those things together, when you focus hard enough, give you (after some time) a strong feeling of the object, the psiwheel. Even a feeling of power may overwhelm you. A feeling where you are 100% sure you can influence it. A feeling where you really feel that you are one with
   it <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile"
        class="smileyImg" />. A feeling that becomes stronger and more solid as you keep practicing.</p>

   <p>After some time it'll become relatively easy to "sense" the objects you concentrate on. You'll see a tree and get an instant inner feeling of it. You'll get better at it every time you try it.</p>

   <p>There might even come a point where you can feel your whole surroundings, your environment, at the same time. Some time ago I saw a TV report about a group in Germany where a professor of anthropology teaches the people to "see" without using their eyes. His students can actually see in a 360-degree perspective
   and even read books without opening their eyes.</p>

   <p>Now when you get a good, stable, strong feeling of the psiwheel, then you have established something I call energy link between the object and yourself. If the link is weak or relatively unstable it'll be more difficult to make the psiwheel spin later.</p>

   <p><b><u>Step 3: Move it</u></b></p>

   <p>Now you have established a good energy link. You can feel the object. You are one with it <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile"
        class="smileyImg" />. At this point, as mentioned earlier, you might notice a strong feeling of power over the psiwheel. It's like if you look at your hand and are sure that the next moment you are going to move it. This might cause even random reactions of your body: you try to move the psiwheel and suddenly
        your hand moves forward. When these random movements happen, you just have to relax and try to "sense" the object better. They happen only because you are too excited and you have to calm down.</p>

   <p>Don't worry about the need to move the psiwheel. It's not exactly like moving your arm where you have to urge yourself. Give yourself the time and make sure your mind is clear. Do not worry, your body knows about your purposes. And you'll move the object as soon as you are ready for it. In some way it's like
   surfing, you do your best and wait for the wave to catch it.</p>

   <p>When the moment comes the psiwheel will start to spin and you'll know you're moving it.</p>

   <p>Moving something with your mind (telekinesis) gives you a strange feeling that is hard to define. How is it moved? The catchy phrase "Just do it," explains a lot but also nothing at the same time.</p>

   <p>If I analyze the feeling I can only find an analogue in a strong feeling of confidence. Remember the last time you were shooting baskets? The feeling when you knew you weren't going to miss even before you threw the ball? Or take a calculator and press "2" "+" "2". Do you have confidence about the result when
   you press "="? That might be a cheap analogy, but in some way it's a unique thing I can think of.</p>

   <p>You can also say it's like moving your arms, but at the same time it doesn't feel completely like that, since there are no muscles between you and the psiwheel.</p>

   <p>My suggestion is: you try it out yourself <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile"
        class="smileyImg" />.</p>

   <p>So when you get the feeling of the object, don't urge yourself and keep in mind your objective. Your inner self (subconscious) knows the aim and will try everything possible to move the psiwheel as your attention increases.</p>

   <p>The time will come and that little thingy will start to spin <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile"
        class="smileyImg" />.</p>

   <p><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>

   <p>Telekinesis is something you can't really use in your life. But it's a very interesting thing to play with or just to amaze your friends <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile"
        class="smileyImg" />. When you start practicing the whole process can take from few days to many months. It's very different for each person. I don't want to repeat the same words you've heard thousands of times about how important it is to keep practicing. You just have to go on, buddy. Look at it as if you
        didn't have another alternative <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile"
        class="smileyImg" />.</p>

   <p>As for me, I take my retirement <img src="smile.gif"
        width="12"
        height="12"
        border="0"
        alt="Smile"
        class="smileyImg" />. If you have any questions, they'll be officially answered in 12 months when the next article might be published (snicker in the audience) <img src="smile.gif"

        class="smileyImg" />.</p>

   <p>Or just send me an e-mail and I'll try my best to answer it.</p>

   <p>That's all folks! It's 4:20am here and I'm glad I've finished this manual. I had to cut over 2000 words and many unnecessary lyrics, hehe... Ideas were born... Words were written... It's time for me to rest.</p>

   <p>My mind fades... Memories alter... Dreams come true...</p>

   <p>(BIG Applause)</p>
