                  <p>hi, a couple days ago i walked into my bathroom and i turned on the light and both the light bulbs blew at exactly the same time. this has happened to me several times over the last few years. is there anyway to prevent this without shielding? i'm a noob and can't quite shield yet.</p>

                  <p>First of all, you might want to get the wiring checked, if the bulbs are burning out more than they should. The quality and type of bulb are other obvious factors. For example, there are light bulbs designed to better withstand power-surges and brown-outs "out in the country", than the standard
                  (and usually cheaper) city bulbs. Hardware stores generally can get both kinds. You might also consider that you changed the bulbs at the same time, and they would have approximately the same "lifespan".</p>

                  <p>in the media section, there are pictures of constructs. i have webcam, a dark room <img src="smile.gif"

                       class="smileyImg" />, and a recording program for my webcam. i made a construct in the view of the cam while recording, but i didnt really se anything. is there something special i have to do to the camera/program(besides "enhancing," i did that, just a blank screen), or do i have to flare
                       (which i have not done successfully yet, workin on it <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Usually, the construct needs to be flared, for it to show up on film reliably. Not always, but usually. The unflared constructs show up sometimes, but not in any sort of predictable pattern, as far as I can tell.</p>

                  <p>That isn't odd at all; it's entirely normal. There are lots of focusing exercises. One of them is to build a picture in your mind. Start with a basic picture, and add details and background, and movement.</p>

                  <p>Greetings anomalies.</p>

                  <p>My name is PJ. I'm the guy who submits hypotheses in the science section over at ppsociety.com for how PK might operate.</p>

                  <p>I understand you guys have been having trouble with the Randi squad from what they've been saying at their forums as of recently. Most likely in the near future, many of them might realize the PK stuff here isn't fake after all, and will thus be chanting the usual "battle cry" of all those
                  individuals over there afraid of anything modern-day established physics states shouldn't exist... "How come they don't apply for Randi's million? See! They're all fakers!"</p>

                  <p>Well I just stumbled across something on the net that puts Randi's paranormal challenge into question. Take a look at these:</p>

                     target="_blank">http://www.survivalafterdeath.org/articles/keen/jamesrandi.htm</a></p>

                  <p>I myself thought Randi's challenge was legitimate. Now I'm convinced, after reading this, that RANDI has been the real charlatan after all. Let me know what you think.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Thanks for sharing that. Generally, such evidence as I have seen tends to speak against Randi as far as his use of the scientific method is concerned. Also, he has refused folks who have agreed to the terms of his test. (One of the folks in question was a friend of mine.)</p>

                  <p>I am in favour of skepticism. The short version of skepticism is that it is considered impossible to know anything for certain. Basically, there is always the possiblity of aquiring more data which might refute current "knowledge".</p>

                  <p>Pseudo-skeptics with agendas to prove their case are something else again.</p>

                  <p>Is it right to play with force? Do you know how strong it can be?! when I started doing this (lets call it psi) I've never heard about psi or any thing like this, but I was able to do everything till "Psychkinesis" (from book "The Psion's Handbook") and some times OBEs (I did not control it). How?
                  Is it normal here?</p>

                  <p>everyone has these abilities, but most do not train them, or attempt to use them (under normal circumstances). Yes, it is fine to 'play' with energy, no we do not know how strong (speaking of Telekinesis) it can get, but the vast majority of the time it is not strong enough to (warrant a ?!) pose
                  a large threat.</p>

                  <p>So, here's my question. I want to learn the following skills: pretty much all forms of Psychokinesis, Telepathy,and Empathy/Healing. However, I don't really want to learn Constructs (other than shields, which I realize I need for Telepathy and Empathy). So, do I need to learn Constructs besides
                  shields so that I can do the above listed things? If there are any, please specify what they are and a place that I can learn them. Thanks for your time.<br />

For one thing, don't worry about it if thoughts wonder through your head, whether the thoughts are along the lines of "beep beep beep" or "Shouting angers the filet-o-fish" or "Professor Hardrup's theory about existentialism seems to lack substance when
                  considered from the point of view of a European Swallow." Let the thoughts wander through, and just ignore them.</p>
