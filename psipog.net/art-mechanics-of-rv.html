         <p><strong>(I must say most everything here is based on my understanding of psychology and science, and while the concepts I will use here are proven, it makes no validation towards my claims, and therefore you must make the decision to accept or deny them.)</strong></p>

         <p>Remote viewing....What a great skill to have, but what good is a skill if we don't the way it works, which not only hinders the advancing of it, but adds to the confusion when something goes wrong that seemingly we can't describe?</p>

         <p>When you look at Remote viewing, normally from the perspective of a remote viewer, they will acclaim the information simply pops into their mind. This claim compares greatly to Telepathy, but differ in information. The reason for this will be explained a bit later in the article, but for now let's continue
         on with what you are here for.</p>

         <p>First off, depending on the technique you use, CRV or ARV, the sender must establish a signal line into the infamous "Matrix". This is done in CRV by assigning something coordinates, whether it be mentally or physically, and in ARV by simply acknowledging what you need to gain more information on. Then it
         is up to the receiver to connect to the "Matrix" in search of the signal line of the object. Most will find this much easier with coordinates, because coordinates are more definite then going out digging the right link to say a shoe, as there are billions of shoes, but maybe only a few objects with the exact
         coordinates of the object you are seeking. Once connected, the info about the object just seems to flow from nowhere into your mind. But there has to be more it than this right?</p>

         <p>Let's explain, before delving into the more physical matters, what the "Matrix" is. As said in the other articles, it is the Unonscious characteristic of matter, that gives it its natural disposition. It is the reason atoms only spin in one direction, the reason opposites attract, and the reason atoms seek
         balance through gaining and losing electrons. You can say that they are made up of more particles that controls them, but what controls the other particles? The fact is, the Unconscious does in its ever present set ways. So when dealing with matter, you are dealing with something much deeper and larger. And
         the fact that the Unconscious controls each and every part of matter to an extent, makes its location Universal, much like the big blob of signal lines and connections described in the famous "Matrix theory".</p>

         <p>Then comes the part where we have to create signal lines into the Matrix so our friend or Remote viewer can view it from a distant location. If you had read the telepathy article, you will understand this better. If you haven't I recommend you read it now, for I am only going to briefly recap creating
         pathways into the Matrix(Unconscious).</p>

         <p>When you first start an RV session you may gather pictures, or think of them mentally as you go along. The reason you can have both is because in the Matrix it is all the same, thoughts. Thoughts, as stated before, are energy in themselves, therefore in Matrix, nothing is physical, until we perceive it as
         such. In RV it is not so much the starting object, but all about the retrieval of the information. So first a signal line must be created, and this is done so by the assigner writing numbers on a card or thinking about and object and mentally overlapping the coordinates onto the object in their mind. Either
         way, Conscious elements are being imposed upon the Unconscious part of the object, and therefore temporarily changes the object. It is temporary, due to the laws of physics. Charges in objects don't usually remain, unless being produced by such object. Which means the Unconscious factors of the object can
         soon overpower the energy we imposed upon it earlier. Also disturbances in the objects environment can interrupt the energy by either overpowering it or simply adding to what was placed there, and create more of a distraction when RV due to the extra source of info that was placed on the object. Written
         coordinates are less prone to disturbances due to the obvious fact that the coordinates are only going to go away with extreme means such as erasing or cutting them off the picture.</p>

         <p>Once the signal line is created into the Matrix(Unconscious), and as said before the unconscious is a part of each object in the environment, your connection is universal. Now the spotlight is on the Viewer to find this link, and receive the details about it. The information seems to come from nowhere, but
         more or less from within the viewer. The reason for this is because our brains are of course made of matter, which is connected to the object, it is a pathway to the object. Once picked up in the Unconscious part of our minds, it is transferred to the conscious parts which then analyzes it. It is up to you
         what kind of info you receive, as you are connected to the object in whole. Mostly people receive pictures or adjectives, because this is the preconceived notion of RV, to receive with the sense of sight and nothing else, and therefore their brain only relays and analyzes the sights of the object. But those
         who have no preconceived notions usually report being transported to the object, and/or feeling the object itself or emotions of the place.</p>

         <p>In the end, you see that RV is in a sense an advance form of telepathy, which requires more on the effort of the receiver instead of the sender.</p>
