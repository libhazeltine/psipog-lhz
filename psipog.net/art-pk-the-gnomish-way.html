         <p>Greetings creatures great and not-so-great!</p>

         <p>Today I will tutor you in the fine art of beginner psychokinesis. The angle of this article will be on the infamous "Just do it" method, which I will explain to the best of my ability. While there will be direct instructions I must clarify that some parts of this article will deal with confirmationary data
         that only serves to assure you that you are heading in the right direction and, as such, should not be directly strived for. Simulating a sensation that occurred in conjunction with a particular situation does not guarantee said situation will occur a second time. And with that said, let us begin.</p>

         <p>For learning psychokinesis you will need to equip yourself with the following:</p>

         <ul>
            <li>One psiwheel</li>

            <li>At least half an hour you can spend solely on yourself in a stress-free environment</li>

            <li>A fresh and relaxed mind</li>
         </ul>

         <p>Place the wheel in front of you. Relax. Take a few deep breaths and slightly open up yourself. Now what we are going to do is make the object in question -- in this case a next-to-free-floating paper umbrella carefully balanced upon the sharp end of a needle -- move by expecting it to do so. This is the
         step short off "just doing it". This is a tried and true method of manifesting psychokinesis by untrained "ungifted" individuals and was used by the Soviets to train several hopeful groups of students. I personally prefer to teach new people psychokinesis this way because it is a relatively uncomplicated
         procedure and has a high success rate.</p>

         <p>Keep your mind void of thoughts, position yourself in a "reacting" mode and look at the wheel, specifically at one of the bent edges. Position your vision so you can comfortably focus on both an edge and the empty space an inch or two in front of it. Now pretend you are watching a movie you've seen several
         times and know inside out. Look at the edge and fully expect it to move an inch forward. Try to put yourself in a mindset that will make you feel a slight indignation if it doesn't move.</p>

         <p>Many inexperienced psychokinetics fancy PK to feel like an "active" force when in reality, it is quite the opposite. At first, it generally feels very laid back and like you are watching someone else move the object, or it moving itself, separate from any commands you might be directing to it. At best it
         feels like working through a medium of some sort. If the wheel did not move yet, do not be discouraged. It's a little more complicated and abstract than that.</p>

         <p>Now is a good time to remind you that the following state of mind is not meant to be visualized or in any other way directly simulated, active thinking will at first prevent your psychokinetic tries. So these are merely to be used as reference data that will tell you if you are heading in the right
         direction.</p>

         <p>While in a relaxed, no-thought state of mind and looking at the object in front of you, chances are you will feel what can only be described as an overlay/over-head connection to the object. Like an immaterial hand or a windy grip that are neither hand nor grip but has similar characteristics. The reason I
         stress not actively thinking and promote a reactive state of mind is because this connection is brought on and maintained by very careful balancing. If you try too hard you push yourself over the required focus, and if you are too passive and too much into an observatory state, you won't seize the focus in
         the first place.</p>

         <p>This is, in my own humble opinion, the reason why objects usually do not move automatically while just being observed and also why many aspiring psychokinetics experience the object moving in a jerky fashion. As they momentarily glitch over the correct PK "focus point" they burp out nearly spontaneous
         bursts of psychokinetic force. The reason that contributes to this problem is that they actively try to move the wheel through what they perceive as accurate "PK force", as I mentioned before, a force you aggressively push forward. Granted this does work for a select few and is an option when the mechanics of
         PK is "in your spine" so to speak, but as this article is geared towards the inexperienced we'll disregard this for the time being.</p>

         <p>The only cure for this is repetitive training on the wheel or any other object until you can move it slowly, smoothly and steadily. The overlay/overhead connection is somewhere in between physical movement and thought and the only analogy I can provide you is that of how a car works. You need to find the
         exact right leverage between the accelerator and the clutch in order to make the car move forward. The same applies here, with enough expectation of the object to move combined with the right no-thought wish for it to do so and your body will create the cloudy, whispy psychokinetic force that hits the target
         of your choice.</p>

         <p>How to communicate through this channel I cannot explain as there is nothing quite like it. The best way I can put it is that you communicate through the overlay connection wordlessly and thoughtlessly in a form that resembles a reaction. To move it to the left, you react "to the left" through the overlay
         connection.</p>

         <p>Yes, it sounds confusing but if you work with it you will understand what I mean. This is not something you armchair yourself through.</p>

         <p>So in conclusion - Locate the object, relax your mind and enter an observatory but "reactive" state of mind and watch the object move itself while at the same time expecting it to do so. See it as a seperate entity, a cat, that moves itself but accepts your command if you carefully will it in the right
         direction.</p>

         <p>Good Luck.</p>
