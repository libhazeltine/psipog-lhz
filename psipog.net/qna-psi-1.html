                  <p>Hello, I have one question today...</p>

                  <p>I was reading about spoon bending because it interests me and was wondering...</p>

                  <p>If you can bend metal utensils, wouldn't it be possible to bend and twist other objects as well? Such as a pencil, or pen? Or a soda can? Even plastic objects would be possible. Right? Thank you for taking time to read and answer my question.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>It is certainly possible to bend other metal objects. Cutlery is not the only thing on record. Soda cans wouldn't be much of a challenge. Rebar and spikes of the sort used in building railroads have been twisted, though, and that looks quite impressive when it's done.</p>

                  <p>I would expect a pencil to simply break, presuming you mean the wooden kind, because wood behaves differently than metal. However, it would need to be tested to say for sure.</p>

                  <p>Plastic can certainly be bent. The cheap-and-cheerful sort is more fragile than the usual metals, and so plastic cutlery has a good chance of breaking rather than making a spiffy distorted shape.</p>

                  <p>Psi is a theory, right? So, that means that we can interpret it in any way to get the results. So, I have read that to do telekinesis, you can put a psiball around the object and gain control of it, so the psi ball is infact, an extension of our aura, or our mind, correct?</p>

                  <p>Actually, no. "Psi" is a variable (and a Greek letter). It designates the mechanism that allows such things as psychokinesis and telepathy to work. As far as the "psi" part is concerned, _how_ you get it to work is irrelevent.</p>

                  <p>The psiball might or might not be an extension of the aura or of the mind or both. There is not yet sufficient data to say precisely what it is. In the same manner, there is not yet sufficient data to say what exactly the functional mechanism is, which makes gravity exist.</p>

                  <p>There are Roman Catholics who practice psionics, and the Vatican has a committee that investigates things. There are also Catholics who practice violin and throwing basketballs into baskets...</p>

                  <p>However, practicing psionics, violin, and/or basketball is nor restricted to Roman Catholics. (That means, "You don't have to be Catholic to practice psionics.") None of them is particularly related to religion, unless someone has decided to worship basketballs or violin rosin or something....</p>

                  <p>I'm a new student to this website and I'm hooked. I've been trying to make psi balls, yet I get the feeling something is holding me back. I want to believe in everything that this site says is possible (it's pretty awesome), yet some part of me keeps on saying this is impossible. I'm trying to
                  make psi balls and drawing energy from my source yet some part of my brain is thinking "I'm looking like and idiot doing this". I am a scientist fanatic and thought that this type of stuff was just a trick (i.e. the video of the spining watch was just a watch attached to a rope). Is it possible to do
                  everything said without truly believing it will work?</p>

                  <p>Skepticism is a good thing. You don't have to believe in _any of it_ for it to work. Strong belief that it can't work can sabotage your efforts, and indeed strong belief that it _will_ work can do likewise. And, for the record, some psionic activities do look incredibly stupid...those are best
                  done behind closed doors, if you're concerned about such things.</p>

                  <p>All that said, it is not known for certain whether it is possible for everybody to learn to do PK. There is a certain amount of evidence that implies that the other psionic abilities (telepathy, and such)can be learned to some degree by just about anyone. PK can be done, but it might not work for
                  everyone.</p>

                  <p>The two concepts overlap. Short version: if you can produce a psionic effect with it, and the effect is objectively observable by a third party, it is - by definition - "psi". At least some of what is described as "chi" or "ki" fits this definition.</p>

                  <p>HI! Do you believe that actually believing that you can do tk or whatever plays a bigger role than the actual energy we use? Would you might even believe that there is no energy and that it is based 100% on belief and that we used this "energy" to reinforce our belief system so that we can actualy
                  accomplish our goals?<br />

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>No. TK does not require that the person doing it believe that it is possible. It doesn't even require that the person consider that it might be possible. A strong belief that it is _impossible_ may interfere, but belief is not required. Therefore, it can't be the central mechanism.</p>

Some people say he's the real deal, and some people are convinced that he's definitely just a magician. I have seen him perform (only on TV though) works of psychometry, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, telepathy,
                  ESP, among other things. Some of the telepathy stuff lead me to believe that he may be a Neurolinguistic Programming practicioner, but they generally can't move pens underneath glass bowls! What do you think?</p>

                  <p>Hello. I'm hoping that someone on these forums could provide some factual evidence that psionics isn't just a myth.</p>

                  <p>I searched the articles for "proof of psionics" and the top link provided me with this:</p>

                  <p>"... Some people actually want to ?prove psi?. Fine, whatever floats your boat. However, many of us have more interesting things to do than to prove the obvious. More to the point, some of us really do not care whether you believe in psionics, gravity, or seawater."</p>

                  <p>That isn't proof, rather saying that anyone asking for proof is an idiot, and I looked through a few more articles and found zero scientific proof of psionics.</p>

                  <p>So... uh, anyone got some scientific evidence of "psi"?</p>

                  <p>While I agree that PsiPog is missing some scientific information on psionics, that doesn't mean we don't offer proof. You just have to inspect what you mean by "proof".</p>

                  <p>On PsiPog we have exercises that are designed to get you on the path of learning different psionic skills. If you use our exercises and successfully move something via telekinesis - then you have just proved to yourself that it is possible.</p>

                  <p>I believe that it's very hard to CONVINCE someone that psionics is real (ESPECIALLY over the internet). I believe it is much easier to give someone simple exercises that they can try on their own - then they can see it with their own eyes.</p>
