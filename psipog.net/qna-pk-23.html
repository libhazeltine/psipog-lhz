                  <p>My question is regarding pyro kinesis. It is really the first thing i have seen positve results from. What I have done is held a penny and tried to warm it some. i would feel strange things but i could not really tell whether it was getting warmer or not. So I had a friend hold the penny and they
                  said that it got hot. Well i didn't think much of it but then the next night i had another friend of mine hold a penny (btw she was about 2 miles away at the time) and she reported it got heavy and warm too. Then the same thing again with a different friend who also lives a mile or so away. But then
                  not too long after that like 20 minutes or so I had yet another friend hold a staple and I heated it quickly and accidently burned her palm. Not a bad burn. I know this was kind of a stupid thing to do "hey hold this let me see if i can set it on fire" but i was not expecting to heat it so much so
                  quickly. But when i do this alone i do not get such cool results. either i feel no heat or if I set the penny down then attempt to heat it i dont feel any heat either. My question is if the heating of the object could possibly be fueled by the persons energy? If it can then possibly visualizing a
                  source for the energy could make for more consistant results. What do you think?</p>

                  <p>How much energy might pyrokinesis take?<br />
                  I just read the fire and ice article and it was mentioned that it could potentialy take a great amount of energy to heat something larger. I was wondering if that energy could be developed over time or if the scale of lighting fires is a universal limit. i apologise in advance if this was perviously

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>I don't know how much energy is required to perform pyroPK, beyond the amount required to actually heat the substance which you are targetting.</p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/energyunits.html"
                     target="_blank">http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/energyunits.html</a> A calorie is "the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celcius".</p>

                  <p>Therefore, if you happen to be trying to heat some water, and you know the starting and ending temperature of that water, and you also know the quantity of water, you should be able to figure out exactly how much energy is required for the actual heating, calculated in calories. Multiply the
                  difference of the starting and ending temperatures in degrees Celcius, by the number of grams of water.</p>

                  <p>From this, we may deduce that the amount of substance does indeed affect how much energy is required.</p>

                  <p>Precisely how much energy is required in addition to this amount (if any) to effect pyroPK, I do not know.</p>

                  <p>As for developing it over a period of time, I am guessing you mean increasing your "strength" for PK, as opposed to heating the water a little today and a little tomorrow, realising that it would cool down again in the interim. It sometimes seems that PK strength can increase with practice, but I
                  am not sure whether this has actually been proven conclusively.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>About how much weight can a single averagely skilled person in PK levitate at a time. And if there is another person does that change? For example: One PKer can lift 2 ounces, but when there is another equal they can both lift 5 ounces making it differ. Something like this could be explained by
                  2x+(x-1) (X=people lifting with PK)Of course that is all hypothetical because I do not know the average weight a single person can lift with PK and I have never seen equally skilled people use PK to make something levitate, except the picture of the pocket knife floating which is probably between
                  average and advanced. Now this brings up another topic: What exactly is 'average'? Well I'm hoping you can fill that in for me with something better than pushing a pen and easier than making a pencil float, although I don't have any experience with PK, so I can't really say much on that. If there is
                  no formula that we know of that can calculate this, I'd still like to know how much a single average person can lift using PK alone.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>The answer to your question would depend heavily on which kind of "average" you mean. I expect that the vast majority of folk who "play" with PK cannot lift anything at all, with their current level of skill. This guess is based on the fact that so many people who practice PK restrict their
                  practice to microPK, and quite a few who practice macroPK only push things.</p>

                  <p>All that said, I'm not familiar with any large-scale studies which establish the most that any one individual could lift, much less the norm for the species.</p>

                  <p>Even if that data were available, each kind of average would give a different result.</p>

                  <p>I?m relatively new to the site, and the various techniques that are explained within ? with that said; I have found a great deal of fascination with these abilities.</p>

                  <p>I have experimented with energy manipulation for a while now, and have been delving into the deeper aspects of meditation in order to find ?myself? ? each amounting to some noticeable personal success. I find either very self-satisfying; and am now looking to grasp the talents of Telekinesis.</p>

                  <p>Two days ago, I constructed the psi wheel. First using aluminum foil (like instructed), and then with paper.</p>

                  <p>So the meditation began, a calming of my person, and a focusing on the wheel itself. After twenty minutes or so, I felt I was ?ready? to attempt the movement of the wheel ? and unconsciously my fingers extended, soon followed by my hands, to rest near the psiwheel (3-4 inches on either side). To
                  my surprise (and delight) it began to waver, followed by a bobbing up and down, and finally it began to spin counter clockwise in a very slow manner. It continued this for 2 rotations, and then slowed, bobbed again, and finally ceased to move.</p>

                  <p>My questions are: ?Would the heat waves generated from my fingers be enough to move it from that distance?? and ?How can I cut back on other ?variables?, wind currents, etc etc ? besides covering my mouth with my shirt??</p>

                  <p>Perhaps I might just try covering it with a glass container, so as to halt all the excess movements of air, and clear my small aspect of self-doubt.</p>

                  <p>My thanks in advance.</p>

                  <p>I guess heat could be generated. I'm not sure how much heat it would take to actually do that. If you're worried about that, try moving it without putting your fingers close. Stand back 5 feet and visualize that your hands are close, when they really aren't. Or try controlling the direction, if
                  you can spin it in both directions, and control when it changes, then that's TK.</p>

                  <p>Cut back on other variables how you mentioned, pretty common sense stuff. Worried about wind? Close windows, turn off the AC, put a container of the psiwheel. Worried about vibrations? Stick it on a table in the middle of the room. Worried about your body interferring? Try to move it from across
                  the room.</p>

                  <p>Hello, I'm new to this site. First off, I would just like to say thank you to everyone here. I had tried PK numerous times before, but was never very certain it could be done. Yesterday I made the pin wheel. Within an hour, I was able to make it move slightly. This was due largely to seeing the
                  videos here and something in my mind just clicking with them.</p>

                  <p>Anyways, I used my hands as guides for where I wanted the wheel to move to, although they were positioned a few inches away. Is this a problem? Should I just use my mind? I have tried using just my mind, and it seems a little more difficult, but also more rewarding. Any advice would be
                  appreciated. Thanks.</p>

                  <p>The only things wrong with gesturing with your hands are that a) if they are two close you risk making air currents, and b) pseudoskeptical debunkers (as opposed to the honest ones) will write off _everything_ you do as being the result of those possible air currents.....even if you are gesturing
                  at a bowling ball twenty metres away. If you find the not-gesture approach more rewarding, by all means, fill your boots.</p>
