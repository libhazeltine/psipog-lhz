                  <p>you said in a earlier Q&amp;A that nonpsions will percieve telepathy as there own thoughts, like if you sent a thought to call a person they would get a desire to call that person. Could this be considered a form of mind control? also, how can you tell if your thoughts are your own?</p>

                  <p>To the first questions: In a way, yes. However keep in mind that people do not do all of the things that they think. the suggestion of "scratch your ear" may be followed, while the suggestion of "run really fast" may not be, just because the person has no true desire to.

                  <p>A "ping" is merely a very rudimentary telepathic communication. Generally, it does not exert any kind of serious control, nor is it intended to. The sort of thing you are referring to can also be fairly rudimentary (seems to be limited in application, however), but is outside the scope of this
                  site, being a hostile action.</p>

                  <p>Different people master different things at different rates. Additionally, remote viewing is more of a set procedure (with explicit standards that were set by the government) for viewing long-distance.</p>

                  <p>Remote presence is more of a free-form technique that allows the viewer to have more of a 'feel' of the place that remote viewing does.</p>

                  <p>In short, in comparison to actual senses, Remote Viewing would be seeing and Remote Presence would be seeing+feeling+(sometimes other senses).</p>

                  <p>Remote Viewing, I feel, is more accurate (and proven). Remote Presence is faster and can potentially be more accurate (with other senses). However, it all depends on the viewer and his/her skill with each technique.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Pulse-sending _usually_ does not produce a physical sensation in the sender, unless the sender is also using another approach at the same time...for example, piggy-backing it on an empathic sending, to get more of an impact. There are, of course, exceptions. So, no, it doesn't mean you are doing
                  it wrong. If the Sending gets through, you're doing it right.</p>

                  <p>Okay, so recently I brought up psionics to a friend of mine because I have known through scanning he was also a psion to some degree. It turns out, as we talked, that he can see auras. When I told him about this site, he told me to try and find some information on aura vision. But, after carrying
                  out several searches I came up empty-handed. So does anyone know any information regarding aura vision, auras, and what not, and where to find it?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Unfortunately, this site contains no information on 'aura vision' because it is often linked to religious beleifs. Although many people beleive in auras, there is no exact proff that they exist. It is currently the policy of PSIPOG not to engage religion in any article, and it is nigh on
                  impossible to write an article on auras without including religion. Although the opinion may change in the future, currently I do not know of any articles posted or pending posting on auras.<br />
                  As far as finding information about auras, I suggest checking out a book from the library or searching for information on www.google.com. Sorry I can be of so little help.</p>

                  <p>I'm very sorry if this question has already been answered. It was hard for me to find anything with the search. I'm 13 years old and I have recently dicovered that I am an empath. I'm worried that if I don't gain control of this 'gift' that it will become harmful to me and possibly others. It's
                  not very strong right now, but I gather it could grow to be quite strong considering my family and the things that have happened to me already. Is this a valid worry? And if so, how do I strengthen my gift or just learn to control it?<br />

                  <p>Great! Good for you! Being an empath is no easy task, but it is one that is heavily rewarding. It is a valid worry that you _can_ end up harming yourself (no so much others, even that I've heard of). the good news is that there are ways to control it, and stop it from becoming too overwhelming. In
                  the manipulation category of PSIPOG, there is a section on shielding. Learn to shield against other people's emotions, it is probably the most useful psionic tool to you. Practice your talent, and you will become better at it, and gain more control. Shield, and you will prevent yourself from
                  harm.</p>

                  <p>Generally, when you are younger, you block out less things. As you grow up, you become more centered of things of life (you get to interacting with people, playing with toys, ect.) and forget the psionics side. This happens for alot of poeple (not all). I wouldn't say that you were more sensitive
                  then, or now, but now it requires more training and dedication.</p>

                  <p>Kind of... For me, I usually 'see' it in my mind's eye. For example, me and a friend have had a few RV/RP practices lately, and when I go to 'see' him, the first thing I notice is what his shield/field looks like. As I focus on it, it usually tends to stand out as a certain color (although not
                  correct 100% of the time, I run around 75-70%). it just 'stands out' as that color. Sorry, its the best advice I can give you, but this is my experience</p>
