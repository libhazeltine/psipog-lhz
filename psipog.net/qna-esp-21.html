               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hello. Thank you for taking your time to read my question.</p>

                  <p>My friend is naturally precognitive. If I am to understand him correctly, he "sees" the future in the form of words - receives details about moments in time. Nothing big, nothing that ground-shaking - but it is ruining his life. He cannot control it, even though he tries. It is not so much the
                  details he receives that are getting to him so much as it is the mental stress put on him. He says it saps much of his energy and does not allow him to concentrate on other things. His memory seems to be deteriorating. He feels like it is pushing other, more important pieces of information out of his
                  mind. I have seen him have fits where his vision blurs, his energy is sapped and large chunks of his recent memory are missing. He says these have happened on and off since he can remember - as well as his visions. He feels helpless against this, feels like it is taking over.</p>

                  <p>I am very, very concerned about him, and so I ask - how can my friend attempt to control this? Many attempts to do so have been foiled by his incapability to focus well.</p>

                  <p>Thank you again for reading. I apologize for the length of my question.</p>

                  <p>Inability to focus well _will_ be a problem. That probably ought to be the first thing he works on.</p>

                  <p>That said, the usual ways of practicing precognition will help gain some control. For example, predict three headlines for the next day, then check the news the following evening. Try to predict, also, what the announcer will be wearing.</p>

                  <p>Hi. I just had an idea, and wondered what you thought.</p>

                  <p>Do you think it would be possible to use empathy to project emotions of caring, selflessness, etc (In other words, feeling for other people) on to someone like a sociopath/psychopath, to sort of "teach" or "help" them? Or do you think, such feelings not naturally occurring/ being very strong in
                  them, it would just be sort of "incompatible" (go over their head)</p>

                  <p>(I do not study psychology or empathy, I'm not suggesting all MOD?s must become vigilante psychiatrists, I just thought about the some of the symptoms of the conditions and had the idea)</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>You can project all you like. If experiencing the projected emotions could help them, they wouldn't be sociopaths. In fact, some empath-folks are the very definition of psychopathy, even though they feel the emotions of everyone around them.</p>

                  <p>Personally, I would suggest a combination of practicing short-term precognition, a bit of receptive telepathy to judge "intent" of possible assailants, and using the edge of your field to "feel" for disturbances.</p>

                  <p>If by "mind reading" you mean mentalist tricks using psychology on stage, then, no.</p>

                  <p>If you mean actual "telepathy", there are several. They are in the section of the sidebar labelled "Articles". When you go to the article menu, click on the "Telepathy" section. You'll find that most of the Telepathy stuff is in the Telepathy section.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1) A scan is any (usually cursory) "look" at something or someone, psychically. A "probe" is a deeper look, most often referring to telepathic activity, beyond surface thoughts. Both of these tend to involve some kind of contact. The kind of "link" you are most likely referring to is a more
                  permanent contact. In some cases, _very_ permanent. Mindlinking is not something lightly undertaken.</p>

                  <p>2) None, unless you are using constructs to do it.</p>
