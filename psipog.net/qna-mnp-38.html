                  <p>it just came to me, but lets say that you (me) have been spining the psi wheel and your like low on energy so then you go to sleep, wouldnt you regain the energy just from sleeping concidering its like meditation right? because your relaxed, but if you dont remember a dream could it be you
                  meditating in your sleep not knowing it?</p>

                  <p>Sleep is great for regaining energy. That's why all sorts of animals do it every night. Rest = good.</p>

                  <p>As for meditation... Lucid dreaming has been called "meditating while asleep", but I don't know how solid that connection is. Sleep is an altered state of consciousness, and so is meditation... but that doesn't mean they are the same thing.</p>

                  <p>Either way, sleep will help you balance out some psi issues. OJ and chocolate too, I've been told, help as well.</p>

                  <p>I would say no. Not that I've ever tried, but just because of the nature of those objects. For example, a TV is not exactly a simple object to just create. Even things that seem simple, like plastic, is not so simple on an atomic level. Psi rarely takes physical form in the first place - if you're
                  looking to get a free TV, then I would suggest learning a different skill <img src="wink.gif"

                  <p>When I was looking up psiballs, I first read peebrain's article, then I read GreatSheepKing's, and they suggest two different energy sources - peebrain suggests drawing it from your environment, GSK suggests drawing it from within yourself.<br />
                  My question is, does it matter what you choose to draw energy from? Is one source better than another?</p>

                  <p>The obvious answer would be: do what works for you. Try both out and see what you like.</p>

                  <p>To extend the answer a little more than that... The most popular theory on psi is that it is a by-product of the nervous system. If that is true, then GSK's old article would be a direct stimulation of the nerves in the abs. My article would be a more indirect way of generating some psi - it would
                  stimulate the subconscious to create "energy". Some people don't like my article on psi balls because they think it is inaccurate for that reason... But if the method works, use it, that's my motto <img src="smile.gif"

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>You can use any of a number of objects as a focus in "scrying", in the manner you would use a crystal ball. The only real requirements are that it not hurt your eyes if you stare at it for extended periods of time, and that it is relatively inanimate, so it will stay still long enough to be stared
                  at. If you want to use a psiball for that, go right ahead.</p>

                  <p>A lucid dream is a condition in which you are aware that you are asleep and dreaming. It may or may not involve control of the dream. If you are not asleep and/or not dreaming, you are not experiencing a lucid dream.</p>

                  <p>Hello PsiPog staff</p>

                  <p>A student of mine recently asked this question,<br />
                  "When I make a shield, do I have to program it to follow me, or does it just do it on its own?"</p>

                  <p>You'd think this is a question that would answer itself once you try it out..</p>

                  <p>In any case, I always attach the shield to my self through a series of lines or equivalent. The shield behaves like you want it to behave. Some people don't do this, and I suspect they subconsciously expect (expect = progamming) their shield to follow them around, for say a shield that is put up
                  to last all day. If you feel that it's needed and that your shield will collapse without this, then by all means do it.. you'll find out if it's needed anyway.<br />
                  I guess it's self-explanatory that object-bound shields don't need this, like a house-shield.</p>
