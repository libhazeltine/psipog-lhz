                  <p>Hi ^^</p>

                  <p>I've been trying to have an Out of body experience for a long time. Yesterday I felt I was very close to it but nothing happened.</p>

                  <p>I tried to let my body sleep, when it was asleep I heard loud noises and bangs/explosions. Then it was silent again for a while. After that I felt a light breeze on my forehead. I kept lying there a very long time but nothing more happened.. Is there anything perticular I have to think of or
                  something? What am I doing wrong? It was the closest (I think) I've ever been to an OBE</p>

                  <p>The next step is to trance out. One good way to do that is to repeat "I will now have an Out of Body Experience" over and over in your head. Just keep repeating it. Eventually you will trance out, and hopefully you will "wake up" in the out of body state.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I just found an interesting website on all the different ways mankind will die out. It's called www.exitmundi.nl</p>

                  <p>If you enter the site and you click on the picture of a clock with the text "Stop!" underneath, the page talks about how life isn't real, and everything is just a computer simulation. What I found was the most interesting was the part about OBE's, as quoted below:</p>

                  <p>?When you disturb your brain in a certain way, your feeling of ?self? can get detached from your brain. You experience what is known as an ?out of body experience?.<br />
                  But you don?t have to be nearly dead to feel it. The sensation can easily be created in a laboratory, by placing a helmet with rotating magnetic fields on your head. The magnetic field acts like a ?jam signal? on your brain. Suddenly, you'll feel like you're floating outside your body. But you
                  aren?t. It?s just your brain going confused.</p>

                  <p>And you don't really need a helmet to do the trick. Visiting a place where the movement of the Earth's crust generates magnetic fields can give you the experience. Meditation and intensive prayer can generate it.?</p>

                  <p>I would like to know your opinion on this.</p>

                  <p>My opinion is the person who wrote that was just joking around.</p>

                  <p>He writes that there are experiments that actually "prove" it. I would be interested in what experiments he's talking about - unfortunately, he doesn't cite any. I've never come across an experiment that proves OBEs are a result of our "confused" brain. That theory doesn't explain how people can
                  see things while out of body, that they wouldn't have known about otherwise, and then later confirm that they were right.</p>

                  <p>This forum post might interest you as well - it goes into more indepth reasons why the "OBEs are hallucinations" theory doesn't make sense:</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>It is not necessary to use a crystal for a pendulum. Anything that will swing freely at a convenient length will do nicely. A ring suspended on a hair is one of the most traditional pendling tools. A necklace also works well, as does a bolt (a piece of hardware sort of like a thick ring that
                  screws onto other pieces of hardwares such as screws) threaded onto a string.</p>

                  <p>How long is "convenient" will depend on whether you are sitting or standing, what you're holding the pendulum over, and how tall you are. Many people find that a suspended length of six to ten inches (15-25cm) is nicely workable.</p>

                  <p>Having a communication with your sub-conscious is a definate plus (typically done via a 'person' in your dream), and can be used to solve difficult problems or just to provide help on a problem that you are having a hard time with.</p>

                  <p>Yes, you can practice psionic skills in a lucid dream (such as psi manipulation, PK, sensing, ect.). Also from a lucid dream, you can move to a dreamwalk, OBE, or RP/clair.</p>

                  <p>I was wondering about communicating with your subconcious. I read the articles and the links that you have about them but I was wondering, do you hear your subconcious (like someone is physically talking to you) or do you get feelings like telepathy. I get it like it is telepathy and it is sort of
                  a mental conversation. Is this talking to my subconcious or am I just imagining things?</p>

                  <p>Different people tend to experience different things when they experiment with their sub-conscious. Personally, I have the experience of having a so-called 'telepathy' interpretation with the occasional image that my sub-c will bring up for clarity. I do not know whether you are personally
                  imagining anything. My suggestion to prove whether you are or are not is to go into a meditation and see what you find there (typically if all responses are quick for me, it is an indication that this is not a true communication but what i want to hear, but you have to experiment and find out what
                  works for you.)</p>
