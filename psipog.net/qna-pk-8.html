                  <p>Hey, I was curious, with pyrokinesis you're fooling around with the molecules of a candle wick, for example, speeding them up and therefore creating a flame. I was wondering if this same concept could be applied to i.e. a cut on your arm, to speed up the repair process of blood cells around the
                  cut therefore healing the wound?<br />
                  Thanks, hope that made sense :)</p>

                  <p>You _don't_ know. If you can enclose the wheel entirely, then it is less likely to be air-currents, but there are other objects which are more effective for "proof": stopping a radiometer (without interfering with the light-source), for example.</p>

                  <p>Man...I have been trying to get telekinesis to work for three years. I have done all the training, all the exercises, and I still cannot get any results. So I am inclined to ask the questions: Is telekinesis real? Or are we all just fooling ourselves? If it is real, why can't I get it to work? If
                  you have any advice, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

                  <p>1) Yes, telekinesis is real.<br />
                  2) No, we are not all fooling ourselves, even though a large chunk of the claims made --especially online-- are false.<br />
                  3) Without the specifics of what you are doing, I'm not about to analyse why it isn't working. Some people do take years before they get it to work, and some never do get it to work. The latter might just give up too soon, or they might not be able to do it. I'll never be able to do Sumo-Wrestling;
                  does that mean Sumo does not exist?</p>

                  <p>Is there a psychokinetic ability which grants you the possibility to control darkness?

                  <p>Darkness is nothing more or less than the "absence of light". If you want to control shadows, for example, you muck about with the light to do so. Of course, you can pretend the shadow has its own substance, for purposes of visualization, if you want to, but you'll be attempting to control the
                  light, even so.</p>

                  I noticed that when I think of it as "letting" it be that thing, instead of "making" it be that thing, like if i just let it be what i want, instead of forcing it, it works ALOT better, and i know since it seems to work for me i should keep doing it(you have answered THAT often enough that people
