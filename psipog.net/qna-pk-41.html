                  <p>Hi,<br />
                  I started tk about a week ago &amp; mind you, I probably believe more &amp; have read more &amp; devoted more time into "believing" than alot of people. Anyway, like I said, I began last week...but, I haven't been able to move the psi wheel in a complete circle. Like I can close my eyes &amp;
                  visualize &amp; open them &amp; its spinning...but if I look right at it, I get excited &amp; also it moves without me trying..&amp; yes, its real, I can video tape it &amp; it doesnt move, but when I come in, it will randomly move...weird i'd say. Anyway, what can I do to stop that? &amp; also..I
                  can barely move it with glass over it..but when I take it off, its easier than heck, must be a subcon thing..what do you say?</p>

                  <p>You can move it after 1 week? Heck, buddy, that's pretty fast...</p>

                  <p>To answer your first question "Anyway, what can I do to stop that?": All you need is control. You are doing pretty well, in fact. Keep with it for a month or two. Try to influence it consciously. Also, the excitement will fade away soon, leaving you more "space" to experiment <img src="wink.gif"

                  <p>To answer your second question: it can be a subconscious thing as you stated it. But the most of us (if not all) have the same problem. It's unlikely that we all have the same subconscious "tic". But who knows, hehe. Don't worry, you'll be able to move under glass, too. Everything's a question of
                  time.</p>

                  <p>i have seen (and used) several computer "games" on differint website's where you try to make a random number generater make only 1's or 0's. Well if you can do that to a computer then is it posible to take it a step(or 3) futher and move the mouse on screen with out moveing the one on you mouse
                  pad? or make letters apper with out manipulating the keybord in any way? ie telling and/or tricking the comp into thinking that you hit a key when you didint realy. It could happen...right?</p>

                  <p>First of all, I'm not an expert regarding this topic, but I've had some experiences. My brother programed a simple 2D space shooter game few years ago. A simple one, where the ship is controlled by a random number generator. It moves left, right or it shoots. That simple. 75% of chance it does
                  nothing, 20% of chance it moves in one direction or another, and 5% it shoots. Since the gaming loop is pretty fast, it still moves and shoots very fast, too. Now from the top of the screen you have enemies flying towards you and shooting. After hundreds of tests my brother calculated an average of
                  score the ship can get. So when you start the game it's very likely that it'll get automatically a score of approx.8 killed enemies.</p>

                  <p>Now after some time I had the idea that you could train micro-TK with this software, trying to influence chance (the random generator). So you sit there and try to influence the ship to move in one direction or another. Some people see the results pretty fast. After few hours I "scored" over 30.
                  Which according to the chance calculated by my bro' couldn't happen at all. I introduced the game on the chat (some might remember it). One guy (heck, I forgot his name), who never had any success in tk, scored over 300 after few hours of playing...</p>

                  <p>There is a lot of similar software which generates results according to RNG's as well as many "online tests" to test your telekinetic abilities *skeptic*. I've also heard about people who fried their HD's or caused other electronic damage/malfunction *looks @ Peebrain*</p>

                  <p>So if you ask me, yes it is possible to influence computers, especially the random generators <img src="happy.gif"

                  <p>Here, i have a Question-problem: As I am doing tk, i try to look the psiwheel but instead of trying to move it, i try not to move it (only just to watch it) and surprisingly i move it without my will (Yes its 100%real...its not the air). Can i fix that "unwilling telekinesis"? If i cant, that
                  means that in the future i will move pens without my intention to do this?</p>

                  <p>Also, from how far away can tk be performed?</p>

                  <p>I don't think you should try to "fix" it but instead try to develop this further.<br />
                  It seems that by "not trying hard" and even by "staying completely neutral whether it moves or not" gets you into the right state of mind. Focused but passive, perfect. You have now just to learn to control that state of mind. Try to develop it further and become more confident with it. It might seem
                  like "unwilling" telekinesis at first, but believe me, you'll learn to control it later.</p>

                  <p>That's what telekinesis is all about. At first you'll be more clumsy than a baby learning to walk. The psiwheel will sometimes move like crazy in random directions and someimes not move at all; like if it had a mind on its own. I don't know a cure to heal that other than practice. You can also try
                  to overcome this lack of co-ordination/control by meditation or other mind exercises. You are free to choose.</p>

                  <p>To answer your second question: personally for me TK is a short-range skill. But I have to admit that I have this unexplainable subconscious tic that I have to see the object and it must not be behind a wall(or something similar). That's my personal problem, but I believe it's my own subconscious
                  thing, since I've heard that some people could move the wheel by simply watching at it through a webcam, sitting in the other room. Maybe other authors could add their opinion here...</p>

                  <p>Good luck,</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Telekinesis and Psychokinesis are exactly the same thing. The confusion comes because sometimes people decide to use the terms as though they referred to different effects. Originally, "telekinesis" was coined to refer to a different effect entirely, in another language. Therefore, for official
                  scientific literature, "psychokinesis" is the preferred term, to avoid ambiguity.</p>

                  <p>Telekinesis/Psychokinesis is the act of moving or altering an object with your mind by way of "psi".</p>

                  <p>Telepathy is communication between two or more minds, again presuming to use "psi" instead of more conventional means.</p>

                  <p>In both cases, "psi" is nothing more or less than whatever not-well-understood mechanism allows to mind to do this. There is some evidence to point toward "psi" being a substance/particle given off as a byproduct of nervous function.</p>

                  <p>1) I don't know why you would want to move an object while you sleep...? Besides, how do you know something moved? It is possible that you will experience spontaneous telekinesis being awake though. These telekinetic "outbursts" can be pretty strong sometimes, but I wouldn't worry about them. It
                  happens rarely and is harmless,... probably <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>2)Whatever works better for you. I allow my eyes to lose the focus a bit (I think that's what you mean by "abscent-minded). You see, if you watch "too hard" after some minutes your eyes become tired and may eventually play tricks with you (like you start seeing movement which is not there). That
                  might become a problem.<br />
                  But when you relax your eyes and allow them to lose some of the focus, you automatically get into a half-daydream-state, which is pretty "productive" regarding telekinesis. Don't exaggerate though, just do whatever makes you feel relaxed and comfortable.</p>

                  <p>1) Yes, it is possible. It does happen. However, unless you are learning pk in order to bring an out-of-control talent under your control, the chances of such accidental pk are fairly low, unless you do something horrendously stupid.</p>

                  <p>Hi,</p>

                  <p>My question is based on pyrokinesis and cyrokinesis. I was wondering if there was anyone out there that had accomplished this to a major extent like being able to light/freeze objects.(eg. match/candle) Just wanting to know and if you have did you get it on camera? Could you get a Video on the net
                  if at all possible.</p>

                  <p>thanx<br />

                  <p>What I wrote about in _Fire and Ice_, I have done, unless otherwise indicated in the article itself.</p>

                  <p>Getting a video of it on the net, however, I regard as pointless: such videos are too easy to fake, and my esteemed colleagues have gotten enough slack for the pictures and videos they have already put up. I have no overwhelming desire to put up with the mockery to which they have already been
                  subjected.</p>

                  <p>I Have been moving the psiwheel for 5 days now and i can move it with ease out side a glass or jar, but my question is why when it is inside the jar or glass do i find it harder. i have been able to move it to some degree about 1/2 spin but it seems to take a great deal more engery. If i could
                  understand why this is happening then i could move it with more ease.</p>

                  <p>There might not be a definitive answer for this, but I think the most likely guess is that you are sabotaging your own efforts. It is not necessary to believe pk is possible in order to do it. _However_, if you believe something is getting in your way, your subconscious can take that belief as an
                  instruction and dampen your own efforts. Glass does not generally interfere with pk on its own.</p>

                  <p>I've read Peebrain's TK guide and, of course tried it myself. In it Peebs mentioned "hints" sent by the subconsciousness (like the "graceful" hint mentioned), and I got a hint too. It is just rather hard to crack. My hint was "dark" (or "darkness", it was rather hard to differ).<br />
                  If any of you mods can help me interpert this, I'd be really thankful.</p>

                  <p>Dark? Hmmm.... With the hints I got, it instantly made sense to me, almost to the point of I understood it before my subconscious finished explaining it <img src="blah.gif"

                       height="12"

                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />. It was just like "OOooooh yeahhh!!!". Everything clicked. Dark on the other hand... hmm... I can't think of anything off the top of my head. Try asking your subconscious what it means. How did it apply to the situation? Did it help? Ask these things to yourself, try to
                       figure it out.</p>
