                  <p>dear psipog staff,</p>

                  <p>Most of my previous questions have been just little things that ive asked in the Q:A section because my computer wont use the chat client. but please answer this one because im growing concerned for the saftey of others, you see ever since i moved the psiwheel when ever my emotions flair up or i
                  have to yell to getsomeone to hear me random objects that i cant normally move anyway move around one time my moms bike even shook for no aparent reason..what if she had been riding it when it shook is the nature of my concern i dont want to hurt anyone and i would appreaciate some help please.<br />

                  <p>The phenomenon that you are referring to is the one of "poltergeists". "Poltergeisting" is a phenomenon referred to around here as being any unintentional use of psionics (for example, getting angry and having things move about the room). Most of the time, such events are harmless, but this is not
                  always the case. At any rate, there are a few things that you can do in order to stop this effect:<br />
                  1 - as always, shielding to keep your own energy around you is a recommended path to follow. If you can shield, keeping a shield around you most of the time can help to solve the problem of geisting.<br />
                  2 - One of the methods people employ to stop geisting is to keep themselves constantly worn out. Practicing in the morning, and then againin the afternoon can keep it so that your body doesn't have enough energy to throw it off randomly.<br />
                  3 - Learn control. This is the most beneficiary long-term goal. Try to learn to control your psychokinetic force so that it only applies when you wish it to. In order to do this, attemt to *not* move objects that you are used to moving (stare at psi-wheel, and try not to unconsciously move it, if you
                  are used to sitting down and trying to spin it).</p>

                  <p>most often, people try a combination of #1 and #3 in order to stop the immediate geisting effects and learn to permanently control it. However, you are entitled to take any path that you wish (including those that are not on this list, of course)</p>

                  <p>hope that this helps - *_# TZ_</p>

                  <p>Hi!<br />
                  this is my third question and i hope ull answer atleast this one,<br />
                  Do you have to have genes for tk or can anyone learn tk? I saw a show about a guy that bends spoones hes about 40 now he bends spoons with 2 fingers ultra fast, hes said that first time he noticed that he has something special was with 4 years!<br />
                  So i was wondering do realy ounly people with something "special" can do tk?<br />
                  PS. ive been practising tk for half an year now and i can ounly move the pin-wheel. whats up with that?</p>

                  <p>It's hard to prove it either way, but I personally believe that anyone can do it. Certainly people who had no skill in it before have learned it... but it might be possible that some people can't learn it. We won't know for sure until we figure out exactly what TK is and how it works (which might
                  take a while <img src="blah.gif"

                       class="smileyImg" />. Keep at it, keep trying new things, and keep challenging yourself. I suggest reading NI's article on "Advanced Telekinesis" (if you haven't already).</p>

                  <p>umbra-kinesis = movement of shadow(s)</p>

                  <p>This is fairly simple. Either move the light source or move the object that is casting the shadow.</p>

                  <p>It is not necessarily a psionic effect, although I suppose it could be if the light or the shadow-casting object were produced or affected psionically.</p>

                  Because when i stick both hands up around it, i can move it, but when i just have 1 hand or just a thumb or finger near it, its a lot harder, and it just makes me think that the heat from my hand is moving it, but im not sure?</p>

                  Anyway, the first time i started to actually move the psi-wheel, my heart(pretty sure it was my heart) started hurting and stuff, i didnt really pay much attention to it and i continued to move the psi-wheel. Has this ever happened before?</p>

                  <p>As for the question-pending bit, you are welcome to ask as many questions as you want to, as long as they are on separate posts. This is question is on a separate post, so there is no problem with it.</p>

                  <p>As for the "heart hurting" part, yes, yes, that has certainly happened before. It _can_ be a problem, because it tends to be one of the early signs that you are pushing too hard. If you ignore the initial symptoms, and let them get more severe, you risk causing some nasty problems to your body, up
                  to and including death. If it starts to hurt, stop doing it.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>More than likely, you are dealing with a source of friction. In spinning a psi-wheel, you are dealing with a near-frictionless surface. In spinning a straw, you are fighting to overcome a static friction (the friction in order to get something moving), and then a kinetic friction (the friction
                  that is needed in order to keep something moving).<br />
                  Hope that this sort of answers your question (keep in mind that if you put the straw on the blade of a knife, or 2 knives, then you minimizse friction)</p>
