                  <p>From "Linking by Gnome":<br />
                  "The easiest method for severing a link, and cleaning up old fuzz for that matter, is the Rattle. Now I won?t take credit for this one as Rainsong introduced me to it. Basically, all you do is imagine a rattle shaking all around you. Feel the weight of it and the vibrations the rattle-filling is
                  making. It?s a surprisingly useful tool and can easily sever quick session links. Other ways to sever a link is making a shield but cutting out a square hole in it where you imagine the link coming in from. Then you attach one of those futuristic space doors that automatically open and close to the
                  side to the square hole, making the door sharp and cutting the link. That?s a method I use on and off and it works very well. You can cut it with a small bladed construct too if you wish, or just locate the link around your field, take conscious control over it and turn it to dust. It?s easy with
                  patience and practice, just keep your socks on if the link won?t sever on the first try."</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hi I have a little problem, I am currently practicing telepathy and simple mind control but lately I have found that when one of my friends or family members has intense feeling such as sadness I feel it to. At first I thought this was a coincedence but it has happened several times and all the
                  times I have been able to correctly guess who I am getting the emotion from. I was happy in the begging but now it is really starting to get to me? I read I should put up a shield but I am lost at what kind because a simple shield hasn't helped.</p>

                  <p>Thx, Cryolord</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>What you are experiencing is called 'empathy' which is loosely translated as being able to feel others emotions. This can be a good thing to aid your life, but it can also be a bad thing because of the side effects (such as being sad when another person close to you is sad). Essentially the way
                  that we stop these side effects is to put up a shield that blocks out external emotions. The typical type of shield that people choose for this is a 'bubble shield'. And then program the bubble shield to block 'links' with people, or to block out external sources of emotion/thought.</p>

                  <p>hey :) Last night I was trying to make a psiball when a car alarm went off, shattering my concentration. After a second of various curses, I closed my eyes and suddenly pictured a white VW "rabbit" . Was this a vauge form of remote viewing, or am I jumping to conclusions? Thanks!</p>

                  <p>It is _not_ remote viewing. It _may_ have been some form of clairvoyance, but there is no way to verify it, unless it connects to something. For example, if the car alarm turned out to have been from a white Rabbit, then it would _probably_ be clairvoyance.</p>

                  <p>hi.. dunno if this has already been ask but here goes... can telepathy be used to find out if someone is psychic or something?? and how would you know if someone is reading your mindwithout permission? thanks in advance :)</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1) Not as far as I know, unless the person in question already knows s/he is psychic. Can it be used to ask someone if s/he is psychic? Yes. Can it be used to determine whether someone who doesn't know if s/he is psychic is indeed psychic? I don't think so, but someone out there may have figured
                  out a way to do it.</p>

                  <p>2) There are too many variables. Generally, if you have to ask this question, you probably _won't_ know if someone is reading your mind, with or without permission, if the person is at all competent and being careful. If someone is doing it rather clumsily, most people would feel it, but they
                  might or might not know what was happening. A surface scan of the field pattern done particularly clumsily can feel like a (slightly less clumsy) reading. On the other end of the scale, a particularly careful and experienced telepath can read all but the most sensitive of folks with no discernable
                  trace of their activity.</p>

                  <p>I was wondering if anyone knew/had any theories on if, when a psi link is created, if its pretty much a "one way" (at a time) street. If I feel like I'm receiving something empathicaly, I sometimes try and respond. If what I'm receiving is strong, anything I try to send is like trying to push
                  through a magnetic field. In this case, would it be a good idea to create a separate link to the same person to send through?</p>

                  <p>Quite frankly, I have never had this happen. Perhaps if you attempted a different visualization of a 'two-way street' for your telepathy link, your sub-conscious would get the idea. However, I am always a huge fan of the 'whatever works' method. ie. if two links (one for sending, one for
                  receiving) works for you, do it.</p>
