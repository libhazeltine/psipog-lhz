                  <p>Okay this is a weird question but hey aren't they all?</p>

                  <p>Well anyway here I go. I've been practicing Psioinics for about a year now and recently I've been having this problem. When I go to get energy to form a construct or a sheild or whatever there is nothing there. There is just this big empty feeling. (I told you this was weird) Anyway whats wrong
                  with me? Or is it just my mind playing tricks on me?</p>

                  <p>That has happened to a lot of people actually. I don't really know what the deal is... I think some progress is gradual, but I think some progress is punctual - by that I mean, it happens like a light switch. I'm not sure if this is exactly what's happening to YOU, but in the past I've seen this
                  happen to people who were getting better. I think it's just a part of growing and becoming more skilled. I know that might not make sense, but *shrug* that's what I've noticed. Keep practicing, maybe you're just having an "off"-day instead.</p>

                  <p>Simplify the problem. Instead of moving the psi from your abs to your hands, move the psi from your abs, to your stomach. Just a few inches. Once you can get that, just keep creeping it along.</p>

                  <p>This is for Annie. In your article about force bubbles, you stated that when these semi-solid and solid force fields were broke they left pieces behind. To what extent are force bubbles visible to normal people by themselves(without showing obivous perforance) as in, "look this is a force bubble
                  i'm holding" and anyone can see it, then would the pieces lying on the ground also hold these attributes and be visible just lying on the ground until they dissipate? or are they present just in that you can "sense" them there? thanks</p>

                  <p>Hi, I have a question concerning where you pull energy from in order to make psi balls. Is it necessary to visualize psi pooling in your abs in order for it to actually work, or is that just a visualization tool? I have a lot of trouble using that technique, yet I think I'm making a psi ball just
                  by directing any energy that I want to use between my hands where I'm making the psi ball. Does either way work?</p>

                  <p>I am new at making shields and yesterday I decided to make a brick shield to protect myself from a bully at school. I was working on it for about 5 or 10 minutes, but then when I got done nothing happened. What did I do wrong? I gathered my energy, formed the psi ball, programmed it and visualized
                  bricks stacking up on top of each other and tried to activate it but nothing happened. Can I have some advice?</p>

                  <p>I would assume your problem is lack of skill.</p>

                  <p>Think of it like this.</p>

                  <p>An expert piano player is giving you instructions on how to play some super awesome classical music. So, you get behind the piano and start trying - but you can't do it. You follow the instructions, but it just doesn't work...</p>

                  <p>Now, in that situation, it's obvious that you just need more skill. You need to start more simple, and build your way up. That's what I think you should do with this shield situation as well. Just because you go through the steps outlined, doesn't mean you WILL succeed no matter what. There are a
                  lot of factors, and how skilled you are is a major one. Start more simple, and work your way up.</p>

                  <p>Hi there, all you people who read this. I have read quite a few articles concerning manipulating energies etc... , and I have a question: You say that everything around you is energy, and that everyone and everything is one. And therefore you can control whatever you wish by... You wrote it,
                  you'll have gotten the picture by now. Shouldn't it in theory be possible to in the same way as lifting an orange using telekinesis, you could... dissolve it? or create a new one? (I do not oppose any of the theories i have read here, on the contrary, I agree with most or all of them, and if in this
                  letter I have given the impression that I do, I don't)</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>When I wrote the "Introduction to Energy" article, I really didn't intend on it being a serious theory <img src="blah.gif"

                       class="smileyImg" />. It's point is more to move someone who thinks nothing is possible, to thinking that perhaps a lot more is possible. Ya know, like open your mind up to the possibility.</p>

                  <p>Everyone has their own theory on how psi and energy and all that works. My personal theory changes a lot, so I never really thought about writing a new article on the subject. I think it's good for people to experiment and come up with their own theory on how it works.</p>

                  <p>As for your question - I would assume the laws of Conservation of Energy would apply, which means you can't just create something out of thin air. But maybe you can? I doubt it, but who am I to say what is, and isn't possible? I think it comes down to: if something interests you, and you want to
                  do it, then work towards your goal. If you really want to dissolve an orange... go for it. People might make fun of you... but hey, you can't please everyone. And if you get it to work, that's even cooler <img src="blah.gif"
