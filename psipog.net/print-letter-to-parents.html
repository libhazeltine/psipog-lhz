   <p><em>by annie</em></p>

   <p>This is a letter to the parents of kids who want to "hang out" (that's right, you know you're hip) at PsiPog.</p>

   <p>Before I really begin here, let me take a moment to define some slang that may be used in this article and in your teen or preteen's daily life:</p>

   <ul>
      <li><u>PsiPog</u> - <i>P</i>sychic <i>S</i>tudents <i>I</i>n <i>P</i>ursuit <i>O</i>f <i>G</i>uidance, this website, this organizations, no kool-aid required</li>

      <li><u>Satanic</u> - Having affiliation with or relation to Satan, Devil, hell, etc.</li>

      <li><u>Freaking Out/Wigging</u> - You going nuts over your child's involvement before reading this</li>

      <li><u>Insanity</u> - Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result</li>

      <li><u>Lame/Weak</u> - not cool, unfavorable</li>
   </ul>

   <p>I will introduce myself while you continue to digest those vocabulary words. My name is Annie. I am a well into adulthood female (nothing's sagging yet, but the clock is ticking!) who has been practicing psionics in some manner or another the majority of my life, off and on. I am a college graduate, an
   independent contractor, a wine connoisseur, (fairly neat, likes long walks on beach and sunsets) cigar box collector. I'm probably not that much different from yourself. I get up earlier than I'd like, I immediately start doing for others, I have small debt I work (fullest time) to pay, and sometimes I use my
   middle finger when driving.</p>

   <p>My goal in writing this is to relate to you. Since I don't, myself, have children I can't relate on that level. I have several friends who have teenagers, and I do not envy them yet. By in large, between 13 and 17 the parents just shrug their shoulders and accept they'll never understand what goes on in that
   kid's head of theirs. And what, exactly, is a Backstreet Boy? I am however as I said, an adult. I'm not so adult that I don't remember the very peculiar phases I went through as a teenager, though. So I'm going to try to give you all perspectives as I can relate.</p>

   <p>As an adult. As an educated woman. As a member of a completely science/medical family. I see how you could be concerned. What we offer at PsiPog goes against everything we've ever been taught. I guess what I can only ask of you here is that you keep in mind that science evolves. We discover new theories and
   formulas every day. Other than that, I'm not really here to convince you that psi exists; only that your kid's interest isn't doing any harm.</p>

   <p>At least it's not drugs, right?</p>

   <p>And while you may feel that there are more constructive hobbies your kid could have, keep in mind that in a month that hobby may very well change to piercing. So my advice adult to adult is to just cross your fingers and hope either your kid becomes successful in his or her psi endeavors and it pays off for
   them, or that at minimum his or her next phase is not piercing.</p>

   <p>Remembering how it was to be a teenager, I make another plea with you.</p>

   <p>I remember vividly how intense I felt about any given cause then, and that intensity would only increase if my parents disapproved. You remember too, I know you do.</p>

   <p>Practicing psi has not been known to cause any bodily harm, unless completely overdone. And while you may at this point doubt your child's capacity of common sense, this is so uncommon -- nearly difficult to achieve.</p>

   <p>Utilizing the activities offered at PsiPog is not a matter of religion. PsiPog takes no stand on religion. We have people of many faiths and beliefs. We are not Satanic. Don't get me wrong, not everyone who joins PsiPog has all their marbles, but we're mostly a pretty decent organization. You are free to believe
   what you wish. PsiPog has found that practicing psi has no common tie to any religion. So, we ask that the members just keep it off-limits so everything may stay peaceful. (Next, you'll wanting us to be talk politics.)</p>

   <p>If you are questioning my sanity or Peebrain's sanity right now, that's ok. We aren't offended mostly. We're really just a couple of internet goof offs who admin and assist in running a site we never knew would get so insanely popular. We try to keep up the best we can, but despite being internet goof offs we're
   not willing to compromise the content of our site. We post articles from the author's personal experience. Obviously this relies on our word of honor, which isn't worth much to you. I ask you to keep an open mind and communicate with your kid.</p>

   <p>Communicate! Read this site first. All of it. Click every link and read it. I encourage you to know who your kid is and with what he or she is spending energy. And not just with PsiPog. Eventually, of course, the kids have to grow up and you can't screen every element that enters their life. We have nothing to
   hide. We require no jumpsuit and no kool-aid. Read. Heck, practice a little yourself some time. You know you want to try it, just a little.</p>

   <p>Kids are going to get into all kinds of things, in life and on the Internet. This article isn't to convince you of anything or try to sway you one way or another. You are the parent and this is ultimately your decision. So there is no reason to wig out. All I wanted to convey is that we're not here to brainwash
   your kids, or turn them into freaks. We don't advertise, so your kid sought us out because they have an interest. Whether a big or small interest, it's one that PsiPog -- though we can't speak for your teenager -- invites you to get involved.</p>

   <p>To those of you with seemingly naturally gifted kids, I even more so encourage you to get involved. Chances are if <i>you've</i> noticed signs, it's a big issue for your child. Be supportive. Encourage practice to learn control. Don't be weak about it, stuff like this happens. Some kids have an extra toe. Some
   unwillingly move objects across a table. C'est la vie.</p>

   <p>And at least it's not drugs.</p>
