                  <p>I think that humans, upon discovering something that they can't explain, will first use religion to explain it in some cases. A popular example of this is lightning. I think psionics is unknown, and "magick" is the explanation of it using religion. Humans need a way to understand it, so they use
                  that. Now it's becoming more popular, and science is stepping into the scene to try to understand it in a more logical way.</p>

                  <p>That's just my opinion, and hell, my opinions change all the time. It's hard to get a firm grasp on something like this <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>The only question I have is how come normal people (if there is such a thing) never encounter any of these things, like psychic attacks, vamps, astral projections, psi balls or anything of that nature. How come you only get influenced by these things when you are made aware of them... I dont have
                  any doubt in the paranormal but it does beg the question... is it all in our heads? And if so how can it effect our physical enviroment? I think we are all thinking the same thing....</p>

                  <p>Your question itself is valid. Some of the "supporting" assumptions are not, however.</p>

                  <p>Many of the effects are subtle enough that if committed against someone who unaware of the nature of the effect, that someone is likely to attribute it to a different cause.</p>

                  <p>Psiballs are only elementary exercises; someone unaware of them is unlikely to be trying them.</p>

                  <p>Projections can be odd, in that a person's fetch may be observed by a third party, but the person who projected may well remain unaware that s/he projected.</p>

                  <p>It is not "all in our heads". Even so, I will readily admit that some of it is....it is easy to delude oneself in this field.</p>

                  <p>I was wondering if there was a way that you all could find more mods and make a "training" section for those in need.....or get people on the site and ask them "What skills are you good at? Could you show us or give us a demonstration?" and then they could be trainers.....the reason is I work
                  better with one-on-one talking instead of reading and trying myself.......and i was rellly going to ask if someone would be my personal trainer but i think above was better<br />

                  <p>Don't expect to see that anytime soon. Personal trainers in the weight-lifting world are full time jobs, and expensive. I do not pay any of the authors for their time - they are volunteering. Any students they take on is their responsibility, and I don't feel that it's fair to ask them to take on
                  any students just because you learn better one on one. I don't think it's fair for me to ask the authors if they'd like to be paraded around like a circus demonstrating their abilities either. I think you demand too much - the information is available, just put in the time and effort to learn it
                  yourself.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Around the time that the word "psionics" was first coined (ie, middle of the 20th century), "psi" was used as a variable to denote the mechanism or mechanisms that allowed psychokinesis, telepathy, and similar effects to occur. The mechanism was pretty much unknown. Although several hypothetical
                  models for it were proposed, none of them withstood the experimental testing. For example, "psi" has some characteristics in common with electromagnetism, but telepathy was demonstrated to occur in conditions where electromagnatism could not function (If, at some future date, psi is demonstrated to
                  be electromagnetic after all, several "known" factoids about electromagnetism will be altered.)</p>

                  <p>Short version: if you can use it to do PK or telepathy, it is "psi".</p>

                  <p>By extension, over time, "psi" also came to be used to describe the effects themselves. (Also, in some circles, it is used to describe the people who can demonstrate such effects.)</p>

                  <p>The psi vs prana vs chi vs ki arguement gets complicated. It is largely rooted in the various theories about the nature of "energies" used in "energy work". The terms come from different cultures, and do not translate easily or directly, as a result of this simple fact.</p>
