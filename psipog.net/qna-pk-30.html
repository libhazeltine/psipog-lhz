                  <p>I suggest thinking of a solution yourself. What do you think you should do? Try it, see if it helps. Think on your own, you can't have people telling you how to figure out the most minor problems.</p>

                  <p>Everyone starts off with a bunch of random stuff going on in their head. Random songs, random thoughts, random emotions... That's normal. You have to gently push those thoughts aside and focus on what you want to do though. It takes practice. It's kinda boring, and it sucks a little, trust me, we
                  all know. We all go through it. But... it helps. If you want some simple meditation exercises, use the Search function on this site, and Google.com, or check out your local library.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I started reading up on telekinesis a while ago and soon after I learned that there were other kinesis' like pyrokinesis and hydrokinesis and such. After I learned more started reading about the different kinesis' I learned that some people can do one kind such as telekinesis but not another like
                  hydrokinesis. I was just wondering, what's the difference between moving a peice of paper on the end of a pin and moving a drop of water.</p>

                  <p>by the way, great site guys.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Telekinesis and Psychokinesis are the same thing: moving or altering a substance using "force of will" or "psi". All the sub-divisions are just part of this. A paper on the end of a pin probably has less resistance than the drop of water because of surface tension. Other than that, there is no
                  obvious difference, for most methods of approach.</p>

                  <p>That's like asking, "I've been learning to play the violin for at least a month now...why don't I sound like a virtuoso yet?" If you bend the pen with your mind, you are affecting it. Moving it how you want to is just a matter of practice and fine control of the skill.</p>

                  <p>Yes. There have been an assortment of studies with animals of various species doing PK...including, but not limited to our own species. My personal favourite is a study in which Chickens use pk.</p>

                  <p>Do you have any advice on moving pencils with TK. I can move the PsiWheel really good, switching directions and everything so now I want to move onto something else. Do I just try to move it every day until I get it? Its just hard if you havent seen anybody do it. Also, do you accept videos from
                  regular members? Thanks in advance! Great site! I've only been here for a year but it keeps getting better every day!</p>

                  <p>Whatever you do to move the Psiwheel, use that to move the pencil. The only discernable difference is the greater weight and friction.</p>

                  i never really thought about it until now, and i can nolonger seem to do it<br />

                  <p>It varies according to what I am trying to do, and the conditions in which I am doing it.

                  <p>I am able to move the psi wheel without any energy loss, I can easily roll pens/pencils. I was hoping that the next stage for me would be levitation of a small object.
