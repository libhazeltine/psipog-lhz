               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I tried a little scanning with a partner on the chat yesterday and I come up with several questions about it:</p>

                  <p>1) How come that our scannings were rather accurate while in "Shapes &amp; Colors" we played 5 minutes before that, we weren't good at all?</p>

                  <p>2) Does it always feel weird to be scanned (kinda cold with chills and vibrations starting at the diaphragm, I've conifrmed with my partner).</p>

                  <p>3) When we both tried scanning each other simultaniously, the weird feeling was completely different: intense heat, increased heartbeat rate and also higher scanning success rate. Why is that so different from a single scan?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1) You do not indicate in your question what kind of scanning you were doing, but you imply that it is not the same as the approach you use in Shapes and Colours. If I have interpreted this correctly, then the answer to this first question is "They are not the same skills". It is a bit like asking
                  why you can play the piano alright, but not the psaltery, or vice versa. If you _are_ using the same approach for both activities, there is a good chance that you had some "false positives" from less-than-precise guesses. Either that or you and your buddy simply communicate better with each other
                  than whomever you were playing Shapes and Colours with.</p>

                  <p>2) Not always. Some folks have enough skill to scan without being felt, by most folk.</p>

                  <p>3) Mutual interference?</p>

                  <p>I am a natural empath but there is something very straing about it and i am not sure if it is part of the empath apbiblity or not, when my empath abilities kick into action i'll feel a persons emotions and the like, but sometimes i'll feel there wounds too like if a person was cut i'll feel the
                  pain of the cut. on one such occaiton i was visiting a friend and duirng the night her next door naiber tried to comit suicide by slitting her rists, that night i was sitting up and with out warning (i usually get a buzzing noise in my head just before i'm about to recieve emotions from someone else)
                  emotions stating hitting at me like rocks, i felt deprestion and anger and fear but the one i felt the moast was pain intence paralizing pain, afterwerds i was left feeling dizzy and sick to my stumich so i went to the bath room and i just happend to look down at my rists and on my rist were red
                  jagged lines as if i had been cut there but not really. now my question is that, is it possible for an empath to recieve anothers wounds, or is that something compleetly differant?</p>

                  <p>If you mean "natural" in the way it tends to be used in this community, it started out as an insult: "natural freak". The short version is: if you need to learn how to do something, you're not a "natural"; if you need to learn how to _Stop_ it from happening, you are.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>A few questions about precognition:</p>

                  <p>All of my life, I've had episodes of precognition. When I was younger, I would recieve actual 'visions' (sort of appeared like an out of the blue visualization accompanied with a strong sense of 'knowing'). These 'visions' would occur during normal waking conciousness, and would occur on a
                  semi-frequent basis (roughly 2-3 visions in a 5 week period). The experiences were occasionally useful, but more often, they were simply frustrating (try telling someone that they're gonna get into a minor fender-bender on the way home when you're a cheeky 7 year-old). These 'visions' lasted until I
                  was 14. I never figured out how to control them. One day, after a particularly horrifying episode of precog., I suddenly lost the ability. It went away for about 4 years. I understand that my subconcious probably shut it off, cuz I wasn't ready to deal with it. However, roughly six monthes ago (I'm
                  almost 19 now) the precog. has returned. This time, it is not nearly as frequent, however, and it manifests now in an extreme sense of 'knowing'. If this makes any difference, my mother and father both have a history of psionic 'hiccups'. The one skill they both share in common is precog.</p>

                  <p>With that horribly long introduction to my experiences with this ability out of the way (I apologize for my lack of brevity), here are my questions:</p>

                  <p>1) is it common for the ability to manifest and go dormant spontaniously? I cannot think of anything I did to re-awaken it (outside of training with psychokinesis).</p>

                  <p>2) Do psychokinesis &amp; precognition both use the same area of the brain? I'm not sure if this is a question that can even really be answered, but I felt the need to ask.</p>

                  <p>3) Is there any way to control this ability and use it 'on command'? I don't mind the ability itself, I only mind the fact that I can't seem to control it. Granted, I've never tried (no idea how I'd even start to go about doing that, actually)</p>

                  <p>Thank you for your time, and once again, I apologize for the lack of breivity.</p>
               </div>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1) Common? Not really, but it does happen from time to time. It seems more common for it to "disappear" permanently after the teenage years, rather than have a temporary dormancy.</p>

                  <p>2) There is not sufficient data to answer this definitively. _However_ training one aspect of psionics _does_ tend to increase skill in apparently-unrelated aspects.</p>

                  <p>3) Precog is one of the easiest to practice, although not the easiest to explain. Start with the basics. Each evening, write down three "guesses" about the headlines of the next day's news, preferably televised. Include such details as what the reporter is wearing, and which reporter is covering
                  the story. Don't worry if it seems like you are making it up (and, yes, much of the time you _will_ be making it up). Just guess, and note whether it "feels" right. For some people, clearing the mind then asking a question ("Will Christiane Amanpour report on CNN at 5pm EST tomorrow, and if so, what
                  will she report about?") will get the job done. Check your "guesses" against the actual news coverage. Repeat this simple exercise for a few months.</p>

                  <p>As for the "lack of brevity" of your post....Questions with detailed backgrounds are much easier to answer. This Q&amp;A is supposed to be _about_ psychic abilities; it isn't suppsed to need to _use_ them to divine the nature of the question.</p>
