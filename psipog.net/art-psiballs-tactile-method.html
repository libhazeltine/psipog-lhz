         <h1 class="pageTitle">Seven Years of Psi Balls (Tactile Method)</h1>

         <p><em>by Peebrain</em></p>

         <p>The most popular article on PsiPog.net (at the time of writing this), is my article "<a href="art-psiball-source.html">Your Psi Ball Source (Peebrain's Method)</a>". This was the first article posted on PsiPog.net when the website was first created. After all our discoveries and growth,
         it's a little ironic that our most popular article is our oldest article. With that said, I hope to provide a good alternative to my beginner level article, and hopefully shed some light on psi balls after seven years of experience with them. I intend to do this with as many pictures as possible.</p>

         <h3>What is a Psi Ball?</h3>

         <p>Don't overcomplicate this question. It's very simple, as demonstrated by our friendly primate below:</p>

         <div align="center">
            <img src="artimg/psiball7-01.png"
                 width="542"
                 height="450"
                 border="0"
                 alt="Monkey with Snowball" />
         </div>

         <p>How do you make a snowball? Grab a bunch of snow, and pack it into a ball. How do you make a psiball? Grab some psi - and pack it into a ball. That's it!</p>

         <h3>What is Psi?</h3>

         <p>This is where things get complicated. There are different definitions of psi depending on the context, and on top of that, different people have different theories and beliefs about psi. So basically: no one knows. Everyone likes to sit around and think about it, but no one has it all figured out yet (and
         if they claim they do have it figured out, then your enlightened friend is just confused between "fact" and "theory").</p>

         <p>Here is one theory you might like. This is just a theory that some people agree with:</p>

         <div align="center">
            <img src="artimg/psiball7-02.png"
                 width="502"
                 height="344"
                 border="0"
                 alt="What is Psi?" />
         </div>

         <p>We don't need to know exactly what it is to use it and have fun with it. So let's try to mess around with it - maybe we'll figure out what it is eventually.</p>

         <h3>How do we Move Psi?</h3>

         <p>There are a lot of ways to move psi around. One good way comes from Robert Bruce's book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1571741437/sr=8-1/qid=1153840737/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-5289255-1272717?ie=UTF8">Astral Dynamics</a></em>. Bruce suggests people use tactile visualization - which basically means
         we try to feel the psi move. An easy exercise to try is to first spiral your right pointer finger on the palm of your left hand. Memorize that feeling. Next try to make that same feeling happen while not using your pointer finger. Recreate the feeling in your hand even though nothing is touching it.</p>

         <div align="center">
            <img src="artimg/psiball7-03.png"
                 width="477"
                 height="311"
                 border="0"
                 alt="Hand Tracing" />
         </div>

         <p>You can try this exercise with different movements (instead of spirals, try a brushing motion, or twisting), and on different body parts (like your knee, arm, or foot). It's pretty cool <img src="smile.gif"
              width="12"
              height="12"
              border="0"
              alt="Smile"
              class="smileyImg" />.</p>

         <h3>Building Up to a Psi Ball</h3>

         <p>With some practice with the above exercise, and the other variations I suggested, you'll start to get a feel for this (literally). At first it might be hard to determine if you are doing something, or maybe you are just fooling yourself. Don't worry about that for now - just have fun. Soon you'll realize
         you don't even need to physically touch your hand to get the feeling going - you can just think about it, and you'll start to feel the tingle. You might have felt tingling just from looking at the above image! It's pretty easy, give it a shot.</p>

         <p>What can you do with this tingle feeling? Try to make it feel differently. Try to make it feel like heat, or coldness. If you need help, stick your hand in a freezer, or over a heater to get the feeling. Then try to recreate that same feeling without having external stimulation. Experiment and play!</p>

         <p>After you get used to doing this, it's time to try a psi ball. Some people can get a psi ball right away... others take some practice. If you don't get it right away, it's no big deal. How many things have you learned that you instantly performed perfectly anyways?! Things take time - practice makes
         perfect.</p>

         <p>To make a psi ball, get that feeling going in both of your palms. Then bring your palms close to each other, and feel the sensation balling up in between your hands. Feel it.</p>

         <div align="center">
            <img src="artimg/psiball7-04.png"
                 width="336"
                 height="291"
                 border="0"
                 alt="Psi Ball" />
         </div>

         <p>There you go! Believe it or not, you are forming a psi ball! I told you it was easy <img src="smile.gif"
              width="12"
              height="12"
              border="0"
              alt="Smile"
              class="smileyImg" />.</p>

         <h3>Now What?</h3>

         <p>Now you can toss the psi ball at the ground, or just stop thinking about it and let it dissipate naturally.</p>

         <p>If you are skeptical whether you really made one or not, you might find my article <a href="art-how-to-verify-your-skills.html">How to Measure/Verify Your Skills</a> to be useful. That article has a section on psi balls, and how to make sure you really made one.</p>
