               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Can they? Probably. However, as a general rule, the major casinos _like_ having the occasional player who, um, defies the odds... You see, when people at a casono see someone else winning lots of money, they bet more. When people bet more, the casino makes more money.</p>

                  <p>(There was a major RV conference in Las Vegas a few years ago...The casinos were happy.)</p>

                  <p>Now, on the other hand, if you tend to blow up computerized equipment when you get excited and/or overloaded, the casino owners don't like nearly as much.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>"Aura vision" is the alleged ability to see "auras". Some instructions for aura-vision use eye-strain to produce an optical illusion unrelated to anything psionic. Others describe ways to perceive various parts of the energetic field around the body. There is no agreed-upon definition for exactly
                  what an "aura" is, in this context.</p>

                  <p>Natural, by definition, means that the person was born with the inclination to do that particular skill. The naturals (in TP) that I have met have been good at TP, but as a side effect have developed methods to shield themselves (even if they didn't know what they were doing at the time, with one
                  exception), so also had a little bit of practice with energy manipulation.</p>

                  <p>I have studied Chinese martial arts, uncluding chi disciplines, for years. I am, however, new to psionics. I am afraid I may be getting confused when trying to create psi balls and such. When attempting to force psi into a ball in my hands, I feel something...I can feel the cold, or hot, or
                  whatever I visualize, and I can feel a physical weight...like I'm holding something heavy...but at the same time, I can't actually feel the ball. I'm afraid I may be getting confused and forcing chi into my hands while trying to manipulate psi...the weight I feel is very similar to the weight I feel
                  in my hands when practicing Tai Chi...Could someone help me clarify this problem, and also maybe help me come up with a way to differentiate more readily between chi and psi?</p>

                  <p>Yes, certainly. If you can do anything that is objectively observable by a third party with it, the "chi" in question is also "psi". The two concepts overlap.</p>

                  <p>hi...I dont really want this posted on the Q and A board. Its just that i am a beginner and i was wondering if i could get one of the authors of this site to teach me telekinesis and psiball making through emails and msn. I would really appreciate it, it would really motivated me to be guided by
                  people who have already mastered these skills.</p>

                  <p>We get a LOT of questions like this in our inbox from beginners, and requests like this in the chat. The truth of the matter is that being a teacher is a full time job, and teaching one individual and mentoring them takes a lot of time and effort. Quite frankly, I have better things to do with my
                  time... not to be rude, but I would rather spend my free time either 1. working on my own psionic skills, or 2. work on PsiPog.net in a public area where EVERYONE can benefit (not just one person).</p>

                  <p>Please keep in mind, we do all of this in our spare time. We all have full time jobs on top of this, or are full time students. Being a one on one teacher for someone requires too much of an investment, in my opinion. There is so much beginner information on PsiPog.net in the articles, that being
                  a teacher to a newbie would consist mostly of "read this article, practice what it says, and come talk to me in a week".</p>

                  <p>If you have specific questions, we are here to help. But being a full time teacher isn't practical.</p>
