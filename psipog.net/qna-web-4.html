                  1. I can't down the Chat because it is in zip format. Do you guys have any downloads compatible for a mac.</p>

                  <p>2. All the media downloads are in wmv format. My man only has quicktime. Do you guys have any videos in that format?</p>

                  <p>I met Rainsong on a paranormal message board at Dimensional-Doorways.com . She helped me immensly, and I also got a lot of help from the online book on Active Psy (now archived on the PsiPog server at <a href="activepsy"
                     target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/activepsy/</a> ). On the board, I was getting sick of people asking how to create a psi ball, so I made a website dedicated to teaching people how to create psi balls when I was 15 (called Psi Ball Station). I was surprised so many people visted it after a
                     while, and eventually decided to evolve it into PsiPog, and accept articles on a variety of psi-related topics. Rainsong supplied a lot of the original articles for the site (and they're still online here).</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>This is actually more of a comment, but i can't figure out a better place to put it or send it and i can't seem to get the chat downloaded.</p>

                  <p>i wanted to give a compliment to the site, based on what i have read so far.<br />
                  As a professional scholar of what you are dubbing psionics, i like what you are trying to do and the efficient blunt way with which it is presented.</p>

                  <p>i am about to begin reading articles and seeing if the stuffing is as quality as the pillow looks, you know what i mean? i did want to make one comment thus far; It looks pretty incomplete to have nothing under research when there is so much being done. i thought i would grab some things off the
                  shelf that are good for beginners and done by very reputible names.</p>

                  <p>To start with, as i am sure you know the film "What the !@#$ do we know?"<br />
                  Also their site @ www.whatthebleep.com and all of the scientific and theological contributers have information about the titles of their books at the end of the film, Most of these are excellent!</p>

                  <p>There is a book mentioned in there that is worth far more than it's weight in gold, The Hidden Messages in Water, by (oh shoot, i loaned that out yesterday, Emoto, i believe it is)</p>

                  <p>Also excellent is Dr. Brian Weiss M.D. Smashingly good reference mostly about expanded conciousness and awareness through concious hypnotherepy, but this gets into the capacity of the human mind, beond what we "know". Many Lives, Many Masters is always my first reccomendation by this author. Also,
                  Messages from the Masters and Same Soul Many Bodies.</p>

                  <p>Rupert Sheldrake, The Sense of Being Stared at. This man after studying philosophy at Harvard, went on to get a Ph.D in biochemestry at Cambridge</p>

                  <p>If you want science into how and why psionics is not only proven but natural fact try, DMT the Spirit Molecule by Rick Strassman, M.D. This is not a Shulgin style book about synthetic DMT (not to disregard the Shulgins in ANY regard at all.) It is about the chemicals and electronic pulses in our
                  brains bodies and bioenergetic bodies. The science of a psi ball...</p>

                  <p>And of course for those who like the classics one of the earliest books on the subject in our century The Search for Bridey Murphy. And i have no idea who wrote this one, it has been so long since i have seen it. But many small town libraries have had it for nearly fifty years if no one swiped it,
                  like they did from mine.</p>

                  <p><br />
                  These are just some suggestions to have some basic stuff from good authority on the research page. It would add a lot of creadence to your site and your subject. Hope you find this helpful and not annoying.</p>

                  <p>i am off to read the articles.</p>

                  <p>Thanks</p>

                  <p>If you do not register your nick on a chat server, and someone else _does_ register that nick, you can't use it anymore, until it de-registers. It doesn't seem to be affected at all by how long you have used the nick. As for how to register on that particular client, we'll have to hope that
