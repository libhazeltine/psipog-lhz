                  <p>I am not sure if this belongs in this catagory. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I have many thoughts that go on in my head at once, and cant seem to clear my mind. Do you know how i can calm the multiple thought prosseses that are all happening at once so that i can focus?</p>

                  <p>That's entirely normal. Start by sitting quietly (or standing, if you're waiting in line at the bank or something...) and close your eyes. Observe the thoughts as they come through, and don't do anything about them. Just watch them.</p>

                  <p>Next step is to breathe, and just count your breaths. Count them silently as you exhale. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc... There will be random thoughts wandering through. Ignore them and count breaths.</p>

                  <p>Or, build up a picture in your imagination. Add details, bit by bit. Eventually you can take this exercise as far as playing video games in your mind.</p>

                  <p>Hi,<br />
                  lol, sorry, i ask a lot of questions..anyway, I've looked around the site about remote presence, and i've got a few questions.</p>

                  <p>1) Where did you first learn bout RP?</p>

                  <p>2)I've tried to search google for other sites on Remote Presence, but i couldn't find anything that was psi-related on it, apart from this site. Do you know any internet sites where i could learn more about it?</p>

                  <p>3)When i try to RP just my arm, for instance, would i feel like my arm was in two places at the same time? i've tried to RP only my arm, but the muscles in my arm either tense up, or nothing happens.</p>

                  <p>Ok thanking you in advance</p>

                  <p>3 - try relaxing, centring and concentration a little bit more before RPing and that may help you to feel your RP-arm a little more strongly.</p>

                  <p>Yes that is very possible, but would take an immense amount of concentration. I wouldn't advise this as you would have to be RPing constantly for about 2 hours. This is setting yourself up for 1-failure and 2-injury.</p>

                  <p>i noticed in a few of the questions that numbers are hard to predict or remotly view but colors are seemingly easier so i was just wondering if you could get you subconcieus to interprit the numbers as colors i.e one could be orange as it starts with "o" or something similer maybe a picture that
                  signifies that number and is it possible to train your subconsious to "see" numbers this way?</p>

                  <p>Thats actually not a bad idea, however you would then need to always program and reprogram your Sub. C. when you wanted to change from colours to numbers and the other way around.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Okay, well I wasn't positive where this should go, but perception seemed the best area. I tried searches on this, but I wasn't too sure what to call it. I don't know if you've ever gotten a case like this before, but I was wondering if you can sense... the past life of objects? I guess that would
                  be a way to state it. Example: I was at a restaurant earlier today and as we pulled into the parking lot, we felt and heard the car go over something. My dad went to see what it was, and he came back with a watch face, that is, there wasn't a band to it. I made a good guess that nobody wanted it, but
                  it was in pretty good shape, I mean it was still ticking after being run over by our van, and I figured I could find something cool to do with it. So I pocketed it. Literally, like I stuck it into my pocket. And I noticed a slight twinge, like the beginning of a headache, but I took it to mean I was
                  hungry. Only when we sat down at the restaurant, all of a sudden my headache got real bad and I felt really sick, like I had to go lay down in the car and I almost threw up, and I was wondering, could it be that the last owner of the watch had been sick, and that when I picked it up, I sensed their
                  feelings? And if so, what would this be called? This is the first time I've noticed this kind of thing, but recently I've been noticing more psychic activity around me, especially precog. Little things like knowing where we were going to go eat dinner or what we would have even before getting home
                  from school, or if we were planning on having one thing, but I had a feeling we'd have something else and we did. So maybe I'm having a... good streak... hehe, I guess that's baseball terminology, but it's how I can explain it. Anyway, sorry this is so long, but if you could help me, I'd be ever
                  grateful.<br />

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>My apologies Sohalia, but I see nothing that states explicitly that this is a psychic oncurence (although it may be, this could also be related to something you ate the previous day, a reaction to the food, ect.). The skill that you refer to is called Psychometry. As far as developing psionics,
                  congrats, typically as people develope perceptive skills (precog, TP, EP, psychometry, RP, sensing, ect.) they tend to have small outbursts of preception. The best ida is to keep an open mind to the phenomenon (but it sounds like you are on the right track).</p>

                  <p>The answer to this question is quite personal. Some people are able to block out other people's emotions, as well as their own. Other people are able to block their own emotions, but not those of other people. Unfortunately, the only way to find out is to try and see what happens.</p>

                  <p>Here's an interesting exercise for you to try to pick up a psi-sig.</p>

                  <p>Think of a picture of someone that you are close with. Do you have a picture? OK, think of all the things that you associate with that person, sounds, smells, memories, personal opinion, whatever. OK, now that you have your mental feeling of the person, take away the picture. Take away how they
                  sound. Take away how they smell. What do you have left. It should be a *feeling* of the person. This is a psionic signature.</p>
