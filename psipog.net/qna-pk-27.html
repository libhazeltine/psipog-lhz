                  <p>No. Cryo-PK is simply the act of cooling an object telekinetically. If you do that to your body, to the point of apparent suspended animation, you are going to suffer hypothermia, and probably die of it.</p>

                  well a while back the idea or notion came up that u can feel the physical pressure on your body when moving large objects well wouldn't that mean people with stronger body's be able to move heavier stuff?</p>

                  <p>HI!<br />
                  When I practice with the pinwheel I never use both of my hands because it never moves when i do so. When I put my left hand near the pinwheel it will always spin clockwise, never in the opposite direction, when I use my right hand it spins in the opposite direction. I'd like to ask you if this
                  happens to other people and if it is normal or am I doing something wrong. So far I've made the paper on pin rotate in already explained directions and the flame on a candle which I gotta say is the easiest to do for me. Thanks.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>i have an interesting experience regarding telekinesis that i would like to share. when i try and move the psiwheel with my hands in close proximity to it (less than na inch away), it starts out normal, but within ten minutes, my hands begin to feel a lot of pressure on them and a strong tingling
                  sensation. by visualizing the tingling as a cloud of energy, i am able ot move it from finger to finger in my hnad, and even make it dissapate completely. anyway, when i try and move the psiwheel while my hands are 'energized', there seems to be a force very similar to static electricity at work. the
                  psiwheel is attracted to my finger and even drawn upwards to it. however, it seems to repel after touching me. now, after a lot of practice, i can control the comming and going to this 'static' electric feeling, and make the wheel move either with 'normal' telekinesis (if there is such a thing :P) or
                  with the 'static' thing. one interesting thing is that it takes no concentration to move the psiwheel when i have the static feeling, and i can only attract it to my finger, never repel it. i guess iwhat im wondering is, have any of you had similar experiecnes, ad does psi/telekinesis have any
                  plausible connection to electormagnetism/electrostatics? thanks</p>

                  <p>This shouldn't surprise you - in most skills, when just starting out, you don't perform your task perfect and quickly. It takes PRACTICE. So yes, it's just as normal as not playing a complicated song correctly on the guitar after a few weeks of practice. Things take time.</p>

                  <p>TK is the same thing as Psychokinesis. All the other psionic "'kinesis" applications are subcategories thereof.</p>

                  <p>As for understanding it when we weren't born with it, I _was_ born with it. That doesn't mean I understand how it works. Peebrain and NI have a better grasp of how to explain how to do it than I do, because they learned mainly by trial and error.</p>

                  <p>Hi!<br />
                  I have read many times that when one is able to witness TK you end up doing yourself much faster since then you know it can be done. I also know that any doubt no matter how small that you have in your mind is gonna hold you back. So, why no do a video of someone spinning the PSI Wheel but a complete
                  video. Instead of showing the psi wheel already set up show the person setting up the psi wheel, putting the glass cover over it and then spinning it in one single shot. Setting the psi wheel wont take more than 30 seconds so time is not an issue. If you think it willl be hard since the person must
                  concentrate sometime before spinning it then do the opossite. Show the psi wheel already setup and start spinning it then when you are done moving it, disasemble the PSI wheel right there in the same shot so any doubt about the aunthenticity of the video is removed from the viewers mind. I know a
                  video like that will help us inmensly as no matter how much you want to trust what you are looking at, the videos outthere right now can be so easily faked that is hard to erase the doubt from our minds.<br />

                  <p>_Any_ video can be faked by a camera-man who is at all experienced with trick shots. Videos are not proof. Doing this sort of video would do nothing except use up Peebs' bandwidth.</p>

                  <p>And on the question of "doubt", I've had things work which I didn't think I could do. And some things happened that I _still_ don't believe are possible. So, the idea that "a little bit of doubt" will absolutely sabotage your work is not quite true.</p>
