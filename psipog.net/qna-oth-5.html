                  <p>try setting your alarm for an hour earlier for when you are planning to wake up. Then go back to sleep with the thought in your head that "I am dreaming". Usually that works pretty well.</p>

                  <p>1) No.<br />
                  2) You cannot relax every muscle in the body and remain alive. As you have noticed, breathing and such involve muscle movements. What they mean is to relax the various muscles that move and support the body. Translation: lay back and chill out. Don't worry if some of the muscles are not
                  relaxed.<br />
                  In any case, it is possible to project when you're not relaxed at all.</p>

                  <p>Make no mistake, when you are getting a message from your sub-conscious it is not forcing you to do anything. So, as far as how much 'free will' part of your mind has, I would say that it has as much as you do (depending upon particular religious preference).</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>These questions are about talking with your subconscious:</p>

                  <p>1. I read on another question Peebrain said that you COULD tell your subconscious to give you 20/20 vision and it was a good way to keep you healthy. What could this mean? Could you tell your subconscious to recover from say, the flu? Could you tell it to give me better psi abilities i.e. TK,
                  shielding, OBE's, etc??</p>

                  <p>2. I don't really understand the whole 'translation' thing. You practice translating emotions into words (or vice versa), I get that but how does that help me talk with my subconscious? If he is a part of me, he should know how to speak English already. I've read the "Communicating With Your
                  Subconscious" at least 6 times but it till doesn't make any sense to me.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1. Improving eye-sight is possible, and avoiding viruses is possible... they do take a certain level of skill though. Communicating with the subconscious is just a tool to explain what you want to happen.</p>

                  <p>2. "He" does know english. I can understand why it's confusing on the surface - once you start practicing, I think it will make more sense. When you quiet your conscious mind, your subconscious will communicate with you via emotions and symbols. Why? I don't know. That's how the mind works. If you
                  can get a clear stream of information, you can run that stream through the translator to get actual words. I like words. Some people don't really care and just take the emotions and symbols. Whatever works for you.</p>

                  <p>That's a good question. I tried to OBE on a long bus trip to see what would happen, but I couldn't pull it off. It's hard for me to OBE on command, so it makes it hard to test certain things like that. I've never read of a situation where that has happened, so I would be interested in the
                  results.</p>
