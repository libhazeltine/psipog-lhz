PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #16, for July 9th, 2005

"Intuition is the supra-logic that cuts out all the routine
processes of thought and leaps straight from the problem to the
answer."
- Robert Graves


Dear PsiPog Users,

Hey hey! Another two weeks have gone by, and I've got some
updates on PsiPog.net for you! I've permanently switched the
chat over to the new system, which means you can use any IRC
client you want to connect. For instructions on how to chat,
and the new rules, visit: http://psipog.net/chat.php

In the next couple weeks I will be updating the PsiPog Chat
Client so it's compatible with the new system, but until then
you'll have to rely on mIRC or some other client.

I wanted to post some new articles today so I could tell everyone
about them in this newsletter, but I decided to post them
tomorrow instead... but hey! Why not tell you about them
anyways?

The first article is by me, and is titled "How to Measure/Verify
Your Skills". The article explains different ways to test your
skills, and measure your progress.

The second article is by me, and is titled "Product Review: The
Gateway Experience - Part 1". In this article, I review The
Gateway Experience, sold by Hemi-Sync.com. In this first part,
I am reviewing the first half of the program... Later I will
write a second part on the second half :-P.

And the third article is by SunTzu, with a pending title. It's
about research into telepathy, and explains how telepathy has
been proven by science in the past multiple times. It also
discusses some theories on how telepathy works by the scientists
who performed the original tests. It's an awesome read :-).

Check for those articles on Sunday... HOPEFULLY they'll be up by
then.

Other than that, let's jump into the mail bag!

"This is a game I play with my Pyrokinetic brother. You must
start a camp fire somewhere safe and let it settle down where it
is burning steadely. You must know how to do the basics of
Pyro/Cryokinesis and have a friend of the opposite of you. The
object of the game is to keep the fire going through the time
limit(Pyro), or put it out(Cryo). This is fun, increases your
skill, and boosts your self confidence! The time limit is realy
up to you."

My comments: Cool :-). Just be safe :-).

"Hi, I am very new to Psionics, and I (like most people,
probably) have various questions about TK and Pyro. I was
wondering what is some of the biggest things anyone on the site
has moved with their mind? I was also wondering if anyone has
ever heard of lighting a cigarette, cigar, etc. with pyro and if
that was possible? I am too new, I dont even know if I am
getting the psi-ball or not to work, but just some random
questions."

My comments: NI has reported moving a rolling char, and Rainsong
has reported moving a canoe (if I remember correctly). I imagine
lighting a cigarette is possible, but I haven't heard of anyone
specifically doing that. Maybe someone out there reading knows
of some more information.

"My friend and I have been studying telekinesis for about 10
months. While we have both had success in rotating a pin wheel,
my friend is learing quite a bit slower then I am. Mostly to lack
of time to practice. I have the ability to move the wheel nearly
everyday and he has only moved it a couple of times. Can you
suggest anything I could do to help him out such as psionic
exercises. Maybe if we work together he could become "stronger".
Thanks for you help."

My comments: I haven't worked with people in person except for a
few occasions, so I might not be the best person to ask.
Nonetheless... we can come up with some ideas to try at least,
right? The first thing that comes to mind is just have both of
you try to spin the pinwheel in the same direction. See if you
can get it to spin really fast. If you can do that, try moving
something bigger, like rolling a pen or moving pocket lint. Be
sure to maintain a relaxed and fun environment... maybe make a
game out of something. I found that I could teach people the
pinwheel quickly when I showed them how "easy" it was, and gave
them the impression that they could do it, and it was fun. A lot
of it is state of mind. Maybe have two pinwheels set up, and see
who can make a full rotation first.

"I suggest that peebrain writes a small article about practical
side and use of psi during time in the Air Force. Nothing big,
just a few examples of use of psi, and what "benefits" he got
from that. I think that that would be much more motivating than
the just "how to" articles on PsiPog. Same for the other staff on
PsiPog, if they have some interesting or funny event from life
that includes using psi, why not share it with community?"

My comments: That's a good idea :-). I know people really
enjoyed reading my journals because they included real life
experiences. Why not start now? Earlier today, my friend was
listening to music and I blurted out "Foo Fighters". He goes,
"That's amazing, I was just thinking to myself, 'Who sings this
song?'". The other day I had a dream about my mom, and it
motivated me to call her and tell her about it. It turns out she
had similar events happening in real life, and was worrying about
them. In my training with the Air Force, I listen to Morse Code
and type the letters that I hear. A lot of times I will trance
out, and start to type the letters before they are even
transmitted to me. It can be a little frustrating though,
because the program will mark them "incorrect" because I typed
them too soon :-P.

"I have tried to make psi balls many times, all I feel after a
couple of minutes is my hands get hotter then usual and my thumb
my tingle a little. My friend who showed me all this gets a
magnetic feeling, I havent gotten this feeling, Have I made a PSI
ball or am I doing something wrong?"

My comments: Nope, that's normal - it sounds like you've made
one. Different people feel different things sometimes... I
personally believe it depends on the visualization, and the
psion's individual beliefs on what energy "should" feel like.

"I was reading the latest newsletter I was excied that you are
adding a forum and used this as an excuse to getting back into
psi myself. But as I read on i am concerned by one thing; I see
the value of the points system or karma system but will that
hinder those of us that may not always have time to spend keeping
up on posts or like to leave your 2 cents here and there?
Personally, psi is not an active part of my life schedule right
now, I have just transitioned from school to an 8 hour job, yet
still have the usual family obligations."

My comments: I can see where you're coming from. With the way I
plan on setting it up, it would only take 5 days, at about 5
minutes of effort per day, to enable yourself to post. I don't
think that is requiring TOO much. I don't want to make it
impossible for people like you to post and participate - but I
also want to give people rewards for participating more. We'll
just have to try it out and see if we have the right balance...
if things seem to unfair for people like you, I might shift the
requirements a little bit to make it easier.
