                  <p>I just surfed by and what do I see? Even more Articles gone... I looked forward to new Articles, not loosing any more old ones. From now on I think I'll download every single Article on this site before it again vanishes... Anyway, even if I only read one of the "Seminars and Classes" and don't
                  remember if there were some that might interest me sometime, I think it's especially unfair to take those away. I mean, they are chat logs, so they are not exactly property of their author, are they? I CAN understand (to a certain extent, though I don't approve it) if the authors don't want their
                  articles on the site any more. But I think at least the Chat Logs should remain on the site...</p>

                  <p>I agree. I am not happy either... but what can I do? The author wants the material off the site. That is their decision, not mine. I think backing up articles is a good idea, and I suggest you do so. The way I do it is click on the "Printable" version of it (the link is on the bottom of every
                  article), and then doing a File-&gt;Save As (in Internet Explorer). I'm sorry, it does suck, but new ones are being written :-/.</p>

                  <p>Is the site shutting down or something? All the stuff in the Newbies section is whipped out and tons of the articles are gone. I know that those two people took out all their articles, but still, does this mean the site is shutting down, or are they just taking theirs out. I'm worried, because
                  this is a fantastic site. I'd hate to see it go.</p>

Other authors are still here, and more and more people are writing articles, so you'll see more new stuff out there soon as well. The Newbie section will have to be rewritten now that KMiller has taken down his Intro to
                       Psionics stuff, but you'll have to wait for that as well. I'm sorry I keep saying "wait wait wait", and it doesn't seem like any work is getting done, but work is getting done.

                  <p>That is a Greek letter. It is spelled out as "psi". It is used as a variable, in this case as the "unknown mechanism" which allows such effects as psychokinesis and telepathy to happen. It was used to coin the word "psionics", in parallel form to "electronics", "nucleonics", and so on, in the
                  middle of the twentieth century, in the United States.</p>

                  <p>By contrast, by the way, "psychic" is indirectly derived from "Psyche", the Greek Goddess who personifies the mind and soul.
