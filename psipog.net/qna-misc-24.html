               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Visualization is merely "picturing something in your mind", or imagining it.</p>

                  <p>Look closely at an object...your hand, for example. Notice all the little curves and wrinkles, and how it moves. After investigating it as though you had never seen one before, close your eyes and imagine it. Repeat.</p>

                  <p>If that doesn't help....</p>

                  <p>Counter-intuitive as it might sound, try visualising complicated things. You may find it easier than the usual simple starting points. For example, imagine a bear, as clearly as you can. Then imagine some bushes around him, and some berries on the bushes, and some trees behind....and so on. The
                  more complex it is, the easier it is to concentrate on it.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Psychokinesis and telekinesis are two words used for the same phenomenon: moving or altering objects by force of will, through a nebulous mechanism called "psi", just to label the variable. The terms are often abbreviated as "pk" and "tk" respectively.</p>

                  <p>These are divided between "micro-" and "macro-" psychokinesis. MicroPK refers to alterations which require statistical analysis to demonstrate: messing with dice rolls, for example. MacroPK refers to alterations which can be demonstrated in their own right: the infamous psiwheel is a basic
                  example.</p>

                  <p>Various other terms have been coined to refer to specific macroPK applications. Pyrological psychokinesis, generally shortened to pyrokinesis, is relatively common knowledge thanks to role-playing games and b-grade movies. DMILS, which you call biokinesis ("biokinesis" actually refers to a
                  political theory, not a psionic application), is another popular one. Both they, and just about any other you might name, are part of the larger category of macroPK. And any psionic effect that alters or moves a physical substance or object is in fact "psychokinesis". Simple, ne?</p>

                  <p>People who have such disorders have successfully learned to do psionics, to various degrees. How much the disorder affects their ability, if at all, is very difficult to judge. Presumably, some of the methods that require focused attention for extended periods of time would be more difficult for
                  someone with ADD, but nothing is lost by trying it.</p>

                  <p>This, or some variant of it, is probably the #1 most frequently asked question. Because the site is frequented by minors, giving out information about location, legal name, and so on is asking for trouble. That said, you might inquire at night school and continuing education establishments
                  relatively near your home, to see if any "parapsychology" or "psychic development" courses are offered. If you are a minor, of course, this would require your parents' and/or guardians' permission.</p>

                  <p>I've got some friends who are interested in Psionics, and whenever we speak about Psionics, they are usually really excited about it and want to learn how to do it. I've given them the name of this website, but I still feel as though I should be able to give them some instruction. However, I don't
                  know where to start. Is there any recommended course for teaching others, or is it better to let them learn by themselves?</p>

                  <p>Personally, I start teaching newbies with the psi ball. It's pretty easy to learn, and most pick it up in no time. It's fun getting results quickly so you are more excited about learning other skills as well. After that, you can go into shields, maybe empathy... In reality, it comes down to what
                  they want to learn, and how much effort they're willing to put into it. For example, Not_Important jumped right into TK, and 9 months later is moving chairs and pens around. At the time of writing this, I don't think he's ever made a psi ball. He had a goal, and just focused on that. If you're not
                  really sure what you want to do, you just want to do SOMETHING, try psi balls, that's a common starting point.</p>
