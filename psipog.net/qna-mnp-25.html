               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1) If you create a shield, how long does it take for it to dissapear?</p>

                  <p>Depending on the programming of the shield, and how often you fix your shield. I've had shields last for days, and others last for hours.</p>

                  <p>2) Is it possible to program the shield to dissapear after a certain amount of time?, if so how?</p>

                  <p>Yes it is possible. Just program the shield to dissolve after the amount of time you'd like it for. This works best for me when I ask my Sub Conscious to take care of the shield. I just ask it to 'look after the shield for __hours and let it dissolve after that'</p>

                  <p>3) Is it possible to "drop" the shield any time you want?</p>

                  <p>It is easiest to see a weak flare in dim light. If you are photographing it, little-to-no light will give the best constrast. If you are just looking at it, total darkness can produce some weird optical illusions.</p>

                  <p>Psi balls do NOT have to be visible to exist. In fact, most psi balls are NOT visible. That's why the body has more than one sense - because there are things in the world that exist that you can't see. Like... wind, heat, music, some psi balls, etc... Use another sense!</p>

                  <p>Depends on the person. Could be anywhere to a few days, to a few months, to a few years. I suggest working more on psi balls until you are pretty comfortable with them, then trying another skill - perhaps telekinesis if you're looking for some visible effects.</p>

                  <p>I have often read about people sending Psi Constructs to each other. I can understand how that works. What I don't get is how someone can send a Psi Construct to someone they don't even know, over the internet, to a place they've never been, without any information about where they live, what
                  their house looks like, what the person looks like, or anything else except their internet handle.</p>

                  <p>I could see it working with precog skills, but I see no mention of that in the sending articles. So how can the Psi Construct make it to the person?</p>
