               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I'm not sure if this is the correct area to ask this, but anyway. I seem to be able to dim or shut off lights with out trying. Like when I'm stressed, or excited, or just plain happy, lights seem to flicker or completely shut off for a few seconds. Just the other day, it was my first school
                  basketball game, we were all in the coache's room for a pregame briefing. I was very excited for the game, and the lights shut off in the room for like a second. It's mostly luminecsent lights that do this(I spelled that wrong didn't I?). I've been experimenting with TK for a few months, and was
                  wondering if there was a specific way to control this spontaneous light flickering. It's getting annoying. I've tried stopping it or deliberatly trying to dim lights, but no luck. Some advice would be appreciated.<br />
                  Thanks,<br />

                  <p>Yeah, we call that 'geisting for slang. I can remember blowing three light bulbs in a row in class once for the overhead projector, and it forced the teacher to use the blackboard <img src="blah.gif"

Figure out SPECIFICALLY what triggers it. Not just "excited", but the actual thought-pattern inside of your head. The state of mind.
                       Every time you do it, analyze yourself and see if you can pinpoint it more. Then try to recreate what you pinpoint it down to.</p>

                  <p>So, I've been practicing TK for a while. And I just noticed that when my parents or my friends say it's not real, but I can move the psiwheel and stuff. I get worse at it. Is it just me? Should I stop telling my skeptic friends and just talk about it to my friends that believe me? Thanks!</p>

                  <p>That is a legitimate question. Other folks have indeed found that if, when observed by a sufficiently doubtful person who him/herself has some degree of "talent", the expectations of the observer colours the results.</p>

                  <p>Therefore, my advice would be to wait until your pk skill is up to the task of picking people up by the throat from across the room, so you can misquote Darth Vader: "I find your lack of intelligence disturbing." It's also much more fun than bopping a psiwheel in front of your high-school Physics
                  instructor.</p>

                  <p>I guess more accurately, PK is "manipulating something using psi". Terms are kind of annoying to get the technicallities down. Just use <a href="http://www.dictionary.com"

                  <p>Cardiac arrest, apparently. The heart failure _appears_ to be connected to the effect PK has on blood chemistry. Sudden drops or spikes in blood sugar, and/or blood potassium levels can kill you. A drop in blood sugar and in blood potassium has been observed in some people while "doing" pk,
                  regardless of whether the pk itself was successful. Occasionally a spike was recorded instead. I say "some people" because not everyone has been tested clinically. The blood tests are not especially difficult, though, so confirming or denying the effect can be easily accomplished.</p>

                  <p>The simple fact is this: Start with the pinwheel. Just do that exercise. Practice! Don't sit around and daydream about "one day I'll be able to do this!". You're not going to get anywhere unless you start practicing. Start with the pinwheel, and SEE how far you can get.</p>

                  <p>Hello,</p>

                  <p>I have always had an very strong empathic power, and shortly i have been seeing aura's. Then suddenly i meet a complete stranger, we befriend and start looking into PSI. I downloaded the handbook, i did exercise 1 and it worked. Although i havent been able to succesfully make the PSI ball, i went
                  ahead to the Psycho kenetics anyway. And the first time i try i succeeded. I found this very strange, so i try breathing on it, and it wont move the way it did before. So i try it again later that day, and it wont even budge. Then in the eavening, i try it again, and it worked again. I have tried it
                  at different locations. It all worked.<br />
                  So my question is:<br />
                  Am i a natural in PK without realising this all the time? And if so, do i need to find someone around to guide me and help me use the pk?<br />

                  <p>Hey, I am wanting to practice TK but since I work with a complete skeptic he has debunked the psi-wheel as static energy, which is annoying but I would rather be sure. So I was wondering; can you guys provide any insight into what I could use that would be less conductive of this static energy,
                  less reactive to it? Or should I continue using the paper psi-wheel but refrain from putting my hands anywhere near it? Otherwise can you think of a better way to test if static electricity is moving it vs psi?</p>

                  <p>If you can afford to buy a "toy" for this, get a radiometer. (They are usually less than $20, and can be purchased at science places such as Edmund Scientific.)
