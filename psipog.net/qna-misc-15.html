               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Is there any way of slowing down your perception of time, to give yourself some more time to think (on an exam, for example). I noticed that time seems to 'flow' much faster when you're not paying attention to it, like when doing something that completely absorbs you. On the other hand, when you
                  are paying attention to time, when for example doing something boring, it appears to 'slow down', so a dull 40min meeting seems to go on for half a day :P (especially if you're checking your watch every minute)</p>

                  <p>So, do you know of any technique that would help simulate the 'boring meeting' slowdown, but in a way that would at the same time allow me to focus on something else (like the exam questions ;])</p>

                  <p>It's known as "time distortion" and is a relatively common hypnotic effect. It is a useful skill, but outside the current scope of this site. You might consider a web-search for "time distortion".</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Yes, it does. It is not especially common, but does occur in some circumstances. If you do not resume breathing after passing out from lack of air, you have a problem. Therefore, either stop doing whatever qualifies as "mental effort" in this context, or be sure you have another person watching
                  you when you exert such effort....preferably someone who likes you, and who knows CPR.</p>

                  <p>Also you might want to check with a doctor, because apneas can be a medical problem: ceasing to breathe is widely regarded as "bad".</p>

                  <p>If it seems like you are watching yourself do something, it is in third-person. If it seems as though you are _doing_ that "something", then it is in first-person.</p>

                  <p>For many psionic purposes, it doens't make much difference which one you use. However, for some activities, such as the "mental exercise" thing, it is important to use first-person.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Concerning all psychic abilities. I have read alot about it and experimented with hypnosis some. Many things i have read and tried deal with, over time, changing behaviors, learning better, ridding unwanted habits, and many many other things. I was wondering if to anyones knowelege this could be
                  applied to learning psychic skills. The connmon sense answer says yes because learning psychic abilities seems not much different than any other learning. However I am mainly inquiring to whether anyone knows if this has been done. To clarify furthur, I have read in many of the articles that some
                  things are easier when in a trance. But that is not the nature of my question. I am wondering if self-hypnoisis or hypnosis could be used to sort of "condition" yourself for psychic learning. Thank you in advance :)</p>

                  <p>Yep, it's been done. In fact, some of the studies of telepathy and clairvoyance stemmed from the observation of "spontaneous" occurances of one or both of these, during studies of hypnosis.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>My parents don't know that I have psychic abilities. They wouldn't accept that fact, or believe me if I told them. I know that I am, I have dreams of what happens the next day everynight, and it's exactly the same, even if I've never heard the people, or seen the places. Things like a placement of
                  a pen, to the way a person's hair is will be the same. I know that I have this ability, and others. I've made it rain before, because I was angry, and once, I made it snow. I've also woken up to see things that weren't around my room, scattered like crazy. I just need some way to convince my parents
                  without having to DO it in front of them, and some way for them to accept me in this manner.<br /></p>

                  <p>If they "wouldn't accept that fact, or believe" you if you told them, then probably nothing short of some seriously convincing demonstrations will change their view on the matter..._if_ your assessment of their view is accurate. It might not be. Why not discuss the idea of "psychic abilities" with
                  them, in an abstract fashion to test the waters? For example, talk about the American government's Remote-Viewing program, and ask what they think of it. Or their opinion of forensic psychometry. Or their opinion of the viability of telepathy. Or "Second Sight"...you get the idea.</p>

                  <p>From the other angle, keep a record of your premonitions, and then also keep track of which were proven to be correct. Also, if you mess with the weather, record the details: how the weather was before, how long it took to change at your will, and what you did. See if your memory of things of that
                  nature agrees with the reality. Once you have your own knowledge of the degree of your skill in hand, it will be easier to convince someone else.</p>

                  <p>The obvious question, of course, is "why do you want to convince anyone?"<br /></p>

                  <p>"A noise in your head"? If you mean that the noise can be picked up with normal recording devices, then it might be an unusual skill. Otherwise it is a form of subvocalisation. A lot of people do this with words when they read slowly, and with songs when they remember bits of tunes.</p>
