                  <p>When peebrain said that we are thinking of a billion things a second does he mean that we are thinking all of them at the same time or seperatly but very quickly. I have learned or was told that the human mind can only proccess one thought at a time and can not have two thoughts at once. Can
                  someone please prove me right or wrong?<br />

                  <p>I have also heard that we think of one thing at a time. I heard that we switch in and out of consciousness a bunch of a times per second. Just stuff I heard... not exactly how you could prove that you only think of one thing... you'd have to define what "thinking" is, and that's not exactly easy

                  <p>When I say that we are thinking of a billion things a second, I mean that there are a lot of things going on through your head that you aren't completely aware of. You are moving your hands, you are shifting your weight, you are turning your head to hear something in the other room, you are
                  darting your eyes over a monitor, translating shapes into letters, into words, into sentences, into something that you comprehend inside of your brain. You are listening to music, perhaps tapping along. You have one hand on your mouse, moving the pointer around by moving your arm muscles. See? A

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Rather a broad question you have there. Some drugs do dampen psionic ability. Some don't. You would probably be surprised at how many have been tested.</p>

                  <p>In some cases, drugs prescribed for the treatment of certain neurological disorders appear to improve the psi abilities, as they stabilize brain chemistry or bring seizures under control and so on, making mental activity a little easier. Of course, some conditions which require medical attention
                  would make psionic activity unwise. An obvious example would be hypokalemia, because psionic activity will make it worse.</p>

                  <p>I suspect that the "drugs" to which your question really refers are the "recreational" sort. There have been studies of the effects of a wide variety of drugs --legal and otherwise-- on psionic abilities. With the exception of caffeine, the effects common drugs were consistently negative. That is
                  to say, when studied objectively by people who were looking for something to make people's psionics work better, the drugs in question were found to be unhelpful...in some cases, _very_ unhelpful. Caffeine's effects were variable, and appear to make some people more vulnerable to telepathic
                  reception.</p>

                  <p>Think about it, though. "Recreational" drugs affect the nervous system. If you are trying to learn psionics, you need your nervous system to function correctly. Mucking it up is stupid. Long-term effects of some popular "street drugs" are still unknown. Long-term effects of drugs that have been
                  around for a while are being discovered now. In many cases, the long-term effects have been different from what was expected.</p>

                  <p>Anyone who says they get better perception while "high" is to be regarded with suspicion unless or until the alleged improvement in the perceptions is demonstrated by comparing records of the accuracy of perception when "high" as compared to when the person is not drugged. When a person's
                  judgement is impaired, that person cannot judge the situation clearly....That's what "judgement is impaired" means, after all.</p>

                  <p>Wouldn't it be better if people learned to do stuff themselves?<br />
                  Alot of people complain that methods don't work or ask others for theirs to try but personally I think that self discovery is the best.<br />
                  I for myself discovered (I'm not a natural, I intentionally did so) how to manipulate psi energy when I was about eight years old and it's been easy for me ever since, using my own method.<br />
                  (In fact when I've first tried to search for it on the net, I've searched "magic" because that what I thought it was. When I've found only rituals that include candles and chanting I've abandoned it and looked for what I kenw ["where is the part about gathering energy and doing stuff with it?"]. That
                  way I've found psionics).</p>

                  <p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not against articles and manuals and of course I'm not against sharing methods, but I think that we should also reccomend people to discover stuff themselves.</p>

                  <p>I have some thoughts/questions related to the communication with your subconsious: Peebrains article "Communicating with your Subconscious" gives me the impression that the main problem is to 'hear' the answers that your subconsious gives, whereas getting the message to your subconsious seems
                  pretty easy. The same goes for pendling, where 'asking' isn't the big deal, it seems.</p>

                  <p>On the other hand, when making psi balls or performing tk the hard part seems to be to get your subconsious to grasp the idea of what you are planning to do by using various visualizations (again, that is just my impression that I get from reading the articles).</p>

                  <p>Isn't that weird? Why is it so easy in some cases and so hard in others.</p>

                  <p>Can you shed some light on this?<br />
                  (Maybe your subconsious actually knows all the time, that you want to perform - say - tk and the problem is just that it doesn't know how to do it. So you would just need to sit there, think 'do pk!' and wait, until your subconscious has figured out how to do it by trial and error... I had some
                  success in doing pk lately, so I can say from my own experience, this theory would make things easier than they are <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>The problem with hearing:<br />
                  You are thinking a billion things a second, and ignore most things that come from the subconscious. So the hard part in receiving something is to shut up.</p>

                  <p>The problem with telling/asking:<br />
                  You are asking for a billion things a second, and the subconscious can only put so much effort into one thing. So, quit asking for so much. I.e., focus.</p>

                  <p>They are both big deals. Usually if you are listening for something, you are focused, so asking is relatively simple at that point. You don't have to listen to ask for stuff though, so some of the beginner articles just get the audience to ask, and see what happens.</p>

                  <p>I mean I know I'm not like everyone else in a specific matter of speaking...In short I know that this might sound stupid but when I was younger when I had a nighmare electrical devices suddenly turn on. Or when we had a major blackout in out town I was all alone and everything was turned off even
                  my neighbors had nothing that worked but only T.V. in our house worked only because I was watching it when I stopped it turned off. I tried to just forget about those days but I can't it keeps me thinking and I thought if it could be a new kind of psi power. But also ever since I discovered this site
                  I've tried TK...and other things but they just won't work, the only thing that can work is a psiball which is pathetic.But my point is if you could explain to me if this really is a new type of psycic power or if it's old news, and do you think you can help me control it. Oh ya by the way I'm 13</p>

                  <p>Unintentional interference with electrical devices is a relatively common form of "poltergeist", in the "accidental pk" use of the word. If you want to learn to control that sort of thing, work on psychokinesis, shielding, and the rudiments such as grounding and centering. No one ever claimed it

                  <p>Are you sure that lowering your heartrate below your resting rate is a good idea? Would you not be, perhaps, better advised to get into better physical condition, thus lowering your resting rate, which is a reflection of the efficiency of your cardiovascular system? Slowing your heartrate below
                  its capacity to sufficiently oxygenate your blood sounds counter-productive.</p>

                  <p>Don't you feel that the Psipog community should come out from the underground? Go public? The individuals who I have read about on this site sound like amazingly gifted people. Schools could be set up to help their training run more efficiently, and they could be used to greatly benefit mankind.
                  Telepaths and other sensitives would make great advisors to world leaders, for example. Telekinetics could aid in construction, or prevent great disasters (such as floods or fires) So many lives could be saved from these abilities, yet they seem to be kept to the Psions who have them, to further
                  their own purposes in general, or to show off, or do nothing at all. I guess that the publics reaction could worry some, and religious figures could attack us too, but I was just wondering if there was some other reason, or if you just felt that an underground organisation would be better for our
                  learning.</p>

                  <p>This is hardly an underground community, in spite of the whimsical introductory page. It is open to the public, rather than being hidden away behind passwords.</p>

                  <p>You say that it "seems" as though psions do not perform the sorts of services you mention. I applaud your careful phrasing. Things are not always as they seem.</p>

                  <p>That's a pretty common "dream"... there's one problem. The dream seems to go like this:</p>

                  <p>we are here-&gt;do something-&gt;everyone in the world loves psi and teaches and are rich and everything is great</p>

                  <p>It's that "do something" part that is unclear. What <i>exactly</i> do you want me to do? I figured this website is a pretty good first step in becoming less "underground".</p>
