                  <p>So, here's the thing:</p>

                  <p>I've been practicing the psiwheel thing for about 5 days, following the guides on your website, but it doesn't move.</p>

                  <p>Or actually, on the second day, it did move a little, when I walked over to it, it spun, but then I walked back to my door, and walked over to it again, and it moved again, so I passed it off as my walking that made it spin.</p>

                  <p>So anyways, I've tried visualization, talking to my subconcious self, believing, focusing, meditation, and all that razz, and it still won't work.</p>

                  <p>Am I just incapable? Because one article says that anyone can do it, but I'm starting to doubt that's true for my case.</p>

                  <p>Anyways, thanks in advance ^_^</p>

                  <p>Five days is a bit hasty to start using the word 'incapable' (I do not think anyone incapable of this), keep practicing it you aim to learn. Whether you are moving it or not, you are building skill.</p>

                  <p>This may be more opinion than question, but it seems to me that all of the various terms for psychokinesis are kinda, well, made up. (insert greek or latin root here)-kinesis seems to just confuse poeple and encourage fluff. Am I right, or is there a point to these terms?</p>

                  <p>Do I need to practice the basics of telekinesis before I try aerokinesis, and is aerokinesis a real ability?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>"Aerokinesis" is one of the slang terms for a specific use of telekinesis/psychokinesis. Usually, when people use the word, they are meaning the formation of gusts of wind by manipulating the air molecules. Therefore, as far it goes, it is a "real ability".</p>

                  <p>Influenced by psionics-rules in role-playing games, various people have added Greek (and even Latin) modifiers to "-kinesis" (roughly "movement"), to make up new words to describe specific applications of the basic telekinesis/psychokinesis. Telekinesis and Psychokinesis are the same thing.</p>

                  <p>As for practicing the basics of Telekinesis first...no, by practicing the telekinetic movement of air, you _are_ practicing the rudiments of telekinesis.</p>

                  <p>I have some ideas for advanced TK fun stuff to do. Now if you were to make a force bubble and form it into a cup, it would be neat to pour water in to test its stability. Then try freezing the water with cyroPK. And if the force bubble was an odd shaped cup you would have an ice sculpture.</p>

                  <p>Im not asking if its posible or how long it will take to do it. I just want an opinion from others on the fun scale or tell an alternate version you thought up or somthing like that.</p>

                  <p>Short answer: no.</p>

                  <p>More useful answer:</p>

                  <p>Ice is frozen water. And, "Cold" is the absence of "Heat".</p>

                  <p>In theory, a sufficiently skillful Psychokinetic could pull water from the surroundings and freeze it into a blade-shape (or a ball, or a rose, or a puppy-dog....). Doing this without pulling the moisture from your own eyes, skin, lungs, etc would be difficult.</p>

                  <p>Ice has energy, but there is no such thing as "pure ice energy".</p>

                  <p>What is your pendulum suspended from? If you are holding it in your hand, it is more likely fine muscle movement than psychokinesis. If, by contrast, you tied the end to a solid object, then it probably _is_ psychokinesis.</p>

                  <p>Hi, im currently trying out pyrokinesis and on the net i read that if you learn it one day you will suddenly spontaniously combust. is that true or will you live happily ever after and not a toaster stroodle?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Insufficient data is available for this one. I am unaware of any reports about the people who have (allegedly) succumbed to spontaneous combustion having ever attempted -- much less practiced -- pyroPK. Likewise, I've not heard of anyone who _has_ practiced it experiencing spontaneous combustion.
                  However, I suppose that it is possible that if you practice long enough (presumably more than a few decades, because I have not yet combusted), you might catch fire yourself.</p>

                  <p>One the other hand, there are people who claim that you must court frostbite and hypothermia in order to practice cryoPK. Their claim is demonstrably false.</p>
