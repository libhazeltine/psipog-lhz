PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #1, for September 14th, 2004

"In the cultivation of the mind, our emphasis should be not on
concentration, but on attention. Concentration is a process of
forcing the mind to narrow down to a point, whereas attention is
without frontiers."
- J. Krishnamurti


Dear PsiPog Users,

Hey! Welcome to the first bi-weekly newsletter for PsiPog.net.
The plan is to send them out every other Tuesday. Why Tuesday?
I don't know. But that's the plan :-D.

So what's going to be in the newsletters? Pretty much anything.
My main goal is to give you guys some cool ideas and exercises to
try, and to keep you updated with what's going on at PsiPog.net.
I'd like to have other cool sections for the newsletter, perhaps
if someone has a really good question about Psionics, or they
made a cool exercise, or website.

I'm open to suggestions :-).

So let's start off with something really cool for the first
newsletter. Hmmm...

I'm getting kind of sick of writing about newbie stuff, so let's
talk about something a little more advanced and fun. How about
shields? Here is a cool idea for a shield that I've used in the
past to get rid of annoying things floating around me:

=================================================================

Create a shield with multiple layers, and spikes sticking out of
the outer layer. Make sure the shield is solid, and then for the
tricky part: start rotating each layer in a different direction.
For example, make the inner layer rotate around you from left to
right, the middle layer from right to left, and the outter layer
from left to right. Now partition the shield into sections, so
that your upper body is rotating in one direction, and your lower
body is rotating in the opposite direction. Get it spinning nice
and fast, and keep it up for a little bit.

The main goal is to rip clean any links that someone has made
with you telepathically. Sometimes people are a little rude and
decide they want to link with you even though you don't want them
to - this shield can help rip those links out, and keep them out.

And of course: just sitting there visualizing it doesn't mean it
will work right away. You need to actually MOVE the psi around,
and program it to act accordingly. How do you accomplish
that? The dreaded P word: Practice!

Practice practice practice. Start simple. This shield has been
useful to me in the past, but it takes a little bit of skill.

=================================================================

Hmmmm, how about an easier exercise for you new guys out there?
Let's define a really cool term that everyone should know about.

Biofeedback - The technique of using monitoring devices to
furnish information regarding an autonomic bodily function, such
as heart rate or blood pressure, in an attempt to gain some
voluntary control over that function.
(dictionary.com)

So what's that mean? Technically, it means you get some equip-
ment to measure a body function (like heart beat), and you use
the equipment to help you get control over your bodily function.

But how does that relate to psionics? Well, using biofeedback,
you can learn to control some subconscious function of your body.
Now let's think for a second - if manipulating psi is a
subconscious bodily function, then we can use biofeedback to get
some control over psi. So how do we do that?

Visualization!

Now for a cool exercise. Go to your local grocery store, and if
they're anything like they are here, you have one of those arm
things that grab your arm, and measure your blood pressure. It's
like you stick you arm through this tube thing, and the tube
fills up with air, and slowly let's the air out to measure your
blood pressure and heart rate.

So stick your arm in there, and close your eyes. Hit the start
button, and visualize yourself running around playing soccer or
jumping off of a building and falling really far. Or running
a race against someone, or fighting some bad guy. See if you
can get your heart rate to go high just based on the
visualization. After you get some readings, try a different
approach. Visualize yourself laying down in the summer, with a
nice breeze going over you. Visualize the nice weather, and soft
grass. Pretend to breathe in the fresh air. See if you can get
your pulse to go lower.

=================================================================

Alright, I don't want to type too much, because then you guys
will expect a huge newsletter every two weeks, and I don't know
how long I can come up with new stuff :-).

I have a new article from SunTzu, which I'll be posting online
today, so everyone check back to read it. It's good information.
Also, I have three gmail.com invitations for you guys. If you
want a gmail account, then click on one of these:

Thanks for reading, and be sure to send in suggestions,
questions, ideas, web links, and anything else you find
interesting. Perhaps I'll put it in the next newsletter! :-D
