               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I posted a Q&amp;A topic a couple weeks ago, so if you already answered these questions, just ignore this, and sorry if it's annoying.</p>

                  <p>Anyway, I have a few questions, mostly relating to Manipulation and a couple on sensitivity.</p>

                  <p>1) What do you think I should work on after being able to make psiballs for a couple months? I can make constructs and such, but what should I move on to?</p>

                  <p>2) The purpose of a shield (for the most part, i.e., not combat) is to block empathetic and/or telepathic signals from others, right? So, does this mean when you become sensitive to other's thoughts, (you can pick up a sig, and can send and recieve) that you can "hear" other people's thoughts,
                  even if you don't want to? The reason I ask is I would like to become more sensitive to these, to improve my sending and recieving, so should I practice shields, too?</p>

                  <p>3) This is kind of related to the above question, but from the articles I've read, are non-sensitive people unable to feel pings, and can you still link and send to them, or scan them? Because I don't know any psions around me...</p>

                  <p>4) I know there was another question on this, but have you figured out this PsiPog Chat Client error?:</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1) Shields are cool. Might want to try some practice with your friends - try sending a certain type of construct to each other, and see if the person can feel how you programmed it. There are all sorts of cool games. Or move onto telepathy games, or TK. Whatever you're interested in.</p>

                  <p>2) If you want to "hear" stuff, you better practice shields. Shields are your way of controlling how much you "hear". Chances are, if you're just starting out, it won't be a big problem. In the future, and you're sitting in the middle of a crowded movie theater, and all of the sudden you start to
                  "hear" everyone, things can get real rough, real quick. Learn to shield early.</p>

                  <p>3) Not really. If it has a LOT of oomph, you might be able to get a normal person to feel it... probably because it could cause them a headache, not because they felt the actual ping though. If you want to meet people who are into psionics, I suggest just mentioning it to your existing friends,
                  and maybe one or two of them would be interested in it. Or you can practice online in the chat room.</p>

                  <p>4) As the error message says, if you keep receiving that error, e-mail peebrain@psipog.net. Just do what it tells you to do, and it'll work out <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>As for changing the shape, sure, of course. They would no longer be psiballs, however. Psiballs are round.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>A 'psipet' is an accumulation of psi programmed to resemble a living organism. To create one gather psi and program it to mirror the shape of an animal you had in mind. For example if you were to create a cat, you might program it to have four legs, a tail and a head. You can also program the
                  construct to feel like the animal in mind. A snake would be scaley, a giraffe would be fuzzy. Lastly you can program the construct to mimic the animal's behaivour or movement. The construct could be programmed to slither, climb or just walk.<br />
                  <br />
                  A reminder that the 'psipet' is not a real pet. It does not have emotions or feelings or needs. So do not neglect your real pets!</p>
