                  <p>You answered the flying question with "The Peter-Pan thing would involve tk, by definition, if indeed it can be done." THEORETICALLY, could you also create a force-bubble-ish construct in a different shape (like a "force disk" :)) and "ride" it? It seems to me that this might be easier than
                  lifting up your entire body with TK, since it's less of a sustained effort.</p>

                  <p>Hi,<br />
                  Smetimes I have this deja vu thing before it happens, and I can see it all clearly but it never actually happens. Can you help me out here?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Your question is unclear, but it looks like you are referring to something other than deja-vu. Deja-vu is a sense of recognition, in a new situation, of something unfamiliar. For example, if you entered someone's house for the first time, and it seemed like you had been there before, because it
                  felt familiar and you recognise the drapes, and furniture, and pictures on the mantle, that is deja-vu. Sometimes it is the result of having had a precognitive dream about it, which had been forgotten, and seeing the actual room reminds you. Sometimes it is the result of something wrong in the brain.
                  Sometimes it's just an association thing...those drapes are kind of like the ones at Grandma's house, or Auntie Betty's.</p>

                  <p>You might be trying to ask about apparently-precognitive visions. I say "apparently" precognitive, because many such visions are not actually pre-cog at all, but fantasies derived from other sources. If they generally do not "actually happen", they are probably not psychical/psionic in origin. (If
                  you take obvious steps to prevent something based on such visions, and those measures work, then they might or might not be considered precognitive, clairvoyant, etc. Jury is still out on most of those kind.)</p>

                  <p>Your subconscious is part of "you", and yes, sometimes it makes up answers, and sometimes your conscious mind over-rides whatever the subconscious is conveying.</p>

                  <p>If you want to double-check answers, as when Pendling for example, write the questions on index cards, shuffle the "deck", and spread them out face-down. Pendle over each card without looking at the question first. Adding some questions with obvious answers to this deck will help evaluate your
                  accuracy.</p>

                  1) Is the Loch Ness Monster swimming in my bath-tub at this moment?<br />
                  2) Do most dogs have eight or more legs?<br />

                  4) Do I live in a treehouse?<br />
                  5) Is my kid brother a dash-hound? (If you don't have a kid brother, this might affect the answer...)</p>

                  <p>Lucid dreaming and OBE are not the same thing. OBE can be done while lucid-dreaming, but without some sort of outside confirmation (such as a witness Seeing your "fetch"), you won't have any way to tell whether the OBE was real or dreamed.</p>

                  <p>Can someone tell me if this was phasing or partially an obe<br />
                  ok here it is. I was at my grandparents house and I decided to take a nap. When I woke my mind (the subconsious1) decided to try and oobe. I tried it and felt like I was being lifted out of my body and i saw part of my back (with my eyes closed). then I got shot back in my body and I felt like I
                  phased through the floor (b/c it really did hurt like h*** and I was in full body paralysis. Any theories?</p>

                  <p>"Felt like" you phased through the floor...? Did you go through it or didn't you? Did you "fade out" or no? Other things can cause roughly the same sensation. Paralysis was not a symptom nor a sign of it, in my experience. Therefore, from your description, the "phasing" part of your question is
                  inconclusive, and cannot be answered from your description.</p>

                  <p>That is sounds like you did, is one of two things:<br />
                  1) started an OBE, but "re-entered" too fast, or<br />
                  2) dreamt of it just before waking up.</p>

                  <p>hey i have a few questions. first of all, i believe in physical teleportation and so do many other people. so why aren't there any basic techniques or any at all? well at least i think there aren't any?? are there? i really wanna learn dispite all the warnings i got from others. i'm very carefull
                  at what i practice. i would also like to know what it would look like if someone or something teleported. would it slowly fade away, or disappear in the blink of an eye? or perhaps a flashy spectacle?( wouldn't that be fun?) thanks.</p>

                  <p>The fact that something is possible (and teleportation is, indeed, possible) does not necessarily mean that the something is reliably-produced enough to allow for the teaching thereof. In fact, even activities that are reliably repeatable are not always teachable by the people who can do them.</p>
