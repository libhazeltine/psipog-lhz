                  1. what do you mean by "leaving your body" when your talking about obes.<br />
                  2. i think i have had 2 obe's, but im not sure if it was one. they felt real, and before i wake up, my eyesight is pitch black, like im blind! how can i tell if its real or not?<br />
                  3. does it really take 6 monthes(atleast for peebrain) to actualy have a obe? i dident think it would take that long of practice...</p>

                  <p>1. Think of moving your consciousness outside of your body. Kind of like a video game, where the camera is floating around, but the body is somewhere else. Your "camera" doesn't have to stay in your body all the time in real life either! (it seems <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>2. Well, if you wake up at night, chances are it's going to be black. Night is dark, you know? But other than that, a lot of times you can't tell if ONE weird experience is something or not. You have to try to recreate the weird experience, so you have a LOT of weird experiences, then you can try
                  to draw conclusions from them.</p>

                  <p>3. It took me 6 months, yes. Will it take you six months? Beats me. Practice until it works. If it takes you a week, cool, if it takes you six months, cool, if it takes you 3 years, cool. Just do it! <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>That is a reasonable question. Fact is, I can "turn off" the sensation of pain in my body, under most circumstances. However, in my experience, every bit of concentration and effort was needed to extricate myself from the phasing problem. Pain-blocking was an "extra" that I simply could not
                  "afford".</p>

                  <p>Safely? Phasing safely? Sure, if you do it the way Peebrain and Annie did for their April Fools' joke, or the way "Shadowcat" does on the X-man movie: trick photography. Otherwise, no, it is no safer than any other large-scale psychokinetic effect, and rather less so than most.</p>

                  <p>I understand what biofeedback is, kind of. From the (admittedly small amount of) research that I've done I got a bit confused. I saw a picture on one of the sites that I visited with a picture of a kid with electrodes stuck to his forehead. Is this a practice that requires machinery?</p>

                  <p>You don't need machinery for biofeedback. Maybe for more scientific results, with something you can measure, but for general "messing around trying it out", you don't need extra stuff - just a body <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>There are two ways that I figure out when I'm out of body: 1. I feel crazy vibrations and loud rings, then I can feel myself float away from my body, or 2. I don't really know, but I can figure out by sticking my hand through something, or by floating lightly. You have a feeling of weightlessness
                  which can help you figure it out.</p>

                  <p>For your second question - movement is pretty easy, use your willpower, or "walk", or sometimes when I get stuck I use weird visualizations to "convince" myself to move, like jet packs stuck to my back or something weird like that <img src="blah.gif"

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>"Deja vu" is the (usually startling) recognition that you have seen or otherwise experienced a situation before. Quite a lot of the time, it is nothing more than "something" in the situation being very like an earlier event that you don't quite remember the specifics of. That earlier event might
                  be real, or it might be a scene from a book or movie. Sometimes, it is the sudden realisation that a precognitive dream --forgotten until that moment-- is playing out in real life. Other times, the circumstances are something else again; they are not all easily pidgen-holed. The fact that memories
                  aren't quite so unchangeable as people commonly believe complicates matters considerably.</p>

                  <p>Short version, though: most of the time, reported incidents of "deja vu" have nothing to do with actual precog.</p>

                  <p>I found a few sites on the internet providing audio files for download that guaranteed an OBE within 8-10 minutes, or your money back. I had a few questions about this, since it made me curious.</p>

                  <p>1) Does this really work? Could you really have an OBE just by focusing and listnening to some mp3 on your computer? And if so, and it is really that easy, how come it takes most people six months to learn how to do an OBE without it?</p>

                  <p>2) Would using this method of inducing OBEs help or hinder your ability to have an OBE the "normal" way? Like, if you used the computerized method enough, would you become accustomed to that and only be able to do it that way, or would that get you used to it enough so that you will be able to do
                  it the regular way? (Sorry if that didn't make sense :-\)</p>

                  <p>3) Finally, do you recommend such a thing? What are your opinions on this? I'd never seen anything like this mentioned before around here, so this was all new to me, and before thinking of looking into something like this, I thought it would be better to get some thoughts on all of it.</p>

However, there are sometimes abreactions ranging from headache to grand mal seizure. Several cause hallucinations, especially the "guided imagery" kind, but I would be very surprised if any of
                  them force a verifiable "OBE".</p>
