                  <p>Hi I am a new member, I just would like to ask, Have you heard of the JREF ( James Randi Education Foundation )?<br />
                  Well James is in research of the paranormal and supernatural, Not that I am calling anything you do paranormal or supernatural, I am acutally interested in it and have tried these amazing things but never became sucessful, But JREF is offering a $1,000,000 dollar prize for anyone who has been able to
                  do kinesis, or any supernatural things, I think you should have a representative go out and attempt this, so you can prove to the world that kinesis is real while also benifiting from a huge check made out to Psipog, So Please please check out the site so we can show the world that this site isn't
                  fake or any kinesis is fake and to show it is 100% real, This will kill anyones beliefs that kinesis isn't real and will try kinesis out also, So here is the site <a href="http://www.randi.org/"
                     target="_blank">http://www.randi.org/</a><br />
                  Please repond I am trying to benifit the site with this and also the world so please do this for me... Thanks in advance! You guys are great!</p>

                  <p>Born? As opposed to decanted or hatched? Actually, chickens have demonstrated rudimentary microPK, so "hatched" is an option. It appears, so far, that many people who have shown no previous evidence of ability in psionics can learn at least the rudiments of these skills. Some people appear to be
                  unable to learn certain ones, and some skills are more easily learned than others. It is unknown whether everybody is capable of learning at least some, but the minimum requirements seem to be fairly low.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Ok first ill give an example when we start out as a fetus we are quite small when we get older we grow, in order for matter to not be created is that saying that the amount of matter in our fetus stage is the same amount of matter we have right now? What im trying to do is explain that I think the
                  "matter cannot be created thing" is hogwash..heh maybe I learned something wrong</p>

                  <p>eonthepeon asks:<br />
                  If our energy can be percieved by one or more of our various senses thus stating that it is a form of matter and it is said that matter can not be created nor destroyed then how is it that we can regenerate/lose energy?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>I put your two questions together because they concern basically the same thing. You have learned a little Physics and have not yet learned the context for the "law" in question.</p>

                  <p>The "matter/energy cannot be created nor destroyed" does not refer to a single organism, but rather the system of which the organism is a part. Matter and energy can be converted to different forms.</p>

                  <p>For example, carbohydrates "burn" to release heat and water (with or without other byproducts, depending on how cleanly they burn and how many impurities are involved).</p>

                  <p>In your fetus example, the child in question is acquiring both energy and matter from the mother. Once living free of her womb, the child either takes in more energy and matter to maintain itself and grow, or it dies. Either way, the energy and matter still exist, just not necessarily in that one
                  person.</p>

                  <p>The fact that a form of energy can be detected by our senses does not make it matter: we can detect heat, we can detect movement, we can detect pressure.</p>

                  <p>The stuff referred to as "energy" used in psionics is another question entirely: it is probably some kind of matter. Its exact composition is still in question. It might be a particle of some kind. (The mechanism for gravity is likewise still in question. The hypothetical "gravitron" particle is
                  not proven.)</p>

                  <p>Like all sciences, Physics has some missing parts, surely, but before dismissing it as hogwash, it might be wise to investigate it further.</p>

                  <p>I'm stumped, how exactly are you supposed to awaken your third eye.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>There are two kinds of "third eye". One of them is a physical structure on certain kinds of reptiles. The other is a "chakra", a supposedly energetic structure mentioned in certain religious beliefs: Hindu, Theosophist, and some of the New Age religions derived whole or in part from Theosophy.</p>

                  <p>Given the phrasing of your question, my guess is that you are referring to the Theosophist version. A quick web-search on "Theosophy" should find a great deal of information.</p>

                  <p>There are many people who believe that chakras are necessary in psionics. In fact, I've been told many times that I'll never be able to do any psionic effects unless/until I believe in chakras. However, so far my lack of belief in these things has not noticeably inhibited my efforts. That said,
                  I've seen "chakras" on some people, but only folks who believe in them. Therefore, until presented with evidence to the contrary, I will proceed on the assumption that they are some kind of construct.</p>

                  <p>I understood your question the first time. The gist of it does not change merely because you do not like the answer. As for "would it hurt you incredibly?"...that would probably depend rather heavily on who or what "it" is, and why it is attacking you. What kind of moron goes around annoying
                  dangerous entities? Psionics _can_ kill, so presumably "dangerous Its" can also. There are assorted lesser dangers as well.</p>
