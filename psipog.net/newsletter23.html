PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #23, for December 18th, 2005

"The principles you live by create the world you live in; if you
change the principles you live by, you will change your world."
- Blaine Lee


Dear PsiPog Users,

Yooo! Sorry for the week delay in this newsletter - it seems
I've been having trouble lately keeping up with it. But never
fear! I think this newsletter is cool, and I appreciate everyone
who contributes and reads (i.e., you!) :-). Thanks for all the
help.

Since the last newsletter, I have been posting links to blogs in
the PsiPog news. Blogs are basically like online journals that
anyone can read - the blogs I have been posting are online
journals of people talking about their current psionic endeavors.
To see mine, surf to: http://psipog.net/blog/

Other than that, there is a TON of mail. So let's dive right in.

"Hi PsiPog.net I've just joined your community after wanting to
learn about telekenisis. My family has had a strong history of it
and we often see future events in our dreams and/or have déja vu.
I attempted the psi wheel exercice and was very disapointed when
I saw little to no results. This is my first day but I thought
I'd be able to do a little more. I have recently been ill and I'm
tired. Does that make a difference? Are there any other exercices
or techniques? I'm pretty sure I can bend candle flames as I was
doing so in church today except it may have been coincidence but
the flame was bending in the right direction. Any advice then?"

My comments: Some people do get results on their first day, but
most don't - so don't let that discourage you. Being ill will
have an effect on your ability. For more techniques, read the
articles on PsiPog.net, and also http://ppsociety.com has good
information on PK as well. Bending candle flames is fun to do -
but as you observed, it could have been coincidence. Buy a
candle and experiment with it. Control the flame in SPECIFIC
directions, at SPECIFIC intervals. This can help determine if
it's a coincidence or not.

=================================================================

Anime52 asks:
"I was wondering if you could use anchors to program it to do
telekinesis?"

My comments: Yes :-). You can (and do) use anchors in all
aspects of your life, not just psionics. For example, once you
start to learn to drive, things are awkward. But after you gain
some experience, you don't think specifically about what you want
to do. You might think "brake!", but that command is associated
with your foot hitting the left pedal.

Patrick writes:
"Greetings fellow believers! I have yet to begin any psi
development. I am still researching as much as I can first.
However, I believe I've noticed a correlation between psi
phenomenon and traditional Chinese martial arts, i.e. Chi. If you
know about martial arts, you may know about "chi". Chi is the
"life essence" in our bodies that, obviously, keep us alive. It
can also be described as breath, heat, spirit, or bio electricity
by modern western scientists ("chi" has no satisfactory English
translation). The only difference I can see, at this point, is
that in martial arts, you use your "chi" to injure or heal,
instead of manipulate as we are doing here at PsiPog. In MA you
focus on moving your chi/psi into, say, your fist to give it more
power and invulnerability to damage. Or likewise into another
person to heal a damaged organ or blockage of energy. Although
this is just a hypothesis, I would love to hear some feedback."

My comments: Some people do think that psi and chi are the same
"type" of energy - others don't. You can find evidence on both
sides of the spectrum. I personally hold the opinion that
whatever psi and chi are, that there is a more complicated and
deeper understanding needed than the current one. Our current
understanding does not account for everything we witness in
reality, and therefore our current theory can not be correct.
Whatever you are being told about psi and/or chi, always remember
that no one has it entirely figured out - so if we want answers,
we need to figure them out. Keep an open attitude, and continue
to think about what psi could be :-).

Ben writes:
"Hi, my name is Ben and I've been reading this for a long time. I
have been trying to make psi balls for a year or two now, but I
can't seem to concentrate and the most I can ever get when I try
to channel energy is this breeze type feeling going down my arm.
Got any suggestions?"

My comments: You've been trying for a "year or two"? Heh. A
breeze feeling is a good start, but something isn't right if it's
taking you that long. I suspect that you haven't been practicing
for a year or two STRAIGHT :-P. A normal psi ball should only
take a few weeks to a month to get (given constant practicing).
Set 30 minutes a day to practice, and experiment with what works
FOR YOU. It really shouldn't take that long. If you feel
something strange (like a breeze, or anything else), then it
might be psi, or it might be something else. Continue to try new
things and figure out what is what.

Zell writes:
"When you depatternize a shield, what happens if the shield is
too strong (not likely but it could happen!), or if it was
programmed to resist psi? How would you go about taking it down?"

My comments: There are some methods, although some border on
psychic combat (so I won't go over those :-P). However, we can
talk about some common techniques for dealing with stubborn
shields. You can wear down a shields programming over time by
making very small adjustments to it's programming. For example,
if you programmed your shield to resist psi, then you can start
by convincing the shield's programming that "psi" is something
else. Over time, you can convince the shield that psi is
something completely different (like a specific emotion or idea).
The shield will be fulfilling it's programming by resisting "psi"
but it will think that "psi" is (for example) the emotion
"boredom". By redefining what the shield is programed to do in
little steps, you can confuse the programming, and then take
advantage of this confusion to remove the shield.

=================================================================

Zell is back, this time with a success story:
"Hi, sorry to write again within minutes of my previous email,
but I was reading a previous newlsetter, the one that mentions
"affirmations". I said to myself, "I will move this marker with
my mind, and I will know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I moved
it." and it moved! I didn't trance hard or anything, I did it in
10 seconds, and I'm positively sure that nothing else could have
done it! (Im not bragging I'm saying this so that other people
might have this breakthrough too)."

My comments: Wow, sweet :-)! I'll have to try that out. I've
never thought of using affirmations directly with PK - thanks for
sharing your success! :-)

Joe Cool writes:
"Hey, I know it is possible to flare a construct, but I was
wondering, how about sounding one? Instead of giving off light,
it makes a sound. Nothing complicated, maybe like a low hum or
something. Just curious if anyone has experimented with this."

My comments: In theory, this should be possible... but I've never
heard of anyone doing this (pun intended). Try and see :-).

"I've been experimenting with telepathy for a while now. A few
years ago, I was able to successfully send pings to a friend over
a distance of more than 300 miles. However, most of the time
when I try to send messages nowadays, nothing happens. Any
suggestions? I've read the telepathy manual over and over, but
visualization only seems to hamper my concentration."

My comments: If visualizing doesn't work, then don't use it :-).
I suggest checking out the article by Brandon, titled Increased
Sending Through Pinging. Also, check out information on Tactile
Visualization, and Gnome's Sensativity Manual. These might help
you better than the normal visualization stuff.
