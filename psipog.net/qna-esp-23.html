                  <p>I was wondering if knowing someone you know is around you is a telepathic\empathic experience. For example, in school I'll be walking the hallway in between periods and all of the sudden i just "feel" a recognizable presence, sometimes i can even tell who it is. A few seconds later that person
                  will walk by. Is this just coincidence or is it related to a field of psionics and if so what field?<br />

                  <p>A couple of relatively-likely explanations, and any number of possible explanations. I'll stick with the likely ones:</p>

                  <p>1) Your mind works more along the lines of "standard telepathy" but has only been picking up the strongest of signals. (Empathy is part of telepathy, and emotions tend to be stronger signals than "thinks", but folks who are primarily empathic interpret the signals differently than folks who are
                  primarily "think" types)</p>

                  <p>2) Contrarywise, you might indeed by "primarily empathic" but very, very weakly so.</p>

                  <p>3) You might be using other kinds of signals to come to conclusions about other people's emotional states.</p>

                  <p>My friends and I have been "playing" around with Telepathy, and the first few times we decided to play "Guess the Fruit" it was over the phone. Strangely, it seemed to work better over the phone. So I was wondering if the game was really effected by the phone or if we were just doing it better
                  then. Thanks.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I sometimes feel physical pain that is not due to something physically wrong with myself. At some point after feeling this pain, I find out that it was something I picked up empathically from someone else. For instance, for a couple of days I was obsessed with swallowing, and felt very uneasy when
                  swallowing anything. A week later, I found out that my grandmother was having this exact problem, and, being very weak and close to the end of her life already, began to starve herself because of it. My question is, how can I figure out who these physical sensations are coming from? It doesn't help
                  to feel someone else's pain if I don't even know whose it is. Thanks so much, I'd really, really appreciate an answer here, if at all possible.</p>

                  <p>There are a few approaches you can try. Which, if any. of the will work for you will depend on where your particular talents lie.</p>

                  <p>You might try pendling to get a "name" from your subconscious.</p>

                  <p>You might try backtrailing the signal.</p>

                  <p>If you are any good at Shielding, use the "process of elimination" and use a series of Shields that block or blunt the incoming signals from everybody except (insert name of person here).</p>

                  <p>Or, use the telephone and ask around.</p>

                  <p>It takes a lot of experience (ie practice) before you'll have semi-consistent awareness of whose signal it is.</p>

                  <p>I believe you can't really call me a very important psychically developed guy, but I do have a few questions.</p>

                  <p>There is an online very good friend I have, but usually I have to stop talking to him and leaving things unfinished because my time is cut out. Not just that, but I feel like alone sometimes. So:</p>

                  <p>1) What's the best thing I could actually do to fix this problem? Is linking a viable solution or is it too dangerous? Or should I just hold it off?<br />
                  2) If there is a solution, then what were the steps to follow to reach it? My friend is, I think, less developed psychically than me, so I'd need a guide from scratch. I only need things to practice, though, because there are more than enough articles already. If there is no better solution except
                  just to wait until I can get online again, then ignore this question. :)</p>

                  <p>I would recommend against a link. Flatly and absolutely. Telephones and snail-mail are other options for communication, for one thing. For another, if you are considering this because you "feel like alone sometimes", you would be on a very fast and very dangerous road to total emotional dependence
                  on this other person. Emotional dependence on someone with whom you are telepathically linked is a bad thing. It can result in disintegration of whatever personality you have. Further, telepathic links get stronger with use. Consider for a moment how you would feel if you two got sick of each other
                  once you had strengthened the link past the point of no return. Not all links can be broken...ever.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I know, I know, there've been several questions concerning linking with animals. Since I was a young child, animals have kind of flocked to me. And as long as I can remember I've had this...I don't know what to call it...But I seem to be, more or less, able to communicate with them in a very
                  effective manner. The one time when I "misjudged" and was bitten by a dog was when I ignored what I was sensing.</p>

                  <p>At any rate, when I am interacting with my cat, even just absent mindedly, it's almost as if a conversation is taking place. Most people attribute this to my experience with animals and being able to read their body language. I've an idea that perhaps it is something more.</p>

                  <p>Are there others who can and do practice this? Could it have anything to do with my ability to "read" the character of people? And is it commonplace when one hasn't actually trained in empathy and telepathy?</p>

                  <p>Interspecific telepathy is actually quite popular. There are seminars conducted all through North America (face-to-face, rather than online) to teach people to do this more effectively.</p>

                  <p>Some of what you are describing is almost certainly a question of body language, of course, in cases where you are in the same place as the animal in question, and likewise when reading people. However, that does not preclude the possibility of actual telepathy happening in both cases. It is
                  merely more difficult to prove.</p>

                  <p>Yes, it is relatively commonplace in folks who are completely untrained. Key word: "relatively".</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1) Yes. For example, you could experiment with the word "please". The manner to which you are referring is indeed possible but outside the scope of this site, as it is overtly hostile.</p>

                  <p>2) The answer would depend heavily on your reason for practice. If you are simply trying to get it to work, I would suggest three practice sessions per day, each of five-to-ten minutes maximum.</p>

                  <p>3) Yes, you can Send to someone who is not paying attention. If they continue to ignore you, however, you are unlikely to get a reply.</p>

                  <p>4) *shrugs* Maybe. I don't meditate at all before doing pk stuff, generally; contrarywise, some people swear by (or at) it.</p>

                  <p>5) Visualisation itself does not cause the telekinesis to work; daydream until the cows come home in sportscars and it will accomplish exactly nothing. In much of psionics, visualisation serves to convey instructions to the subconscious, and nothing more. You need to actually push or pull the
                  object with your mind. Learn to manipulate your "psi-stuff", first, then try one of the simple-if-inefficient approaches, such as extending a tendril from your field to bop the object or push a stream of psi-stuff ("oomph") at the object to push it.</p>
