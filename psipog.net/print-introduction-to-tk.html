   By now you probably know what telekinesis (TK) is. It's the ability to move something without actually touching it. Some people like "psychokinesis" better, I don't <img src="smile.gif"
         width="12"
         height="12"
         border="0"
         alt="Smile"
         class="smileyImg" />. Right off the bat, I can hear you say: "Telekinesis real? HAH! You're nuts!" Maybe you're right. Maybe TK is fake... maybe what happens is a gust of wind, or maybe a vibration in the table, or maybe... All I have to say to that is BLAH BLAH BLAH <img src="smile.gif"
         width="12"
         height="12"
         border="0"
         alt="Smile"
         class="smileyImg" />. You don't have to believe, no one is forcing you - but I recommend reading on anyways. You don't have to try the exercises, but just getting you to think "Hmmmm, maybe it is real?..." will be a good first step.<br />
   <br />
   <br />
   <a name="step1"
         id="step1"></a><span style="font-size: 120%;">The First Step</span><br />
   <br />
   Getting your conscious mind to believe TK is real is the first step. Once you can say, "Yeah, people can move things with their mind" - you'll be part of the way there. The funny thing about telekinesis is that when you believe it will work, it will. When you don't, it won't. Since it works like this, people who
   can do TK believe in TK and the positive belief becomes stronger. When a person who doesn't believe in it tries, they fail because of the belief and the negative belief is reinforced. Success means more success and failure means more failure. This is why most people can't do it. So, back to the first step - get it
   in your head that TK is real. Once you consciously believe in it, the beliefs will seep into your subconscious and you will totally believe it - inside and out, through and through. This is when you will start seeing consistent results.<br />
   <br />
   Before we get into how to consciously believe in it, lets go over how we should handle random thoughts and feelings. The thing I fear is that you will think "This is crazy" and you will suppress this thought and force yourself to think "TK is real." This isn't good. You have to pick through each thought and pull it
   apart. You have to listen to what you hear. If you hear yourself thinking "This will never work" - ask yourself why? As the reasons pop up, you have to challenge each one and nullify it. Please, do not shove the thoughts deep inside of you; spontaneous thoughts come from your subconscious. If you think something -
   explore it, don't hide from it. I love getting in arguments with myself - it lets me see the true me.<br />
   <br />
   Now you're saying "Heh, my thoughts can't be challenged! I can argue to anyone that TK is fake." Fine. Just keep an open mind... I'll go over some of the reasons why I started to believe in TK. This way, you can see why I started and look at my reasoning:<br />
   <br />
   1. You say: No one can move things with their mind and modern science agrees.<br />
   This is a pretty broad one. The thing that made me think twice about it was the experiences of others. Just me here, telling you that I have personally seen it in action, should spark a little something. If you do a search on the Internet, there are a lot of message boards and sites dedicated to "psychic" stuff.
   Why would there be such a huge thing about it if it was all fake? Can people be really that dumb (heh, don't answer that <img src="smile.gif"
         width="12"
         height="12"
         border="0"
         alt="Smile"
         class="smileyImg" />)? Seriously, you're trying to say that there is a scientific explanation for everything out there? No way... There is a lot that science can't explain. Also, are you saying that every person who has had a TK experience is crazy or it was some weird coincidence? I don't think so. Sure, you
         got your crazies out there who don't know what, and I'm positive there's a couple fictional stories out there, but every one? Eh, chances are slim. There is something going on we can't explain it. You have to admit that.<br />
   <br />
   2. You say: Physics says it's impossible.<br />
   Physics. Hmmmm. Ever hear of Quantum Physics? It's the study of energy and how it gets around. Pretty interesting stuff... but not explored fully yet. Plus there's the magnetism theory for TK. Basically, electric magnets are stronger than normal magnets. Guess what our brain is? Yep, electrical impulses. Can you
   see the connection? Plus there have been studies (just do a search, you'll find them) - baby chicks have used micro-TK to affect the outcome of a RNG (random number generator) so the light (guided by the RNG) would be close to them, keeping them warm. Maybe common sense at first says it's impossible, but if you
   look close - it's not really that far fetched.<br />
   <br />
   3. You say: Maybe it is possible, but then it's a freak of nature and only happens with gifted people.<br />
   Heh. Yeah, maybe. All I can say is that I have taught people who have asked me and I taught myself. If it is only possible through "mutants" then I guess I'm a mutant along with anyone else who was taught by me. Hmmm, if we're so rare, that's an amazing coincidence <img src="smile.gif"
         width="12"
         height="12"
         border="0"
         alt="Smile"
         class="smileyImg" />.<br />
   <br />
   As you can see, there are a lot of angles to take. Be logical - and have an open mind. Read about experiences of others online and go into chats and ask around. Try Yahoo chat - under the Religion category there is a "Paganism" room - check it out. Sometimes we have meetings in #psipog for all you IRC users (any
   austnet server).<br />
   <br />
   <br />
   <a name="idobe"
         id="idobe"></a><span style="font-size: 120%;">I Do Believe</span><br />
   <br />
   Oh do you? Heh. I don't mean to knock over everything you've built up, but you probably don't truly believe unless you have seen it with your own eyes. You still might not believe after that. I remember the first time it happened to me. I was doing an exercise I invented (the key one for those of you that have read
   on <img src="smile.gif"
         width="12"
         height="12"
         border="0"
         alt="Smile"
         class="smileyImg" />) and the key (the object I was trying to move) spun around really fast then stopped suddenly. I was shocked. I 'knew' TK was real, but I really didn't know. It blew my insides apart... on the outside I thought "Sure, TK is real, I just need more practice" while on the inside I thought
         "Ehhh, this stuff can't be real." After the experience, I truly knew TK was real. How can you get your subconscious to believe it's real? It's not easy. The way I did it was to just bombard it with thoughts that "TK is real" and challenged any thought that said otherwise with logic and reason. I also did
         another thing which is the key to TK. Do you want to know what it is? It's the same with anything else you want to be really good at.... PRACTICE. Yeah, it sucks, there is no switch or trigger, just plain practice is the best way to get good at it. What do you do when you practice? In my next section I'll
         show you the way I practice and some other exercises I've read about.<br />
   <br />
   <br />
   <a name="micro"
         id="micro"></a><span style="font-size: 120%;">Micro-TK Practice</span><br />
   <br />
   A real quick intro on micro-TK. Micro-TK is easier than it's counter-part, macro-TK. The micro basically means that you're dealing on a sub-atomic level - dealing with chance/statistics. In these exercises, you will effect the outcome of something using TK. You'll get the hang of it after reading some.

   <ul>
      <li><a name="dicee"
         id="dicee"></a><span style="font-size: 110%;">Dice Exercise</span></li>
   </ul>The basic idea behind this is to roll dice and force a number. Be careful inventing your own exercises. If you have a target number and you try to force it, your practicing TK. If you try to predict what the number will be (changing your target number between each roll) your actually developing a different
   psychic skill - precognition (predicting the future).<br />
   <br />
   <img src="artimg/trial1.gif"
         width="198"
         height="179"
         border="0"
         alt="Trial 1"
         style="margin: 15px; float: left;" /> All you need is a die, some paper, and a pencil. Roll the dice 50-100 times to make sure it's not weighted anyway and is fair. If you roll it 100 times, each number should come up 16-17 times (number of trials divided by number of possible outcomes or 100 / 6). In the
         example, it seems that 5 might have a slight advantage and 6 doesn't look so well. Here, I would pick either 2 or 3 as a target number because you can be sure that the results won't be affected by the imperfections in the die.<br />
   <br />
   After you get the feel for the dice, you want to try and force your target number. Don't get upset if your number doesn't seem to be coming up that often, there could be a lot of reasons for this. You could not be concentrating enough, you could not have enough practice, you could not be "warmed up," or you could
   just be having a bad day. You want to try to keep relaxed and free. Open your mind to the dice, stay focused but passive. "Know" that the dice will land on your target number, trust your instincts, be playful and have fun. If you find yourself getting mad, take a break for a while and come back to it. I know I'm
   saying to try to force your target number, but I don't want you to take it the wrong way. It shouldn't be a "force," it should be very calm and relaxing. Let it flow, lay back and let the numbers do what they're going to do.<br />
   <br />
   <img src="artimg/trial2.gif"
         width="194"
         height="173"
         border="0"
         alt="Trial 2"
         style="margin: 15px; float: right;" /> Take a look at the results to the right. Although the person was trying to force 3, he did the total opposite. This might happen to you. You say "I want 3" and your subconscious thinks "Well, since this isn't going to work, there won't be a lot of 3's." Your negative
         subconscious thoughts are reflected onto the results. This is a GOOD sign <img src="smile.gif"
         width="12"
         height="12"
         border="0"
         alt="Smile"
         class="smileyImg" />. If you get something similar to this you should be able to convince your sub-conscious that TK does exist. How else can you explain the drastic change? Sure, the numbers will fluctuate a little, but that much? Eh, not likely.<br />
   <br />
   Personally, I don't like this exercise that much. It's pretty tedious and repetitive. It isn't very positive in my opinion either. You can try other things instead of a dice (a coin for example) - the basic idea is still there. I prefer (when practicing micro-TK) to do the next two exercises.

   <ul>
      <li><a name="card1"
         id="card1"></a><span style="font-size: 110%;">Card Exercise 1</span></li>
   </ul>I made this exercise one late night in bed. Everyone seems to like it, including myself <img src="smile.gif"
         width="12"
         height="12"
         border="0"
         alt="Smile"
         class="smileyImg" />. It's fun, easy, and exciting! All that you need is a deck of cards - a pretty common thing. One reason why I like this exercise is because you can do it with people watching and they can't catch on to what you're doing. You don't have to write down anything or make any tables, it's just
         you and 52 cards.<br />
   <br />
   First start off by choosing a target card. Try to pick a card that isn't bent and will fit in pretty good. Now you shuffle and shuffle. The goal is to remove all cards EXCEPT your target card. On average, I remove around 6 cards each time. Let's run through an example so you get the idea.<br />
   <br />
   Lets say I choose the Ace of Spades as my target card. I shuffle the deck a couple times to mix it up good. I have an urge to take some cards out so I pull out the first 6 cards and look through them to make sure the Ace isn't in it. I throw those cards in another pile. Then I shuffle some more. I get a feeling to
   stop and remove some cards, so I take the top 7 and look through them to make sure the Ace isn't in there. It's not, so I keep going. I keep shuffling and removing cards until I do come across the Ace.<br />
   <br />
   This exercise works good because you can convince your mind that your card won't be in the group you grab to check. Think about it, will your target card be in a group of 40+ or in a group of 6? Your subconscious says "Yeah, you're right, there's no way the Ace of Spades is in here..." If you keep doing it, you
   will start to see results and be able to narrow it down to 10, 5, and eventually 1 card. The most important part is to do what you feel like doing. Don't analyze (until you're done) and don't think. Just flow... go with it.

   <ul>
      <li><a name="card2"
         id="card2"></a><span style="font-size: 110%;">Card Exercise 2</span></li>
   </ul>This exercise is for those who have mastered the first card exercise. It's pretty straight-forward and simple. Actually, I made this one before I made Card Exercise 1.<br />
   <br />
   First, get a target card. Make sure it's not bent and has no weird marks (so it doesn't stick out). You basically shuffle the deck and keep shuffling until you feel your target card is on top. Believe it or not, the third try after I started doing this I got my card on top. I was just shuffling and shuffling, then
   I thought "There it is" and I threw it on my bed. When I saw I was actually right, I just stared at it in shock.<br />
   <br />
   The key to this exercise is to identify your goal and just do it. Don't let anything run through your head other than "..." No thoughts. Don't think "This won't work", don't think "The odds are way against me" - just think "..."<br />
   <br />
   <br />
   <a name="macro"
         id="macro"></a><span style="font-size: 120%;">Macro-TK Practice</span><br />
   <br />
   Macro-Telekinesis is what were all here for. Moving big things with our mind. None of this "chance" crap, this stuff is hard-core, obvious, undisputable proof. The only thing that sucks about it is that it SEEMS to be harder to do. Why do I say seem? Personally, I believe it is no harder than micro-TK (my
   subconscious disagrees <img src="smile.gif"
         width="12"
         height="12"
         border="0"
         alt="Smile"
         class="smileyImg" />) it's just SEEMS harder because we believe it would be harder. Everything, even the things outside of TK, is tied to perception and belief. Just stating "I am telekinetic!" to your subconscious will help. Have confidence! It does work and it will work!<br />
   <br />
   Enough of that, here are some exercises:

   <ul>
      <li><a name="keyex"
         id="keyex"></a><span style="font-size: 110%;">Key Exercise</span></li>
   </ul><img src="artimg/key.gif"
         width="250"
         height="315"
         border="0"
         alt="Key"
         style="margin: 15px; float: left;" /> I'm not sure where this exercise came from. I think I read something to trigger me into thinking of it. It's pretty basic. You hang a string from the ceiling and tie a key to it (or any weight for that matter). Then you try to move it. Heh, that's it (see picture if
         you're confused).<br />
   <br />
   The key (pun intended) to this exercise is to unlock (heh, I'm loving this <img src="smile.gif"
         width="12"
         height="12"
         border="0"
         alt="Smile"
         class="smileyImg" />) your power. You can try a bunch of things to see what works for you. I like my eyes open. I try to keep a clear mind with only the thought of success in my head. Some people like to think of a magnet, some like to think of energy, it's all a matter of finding what's right for you.

   <ul>
      <li><a name="strng"
         id="strng"></a><span style="font-size: 110%;">String Exercise</span></li>
   </ul>I get a lot of e-mails about people wanting to learn TK, one of the first people I taught used the key exercise. Unfortunately, he could not get the key to move, no matter what he tried. Then, after a couple weeks, he tried to move the little string that was left over when he tied <img src="artimg/string.gif"
         width="219"
         height="270"
         border="0"
         alt="String"
         style="margin: 15px; float: right;" /> the string to the key. He was VERY successful (and let me know <img src="smile.gif"
         width="12"
         height="12"
         border="0"
         alt="Smile"
         class="smileyImg" />). That's where this exercise came from. It's the exact same as the key exercise but without the key. Just try moving the string. Be careful, it is very sensitive to wind, so breathe low, or cover your face, and don't make gusts of wind with your hands or when you move your body. Don't
         write off good results as "gusts" of wind. I made the string move while half-way across the room but I thought it could have been some wind I generated. So I went through the same steps to see if the key moved again (only this time without the actual mental effort). It didn't move. I tried making gusts of
         wind and I couldn't make one strong enough to effect the string from that distance. So, know your strings limits. See what movement will make it move and what won't. If you're really paranoid about wind, you can make a miniature version of the string exercise but in a glass. See the picture to the right. The
         container makes sure no wind will get in or out... and since magnets go through stuff like that, it doesn't interfere with your effort.

   <ul>
      <li><a name="paper"
         id="paper"></a><span style="font-size: 110%;">Paper on Pin Exercise</span></li>
   </ul>This is a newer exercise to me. I read it off a web-site but I forgot where exactly it was (doh). I'll give you step by step instructions on how to make the thing you need:<br />
   <br />

   <center>
      <img src="artimg/paper1.gif"
              width="502"
              height="328"
              border="0"
              alt="Psiwheel" />
   </center><br />
   <br />
   <img src="artimg/paper2.gif"
         width="134"
         height="155"
         border="0"
         alt="Psiwheel again"
         style="margin: 15px; float: right;" /> That's the paper part, for the stand, all you do is stick a needle in cork or something and balance the paper tool on top. Personally, I just use a thumb-tack. It's real easy. See the picture to the right see how it should look when you're done. It's a low angle looking
         up into the middle of the paper thing.<br />
   <br />
   You can probably already guess what your mission is. Make the paper thing spin on the needle. Be really careful with this thing, it's extremely sensitive to wind and air currents. A whisper from 5 feet away can make it move. Just relax and let it flow like all the other exercises. I wish I could remember the web
   page I went to so I could give proper credit, but I have no idea. Oh well.

   <ul>
      <li><a name="cndle"
         id="cndle"></a><span style="font-size: 110%;">Candle Exercise</span></li>
   </ul>I've only tried this exercise a couple times. It just doesn't work very well for me (probably due to early failure and stupid beliefs). I'm including it because it really sounds cool and you might find it very useful.<br />
   <br />
   The setup is easy, just get a candle, light it, and try to make the flame move. Try shrinking it or lengthening it. I read that you can actually distinguish the flame totally if you keep shrinking it to a point where it can't exist. Pretty cool. Nostradamus supposedly invented this. He didn't use it to practice TK
   but it sounds like it should work. Give it a try, heck, I'm gonna go try right now... maybe it will work...<br />
   <br />
   <br />
   <a name="concl"
         id="concl"></a><span style="font-size: 120%;">Conclusion</span><br />
   <br />
   Well, you've reached the end of the file. I hope you got something from it. If this is like your fifth time reading it and your saying "It doesn't work!" - don't give up. It will work, just keep practicing. First do the micro-TK stuff to get your confidence high, then move on to the macro stuff. Keep pounding your
   mind with TK - day dream about TK, when you want to grab something, try to "pull" it to you, when someone is talking to you, think "telekinesis... telekinesis... telekinesis..." - well, maybe not that far <img src="smile.gif"

         height="12"
