                  <p>The same way you get past all the obstacles to OBE'ing: remain passive. Sit there, think to yourself "oh, that's nice", and just brush it off. Acknowledge it, but don't focus on it. Let it run it's natural course, and in the meantime, you keep your mind focused on nothing <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>The falling sensation isn't an OBE. Everyone feels that now and then - hence the saying "falling asleep". When you have an OBE, you will perceive your consciousness OUTSIDE of your body. I know that sounds kinda weird... Imagine you're playing a video game that is a first person shooter. Like
                  Halo. If you can imagine taking the camera out of first person, and flying around the world in the camera, then returning back into first person. That is what an OBE is like. (I hope that made sense <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>Lol. They are usually kept in the same section, yes. But that doesn't mean you have to be a crazy warlock to have OBEs. Good books are a little tricky to find, because a lot of people combine psi with religion... Some books have good information but you have to extract it out of the religious
                  material. One of the goals of this website is to get people to think about psi as something more scientific than religious. Even if people don't think you're a crazy warlock, they still might look at you weird for thinking you can leave your body <img src="wink.gif"

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Actually, you're not doing anything _wrong_, per se. Your system isn't accustomed to the sudden influx of "energy"-like stuff. Moving too much of the stuff around, too fast, makes you light-headed. Push it faster, and it will do more than just make you lightheaded.</p>

                  <p>Chill, ease up a bit, and take your practice somewhat slower.</p>

                  <p>You might also consider the benefits of "grounding". Grounding is good. Grounding is your friend.</p>

                  <p>Don't know how to ground? No problem. I'll give you the short version of one of the simpler methods, right here:</p>

                  <p>Choose an inanimate object that is in contact with the ground, or choose the ground itself. (I said "inanimate", not "unintelligent". No, your kid brother doesn't count as inanimate, even if he's still asleep.) Place your hands flat on the object. "Pretend" the psi-stuff in your system is cloudy
                  water, and let it flow through the palms of your hands into the object until the "water" looks clear in your imagination. Let it flow; do not push...unless you _like_ being unconscious.....</p>

                  <p>Speaking of "unconscious", there is a technical term for what happens when you push too hard in practice. It is called "death".</p>

                  <p>In one of the seminars on how to get an OBE you say, after a few tries you will know when to leave your body. I think I got to this point but I dont actually know how to leave the body. I tend to try mvement but that just messes the whole procedure, I've also tried visualising but that doesn't
                  seem to work either. I wsa just wondering if you could give me some ideas on how to do it.<br />
                  Any insight would be much apreciated.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Ok... I know it's a pain in the ass from your end to try to understand it. I just say "you'll know" but that doesn't really answer the question.</p>

                  <p>I'll just say what happens to me. When I leave my body, usually I wake up in a very "flexible" state, right in the morning after dreaming. In this state of mind, I can do a lot of things. I can stand up, go to the bathroom, start my day like normal. I can roll over and go back to sleep, and dream
                  some more. Or, if I can "tune" my mind just right, I can leave my body. It's more of a feel than anything. I can feel that if I think in a certain way, that I'll start to get the infamous "vibrations".</p>

                  <p>If I want to leave my body, I will try to focus on the right state of mind to get the vibrations going. After the vibrations come in, I just relax for a little while. If I fight the vibrations, usually I won't leave my body. If I keep that state of mind, hold it for a while (20 seconds?), and let
                  the vibrations fade out calmly... THEN I can leave my body. After the vibrations end, all I do is move how I normally move. But instead of my physical body moving, my out-of-body-body moves.</p>

                  <p>If you have trouble moving out of body, I find that sometimes I have to "convince" myself to move. It's kind of odd... For example, one time I was floating in my bed, inside of my body. I wanted to fly up and around, but I could only move my arms and legs. I tried to grab onto things to pull
                  myself up, but I kept going through the things I was trying to grab, so I couldn't pull myself up. Eventually I tried imagining rockets on my back, pushing my entire being up. It worked - I had "convinced" myself that I "should" be floating upwards - and I did.</p>

                  <p>It's very odd stuff. It's hard to describe, and you sorta just gotta jump into it. If you mess up, try again. You'll get it eventually.</p>

                  <p>Hey, I Have a question about starting an OBE.</p>

                  <p>I Have searched for the answer for this Question for about 1-2 weeks, and haven't been able to find the specific Question and Answer, (or I might have seen the answer, but it was phrased different than what i was looking for...) So here it goes.</p>

                  <p>In all the OBE Articles' it allways says to keep your entire body compleatley still, but when ever I try to do this, I can keep all of the out side of my body still, (like my arms and legs and everything else.) but, about 1-2 minuets into it, my mouth seems to start produceing alot more saliva
                  than regularly, and my natual reflexes make me swallow when ever my mouth gets too full, Other wise i choke and... moove. I was wondering what I should do, Should i just ignor it compleatley and let my self drool all over myself? Or just allow my self to swallow?</p>
