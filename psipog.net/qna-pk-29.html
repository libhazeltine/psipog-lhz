                  <p>"Deeply"? Sure, there are any number of fluffy sites which devote a considerable amount of imagination and creative writing to that topic. If you are looking for a serious and/or useful site about such things, you are unlikely to find one. There are sites devoted to microPK, and there are rather
                  fewer useful sites devoted to macroPK. The only other really useful subdivision concerns whether the object being affected is animate or not. If it is, the majority of the information you would need, other than the standard stuff, could be found in a medical, physiology, anatomy, or biology
                  textbook.</p>

                  <p>You have to balance it. If you work yourself every day, for a few hours, you'll be drained. If you practice once a month, for an hour, you'll get nowhere. If you practice a lot, and learn a lot, sometimes it's a good idea to take a little break. There is a lot of information to absorb and figure
                  out - give your mind some time to sort it all. In the meantime, perhaps try practicing another skill, or meditate daily, or do something else. If you completely stop practicing all together for a long period of time, your skill level will most likely go down. It won't take as long to get it back up
                  to where you were, but it'll take effort. Think of psionics like any other skill... it follows the same basic concepts.</p>

                  <p>That's really up to you. Personally, I learned psi balls first. It's easier to accomplish, and gives you some extra confidence. Learning how to make a psi ball is not required to learn TK though... if you really have no desire to learn anything else except TK, then train TK and skip the psi balls.
                  It might be a little harder though.</p>

                  <p>For me, I started my TK training in February of 1999. I tried for a few weeks, failed miserably, and moved on to more easier things. Mainly psi balls, shields, and eventually OBEs (which really aren't that easy <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"

                       class="smileyImg" />). In August of 2000, I decided to try TK again, and it worked the first time I tried it. So, technically, it took me about 1.5 years, but I didn't practice TK that entire time. I practiced a bunch of other things... I <i>think</i> it took NI 9 months, if I remember
                       correctly... but I could be messing that up. I think he mentioned it in one of his articles... if not maybe he'll see this and reply to it.</p>
