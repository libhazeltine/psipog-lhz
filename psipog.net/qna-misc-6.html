                  <p>Ok, I have a big problem.<br />
                  I'm hearing voices in my head, and they're telling me what to do. They practically control my body. I can barely stand, and can't really walk. It's very hard to resist them, and I'm afraid that I may hurt someone. I asked and they said that they were from hell. I don't know how to get rid of them,
                  and I think something bad might happen if I don't. I also saw a little portal opening beside me and it really freaked me out.<br />
                  Please help me before something bad happens.</p>

                  <p>Ive read in many places that grounding and centering are needed for everyone, and that you have to do it a couple times a week at least, but i find that if i try to ground that often, it does no good, i only have to ground about once a month, im a psi-vamp, so since i absorb energy shouldnt i have
                  to ground more often?(The psions guild describes a psivamp as one who _has to_ drain energy, and i find that is fairly accurate when applied to me)</p>

                  <p>Grounding and centering are pretty important skills to have, if you practice psionics. However, there are some perfectly competent psionicists who never (or almost never) use either skill. If you don't need to ground more than once a month, don't ground more than once a month. No problem.</p>

                  <p>Ever since i had a door unlock itself and swing open ive been trying to open or shut doors with TK, at first no success, but now im able to get it to start shaking back and forth a little bit, but i can NOT get the psiwheel to spin at all(in fact even if its being blown on it wont spin at all, it
                  stays perfectly still) and the door shaking back and forth makes it seem like my subconcious is fighting me for some reason, ive tried communicating with my subconcious but im not getting anything when i try, and i used to be able to do this very easily, the same with the psiwheel. Can you please
                  suggest something for me to try to let me communicate with my subconcious again?</p>

                  <p>As for the pinwheel, I would suggest checking to be sure the paper is just sitting on the pin. If the pin pokes through, you're dealing with much more friction.</p>

                  <p>As for the door, some days you'll have enough oomph, and some days you won't.</p>

                  <p>And as for the communicating with your subconscious, relax and don't "try" as hard. See if that helps. It sounds like you might be pushing too much.</p>

                  <p>Learn to control it...you are not the first one to encounter such difficulties. The only real difference between controlling already-expressed abilities and learning totally new ones, is that you have much less choice as to which skillset you work on. Otherwise, proceed as per any newbie.</p>

                  <p>As for the "monster" bit, that depends entirely upon what you choose to do with it.</p>

                  <p>As for your first question: try a radiometer. It's a sort of enclosed psiwheel, but the idea is to _stop_ it, rather than start it. It moves as long as there is enough steady light hitting it. Places such as Edmund Scientific carry them.</p>
