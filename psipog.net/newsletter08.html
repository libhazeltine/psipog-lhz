PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #8, for December 21st, 2004

"To repeat what others have said, requires education; to
challenge it, requires brains."
- Mary Pettibone Poole


Dear PsiPog Users,

Hey hey! I hope everyone got a chance to submit an application
for the Telepathy Group. We had just about 300 applications
submitted, so it might be a little time before the teachers go
through them all. Jespers isn't going to teach, and I haven't
heard from eversosleepy in a while, but Roy is sorting out all
the applications and choosing his students.

If you want to read about the entire project, click on this link:
http://www.psipog.net/groups.php

Since you're reading this, the deadline for applications has
already passed. If you didn't fill one out in time - no worries.
I plan on doing more projects like this in the future, so keep
checking back on PsiPog.net to see what's available.

If you did apply - then thanks :-D. It's cool to see so many
people willing to learn, and dedicate their time towards this.
Hopefully we'll learn a lot from it.

Let's jump into the mailbag. (If you want to submit any ideas
or questions for the next newsletter, send your thoughts to:
newsletter@psipog.net - don't be shy!).

"Has anyone ever tried to test psi with medical tools? Maybe what
I feel, or some of us feel as psi is really just blood rushing to
our hands, which we have trained our selves to do? I myself do
not have access to those type of medical tools, but maybe someone
else can and bring back results?"

My comments: Most people don't have medical tools, but that
shouldn't stop us from doing some basic tests. For example, one
of the experiments I did when I first started out was raising the
temperature on a digital thermometer. First I put my hands
around it, then I made a psi ball with the intention of getting
an increase. It did increase.

Then I thought it might be because of my body heat. So my next
experiment was to make a psi ball from 10 feet away, then send
the psi ball to the thermometer and see if it raised. And for
me, it did raise. I suggest everyone out there try similar
experiments, or THINK OF YOUR OWN experiment. What do you have
available to you to test it out? There has to be something
you can do without buying a bunch of medical equipment to see if
what you're doing is legit. Of course, I would be interested in
what medical equipment would show, but for verification purposes,
you don't need an expensive laboratory :-P.

"Hi I practice OBE's and lately I have tried many times and read
all articles about it, but it still does not appear to work. Any
suggestions?"

My comments: Start simple. Go step by step. Are you able to get
in the state where your entire body is numb? You do this through
progressive relaxation. This state isn't TOO hard to get into,
and I'll just assume you can get to that state.

You can do a lot of cool things just from the progressive
relaxation state. Robert Monroe calls this state "Focus 10", so
that's what I'll use.

One thing I like to do in Focus 10 is to confuse my sense of
where my body is. By this I mean... I can convince myself that
my arm is in a position that I know it isn't. I can remember
where I put my arm, but I can convince my mind that my arm isn't
there. Sometimes I convince myself that my bed is flying through
the air, and taking sharp corners and flipping upside down. If
I can CONVINCE myself that that is happening, I will FEEL my body
getting pulled in different directions. Similar to convicing
myself that my arm is in a different position.

Sometimes I like to get my body to sway. This is all under the
same thing as above - if I can use that "convincing" idea, I can
get my joints to bend in directions they shouldn't, and make my
body sway and pulsate, like a flag in the wind.

My suggestion is to play around with it. It is fun, and you can
do some weird things. Get a feel for Focus 10, and don't worry
about if you're feeling the "right" thing, or if you're doing it
"wrong", or if you're going to have an OBE or not - just enjoy
the relaxed state, and mess around with it.

"I have heard of grounding and centering, and know that they are
lumped with meditation in that group of 'things to do before
practicing psi.' I know about and regularly practice meditation
(and it was discussed in a previous newsletter), but I'm not
really sure what grounding and centering are, or how they are
done."

My comments: Grounding and centering are outlined in the Active
Psy book, by Skywind. You can find more information here:
http://www.psipog.net/activepsy/book2.html#_Toc472931485
http://www.psipog.net/activepsy/book2.html#_Toc472931486

I'll talk about it here as well, just to go over what I think.
Grounding and centering are useful tools, but they aren't
necessary for practicing psi. I personally think grounding is
more useful than centering, but I've used both at times when I
felt unbalanced.

The idea behind grounding is just like grounding an electrical
current - if you know anything about that. Basically, the idea
is that we can become too "charged" a certain way... this
"charge" can make us feel uneasy, but for me it usually makes me
feel excited. So, what you do is take all that extra psi and
emotion that is making you feel odd, and get rid of it. The
usual target location is the earth. Then, if you want, you can
pull some more "balanced" and "relaxing" energy back from the
earth. Basically: Grounding = Relaxing and letting go of all the
shit that's bugging you.

Centering is a little different. I honestly don't think most
people need to learn centering until they start to feel mentally
"lost". By this I mean... when you are capable of picking up
other people's emotions and thoughts, sometimes you can get
flooded with too much external stuff, that you lose your own
identity. I've had this happen to me a few times - it's just
like you can't find your own thoughts, and you aren't sure if
what you're feeling is YOUR emotion, and what your thinking is
YOUR thoughts.

Centering is pushing out all that external stuff, and finding
what is really going on in YOUR head, and not the heads of
everyone else. It's fun to do telepathy and empthay, but you
can't forget who YOU are in the process. Centering can help you
remind you who you are :-P.

"Just had an idea. Clear a space on your desk or shelf, and
create a construct there. Program it to stay there and slowly
take energy from an energy source like the earth. Now program it
to use some energy to produce light. Then just keep adding a bit
of energy and reprogramming it each day. You now have your own
pet construct. Maybe as you get more experienced it might start
to actually light up, then you can just keep making it brighter
each day."

My comments: Cool idea :-). Try it and see what happens.

"I noticed that your last letter dealt with meditation guides. I
found one thats rather helpful at www.zenguide.com "zazen guide."
It's in PDF form so you can download it."

My comments: Cool, thanks :-).

Sander submitted a common breathing technique. This is good for
relaxing, and can help with getting started with OBEs too:

"You inhale with you nose. You really guide the breath to the
lower parts of your lungs and let your lungs fill up with oxygen.

You exhale with your mouth. Emptying your lungs from the top to
the bottom.

The breath-rhythm is like this:

Inhale 1 2 3 4 5
Hold the breath 1 2 3
Exhale 1 2 3 4 5

Do this for a couple of minutes.

Then visualize the breath going to your feet knees etc, do your
whole body."

Alrighty, let's wrap this up. Thanks to everyone who sent in
tips and questions. One more reminder: send whatever you think
might be interesting to newsletter@psipog.net

Other than that, have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, and
I'll see you in 2005 :-).
