                  <p>Some people work different ways. The first step is always to relax. If you're trying to force yourself to feel something, then you're trying too hard. Relax. Breathe. Ahhhhh.... good 'ol oxygen <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Try some different things. By this I mean, try visualizing different things, or just try different techniques all together. I'll give you some ideas to try:</p>

                  <p>1. Try visualizing a green fog instead of a blue blob. Or try visualizing water instead. Or fire. Or light. Think to yourself, "What do I picture energy to look like?". Visualize your first instinct.</p>

                  <p>2. You don't have to visualize. You can try willing the psi to pool in your abs. It's hard to describe. Think of it like when you move your hand. You don't visualize your hand to move, it just moves because you command it to. Say to yourself, "Psi is this energy stuff that my body creates... I am
                  now pooling psi in my abdomen." Will it.</p>

                  <p>3. Ummmm what else. I find that it just follows my focus. If I think to myself "I want psi in my hand", then focus on my hand, and ignore everything else, it'll start to pool in there pretty good. Don't focus on a million things at once - put the Gameboy down and focus on what you're doing.</p>

                  <p>Also, if your sister got it to work, maybe you can ask her for help?</p>

                  <p>Yes, you can shield yourself from actual objects. However, it requires skill in both making constructs and telekinesis. If you are interested, there was an article written on the topic by Rainsong that can be found here:<br />

                  <p>Yes, you can make your shield be seen as a color during a scan (sometimes even unintentionally, depending on the visualization you may use).</p>

                  <p>Hi<br />
                  I think i can make a psi-ball because i got all those feelings of pushing-away and tingling. When im doing a psi ball my hands are still, and i feel the pressure between them; but when i move my hands i cant feel the pressure for a few seconds, what i mean is that i cant move my hands and feel the
                  psi ball at the same time. Does it means i just feel pressure because of something related to keeping your hands still?</p>

                  <p>thanks</p>

                  <p>Try moving your hands slightly while making a psi ball. If you're making a psi ball, you should still feel it even though your hands are moving. You might be doing a couple of other things to create the sensation, and it might be dependant on your hands moving or not. You're going to have to
                  experiment a little on your own and try to figure it out.</p>
