                  <p>I am very confused. When i was younger if i couldnt sleep i would visulize these things that looked like dots and squiggly lines that were different colors and they were floating around in the air. i could make them go away and come back whenever i wanted. was i making psi balls as a young
                  child?</p>

                  <p>Probably not. Visualisation is only part of the process. It sounds as though you were doing exactly what you said you were doing: visualising.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>A couple psi-ball questions for you. Do you experience any wierd feelings after making one? Not exactly during but afterwards. I felt this wierd tingling in my back that felt a lot like the tingling in my hands. I felt it on and off for about 10 minutes. Also, i felt like the energy from the ball
                  hit me when i waved it off.</p>

                  <p>Another question: I've read several places on this site that the feel like their hands are being pulled away from eachother whereas i feel mine being pulled closer. When i make a psi-ball i do it without my hands touching at all by the way. Is this a normal reaction or am i doing something
                  wrong.</p>

                  <p>Sorry if these were stupid questions. I'm new to the whole psi-ball thing as i randomly came across this site in my jourey to an OBE. Thanks in advance.</p>

                  <p>1) That after-effect reaction appears to be relatively common, yes. You'll probably stop noticing it after a few months, though.</p>

                  <p>2) Pushing-away appears to be the more common sensation, but both have been reported. Pulling-together does not indicate anything wrong, don't worry.</p>

                  <p>They seemed like perfectly legitimate questions, not stupid at all.</p>

                  <p>Well, I looked around to see if someone asked this question well here it goes.While I was trying to create a psi ball( I just started)I saw a faint smoke come from my hands. What does that mean? Am I by accidentally creating pyrokineasis?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>If the "smoke" is illusory, then it is one of the "usual" interpretations of psi-stuff perception, and therefore your psi-ball attempt is making progress. If the "smoke" is real, you have some serious problems. I'd suggest dunking your hands in cool or lukewarm water to "put them out". Either way,
                  no, it would not be "pyrokinesis".</p>
