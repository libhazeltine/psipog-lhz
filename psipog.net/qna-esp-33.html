                  <p>If either the mother or baby has any telepathic aptitude at all, they almost certainly have a link already. As for the probable intent of your question, yes, telepathic communication with a child still in the womb is possible, both by the mother and by a third party.</p>

After i start to trance i fell myself expand. after that i am bombarded with some off the wall thoughts that im not sure are my own. It makes it hard to
                  concentrat sometimes. i was wandering am i intercepting other peoples thoughts, and would puting up a shild help me if i am intercepting others thoughts un intentionaly? i know i am a little sensitive, becase i am quite good at scaneing people, and i fell everyone around me. thank you for your

                  <p>If you are picking up other people's thoughts, a well-constructed Shield programmed to keep such thoughts out should solve the problem. Your other option is not to go so deep into trance, in which state you are more likely to pick up such broadcasts.</p>

                  <p>Empathy is part of telepathy, but being an empath does not mean you necessarily have any natural talent for the other parts of the category. There are several ways around the problem. The easiest is to learn to Send and Receive thoughts as though starting completely from scratch (ie, like anyone
                  else trying to learn it), _but_ include a busrt of empathic sending at the same time you send the thought.</p>

                  <p>The sort of folk originally meant by the very localised slang term that got shortened to "natural" are relatively uncommon. It appears that highly talented psychics are also uncommon, as are highly talented pianists. As to the actual percentage, that is unknowable at this point; there has been no
                  study extensive enough to give a percentage of the human population. The apparent "stats" are variable from place to place, and there is considerable disagreement as to what constitutes "talented" and/or "natural".</p>

                  <p>By definition, "telepathy" is communication between two or more minds. It cannot be done solo. However, there are preliminary exercises which can make later telepathic attempts easier. One of these is to read silently while forming the words as clearly as you can in your mind, so you "hear"
                  them....exactly the opposite of what you would want to do if you intended to increase your reading speed. Another is to picture objects in your mind; practice visualization.</p>

                  <p>Is it dangerous to maintain long term telepathic connections, with friends and family, etc, without their knowledge? Or would you deem it advisable?

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Some linking with people to whom you have strong emotional ties appears to be normal. Deliberately established links tend to be more intense than the average incidental link.</p>

                  <p>Establishing such a link without the consent of the other party is pretty much a hostile act. Some people will notice the link. Whether it is dangerous depends on the nature of the link and whether the other person chooses to do something about it.</p>

                  <p>The very intense links which _are_ decidedly dangerous are not likely to go unnoticed by either party. "Extreme emotional distress" is not the extent of possible damage. Deterioration of the personalities of both parties is one of the possibilities, which has been recorded, and appears to be
                  permanent and irreversible.</p>
