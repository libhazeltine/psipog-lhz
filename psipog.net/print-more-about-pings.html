   <h1 class="pageTitle">More About Pings... sort of</h1>

   <p><em>by Rainsong</em></p>

   <p>So, you read the Pinging article, and understood the concepts, but it doesn't work? Chances are pretty good that you are wanting some practice in the component parts of the Ping, especially the interception of nerve impulses.</p>

   <p>Internal video games are good for this. Choose a basic video game that involves close-up movement, such as car racing or flight simulation. Establish a vivid visualization in your mind of the surroundings. For example, the view from the pilots' seat in the cockpit. Now, pretend to move the controls of the plane,
   and feel the pitch and roll of the fuselage,without moving your body. The more detail you can hold in your mind, the better. Expect it to take half a dozen tries before you can feel the "movement" and yet not be moving. It is not as easy as it sounds.</p>

   <p>A similar "game" is the practice of mental sports or exercises. Always keeping the visualization in first person (<i>you</i> are doing the action, not watching someone else), pretend to go through the entire sequence of an archery round, or a game of golf, or a match of tennis, or whatever sport appeals to you.
   "Feel" the motions, but keep your body relaxed and still. If you choose a sport that you play in the usual fashion, pretend to play it perfectly in the visualization: every Alpine ski run fast and smooth, hole-in-one on every shot, etc. You are likely to find that the mental practice improves your physical skill,
   in addition to increasing your Ping expertise. There is good reason for the mental rehearsal used by professional and Olympic athletes, after all.</p>

   <p>In a similar vein, vivid first-person visualization of more mundane exercise (chin-ups, push-ups, running, et al) serve a dual purpose. By intercepting the impulses, and preventing the muscles from reacting to the mental commands, you are getting better at an essential Ping skill. There has been some research
   that has shown that doing such exercise a few times a week actually strengthens the muscles, as well. In fact it works almost as well as conventional exercise.</p>

   <p>Something else that gives people problems in Pinging and assorted other psionic activities is the concept of stilling the mind. An absolutely calm, still mind is not required for successful telepathic transmission. In fact, some people find a state of panic more conducive to strong Sendings. Even so, when first
   learning to control one's Sendings, being able to keep your mind free of other distractions is useful (Do you really want to Send all the lurid details of your most recent date to a comparative stranger in a Guess the Fruit game? Or worse, to your mother?). Like most skills, this does get easier with practice.</p>

   <p>One of the easiest methods of quieting the mind's chatter that you don't want to Send is to imagine a blackboard or a drapery of black silk velvet, and then visualize the concept that you want to Send being drawn or written on that backdrop. A blank artists' canvas may be used the same way.</p>

   <p>A very similar method is to imagine a pool of water, still as glass, and picture the concept being reflected on the surface. If the scrying idea appeals to you, imagine a mirror, a crystal ball, a darkened bowl of water, or some such. In fact, you may actually use such a prop, but relying on it can be burdensome
   and inconvenient.</p>

   <p>The act of deliberately visualizing the backdrop - be it canvas, water, crystal, or marshmallows - helps to focus your mind. With practice, the mere intention to do such a visualization will signal your subconscious that it is time to Ping.</p>

   <p>In fact, these methods may be used for a number of activities including receptive telepathy, active Reading, assorted clairvoyant methods, and basic precognition. You might find it worth your while to choose a backdrop and learn it well.</p>

   <p>These exercises should prepare you for successful Pingage. Reading the articles isn't enough, though. You need to actually <i>do</i> the stuff. For those of you seeking the "secret" of how to become a psionicist, you will find that it is the same as the secret to getting to Carnegie Hall: "Practice, baby.
   Practice."</p>
