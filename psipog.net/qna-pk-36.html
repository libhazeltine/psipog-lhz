               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Yes. It appears that strong emotions add extra oomph to psionic effects. _However_, "controlled anger" is rather an unusual accomplishment, and doing pk only while enraged will cause problems.</p>

                  <p>Hello everyone,<br />
                  I'm just curious because I have been trying to bend spoons for 3 or 4 days now but I have had no success I'm just wondering how long it takes to get some results on bending spoons I have tryed meditating but that doesn't really help me that much.</p>

                  <p>Some people that attend "PK Parties" report bending their spoon on their first try. I, on the other hand, have tried multiple times and never succeeded. I suspect the group setting has something to do with it. Check out <a href="http://www.fork-you.com"
                     target="_blank">http://www.fork-you.com</a> for some good info on spoon bending.</p>

                  <p>In solo attempts, for people with no prior experience in pk, I am told that the first attempt takes close to an hour for adults. In this context, you might as well consider "adult" to mean anyone over the age of twelve, because it appears to be connected to the subconsious sabotaging the beginning
                  of the attempt with programmed "beliefs" of "this can't be done". As you know, the subconscious likes to obey orders, and it is the one doing most of the work in psionics. The same obeying-orders principle appears to be at work when a hypnotist tells his/her subject that s/he can't open his/her eyes,
                  and the subject then fails to open them when s/he tries....even though s/he _knows_ s/he can do it.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Get the basics down good first. Basic energy manipulation, and basic energy perception. Nearly all skills are built off of those. The typical route for manipulation is: psi ball -&gt; shield -&gt; complex constructs, and the usual progression for perception usually starts with empathy or
                  telepathy, and moves on from there.</p>

                  <p>That doesn't mean you HAVE to do it that way. Many people just pick and choose what skills to learn, and do fine. If you want to learn everything though, don't form any bad habits training for one particular skill, and try to get the basics down real good.</p>

                  <p>If you are using pk to move them, it is easier to move only one than to move all of them. If some other not-pk element is at work (a breeze, magnetic influences, and so on) they are more likely to move at roughly the same time.</p>

                  When I try to light something up using the tecnique of vizualizing the atoms and moving them fast I start to breath very rapidly and my heart rate goes sky high and also my face is starting to twich. Are this sort of simptoms normal or will they go away with practice?</p>

                  <p>You're trying too hard. Either chill out voluntarily, or keep at it and chill out _permanently_. Pyrokinesis is (obviously) one aspect of Psychokinesis, and shares the risks inherent in all PK.</p>
