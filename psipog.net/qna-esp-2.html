                  <p>Telepathic pings do not have to instigate any other neccessary action(s). For instance, if I was to walk up to a person on the street and say hi to them, we would not necessarily stop to hold a conversation.<br />
                  Depending on your skill in broadcasting, people may or may not be able to hear you broadcast. As you get better, you will notice that sensitive people will react first, and people that are not sensitive at all will barely react at all.</p>

                  <p>Hi I have been a member for about 4 months now and I have not have had any proggresive except spoon bending and moving the psiwheel. Today I had a very strange experience, I had a Starbucks canned double shot before my class and I had been kinda hyper for a bit(^^). Later we picked number 1-100
                  for doing a presentation. First the number just came to me (7) and when it was announced I thought it was coincedence. Then I tried it the second time and guessed 43 and yet again I was correct. After Class was an awards assembly and I just heard tons of thoughts in my head that were not mine... My
                  question is, does caffiene help with telepathy?</p>

                  <p>There is some research that has pointed to caffeine having an effect on telepathy. There has also been some research on its effects on telepathy that came up with negative results. It is still open to question.</p>

                  waht do you mean tensing and relaxing the muscles?<br />

                  <p>Projecting your awareness is done the same way it would be if you were just "checking around the corner" from the sensitivity manual.</p>

                  <p>You do not have to know the place beforehand (knowing can lead to inaccurate data sometimes)</p>

                  <p>By tensing and relaxing muscles, it was meant that you actually physically flex your muscles (this can focus you just as if you had been meditating or trancing, and it Yumper's preferred method, last I knew)</p>

                  <p>Yes, you can physically move while RPing, however, it functions the same as opening your eyes in that it does serve as a distracton.</p>

                  <p>Hi. I just signed up today, and I was wondering if anyone knew how to stop recieving emotions? See, I've always (or at least as long as I remember, I'm 18.) have been able to recieve the emotions of other people, but I don't know how to stop it. When I go into crowds, like at festivals and such, I
                  get all these foriegn emotions that just pour into me. So, does anyone know how to stop it?</p>

                  <p>One of the things that I hyave noticed about psionics is that it has a tendency to fluctuate. Some people beleive that this has to do with different external forces (solar flares has been proposed). However, in my experience if you continue to practice just like you used to, you will continue to
                  get better on the whole. I have had people ask me to do psychic things before, and had to tell them that I had been having an off week (for some reason psionics were less than 40% correct during that time period). Kepp practicing, it will come back.</p>
