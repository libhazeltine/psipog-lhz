                  <p>If 2 people are practicing telepathy between themselves and together wish to look into the thoughts of a third unparticipating party, is that possible to do so simultaneously, and if so can the 2 communicate with each other still while in the mind of the third without the third person relizing it/
                  hearing it. For the purposes of this question let's assume that the third unparticipating party has no known abilities in this area to speak of, but is aware that the first 2 parties have been using her for different practices. Thank you for your time.</p>

                  <p>About how long does it take to get the hang of telepathy? If you practice 3 to 7 times a day around 10 minutes each. I don't mean be a master, just get the hang of it. Like psi balls, not a master at them, but can make visible ones after 6 weeks of practice.</p>

                  <p>It will take different people a different amount of time to learn different skills. kinda like asking how long does it take you to learn how to ride a bike so that you won't fall. I would say more than 2 weeks, less than 2 months, on average. However, I am sure that it takes some people longer
                  than that, and other people shorter than that. It all depends on the person, and we cannot say with any accuracy whether it will take you a year, two years, or a week.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>To some extend, every telepathic communication involves a link. However, you can have a telepathic communication without the *will* to create a link. For instance, if you are training telepathy, and discover that you are getting telepathic information without actually sitting down and creating a
                  link, do a scan of yourself at that moment and see if you have indeed created a link without meaning to. In most cases, I am sure that you will find that there *is* a link there even though you did not intend to create one.</p>

                  <p>This is usually (but not always) the result of training your sub-conscious to link, and it eventually will begin to do it during your everyday life. Also, it is called a sub-conscious lin, and can be the result of you awctually wanting to link with someone, even if you did not pput forth the
                  physical effort in order to do so.</p>

                  <p>short answer: it is not necessary to create a lin to communicate, but it will strengthen the communication (clearer and more accurate) if you do create a link.</p>

                  <p>What do you call the ability to see with your eyes closed? Ive been playing a game called Gunbound, witch is a turn bassed shooter and did the this: close my eyes when the game loads so i dont see my enemies or allies, when the game starts i open my eyes to see witch way im looking and what angle.
                  Then i just "blindly" shoot (when i say blindly i mean with my eyes closed. Shooting is based on the more u hold it the longer it goes. Using this method 38/50 times ive hit the enemy. Playing normaly i hit 15/50 (i know, im hopeless!).</p>

                  <p>Hello,<br />
                  I am fairly new to all of this, and almost gave up on it after getting the psi wheel to move. Now im back, though, and really interested in learning. My question is this: has anyone "stolen" a loved ones discomfort from them, so they didnt have to deal with it? I think it is because my subconsious
                  sees her as more important than myself, but i could very easily be wrong.<br />

                  Is it possible that i can actually "see" the energy flowing from my hands? I think I'd best describe it as a ripple in the air, going upward like smoke. Also, I read that it was possible to create visible psi-balls, cubes, whatever, but can someone point out how this is done? More visualizing?<br />

                  <p>Yes, it is possible, but more people than not describe it as a feeling, rather than a visual sight. For me, it is more something that lingers just out of personal sight, but has a definate tactile quality to it. As far as creating a visible psi-ball, I suggest you read the article on the subject,
                  it is Evan's Flaring Guide.</p>

                  <p>Sorry for asking so many questions, I'm currently too obsessed with TP.</p>

                  <p>1) How do u ping someone far far away with a "psi tube"? I read in one of the articles in your web: visualising a psi tube from your mind extending out and bouncing off the other person and also programming the end of the tube my message. But since that person is like on the other side of the
                  world, how do u actually extend the psi tube??? [sry, kinda silly qns, but plz answer it]</p>

                  <p>2) Can a person who doesn't practice TP, pick up my pinged signal?</p>

                  <p>1) typically it helps as a visualization, to picture them in the room with you. Mentallly, this makes them closer (even if they are not) and can lead to a more effective ping/message.</p>

                  <p>2) Yes, but more often than not, even if you do everything right, even if the person is sensitive they will not pick up the signal. For this case it helps me to try to send a 'louder' (stronger sending) signal to the person.</p>

Well, after digging deeper into it and how to help focus my qi, I found this site through a link on a myspace account.

                  <p>It isn't unheard-of, but I wouldn't call it "normal" as such. You might consider putting _less_ oomph into the psiballs. If you've been working with Qi in your martial art, you may find that the basic psi-manipulation comes a little more easily to you than to folks starting from scratch.</p>
