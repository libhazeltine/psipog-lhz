                  <p>I have a weird feeling these last nights. While lying in my bed, and started getting to sleep, I could hear different voices (of different people in different pitches of voices) inside my head but certainly I know that I'm still awake. I could tell that these voices are not coming from the outside
                  through my ears, but I think its coming inside from my head or something. It happend to me for three (3) times of non-consecutive (random) nights. Could it be an accidental telephaty?<br />
                  Hope my question is not rubbish... Im waitng for your answers.. thanks in advance...!</p>

                  <p>Ok, i'm sorry if you've been asked this question before, but i've looked and i couldn't find anything similar.</p>

                  <p>When i try to RV or just extend my awareness or perceive something, how do i know i'm not just imagining what i'm seeing/feeling? for example, if i try and make a psiball, how do i know the tingly feeling i get on my hands isn't just caused by me imagining my hands are tingling, because that's
                  what i've read most people feel?</p>

                  <p>Also, when i try to RV, i can't seem to stop "imagining" or "visualising" the place i'm trying to go to in my head. Are there any tips you could give me?</p>

                  <p>I hope that wasn't too confusing, but i wasn't quite sure how to put it.<br />

                  <p>Short answer, you don't. If you keep records of your results, you will accumulate enough data to be able to estimate the likelihood of accuracy, after a few years. Otherwise, for things like psiballs, a second opinion is pretty-much required.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hi, i was wondering if you could help me out with the term "Empath" ive always thought of this as a description of a person who can pick up emotions similiar to the way a "Telepath" picks up thoughts. However while search on the net about various types of sensitives i found that "Empath" and
                  "Empathy" is commonly referred to as "a person who recieves any clairvoyant or extra sensory information through emotions and feelings" It is seen as slightly similiar to clairsentience in the sense that the person gets an emotional response to an area or situation which is what has the information.
                  I find all this very interesting because that describes the way i do psychic work, even when doing things like telepathy i don't mentally receive the information.. it is shown to me through "vibes" which i translate into an image. I was wondering if you could help me understand the term better.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>In common with most psionics terms, the meaning of "Empath" varies somewhat with the experience of the writer/speaker. Generally, it means "someone who experiences other people's emotions" and/or "someone who can cause other people to experience his/her emotions". The "vibes" thing tends to be
                  associated with psychometry, also known as retrocognition. That said, all the perceptive abilities overlap to some degree, and may be lumped together under "psychic phenomena".</p>

                  <p>The simularity in the results has interfered with research. Telepathic overlay contaminates data in Remote Viewing, especially when the monitor has an idea about the target. And imagined sounds and images are easily mistaken for telepathic and clairvoyant data.</p>

                  <p>It seems to be reasonably common, yes. If it is consistent, no problem. If you consistently get "green" in place of "red", for example, report it as such in your practice: "Hmmm Getting impression of green, and that always means red, so that house must be "red"."</p>

                  <p>hi, i stumbled across this site while trying to find an explanation for something strange that happened to me recently. i've never put much thought into any of this stuff beyond "wow, that would be cool." so... browsed the site, read EVERY article and question that seemed to be pertaining to
                  anything related to what i experienced, and although i found some info, i still wanna know what in the WORLD it was that happened... so... i guess its time to explain it, and mabye one of you guys will have some kinda answer for me... i hope...</p>

                  <p>this person that i met online only, never in real life... well he "touched" me... maybe that sounds crazy even to you guys :p but we were chatting and at the EXACT moment that he typed "did you feel that" (and we had not been discussing anything relating to ANYTHING on this site, so i had no way
                  of expecting it or imagining it on my own, so i know it was an ACTUAL sensation) i felt this... tingling sensation on the back of my head, just above my neck. it freaked me out and i demanded him explain what he meant by "did you feel that". and he told me that he had attempted to touch me (in a few
                  more words than that) and i asked where exactly, he said my neck...(which is only SLIGHTLY off) anyways, it was REALLY weird, and im not particularly prone to believe in this type of stuff (strong southern baptist upbringing) anyways since then i've been quite FREQUENTLY feeling this tingling
                  sensation... mostly in my head.... very strongly... and often in other areas throughout my body... i've made my own guesses as to what this was... (actually landed on this site by google search that turned up the article on linking, and some of it made sence to me). but like i said im not
                  particularly prone to believe in this kinda thing, so im not playing it up to be something more than it was or exaggerating. i know this is kinda long, but i wanted to give detail so that MAYBE someone could tell me what is going on. i'd actually like to talk about it, but i cant download the chat
                  thing... if my husband found it in the pc he'd wanna know what it is, then i'd have to explain and really dont wanna.... so... on that note, i noticed a mention of message boards, but cant seem to find the link for them... maybe im blind or dumb and the link is right in front of my face... but ya...
                  um... any help on this is appriciated... i tried to be brief in the description, i can supply more details if needed... and here i am taking up MORE space :( sorry.</p>

                  <p>It doesn't require a link to do what you are describing. However, in many cultures it is impolite, and possibly worse, to touch someone without permission, psionically or otherwise. It is possible to Shield against it, and it might even work to simply ask him to stop it.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hi<br />
                  I spend about 90 minutes a day on buses and use this time to practice Psi abilities. I make Psiballs and play with shields, which I don't think affect other people. I try and sense the people round me through my field eg. is there some one sitting behind me, can I feel them or is the seat empty. I
                  have tried RV'ing other people and pinging them and floating up and expanding my field to fill the whole bus is fun (I have no idea what that falls under - my imagination maybe?). I went through a phase of trying to extend a tendril to read people, then realised that if it worked it was rude so I
                  stopped that. Over the last few months I have more or less practiced article of the day with no specific plan or reasoning and I've read most articles.</p>

                  <p>My question is if there was another psion on the bus eg. one of the moderators, would they be able to detect what I am doing? If so would they be amused, irritated, offended? Am I doing anything silly and is there anything I shouldn't do in such a public place? I don't want to offend anyone or
                  open myself up to unwanted attention.</p>

                  <p>As an aside I sat next to an Indian gentleman once who was the psychic equivalent of a 10 ton block of black granite, what a prescence. Then I noticed he was reading a spiritual book of yoga. I figured something in the yoga he practiced had created a shield up of some sort.</p>

                  <p>Thanks<br />

                  <p>Short version: such activity is detectable to anyone Sensitive to such things who happens to be paying attention. The Pinging could be annoying. Assuming the Shield forms to be harmless, they and the psiballs are unlikely to bother anyone.</p>
