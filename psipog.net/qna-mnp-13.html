                  <p>Short Answer: no one really knows<br />
                  Long Answer: It takes different people differing amounts of time. I made a psi-ball before I had ever heard the term "psi-ball". NI has tried for a long time, and so far been unsuccessful (whether that is due to his own skepticism or not has remained to be proven). I have heard of people taking a few
                  months, and others taking a few hours. Try for yourself and see.</p>

                  <p>I was reading Throwing and Sending Psiballs, by tkkid, and I was wondering if it's necessary to program a psiball to go somewhere, or if you can just "push" it. What I mean is, you can move it easily between your hands or across a room, but do you have to program it to go further?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Whether you personally have to program a psi-ball to go to it's destined location is really dependent on the way in which you make them and control them (the sub-conscious mind of each user here is quite different). I know several people that RP/RV/clairvoyance to the location and then actually
                  make the psi-ball there. I know some people that make a solid shell around the psi-ball, and then give it a push. Others program the psi-ball to disassemble into energy fragments and then go to the location (I am against this aproach as often it brings fragments of energy to where it's supposed to be
                  sent, instead of the actual ball).</p>

                  <p>Try and see that works best for you. Oftentimes if it is shelled very well, it works better (especially in the just-push-it method), but in the RP/RV/clairvoyance method, it doesn't need to be shelled at all. Try several methods and see what works.</p>

                  <p>The real question behind this is "why are you makig your psi-ball?"</p>

                  <p>The location of a psi-ball is designed to help in whatever you are trying to accomplish. Although most of the time is is not practical to make a psi-ball in China, you may play a game of 'send the construct' with someone in China, and need to send that energy to them.</p>

                  <p>For another example, let's say that you are making a cold-compress psi-ball (a cold psi-ball designed to cool a headache of sore muscles). What good is this construct is if it is not located on the affected area? You want this construct to be located on your head to cool it, or affected muscles to
                  sooth them.</p>

                  <p>Where you select for making your psi-ball is significant because of what you want th epsi-ball to do.</p>

Ugh.

Here's the thing.  People ask the same thing, over, and over, and over, and over, and over again.

From the user's perspective, they are new, and they are just looking for a little help.

But from the author's perspective, it's the millionth time hearing the same question.

I think the thing that is most damaging to the author is that you KNOW that, no matter what, you
are going to be asked this question... over... and over... there is nothing you can do to stop it.
It's hopeless.

So you do your best, and try not to sound like a dick, and try to point people in the right
direction... but really, you're thinking: just fuck off.  If you can't figure it out, then just
go away.

But what a harsh response, and we can all remember the time when we were new... so we grunt and
ignore the question, or post links.

...And then someone asks again.

                  <p>Interesting rumour, that is. Personally, I was unaware that the Moon gave off any rays of its own. What manner of transformation are these "lunar rays" supposed to induce in the lichens? Are the rays also supposed to affect mosses? Algae? Cyanobacteria?</p>

                  <p>Without further information about the rumour, it is somewhat difficult to track down its truth or falsehood. My guess is that it is merely a rumour. The lichens are likely to be in more danger from earthbound threats such as critters who eat them, pollution, and trampling. In fact, being munched
                  by caribou (reindeer, for the Europeans) is guaranteed to cause a transformation in the lichens...from "lichen" to "deer droppings". <img src="happy.gif"
