                  <p>Another question about TK: When I move the psi wheel, there is always one corner (and it's always the same one) that moves toward my finger instead of away like the others. This happens no matter how hard i focus on moving it forward. Any suggestions? Any idea as to why this happens?</p>

                  <p>Its me again, asking another telekinesis question. Will there be a point where I will be able to lift, roll, spin, etc anything I want (as long as it isn't too big for my brain, and after I have practice for like a year or two.)?<br />
                  Or do I have to practice on every item i want to move, and only be able to move those things. I hope my question is understandable!</p>

                  <p>No, you don't have to practice with each item. But it is important to practice different types of movements. i.e. spinning, rolling, sliding, levitation, etc. Your subconscious needs to get used to different types of telekinestic movement.</p>

                  <p>There might be even a point where you'll be able to spin different things, for example: paper-on-pin, cd-on-pin or simply a pen hanging from the ceiling. But you won't be able to roll things, even very small ones.</p>

                  <p>So basically, you'll need to train different types of movement and the "power" implied to move bigger stuff. But you won't need to train again and again with different items.</p>

                  <p>When i start spinning the psiwheel, it maintains the same speed only for few second and the it stops and its hard to do it again. How can i maintain the speed? Moreover, when i try to move it, it usually bobbing up and down without spinning. why? how can i do it only to spin?</p>

                  <p>Why am i not able to move heavier objects? such as a pencil or thick paper...or at least after how many days i should move to bigger objects? thanks.</p>

                  <p>To answer the first block of your questions. These are the usual problems of lack of _control_. I suggest more practice, meditation and patience. You might need months to gain better control.</p>

                  <p>Only you can know when you are ready to move to heavier objects. When you feel comfortable with the wheel and know that you can move it anytime you want, then you might try to roll the pencils. ... <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>Just relax and watch. It doesn't really matter whether your eyes are blurry or not as long as you don't lose the concentration. You may allow your eyes to lose the focus if they feel like it. don't force, relax and let your body do its job. Don't worry about the clarity in your eyes, just watch
                  the light and let it "enter" your subconscious. You are basically in a "daydream state" watching the light source.</p>

                  <p>First off, I would like to thank you people for my success I have had already in telekinesis. I've been working on the psi-wheel for about 2 weeks, and I can make it spin pretty well. I went on to pencils and after hours of just staring at it without results I had a question: Can I practice with
                  the psi-wheel for a few more weeks without trying to move any other object, and then when I can move the psi-wheel with more control, then can I move on to more things? And will moving different things be easier if I get really good at the psi wheel? Thanks!</p>

                  - Whatever you feel like. It's your choice. If you think you should, then do it.</p>

                  <p>"And will moving different things be easier if I get really good at the psi wheel?"<br />
                  - Most likely it won't be much easier... unless you move something which somehow looks like a psiwheel. But your subconscious often refuses to move any other thing, even if it's small and easy. My suggestion is: practice different things parallely</p>

                  <p>hey iam kinda new to this and i was wondering.<br />
                  I started this like 3 weeks ago and i could move my psi-wheel on the first try (first it kinda danced the it spun like 90 degress).<br />
                  well all the articles say it should take weeks to months (even years) to make it spin but i got it to spin in several mins and my power never disapperd or lowered like it says in some articles and now have more control over it then be for.</p>

                  <p>ANYWAY my question is: is that a good or bad sign, being able to move it good right off the bat? is it a sign that my power will drop drasticly at some point? or do i just have a head start in this?</p>

                  <p>also i'm worryed... how hard could it be to give some one a brain hemorage accidentally. i dont want to kill any one just becouse my subconscious thought my pinching this guys head meant pop a blood vessle in his head.</p>

                  <p>First of all, telekinesis is not done by imagination. And even visualization is a cheap trick if you ask my opinion.</p>

                  <p>Your mind can do so many things besides imagination/visualization. Why do you think you have to imagine the object moving in order to move it?</p>

                  <p>However that's my opinion, if visualization works for you, then keep with it. Besides, a week is a short time, you need patience. It may take much longer. If it doesn't work for pencils try other things, you can find some good articles on PsiPog.</p>

                  <p>Here the deal: I started TK training for the first time using Gnome's method yesterday, and got the psi wheel to spin 360 degress +. Today, however, I'm getting some movement, but nothing more than 10 degrees. I'm not feeling any energy transfer when I do it, and if it does work it's immediately
                  when I bring my thumb close to it. So is it possible that it's moving just because of the breeze my hand makes when I move it close? The same thing happens with fire. I bring my hand close and it moves a little, but it looks almost as though it's just being pushed by the breeze...</p>

                  <p>It is possible that it is a breeze from your own hand.</p>

                  <p>I have to admit that I experienced the same thing when I just started. However when I moved the hand very slowly towards the wheel it moved, too, and sometimes pretty fast.</p>

                  <p>My suggestion is, when it happens next time don't lose yourself. Try to stay in the same state of mind and provide further movement. Believe that it is your energy field interacting with the energy field of the object. You'll see very soon that it's not the breeze moving it.</p>

                  <p>If you keep practicing like that in less than few weeks the wheel will be spinning like crazy just by holding your hand next to it <img src="wink.gif"

                  <p>Hello...<br />
                  I have a question again (hope I dont annoy you! :))</p>

                  <p>Well, I had my first success (psiwheel) in 3days...without meditation.<br />
                  As a conclusion, I understood that meditation doesnt help because I can move it with none of it. Will meditation help at any way? or i will spend my time if i do it?<br />
                  Finally, i admit that meditation is boring. If only i could do it for 10minutes... :)</p>

                  <p>I need your help.</p>

                  <p>That's right. TK can be done without meditation, but meditation can be a great help. Not only for tk but for all aspects of your life.</p>

                  <p>Meditation helps only when done often on a regular basis. You won't notice anything different after few times. But as you become better you'll experience deeper and deeper states of mind. You feel full of life and absolutely calm after a good deep one. That's one of the most cool feelings one can
                  experience <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>Meditation will provide you better control over your own mind and body. How do you want to control objects with your mind if you can't even control your own mind (subconscious)? Many of you guys have the problem that when you try to move the wheel in a particular direction it moves like 10 degrees
                  and then it stops and moves in the other direction. How to fix it? ... <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>You'll be amazed how easy it is to control the wheel after months of regular practice and meditation. <img src="blah.gif"
