                  <p>Hi.</p>

                  <p>Is there anywhere on your site where an announcement could be made, or a web link posted, regarding a course that is going to occur in Portugal, Europe, on December, with psychokinesis being one of the main subjects?</p>

                  <p>This course is given by Dr. Joe Gallenberger, which is considered to be a manifestation expert, and also teaches at the Monroe Institute (besides having his own courses/workshops).</p>

                  <p>The URL is: synccreationinportugal.com</p>

                  <p>If you can, please reply to my email: rper@mac.com</p>

                  <p>Thanks,<br />

                  <p>1) When I saw your post/question, I went to look at his site. If you compare the two, you will find that the information is somewhat different. (And, by our standards, most of his is fluffy, at best.) We did not steal any of his work.</p>

                  <p>2) It is okay if you're 14.</p>

                  <p>3) Don't worry about the small errors in the text. English is a difficult language to learn, and you seem to express yourself quite well in it.</p>
