                  <p>Has anyone tried moving a compass with a magnetic psiball? I find it a useful boost of confidence as to "this is real". I make magnetic balls as opposed to hot or cold. This seems to be a nice exercise to contol energy flow too, trying to reverse the polarity.</p>

                  <p>You can leave your eyes open when making psiballs. Feel free to dim the lights if you feel like it. If you are working on flaring your psiballs, the dimmer light is useful for seeing faint psiballs. Otherwise, it appears to make no difference.</p>

                  <p>Yes, it could be that you have a made a psi-ball. however, this could be a phenomenon that is known as biofeedback. the thing to do in order to test that this is not biofeedback is to see if another friend can feel the ball that you have made. Other than that, this is a normal thing for people
                  that have made a psi-ball to feel.</p>

                  <p>yes. More effectively, if you can find a place that has a vast amount of energy running through it (ley line of such), you can program a psiball to gather that energy and then just send fragments of itself, shelled, when needed <img src="wink.gif"

                  <p>I have a couple of questions for you that have been on my mind for a good while I have searched for this questions but unable to find a satisfactory answer. anyway my questions are these:<br />
                  1: when you visualize yourself drawing energy from a source do you actually do it? or is it just a way for your mind to prepare for what psionic you may do.<br />
                  2: can you REALLY program psi to do anything? have you tried to program psi to do anything?<br />
                  3: is aerokinesis=the ability to create wind with psi or psychokinesis possible?<br />
                  4: is electrokinesis=the ability to create electricity with psi or psychokinesis possible?<br />
                  5: well i've heard a couple of times that you can't program psi yo do something u cant do. I can't create heat; but with psiballs I can.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1 - when you are visualizing soething, it is like telling your sub-conscious mind that you are wanting to do something, and then your sub-conscious mind recognizes this drives and then uses an already-existing method (psi, in the case of psionics) in order to accomplish this goal. Researchers
                  refer to psionics as something that is need-driven (ex. if the goal was to stop a machine from working, hitting the power switch or disconnecting a cable internally stops the machine more often than psionics will hold a physical machine part back, unless the goal was to stop the machine part

                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" /> )<br />
                  2 - anything is a VERY broad term, and has a number of distinct limitations. For instance, the vast majority of the time, if you cannot do something, you cannot program psi to do that thing eigther (there are a few exceptions).<br />
                  3 - &lt;fill-in-the-blank-latin-word&gt;-kinesis is DEFINED as the ability to manipulate &lt;fill in the blank latin word&gt;. Also, all of these are simply consider psychokinesis (both by researchers and by www.spipog.net<br />
                  4 - see 3<br />
                  5 - Psiballs, as a byproduct are hot (most of the time). One could also argue that if you can make a psi-ball hot, then you could also make something else hot. At any rate, the rule that you cannot program psi to do something that you cannot do is a good one to follow (and is true the majority of the
                  time).</p>

                  <p>i was just thinking... is there anything you can do with non-flared psiballs? I mean you can't really do fun things like throw them or make them into shapes. And flaring is made out to be pretty advanced on this site.</p>

                  <p>i dont really know how to put the question in a simple sentance :P</p>

                  <p>First of all, having a scientific mind is not an impediment to practicing psionics. Having deeply ingrained beliefs about what "science" says about the world is another question entirely: science is a method, not a belief.</p>

                  <p>As to your actual question, you certainly do not need to start with psiballs. However, you can shape them, throw them, and turn them into yoyo's if you want to. Of course, if you change their shape, they are no longer psiballs....they become psicubes, psibunnies, psidodecahedrons, etc.</p>

                  <p>Things you can learn without learning psiballs first include --but are not limited to-- telepathy, psychokinesis, constructs other than psiballs, clairvoyance, precognition, doing laundry, abstract mathematics....you get the idea.</p>

                  <p>Ive been into "energy manipulation" for a few months now, and ive studied all kinds of articles (by the by, thank you so much, this truely is the best site on the web)and, as far as i can tell, all the stuff about drawing energy from the sun, moon, earth, ect. is just a bunch of crap. I mean, ive
                  been pretty sucessful with the simple understanding that people have this ability, with further practice it can be developed,and we dont know how it works yet (completely). Basically im asking: Is drawing energy from the sun and stuff a reality, or a mental cruch to help with newbies manipulating

                  <p>That's a great question. You'll notice that there are a lot of questions like that in psionics - unfortunately, there really aren't any straight answers. There are plenty of OPINIONS, but very few FACTS. I personally believe it is possible to draw energy from yourself OR external objects. Others
                  believe you can't draw from external objects, and that it's only a crutch. And even others believe you can't draw from yourself.</p>

                  <p>HI,<br />
                  My question is on manipulating where energy comes from.I have been playing with this idea for a while now and wondering if it is possible. From what I get from researching the subject... There are lines of energy that run all over the world... Our minds can tap into these lines of energy and apply
                  intent to it... Please correct me if any of this information is wrong.</p>

                  <p>A:) Would it be possible to create a line or manipulate one of these lines store energy for a planned project.</p>

                  <p>B:) During my meditation sessions I have been able to create large pinkish red balls (about the size of a computer tower exept round) that sort of float around the room.</p>

                  <p>Please help me explane what it is I am doing or if my theroys are correct This happens each time I go into a Mediation</p>

                  <p>Sounds like you're talking about Ley Lines. Some people believe in them... others don't. Since we don't even know what psi IS, I don't think it's beneficial to start getting into complicated matters like lines of energy on the earth, etc... Start simple. Work your way up. Can you make a ball of
                  energy? If yes, then good! Figure out other things you can do as well.</p>
