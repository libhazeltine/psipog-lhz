                  <p>hi, i am new to all this and i find this AMAZING!!!but i was just wondering, if this has been asked im sorry i looked and didnt see :D but on average how long does it take for someone new to make a psi ball? or does it depend on a person's attributes or health? which would then make it different
                  times</p>

                  <p>This question come sup quite often, and the answer is still the same. It take different people different lengths of time to learn different things. Some people make a psi-ball on their firt time, others make them after a week, or a month, or a year. However, most people around here tend to stay
                  under a month, on average.</p>

                  <p>Hi,<br />
                  I was just surfing in internet 2 days ago and just found magic, psi energy etc... When i found this site!<br />
                  I'm practicing doing psi balls but i don't know how to visualize the energy coming from the source to my body, Do you imagine in the first person or in the third person ?<br />
                  For me it's easier to imagine in the third person where i see myself stand and energy from the moon coming in my direction.</p>

                  <p>Just to give you a little background, visualizations are used to tell your sub-conscious mind to accomplish some task. So, whatever visualization that you are using, as long as it works it is good. Try to do it in first person, and try to do it in third person, and then whichever works best, use
                  that ;).</p>

                  <p>I was reading about the psi-balls in The Psion's Handbook, and as I was reading and looked at the picture of the blue ball that Peebrain said was psi, i started to get a weird feeling. Also, THE SECOND I started to imagine the blue ball right above my bellybutton, I had a tingly feeling in my abs
                  (kind of like I was almost gonna throw-up) and soon my fingertips were warm. I know that all of these abilities happen differently for each person, so should I worry about anything?</p>

                  <p>From what you say here, you have probably made your first psi-ball, congratulations. I wouldn't worry about anything, but if you think there may be something wrong, talk to your doctor.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Short answer: No<br />
                  Long Answer: depending on the task that you want the energy to accomplish, then you may or may not need to shell the energy. For example, if the object of the construct is merey to be thrown at the nearest wall, shelling it would pretty much be a waste of time. However, if the purpose is to send it
                  to a friend in China, then shelling it before it undergoes such a journey is a good idea. If the object is to have it last several days as a blob of energy, then shelling it is a _must_</p>

                  <p>real answer: all depends on your purpose, decide for yourself ;)</p>
