                  <p>Wow, this will sound lame, but can you do "Jedi mind tricks" using TK? By that I mean can you influence someone to do something, like "oh, this drinks on the house", or, "here, ill just boost this test grade up 20 points". Just kidding, but is this possible?</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>My close friend Tekproxy is starting to believe that I have some sort of "natural" knack for kinesis. I'm not sure which ones though. How many different kineseis's are there and what could a psion do with each? I have read a little on elctrokinesis and that really got my attention. Is there any
                  special way to really hone in on that specific type? And one more thing...I am having lots of trouble focusing psi to make a ball. I've read/printed the how-to on it from here but I can't seem to make it happen. Are there any special techniques ya'll reccommend?</p>

                  <p>(Tekproxy, eh? Alex Cassel?)</p>

                  <p>There are basically two kinds of psychokinesis: micro and macro. One is a sort of "probability alteration" and requires the use of statistical analysis to demonstrate. The other one ("macroPK"), is the kind that makes a fairly obvious effect, small or otherwise.</p>

                  <p>Most of "electrokinesis" falls under the microPK category. If it appeals to you, try playing with psi-games on the computer, or messing about with multimeters and voltmeters. (Warning: you might kill the device, if you run too much psi-stuff through it)</p>

                  <p>Figuring out what parts of pk you are most suited to would probably be related to finding out why your friend thinks you have a talent for it. Try several and see what happens?</p>

                  <p>Of course. You would do this in the same way as you get different colours in a campfire: either change the amount of heat, or burn different substances (sugar, various kinds of firewood, pinecones, et al).</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I need help with Telekinesis.</p>

                  <p>About a year or two ago I was very good at it, and could move the pinwheel with ease. But lately self doubt and a clouded mind seemed to have completely screwed my chances of ever doing it again.</p>

                  <p>Every time I sit down at the pinwheel, I try to move it. Then I feel like I'm doing everything wrong. Then I tell myself that is nothing but self doubt, and self doubt will get me nowhere. Then I keep trying, and the damned thing still doesn't move. I get more and more frustrated, and my head
                  feels like it's going to burst..</p>

                  <p>I already know that when my head feels like that it isn't concentration at all. It happens when I try to get rid of other thoughts and try to focus on one thing. When I get to that point I can't focus on anything, and I get really frustrated with the whole exercise.</p>

                  <p>I'm heading back to reading the articles. It's been a year since I did TK last, and I'm fearing the worst that I have forgotten how to do it, or became "rusty."</p>

                  <p>I just need help with this whole focusing thing...how the hell do I get past it all??</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>First of all, self-doubt does not prevent telekinesis from happening. Some doubt in your mind is not a problem. However, oddly enough, if your subconscious is convinced that "self-doubt will prevent telekinesis from occurring" it is quite capable of fulfilling that program, by simply not making
                  the object move.</p>

                  <p>If you learned to do it a year ago, you can learn to do it now....assuming you haven't caused any permanent damage in the interim.</p>

                  1. If i get realy physicaly tired after about 30-50 minutes of practicing tk is that some kind of evidence that it is pk and not somthing else?</p>

                  <p>2. And what angle and where should i look and the psi-wheel when i try to spin it with no hands?</p>

                  <p>3. And should i try to pull/push one of the edges like, push/pull the first one then the other one untill it is spinning?</p>

                  <p>4. Or should i try to spin it around it's center, like move the whole thing in one motion?</p>

                  <p>1) Not necessarily. Intense concentration for an extended period will tire you out, whether or not you are doing anything psionic.</p>

                  <p>2) Doesn't make much difference. Try an assortment and see what appeals to you. The psiwheel I play with is on a shelf roughly half-a-metre above my computer screen. Doesn't seem to make much difference whether it is there, or on the desk.</p>

                  <p>3) That can work.</p>

                  <p>Air, temperature and electrical stuff can all be affected by Psychokinesis, and so, yes, those are real. The dorky names for all the possible things a person can use PK for, however, are chiefly derived from role-playing games, where game balance requires subdivision that has nothing to do with
