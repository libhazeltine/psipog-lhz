                  <p>The only way to be really sure is to have someone else verify it. If someone else can feel it there, you can be reasonably sure you made one. _However_, if the "someone" you ask _doesn't_ feel it, the result becomes inconclusive. Some "someones" are better at perceiving psionic constructs than
                  others.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I just started practicing telepathy a few days back and tried secretly pinging to my friends in school today. None of my pings worked.</p>

                  <p>My question is this:<br />
                  1) Can pinging be done to anyone???? Even those we haven't seen before, but we chatted together online, though he is living on the other side of the world.<br />
                  2) Is making psi balls a requirement in pinging?<br />
                  3) After reading The Telepathy Manual on pinging. They said acquire target. Think about target. Think of what to say and subvocalise it. My question is: after all those steps, how do u actually send the message into their minds?<br />
                  4) Last question: I still dont understand what does thinking AT the target mean?? Can you please explain clearly.</p>

                  <p>THANKS!</p>

                  <p>1) Yes, but it is more difficult to Ping people you do not know, and people who are far away.<br />
                  2) No.<br />
                  3) Not after. During. That _is_ how you do it. You'll generally get more strength in the signal if you repeat it rhythmically, and/or if you fake a strong emotion with it, with or without the conscious pushing of psi-stuff outward toward the person.<br />
                  4) Toward.</p>

                  <p>Though this is not truly loyal to the term, "perception", I have a question. Do believe that by mastering all the aspects of psionics, that one could master more than ten percent of their brain? I've been buying books and the such on the subject, because I want to stimulate brain as much as I
                  possibly can. A hihg amount of these books seem fraudulent, and after slightly scanning some Psions around here, I thought it would be the appropriate place to ask.<br />

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Well... there are a few ways you can tell. The most obvious is that you start receiving emotions/thoughts that aren't yours <img src="wink.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       border="0"
                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />. If you clear out your head and calm your emotions down, you can notice when foreign emotions/thoughts enter. It takes a little practice, but you can do it.</p>

                  <p>Let's say you want to create a link that doesn't allow information to pour in right away (perhaps you're afraid of being overloaded and just want the link to exist). You can tell you have a link if you're good at energy manipulation just from sensing it. Sometimes you can feel pressure in your
                  heart/head area.</p>

                  <p>(I just tried creating a link right now to see what it was like...) I notice that when I create a link that shoots off my chest for empathy, I can feel it extend out... then once it hits my target, I can sort of feel like a release of pressure. I still feel the pressure on my chest from the link,
                  but the anticipation tenseness of the link is relaxed.</p>

                  <p>If I telepathically 'talk' to a dog, will the dog understand what I am saying? Could it understand and know what every word I am saying means? Could the dog talk to me back?

                  <p>Some dogs are pretty good at picking up stuff, telepathically, and others are not so good at it. They aren't that different from humans, in that regard. Whether or not s/he _understands_ what you are saying will depend heavily on how you are conveying it. If s/he understands all the words when you
                  speak aloud, there's a good chance s/he'll understand them when they are Sent, presuming the Sending is clear. If s/he doesn't understand them, the method of communication won't make much difference. This is why it is generally easier to use images, "movies" and the like when communicating
                  telepathically with someone who does not understand your language, regardless of species....of course, if the species has no concept of vision, images won't avail you much, either.</p>

                  <p>Hi people,<br />
                  I just like to ask if anyone had come across the distinct similarities between psi practices i.e. remote viewing,telepathy and the symptoms experienced in schizophrenia or extreme psychosis i.e. hearing voices and experiencing auditory and visual hallucinations. Is there really an obvious difference
                  betwixt parapsychology and psychology or are they in fact one and the same?<br />

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>The simularities have been noticed, yes. In fact, many people who are afflicted with certain kinds of mental illnesses believe that their symptoms are actually psionic in nature, rather than symptoms of their illness. Indeed, some of these people refuse to believe that they are ill. There are some
                  differences between the "hearing voices" experienced by a telepath, and the "hearing voices" experienced by a schizophrenic. The first, and most obvious, of these is that it is possible to verify the telepath's perceptions. Difficult, sometimes, but possible. On the other hand, the question is
                  complicated by the fact that some telepaths are also schizophrenic.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>ABSOLUTELY is a very strong word. The answer to that question is that "no, you don't have to have read Mazrim's Sensitivity Manual in order to practice telepathy." However, in order to receive telepathic (or empathic)messages, you must be sensitive enough to receive them. Whether this sensitivity
                  is trained by the methods that Gnome describes, or by various other methods (including just being pinged until you are sensitive enough to receive them) does not matter.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hello,</p>

                  <p>I have a quick question for anybody who can answer this. I'm also in need of some expertise which is beyond what this site can provide. I've been sensitive or highly sensitive or empathic for as long as I can remember.</p>

                  <p>I also siphon people's anger very quickly. My own anger is equally intense and difficult to deal with or distinguish (other emotions are better). Then again when someone has pissed me off for the last time, they generally fall into the bye-bye category. But if I blow everybody I love off I'll wind
                  up without many people around.</p>

                  <p>My parents and I have wised up over the years to learn how to be angry at each other less. Sometimes my people are just plain emotional (I'm half Chilean, I hear that's how it goes). But my awareness would be just as bad no matter where we had chosen to live.</p>

                  <p>I'm generally not someone who enjoys getting angry but can come off as someone who does. In fact, I try to be less sensitive but still get floored (like nervous breakdown territory floored) - by empathic rage or my own which I can somehow amplify and spew. I know the only thing I can do is shield,
                  sometimes the only tools I have to feel centered is Reiki, aka TT which helps in innumerable ways.</p>

                  <p>I am actually in need of a referral to a psychiatrist (if you can provide that, I appreciate it but I understand why you do not dispense medical advice). I'm also in need of a mentor. This summer I'm willing to put in work in one of your classes. But I'd have to email someone such as Annie to
                  discuss this further.</p>

                  <p>I also would like to find people who use psi with chronic illness if they'd care to discuss it with me further. I'm getting treated for a variety of different ones but nothing is bad to the point I can't go to school (English major, creative writing) or work (let's see how that goes!). I have
                  well-managed insulin dependent diabetes. For more details, someone with a background in holistic health (I took a class this spring, I know a bit) can email me at the email in the site or my private email.</p>

                  <p>I look bipolar to people too as one poster mentioned. I've even had people try to diagnose me this but I just have a mood disorder based on blood sugars like any other diabetic. Eventually I'm looking into biofeedback as an alternative but I'm willing to provide people with further details. I'll
                  also look for emails on your site but I'd like to thank you very much for what you have offered already.</p>

It isn't particularly easy, but it is reasonably effective, if you make the Shield strong enough. I'd recommend several layers if you have the skill to do so.</p>

                  <p>You might find it helpful to Ground excess emotions to earth (see "Normal Uses for Unusual Skills" article). Also, shaking a rattle all around yourself, then "brushing" through your field with your hand, or a construct, can help quite a bit. Yes, I know it looks stupid.</p>

                  <p>Anger is indeed one of the more intense emotions to deal with, in terms of how much it tends to project outwards, all else being equal.</p>

                  <p>Your question clearly has more to it that that part, and I'm not ignoring the other issues. I simply do not have solid answers for them at this time.</p>

                  <p>I put this in Perception because it is tied to RV.</p>

                  <p>I have experimented with going backwards in time (RV + meditation) and every time I run into 2 problems that I can't figure out.</p>

                  <p>1) I expel huge ammounts of psi, which some how limits how long I can stay in the RV of the past. I don't even know how its connected to psi, any help on that one would be great.</p>

                  <p>2) It seems I can only follow my family tree when going backwards. (e.g. if im viewing 1940 and none of my realtives where in paris at the time... I can't view paris... However, I can view their current (at that time of coarse) locations.)</p>

                  <p>Thanks for any help I can get on this.<br />

                  <p>1)It would only seem logical that expelling large amounts of psi would exhuast you mentally, limiting your ability to fufill other mental activities. Work with your mind on when you should and shouldn't use psi and eventually you will find you will not exhuast as fast.</p>

                  <p>2)This could be a few things...One, your relatives could be an easier target in the past for you to aim for due to being bonded through family..Two, as C. Jung would put it, the experiences of your relatives could be buried in your unconcious passed down through the family, allowing you an easier
