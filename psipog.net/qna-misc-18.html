                  <p>Any advice for overcoming doubt?</p>

                  <p>I'm not normally a forum reader/participant but I am REALLY stumped here... I had some success today with some telekinesis work, and immediately after was filled with questioning and doubt about whether or not I was fooling myself, despite some pretty good controls I placed on the experiment.</p>

                  <p>Obviously, as soon as I entered this mode of thought, I couldn't duplicate my own results.</p>

                  <p>What are some of the ways people overcome doubt and mental baggage? (if the answer is "meditation", I'll probably need some specifics beyond that... I meditate regularily)</p>

                  <p>Stick to the facts. That is my advice. Doubt is a good thing, but don't abuse it... if something happens, notice it. Note what could have caused it. Be as complete and detailed as possible in your analysis. When pestering thoughts arise, calmly remind yourself that you have already exhausted every
                  possibility, and move on. "It could have been the wind!" - "Yes, I know, remember we already went over this? Now let's try to move that pinwheel again!!!". <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>one way or another, this is probably a dumb question, but what do you (any of the mods) think are the logical limits of psionics, in general?</p>

                  <p>Keeping in mind this is just my uneducated opinion on the subject, I could formulate some basic beliefs...</p>

                  <p>I would suspect that TK takes up energy and chemicals in the body to exert the force. I don't believe it is just a magical unlimited force, therefore, I believe there is some limit to what can be done before the body passes out from chemical imbalance. Rainsong has reported moving canoes and small
                  boulders... I would suspect the actual limit would be larger than that, but it would be very difficult to get that big. Perhaps something like... an entire car. Again, this is pure "in theory, just guessing" <img src="blah.gif"

                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />.</p>

                  <p>Telepathy seems to be affected by distance... But you can override distance if you have a strong connection with someone. A random psion "shouting" for help close by might get my attention, but if the psion is a few miles away I probably wouldn't feel anything. However, if an online friend like
                  another mod of PsiPog gave out a shout, chances are I would pick it up, even though we live very far apart from each other. I would suspect that the actual limit in distance would be so big, that it really wouldn't be a big deal. People on opposite sides of the world can communicate... I don't think
                  many telepaths will be surfing through space in a shuttle, so who really cares about pressing that issue further.</p>

                  <p>RVing seems about the same as telepathy... I've heard people can RV other planets, but who really knows if it's accurate or not? Not like you can confirm it...</p>

                  <p>What other skills? Constructs can basically be made to do anything, given enough psi, and enough skill. House shields are somewhat common... I'd imagine you could make an enormous shield as an upper-limit on the skill.</p>

                  <p>And then you might want to think about what the limits are when two or three people are involved in a specific goal. Does it add to the limit? Does it multiply the limit? Is it exponential?</p>

                  <p>Heh, I could go on and on and on about theory. That's why I try to stay focused on practical things... The field of psionics is so unknown that theories almost seem like a waste of time. Get out there and learn something! Don't just sit there and think about "could this, and what if".</p>

Off the top of my head, it might be possible to sort of make it look like your eyes are glowing, if you're skilled enough to make two flaring psi balls and put them in front of your
                       eyes (?). Never really thought about it, nor heard about it.</p>

                  <p>I wasn't sure where to send this so I thought this would be the best category. I'm new to psionics and I am still at the stage of making psi-balls. I am trying to work on relaxing and focusing more so I can make them stronger, but I have run into a bit of a snag. I have tried many techniques to
                  relax, such as deep breathing and audio that is supposed to put you in a relaxed, almost hypnotic state. When I start to feel relaxed, I feel a sharp increase in my heartrate, almost like a panic attack. I feel like there is a mechanism within me preventing me from reaching this relaxed state, but I
                  don't know why. I was wondering if you had encountered anything similar or had heard of anything like this before? I posted this question in the chat, but it's not easy to fit into 255 characters. I hope you can help or might know someone that can, as I am very eager to explore psionics, but it will
                  be a short trip if I cannot overcome this block.</p>

                  <p>Let's look at what's going on...</p>

                  <p>What is Randi trying to do? He is trying to say "look, I can fool you, this is not supernatural, therefore all psychics are fake". Or maybe "look how easily you can be fooled". Proving that he can fake it does not prove that it is impossible to do. Nor does it prove that everyone who has done it
                  is a magician.</p>

                  <p>Think of it like this... In movies, it looks like people do some crazy things. Hollywood magic. That doesn't mean people CAN'T do it, it just means it's possible to fake it. Brad Pitt got in some bloody fights in the movie Fight Club. That was fake. Does that mean no one can ever get in a fight?
                  Of course not.</p>

                  <p>If Randi is trying to prove that all psychics are fakes by faking something, that's pretty flawed logic.</p>

                  <p>This may sound stupid...if you guys really can do all this stuff that is described in the articles, why has noone attempted Randi's 1mil challenge (www.randi.org)? Sounds like easy money to me, just roll a pencil round the table a couple of times and it's yours ;]</p>

                  <p>I don't want to offend you or anything, I'm just curious and it sounds weird that despite there being so many people with 'paranormal' abilities, no one has got the prize yet O_o</p>

                  <p>Not really a stupid question... a pretty common one.</p>

                  <p>What most people don't realize is that, if someone does "prove Randi wrong", then Randi loses one million dollars, and looks like an idiot publically. Randi, believe it or not, does not want this to happen. He is NOT a scientist looking for factual data, he is looking to keep his money, and
                  reputation.</p>

                  <p>Some of us have thought about it though... some of us still do think about it. It's not exactly easy, though it might seem easy to you. Thinking about doing it and actually DOING it are two different things. Imagine you yourself could "easily" win the prize... what would you do? Think about it -
                  not just "I would get the money", what actual steps would you perform? What would you have to sacrafice? How much do you trust Randi to deliever the money and not lie?</p>

                  <p>On the surface it seems clean-cut, and Randi tries to play it off that way... but it really isn't. Oh, and Randi has cheated people in the past as well... not that publisized though <img src="blah.gif"

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I 'see' things in my dreams. I usually find out later that whatever was in my dream was 'real' and going to happen at some point down the road. I did not see a section on Psychic abilities, if that is what I'm 'having'.<br />
                  Can you help?</p>

                  <p>As the word is normally used, "Psychic" abilities include Precognition (which you might be experiencing), Telepathy, Clairvoyance, and Psychokinesis.</p>

                  <p>As for your dreams, keep a record of them, and then compare the details when it "happens". It'll give you a better idea of your accuracy, than if you just "remember" having dreamed it.</p>

                  <p>Yes, actually. Lots of people do. It's very popular. Try a site devoted to it. There are many. A quick web-search should locate several hundred.</p>
