                  <p>Hey, I've been working on Psionics for a couple of months now, and almost every time I'm dealing with energy, my watch either goes crazy, or freezes. I'm guessing I just don't have complete control over my energy yet, but i need to be sure. Does my watch freezing have anything to do with my
                  control over energy?</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Firstly I would just like to apologise if my question has already been answered, even though I read 10 pages of manipulation, AND searched (I?ve got way to much time on my hands). A few questions have been asked about the storage of psi in materials such as crystal and copper. I was basically
                  wondering if this meant they could be used as the psychic equivalent of a battery? this would be extremely useful in creating i.e. high energy constructs like force bubbles. I would like to do the obvious thing and try it myself, but I have absolutely no access to either crystals or copper. The
                  thought came to me while writing a story in which hundreds of psychics contribute daily to a huge psychic repository, allowing them to telekinetically shift large objects ( a portable source of psi sure would help ) without dying (almost) of exhaustion . Thank you for reading my ramblings, and
                  hopefully you?ll be able to answer my question.</p>

                  <p>Shields collapse, break, and otherwise fail even when not under attack. Being "constantly attacked by telepaths" without any idea as to why is decidedly unlikely (albeit possible).</p>

                  <p>I've been reading about psi balls and I've gotten very interested. I've learned that you can make any shape out of them, or something along those lines. And I was just wondering, is there any connection to those shiny blue dots you see floating in the air? Like, sometimes when I relax and just
                  look in midair, these blue little spots, kind of like lights appear. Is there any connection? Or is this just nothing at all?</p>

                  <p>It is possible to make constructs which are humanoid-shaped. It is also possible to make constructs that produce observable "physical" effects. If you yourself cannot produce the effect, however, I would be very surprised if your construct can.</p>

                  <p>1) That was a statement, not a question.<br />
                  2) Quite often, you don't. Perception of constructs is a different ability from making them.<br />
