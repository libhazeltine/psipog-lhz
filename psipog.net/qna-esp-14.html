                  <p>I am just starting out and i want to learn empathy. And i read ur warnings about making sure i can protect myself so i decided to learn shielding first before i even bother with the empathy stuff. My question is how would i test if the shield actually works or if i even made it correctly? I mean
                  at this point i haven't actually allowed myself to open up to other people yet so i wouldn't know if other feelings are getting into my shield, if i even made one.</p>

                  <p>Thanks</p>

                  <p>Good question. Usually, to correctly test a shield, you'll need someone else to verify it for you, with scanning. Sometimes that's hard to come across someone willing to do that. For me, I just stick my hand out, and I can "feel" my shield.</p>

                  <p>Start with simple constructs, and find ways to test to make sure you're doing those right. Then moving up to shields, it's less likely you're screwing it up, because you can already make smaller constructs correctly.</p>

                  <p>If you're only blocking out empathetic stuff, I bet you can make the shield fine. If you can feel it, it most likely is up correctly. Bubble shields aren't terriably complicated. When you decide to learn empathy, just move slow if you're nervous about the risks.</p>

                  <p>Every once in a while i notice things out of the corner of my eye. for instance i'll be walking to the kitchen when i'll think i see someone to my left (out of the corner of my eye) and i'll turn around and there will be nothing. I've noticed this alot. other times a certain room, store, or
                  restaraunt will just make me feel very uncomfortable, and i'll rush to leave it. I don't know if this has anything to do with physic abilities, but i'd really like to know. Please email me the response (sorry i don't know if you do this, i'm a newbie and trying very hard not to by annoying-i'm very

                  <p>Hello, I'd like to apologize for not being around often, but it's been due to a significant other. On that note, I have to transition to a problem, she is no longer my significant other, and I feel it wrong to have a link with her, it's a strong link, and it's from my subconscious mind. How would
                  I be able to break it? Moreover, would that be a wise course of action?</p>

I have just recentl started a small practice of telepathy, as in I usually only send messages to my pets, and play guess the fruit (that's an awesome game!). Lately, I've been getting headaches every time large groups of people walk by too
                  quickly. I try to put a sheild around my head before it worsens, but with little success. If someone could please give me advice, it would be greatly appreciated, Thanks!</p>
