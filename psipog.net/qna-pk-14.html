                  If so, how would this effect the psiwheel. I use the psiwheel but would it be easier to put my head right infront of it, or far away from it. Do you know what i mean. How close do you half to be?</p>

                  <p>It is a broad term encompassing any use of psychokinesis to affect a living organism, or any part thereof. Any physical healing accomplished psionically would fall under this category, as would the opposite effects. Trying to alter a cell structure or even DNA psionically, would be an attempt at
                  BioPK.</p>

                  <p>TK is moving something with your mind. Are you making it twitch with your mind? "Twitcing" is a type of movement. Be careful your eyes aren't playing tricks on you though - sometimes staring at something for a long time can make you see it "wobble", but really it isn't moving at all, it's just an
                  optical illusion from starring too long.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1) If the effect is readily observable, without needing statistical analysis, it is probably macroPK.<br />
                  2) Changing the trajectory of an object that is already moving is normally easier than getting an object to move. Therefore, it makes sense that it would be simpler to gain a certain amount of consistent skill with changing trajectories before bothering with moving objects that are still. I am not
                  sure that it makes enough difference to worry about it, however.</p>

                  <p>Hi there!</p>

                  <p>I've been practicing TK (on and off) for about a year now, but I've always had the same problem. I can quite easily get my psiwheel to move, but it nearly ALWAYS spins in the opposite direction that I want it to. I've tried lots of things to rememdy the problem, but I still can't get it to spin
                  the way I want it to. I don't think my brain can get around it. I would appreciate it if you could give me some guidance on trying to sort the problem.</p>

                  <p>~ Waldo</p>

                  <p>ps. Sorry if this has already been answered. I looked but couldn't find anything.</p>

                  <p>Alright, this one is easy. If it always goes in the opposite direction, use that to your advantage. When you want it to go clockwise, do whatever you had been doing to try to make it go counterclockwise. When you want it to go counterclockwise, do whatever you had been doing to try to make it go
                  clockwise. Too easy, eh?</p>
