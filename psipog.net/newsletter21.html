News1etter #21, for November 11th, 2005

"Even if you are on the right track, you'll still get run over if
you just sit there."

Dear PsiPog Users,

Hello! Sorry I missed the last newsletter, life is busy, yadda
yadda yadda :-P. Happy 11-11!

The two most common questions I keep getting over and over again
are: 1. New articles? 2. New seminars?

1. First, I am working on a new eBook, and it's coming along
pretty good, but it still needs more work. There are pending
articles, but they need more work as well. A lot goes into
writing an article, and I would rather not post anything than
post something that is sub-par.

2. Yes! But not for a little bit. Don't think I've forgotten
about PsiPog :-P. 99% of the work I am doing on PsiPog isn't
being seen because I am working on the forums and other scripts
that are the backbone of how PsiPog delivers the information to
everyone. Things are getting done, but you just don't see it.

One thing I just finished was a small FAQ on how the new forums
wi1l work, and what the plan is for them. You can read it at
http://psipogbb.net .

With that said, let's jump into the mail bag. We have a lot of
mail built up because I didn't send out a newsletter two weeks
ago.

"Hi, I just wanna ask what is happening to me, it is empathy? or
coincidence? Sometimes I know when my friends are sad or happy
and they dont tell me their state; I see them and I just know
their fee1ings. How I can practice and improve Empathy and how I
can manipulate their feelings? cause somethimes I know their
feelings and I cant do anything to change that. Thanks."

My comments: Yes, that sounds like empathy. One exercise I do
to practice empathy is to just read random people on the street.
Go to a mall and find a comfortable seat in the middle where
everyone walks around, and pick out people and read them as they
walk by. Look for their general emotion, but also try to pick up
on specific things. For example, someone might be happy, but why
are they happy? Is this happiness originating from seeing
something funny? Or maybe you can sense that they have recently
released a lot of tension and stress from a relaxing activity?
Perhaps they just saw a movie. Figure it out, and try to hone in
on specifics. The best way to change someone's emotion is to
talk to them and see what's up.

"Wow, I cannot thank you all enough for this experience. Today I
actually made the pinwheel and had suprisingly positive results.
It's been truly a powerful experience and I thank this community
for making this possib1e. It's a life changing experience; it
changes your outlook, perception and confidence. And for all you
fellow newbies out there, just keep on going, it definitely
comes! You get tired after a while and your ability starts to
diminish as a result but you can do it the next day and the next
and the next! It's a wonderful experience. Million thanks!!"

My comments: Awesome :-). Thanks for working hard :-). If you
learn something new from your experiences, please share it with
everyone else :-P.

"It makes you feel like being woken up all over again! I have
been listening to his internet radio shows. They are free
http://radioaaron.com/ He is the best remote viewer, psychic,
prophet, and much more. He does lottery for a living! start with
the 1st show on the top of the page. Lucifer (not satan or set)
is the alien spirit he speaks for."

My comments: I've heard of Aaron, and while some of his things
are impressive, some things worry me. A red flag goes off when
people claim to be talking to alien spirits... But hey, if you're
not afraid of being a little weirded out, then it might intruige
some readers out there. A1ways maintain healthy skepticism!

"I just joined, haven't yet received a newsletter, and haven't
read any of the previous newsletters. So, this idea that I'm
about to throw out there may already be used, but here it goes:
include a "Psionics in the Media" section, where you mention
books, movies (such as Suspect Zero), and video games (such as
Psi Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy) that have psionics as the
theme."

My comments: That's a cool idea. In fact, it's such a cool idea
that I've already started to implement it! Some of the backbone
stuff I've been working on inc1udes reorganizing the Articles and
adding more categories - one of which is "Psionics in Society".
For the curious, here is a link to what I've got so far:
http://psipog.net/bn/articles.php (it's a little buggy still).

"I've read some of the articles, and when I practice TK on a
paperclip, it doesn't work. I relax, stare at it, and concentrate
on it, but nothing happens. Also, I levitated myself once (with
my eyes closed) so I think I unintentionally used telekinesis on
myself! That's a bit easier than trying this on objects. Any
tips?"

My comments: First, I am skeptical that you actually levitated
yourself. Perhaps your senses were fooling you? If you can do
it again, try to get it on camera to confirm it. Don't take just
one experience and leave it at that - work to do it again! Also,
we get a lot of emails of people wanting tips. To be honest, all
the tips I have are in the articles posted on PsiPog. I've
written everything I know in those. But, just so I don't leave
you empty handed, there is an awesome article on PK by Float on
a different website, http://upconline.net - check it out, it has
a cool exercise to try.

"I've been studying psi and have always kept it a secret because
I freaked a few friends out when I moved a pencil on my desk. I
was talking to some girl who said her dad was in India in the
navy and he saw some lady. She did the same thing but it she said
it was called something else! Are these two abilities related?"

My comments: Well, if you are both moving pencils, then it sounds
like it's related (i.e., it's the SAME THING :-P). However, you
also have to be wondering what exactly happened in India?
Perhaps it was a clever magician, or maybe it was legit. Maybe
you can get more information from your friend to figure it out.

Cedric writes:
"I know most of you guys advocate a healthy skepticism with
regards to psi and the phenomena associated with it. Therefore I
thought you might find interesting the work of a "magician"
called Derren Brown (probably fami1iar to some of you). He is
specialised in mind-reading/manipulation tricks with results
very similar to psi but without the use of psi. Although he does
not reject the idea of psi phenomena he simply states that there
are many scammers on the lose (something we are all aware of). If
you look around on the interenet you should be able to find links
to (legal) video clips of a show he ran on TV a while ago. The
guy is simply amazing. Personally, his displays have helped me
keep my feet grounded without throwing away my beliefs.
Hope this'll help.

Take care and thanks for all the great material on PsiPog"

My comments: Thank you for giving me his name! I saw a video on
the internet of him doing an "invisible punch", but I didn't know
who it was. I immediately ordered his DVDs, and watched all the
material on them. It is mind blowing for sure, and it does help
us stay grounded with healthy skepticism. I personally have a
lot of theories of what is going on (like I'm sure everyone does
who watches his stuff), and I hope to figure some of it out.
Thanks again for the tip!

"I'm having trouble even getting a sign of moving the psi wheel.
Whenever I do it I just can't even when I'm trying my hardest, so
is it REALLY possible to actually move a psi wheel? Not to put
down practicing telekinesis, but I've read an article that shows
if you position your hands right (in the same spot other people
put their hands in movies) the psi wheel will spin because of the
heat rising. This is really putting me down because now I really
don't know if its rea1 or not?"

My comments: Heat rising is a problem you have to deal with. I
suspect some people out there think they are moving the psi wheel
when it is really just heat from the hands. BUT, there is a
large number of people who have tested against the heat theory.
For example, some people (including myself) have moved the psi
wheel without having our hands close to the psi wheel at all. I
have done it from across the room. Others make sure they are
truly moving it by focusing on different directions for the wheel
to move. Heat can spin the whee1, but if it was ONLY heat, then
you couldn't control what direction the wheel spins. The
majority of people who have spinned the wheel have done tests
like these to see if it was heat or not.

"I've found that working with meditation and "grounding and
centering" helps as a warm up, or when you are just starting out
trying anthing such as OBE. You seem to collect your energy more,
and it becomes more focused."

My comments: Cool! Thanks for sharing :-). For those working
on OBEs, try that out.

=================================================================

mortal writes:
"I've had the same experience as Nesvae from newsletter #20 (he
talked about forgetting to breathe during an OBE). A few times
I've been OBE'ing for up to 5 minutes forgetting completely about
my body during that time. When a thought comes in about my body,
something is brought to my attention: I was not breathing for the
entire time since the OBE started! It was weird because you think
you'd feel pain or something when going without breath for that
long, but I didn't feel anything."

My comments: That really surprises me. If you don't breathe for
5 minutes, then you will be gasping for air... Either your body
doesn't need the oxygen (highly unlikely), or you don't realize
that your body is really breathing (more likely). I personally
think that you don't realize your body is breathing fine while
you are out of body. If you can, try video taping yourself while
having an OBE (although I know how hard this can be because of
the randomness of OBEs). Perhaps one day we will figure it out.

"I've been a member of PsiPog for about 8 months and have had
success in the fields of psiballs and psychokinesis. One day I
was looking through the articles and found "The Ebb and Flow Of
Psionics" by Brandon. Now I was perplexed by this article.

This, for those of you who don't know, is an article on what
causes psionic off-days. Most of the possible causes can be
summed up with lack of concentration due to focusing on other
things. Throughout my studies, never have my abilities been
affected by sickness, depression, anxiety, diet, hunger, or
alcohol, nor have they been affected by me mood.

I know there are exceptions to every rule, but these just seem
like excuses to me. In my opinion, if you're having an off-day,
you're not putting enough effort into it."

My comments: Heh :-). Different people have different points of
view... Brandon's opinion is pretty popular, but others share
your opinion as well.

Blueish writes:
"What is your opinion on deja vous, or precognitive ability? Is
it possible to see future events or does free will mean that by
knowing the future you have already changed it? Is there free
will or is the future already defined in stone?"

My comments: Well, although I have few experiences with precog,
it seems obvious when looking at the evidence that precog'ing
something is possible. How does the past, present, and future
all tie together to produce reality? I have no idea. How does
deja vous work? Again, no idea :-P. I do NOT agree with the
scientific/psychological explainations for deja vous (like the
brain misfiling an experience under long term memory, instead of
short term memory). If I had to guess, I would say the
phenomenon of deja vous is probably a lot of different things
clumped together under one umbrella. Some people might
experience it from a forgotten dream they had about the future,
while others might experience it because they saw something
similar a long time ago. Good question to ponder :-P.

"Hello, my name is Cody. I have been studying psi and other
things such as this for about 1 1/2 years. I have just recently
learned how to flare my psi ball. Now my question is: when I lay
down at night before bed, I try to relax myself with meditation,
when I stop, I start to tingle and become kinda paralyzed, I
can't make myself move. When I can move again, I try to make a
psi ball and it make the air look wavy and stuff like the air
over the top of a fire. Is that normal?"

My comments: Is any of this normal!? Heh :-P. I assume you
mean: does this sort of thing happen to other people? The answer
is yes. You describe two different experiences that are pretty
common: 1. sleep paralysis, and 2. distortion of light from a
flared psi ball. Most people don't link the two together like
you have, but it does happen. So feel better that you aren't
alone :-P. Now figure out WHY it happens and let us know! :-P
