                  <p>If you check out the articles we have that cover linking you'll probably get the concept of it, but maybe the actual feeling isn't covered as well as the how-to is.</p>

                  <p>I haven't done any survey or anything, so I'm just going through my own experience. When I'm linked with someone, I don't feel like I am sitting alone in my apartment. It feels like a pressence is with me, like someone is in the room, but not fully as it would be if an actual person was standing
                  there. It's a vague, dreamy sensation of someone elses feel (their sig) being in the back of your head and you're just aware that they are there. Thinking at them while linked usually works for sending. Sometimes I think about a concept or an image, like a flower and I make it feel like me and the
                  person I'm linked to are watching the Target (the flower) together. Kinda like how you behave/feel when you're sitting in a couch watching a movie with a friend, as opposed to watching that movie alone. You kind of "expect" the linked person to watch what you are watching and by doing this, you let
                  them take part of what you are thinking. If that sounds too complicated you can just see the link as a signal-strenghtener and vividly visualize yourself and the other person sitting at a table, face to face. Imagine yourself placing an object on the table, as if to present it to the other person,
                  and imagine him or her studying it intensively. The key-word here is, again, expect. Present the object while expecting them to react and observe it. I believe this "phenomenon" can be seen here and there in your everyday life, when someone expects a person to react a certain way, that person is more
                  likely to do so. If you're playing hide and seek and sit there rocking back and forth, obssesively thinking "he's going to find me, I know he's going to find me" and you truly feel/believe that, you're basically Sending out "hey, I'm over here! Look at me!".</p>

                  <p>I hope that helped.</p>

                  <p>Yes. Relaying of this nature can be done, with or without person-b's consent. Probably the easiest way is to "bounce" the signal off the person's field, using a small construct (an acquaintance of mine is notorious for this, just to make a nuisance of himself).</p>

                  <p>This question may be interpreted in two ways.</p>

                  <p>The first is a matter of mechanics of telepathy. Unfortunately, the answer to "how does telepathy work" has not yet been established. There have been many hypotheses put forward, of course. None has enough evidence to become a theory yet, although several hypotheses have been ruled out, thus
                  narrowing the field slightly.</p>

                  <p>The second interpretation is "how do you do it", rather than "how does it work". If you work verbally, this can be as simple as a hard Ping at close range.</p>
