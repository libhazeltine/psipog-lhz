PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #3, for October 12th, 2004

"Those who seek the easy way do not seek the true way."
- Dogen


Dear PsiPog Users,

Howdy howdy :-). Here we are with another installment of our
super happy fun fantastic newsletter. Welcome all people new to
the newsletter - if you want to read previous ones, go here:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/psipog_newsletter/messages

Not as much feedback as last time - don't be afraid to send in
your questions/comments/ideas/complaints - whatever! Send your
thoughts to newsletter@psipog.net. GFW is back with a helpful
comment to add with what I said about affirmations in the last
newsletter:

=================================================================

"In phrasing your affirmations, don't say 'I will lose weight.'
Since the subconscious mind takes things literally with support
of the conscious mind, it only stands to reason that using the
word 'lose' implies 'something which must be found'! Unless you
want to have your mixed goal of losing weight (only to be found
again), a better idea is to say, 'I will a reduction in weight!'
or 'I am slimming and toning my body.'

The subconscious mind is often like a small child. You must
tell it exactly what you are manifesting currently."

My comments: Wording your affirmations are very tricky. This is
where "be careful what you wish for" comes into play :-P. As
GFW has pointed, your subconscious can interpret things the wrong
way if you're not careful. Think out your affirmations very
carefully, and make them clear so it's hard to interpret them any
other way.

=================================================================

Jolly Good also commented on the affirmation exercise from the
last newsletter. He took it in a different direction, and listed
ways to subliminally affect the subconscious mind in a positive
way. I'm personally a little cautious about subliminal messages.
It is interesting though, so if you're interested in affirmations
you might enjoy reading about subliminal messages. Google and
your library are good places to start :-). One last reminder
before we move on to the next topic: You have to be careful about
this stuff. Subconscious (re)programming can cause trouble if
you go willy nilly and don't think about what you're doing. Take
the time BEFORE you start, instead of taking ten times as long to
fix a mistake you made because you were impatient.

=================================================================

Next topic: Lucid Dreaming! (Thanks BlueTsunami for the idea).

Ok, first, what is lucid dreaming? Lucid dreaming is when you're
dreaming, and you realize you are dreaming... while inside of the
dream. So, you're running around, shooting zombies and saving
some hot chick, and bam it hits you: what the hell am I doing?
This doesn't make sense. This is a dream!

Lucid dreams are great. For some odd reason they're considered
a sleep disorder, but I disagree. If you have lucid dreams 100%
of the time, I think that's a disorder. But most people have
trouble getting ONE lucid dream, let alone 100%. I find that a
lucid dream every once in a while is relaxing - you can use them
to release stress. Think about it - one third of your life is
spent asleep - don't you think it's worth an investigation?

Before you have a lucid dream, you must remember your dreams.
You don't have to remember all of them, but what good is a lucid
dream if you won't remember it? Get in the habit of remembering
your dreams after you wake up, and try to pick up as many details
as you can. Personally, I shower right when I wake up. While
showering, I go over as much as I can remember about my dream. I
do this every day.

Once you can remember most of your dreams, then you can start to
try to induce a lucid dream. The most common, and easiest
technique, is to keep asking yourself "Am I dreaming?". All day
long, just keep asking yourself. If you make this a normal habit
eventually it will happen while you're in a dream, and you'll
become lucid :-).

Another technique which works for me is to notice themes in your
dreams, and try to remember when one of those themes occur, that
you are dreaming. For example, in a lot of my dreams I am under
water, but I breathe normally. After I noticed that pattern, I
remembered that any time I find myself breathing under water,
that I am dreaming. Another theme in my dreams is flying - if
I realize I'm flying, then I instantly realize that it isn't
normal, and that I'm dreaming.

Lucid dreams are great; one website I visit about lucid dreams
is www.dreamviews.com .

=================================================================

Alrighty! Another bi-month, another newsletter :-P. There's a
rumor going around that SunTzu is writing another article, and
both annie and myself are writing as well. I'm also thinking
about doing a seminar/lecture sometime soon. And of course, I
have to get back into training :-). I'm thinking the next
lecture will be more interactive, and more like a huge ass
practice. Just tossing ideas around though. Keep an eye on the
calendar ( http://www.psipog.net/calendar.php ).

Thanks for reading! See you in two weeks :-).

(A side note: these newsletters go out every other tuesday, so
they are bi-MONTHLY... I think in previous newsletters I called
them bi-WEEKLY... whoops. See you in two weeks :-P).
