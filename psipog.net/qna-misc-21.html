                  <p>How long have people known about psi? It seems people have known about witchcraft for a while (not saying I believe in that or anything), but it seems kind of odd that I'm finding about it now, it seems like people would have already known about it.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>The term "psionics" was coined in the middle of the twentieth century, with "psi" denoting the mechanism or mechanisms that allow such phenomena as telepathy and psychokinesis to occur. The phenomena themselves had been under investigation for much longer. Serious scientific investigation,
                  state-funded in the Soviet Union and privately-run in United States, can be seen in the first half of the twentieth century. Less stringent studies pre-date those by a hundred years. This stuff isn't new. Interest in it isn't new. Popularity of the interest in it goes in cycles, it seems.</p>

                  <p>Short version: "people" _did_ already know about it. That is not affected by the fact that you personally encountered the concept only recently.</p>

                  <p>Blinking is good. It helps maintain the proper moisture in your eyes. Generally, random thoughts will show up. Complete emptiness is rare, especially without a lot of practice in meditation or related activities.</p>

                  <p>After you get to know your subconsious mind, can you just tell it to do something and it will? Just wandering anyway.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Depends on what you tell it to do, and how obedient your subc is <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"

                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />.</p>

                  <p>For example, I can't exactly tell my subc to grow a new head. That's just impossible.</p>

                  <p>And I can't tell my subc to take over my body and do all my homework. "He" refuses <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       border="0"
                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />.</p>

                  <p>Your subc is just another part of you... it is powerful in a sense that it takes care of a lot of nitty gritty details about your body and how it interacts in the real world. But I can't be like "hey Mr. Subc, learn to play piano". I don't have that skill. I have to learn it, (i.e., teach my
                  subc), then we have some data to work with. In the same regard, I can't tell my subc to "learn telekinesis", because it has no clue what I want.</p>

                  <p>I can, however, say:</p>

                  <p>Me: alright, you know how a telepathic link works, right?<br />
                  Subc: yeah<br />
                  Me: ok, create a link with my friend, and create a link from them to my other friend. Then make it when I send the information to my first friend, to bounce off of him, and go directly to my second friend.<br />
                  Subc: ok, it'll probably take me 10 minutes<br />
                  Me: ok, that's cool, let me know when you finish</p>

                  <p>Basically: I know how to make a telepathic link, so I could tell my subc how to use this tool that I've already learned in a more straight-forward mannor. If I didn't know how to make a telepathic link, my subc would reply "what the hell is a telepathic link?".</p>

                  <p>(This is turning into a long answer). Let me see if I can condense my meaning into one sentence <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       border="0"
                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />: You can tell your subc how to use and arrange current skills, but you can't tell your subc to do something that it doesn't know how to do.</p>
