         <h1 class="pageTitle">Archive</h1>

         <p>In August of 2006, I decided to stop actively working on PsiPog.net, and to archive it. PsiPog.net had been very active and had a lot of smaller projects being worked on. All these projects were stopped in their current condition, and archived in whatever form they were in. The following links are the
         projects that PsiPog.net was actively involved in before the decision to archive. Please be aware that some of the projects were archived in an unfinished state. Nonetheless, I think the information is useful, and interesting.</p>

               <p>Back in August of 2004 I published an eBook on the most popular skills. The idea is to show how it all fits together, as opposed to getting stuck in the details. In August of 2006, I also published my unfinished sequel.</p>

               <p>I used my blog to post my psychic experiences, my ideas on psychic abilities in general, and progress updates for PsiPog.net.  It's more informal, but you can probably find some useful information in there.</p>

               <p>Our newsletter was hosted by Yahoo! Groups and went out every two weeks. It was active from September 2004 until July 2006, and served as a means to answer questions in depth, share ideas on psionics, and update members on PsiPog.net.</p>

               <p>The PsiPog.net Forums were active and disabled through-out the years. Eventually we figured out the correct formula for maintaining healthy forums, and the archive represents the most popular psionic forums in the year 2006.</p>

               <p>The News was a way to inform visitors on the home page on what was new on PsiPog.net. Usually it contained announcements on new features and articles. The News spanned from July of 2003 to August of 2006.</p>

               <p>The polls ran on the PsiPog.net home page, and were interesting to see how the PsiPog.net community felt on different topics. They aren't scientific polls, just friendly and informal questions to see how people would respond.</p>

               <p>Our fourth online PK Party. Unfortunately, because of scheduling issues, I couldn't participate. Nonetheless, Roy and Kingcob stepped in to help. Because of the poor planning on my part, it wasn't as popular as previous Parties. Still some cool results though!</p>

               <p>This was our third online PK Party. We had about 75 people at it's height, and we all tried to bend silverware together. These events are always a lot of fun, and we always have lots of pictures of cool results from the chatters.</p>

               <p>We had the idea to get a bunch of people together and flare a construct in front of a webcam for everyone to see. We had about 100 people participate, and we had interesting results that are still debated about.</p>
