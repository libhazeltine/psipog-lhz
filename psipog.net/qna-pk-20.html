                  <p>Sorry, one more question:<br />
                  What type of power is telekinesis referred as? What I mean is that is telekinesis an ESP power, psychic ability, parapsychology power, psychic intuition, or is it known as a different ability/power? This question is referring to the first question I made in the last one. I've heard about ESP and
                  telekinesis being related in some way, but I wasn't so sure if telekinesis was a power/ability of ESP. PLEASE answer this question... Thanks!</p>

                  <p>Psionic. Psychokinesis, also known as telekinesis, is a psionic ability. "ESP" stands for "extra-sensory perception". It is, by definition, _perceptive_. Psychokinesis is _affective_. Not the same thing at all.</p>

                  <p>okay, if you won't answer my question on what book there is about how to do a detailed step by step process, then at least answer these questions:<br />
                  1. would developing your ESP help you peform telekinesis?<br />
                  2. are there any items that can either help or awaken my psychic powers, such as telekinesis, telepathy, etc.? and if so, what are they?<br />
                  3. is there any site that explains how to peform time travel, like traveling to the future or the past? and if so, which site? -And-<br />
                  4. what site explains how to do biokinesis to make me change, like having green eyes, jumping higher, etc.?</p>

                  <p>Did it occur to you that perhaps there is no such book, or, if there is, that none of us have seen it?</p>

                  <p>1) Maybe, but not necessarily. It helps concentration and focus, but so does practicing harmonic minor scales on the viola.</p>

                  <p>2) To "awaken" an ability, you'd have to _have_ it first.</p>

                  <p>3) I've seen a couple such, but they were all "questionable" (ie, creative fiction of the cattel-dung variety)</p>

                  <p>4) More cattle-dung sites, and a few openly fictional ones. "Biokinesis" is a political theory, not a psionic ability.</p>

                  <p>If the psiwheel is coming along well, use whatever method you are using for the psiwheel to push the pen. Start with something lighter than a pen, however: a straw, a piece of paper, a matchstick, etc.</p>

                  <p>Ok, now i have been wanting to know this for some time now and i wont relax until i get the answers, it's been on my chest since Day one and that is about 10 months...<br />
                  <br />
                  1. When performing TK, how should the eyes be?, should they be focused, should they be unfocused, squinted, looking at the object, looking beside it, looking through it, looking before it, move my eyes where i want the object to go, try moving the object with my eyes, HOW should the eyes be and where
                  should i look?<br />
                  <br />
                  - I have this kinda bizzare ability i discovered, but everyone prolly possesess it, if you stare at an object and focus through it, and let the eyes go with their own flow i can make what i am looking at dissapear to my vision, should i use this?<br />
                  <br />
                  - I also see like tiny white dots flying all over the place and every one in a while i will see like what looks like a streak of lightning, and also an occasional blue sparkle dot thing, is this "energy"<br />
                  <br />
                  - I also see like a glow around objects if i try to, the glow is orangish, no matter what the object is, once again is this "energy".<br />
                  <br />
                  - Since i was a kid i have always seen this kinda transparent line with dots in it, kinda like the shape of an S but not fully and not as compact, it shows up every once in a while then when i try lookign at it, it floats a way, there was only a few times i recal being able to look at it, but it was
                  peripheal vision cuz i can't focus directly at it or it will move.<br />
                  <br />
                  2. What shoudl i visualize, should i visualize energy pushing on it, should i visualize it moving a tiny bit at a time, should i visualize how i want it to look, WHAT should i visualize?<br />
                  <br />
                  3. What to focus on, not thinking?, the feeling of my purge, the feeling of the preasure in my head, my pineal gland (third eye), the feeling of tingling sensation around my body, the object?<br />
                  <br />
                  4. How should i BE? back errect, let gravity take over my body, relaxed, tense up, make a muscle and flex it, pinch my nerves so my hand shakes, make my body do like a small convulsion?<br />
                  <br />
                  5. I seen that you should make like an nnnn soudn in your head, but how affective is this really, i mean the nnnn is a thought and you can't think AT ALL while doing TK, so how would this help.<br />
                  <br />
                  please answer if you know how to do TK, i need REAL answers...these questions have been on my mind for so long it is impeding my proccess.<br />
                  <br />
                  and also if you can please give me a step by step how to on how you personaly go about doing TK, what you visualize how your eyes are set, what you feel stuff like that.</p>

                  <p>1)<br />
                  a: It doesn't matter. You don't even need to be able to see the object.<br />
                  b: This is a function of how the eye works. For this purpose it is irrelevent.<br />
                  c: The white dots are not "energy" contrary to claims by some writers. It is, again, a function of how the eye works.<br />
                  d: Optical illusion by way of eyestrain. Not "energy".<br />
                  e: Those are called "floaters", little bits of stuff suspended in the eye itself.</p>

                  <p>2) Visualisation serves to inform the subconscious what the conscious mind wants to do. Picture the desired _end result_.</p>

                  <p>3) Focus on moving or affecting the object for PK, or focus on the end result. Push psi-stuff at the object at the same time. For newbies, that alone might require most of your focus.</p>

                  <p>4) Some people find it helpful to be slightly tense. Others prefer to be completely relaxed, physically. Both work for me. Convulsions tend not to be helpful.</p>

                  <p>5) I was under the impression that the fellow who first wrote that, did so as a joke. It was much-copied by others, in the way that an assortment of dishonest folk steal work that does not belong to them. In any case, you _can_ think while doing PK... or at any rate, some of us can.</p>

                  <p>Step by step instruction of how I do PK? Sure. I think at it, and it moves. End of story.</p>

                  <p>Ok. I THINK i have made a psiball. I feel a heat/tingle feeling whenever I pass it from hand to hand. I THINK I made a psiball(probably weak). But whenever I pass it to an object(such as a glass)because I want to knock it over. But it just doesnt happen. If I aim my psiball at the glass how come I
                  dont see an effect? The glass is pretty close also. Of course this is my first day doing it and I have gave it about 15 tries. Please help<br />

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Yesterday I began my TK training once again and it wasn't very long before I could do it almost as much as I could before. But today is something interesting. I have a much stronger force to move objects. For example instead of just moving paper on a pin, I can move it on a table or whatever. I
                  would naturally think that this is because during my "break time" I got more keen with my ability? (like working out and waiting a few days for the muscle to develop).</p>

                  <p>But my main question is how come now I feel wind when I do this? I asked my friend who has been studying this kind of stuff pretty much all his life and he said it was my Chi and not PSI. Then I asked my Sensei and she said it was Chi and not PSI. So what exactly is this wind that I am creating?
                  It seems to work really well to move objects, and to use TK.. If it is TK at all. What in the world is going on?</p>

                  <p>The "break time" thing has been noticed before, in several mental activities, psionic and otherwise. It might simply be that your subconscious had some time to sort out the "files".</p>

                  <p>If it can be used to move something in that manner, it is "psi". Therefore, if "chi" can be used to produce that effect, "chi" is also "psi".</p>

                  <p>The kind of pk they are doing in those cases is uncontrolled "poltergeist" effects. Distraction isn't the problem; out-of-control emotions are.</p>

                  <p>Can TK be performed without your hands being near the object?</p>

                  <p>I was doing TK (or so i thought) on a tin foil psi wheel and showed my mother. She was surprised at first, but then she placed her hands where mine were and the wheel just started moving. She said she didn't try to move it or anything like that. She thinks that if you place your hands close enough
                  to the wheel that the natural magnetic force of your hands will start to push the wheel. We tried it on a paper wheel too and the same thing happened.</p>

                  <p>Now i'm not sure i had ever moved the wheel with only TK, mabye a combo of TK and Magnetic force, or just magnetic force. Also, all of the videos in the media section show the performers hands very close to the object being moved, so i was wondering if TK can be performed without your hands being
                  anywhere near the object.</p>

                  <p>TK can be performed without your hands being in the same country as the object....and I don't just mean in bordertowns.</p>

                  <p>If your hands _are_ too close, the heat alone from them can make a psiwheel move, with or without TK or magnetism.</p>
