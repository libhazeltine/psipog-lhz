               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I noticed there is a no DBZ name restriction, and I was wondering if there was a restriction on other copyright protected shows/serieses/movies, like people using LOTR names, which will probably crop up around Xmas time, or names based on whatever is currently popular at the time. Not trying to
                  sound like a smart aleck, I'm just curious because I was thinking of using something Middle-Earthy but chose this name instead. I'm not sure why the DBZ name restriction, whether it's to keep track of who's who since there could be 50 Goku names, or if it's to screen out a kind of member, which might
                  seem silly, but I was also wondering if someone could use pseudo-DBZ names or names that just sound like they belong in DBZ but aren't really, like Gojiro (knew a guy on one job who got that on his nametag, everyone called him that, but his real name was Chris). Anyway, thanks for your time, love the
                  site.</p>

                  <p>Actually, I'm not as anal as I used to be about the usernames. Back in the day there used to be a large community of DBZers who went around thinking they were Goku and whoever else, and thought that the show was real, and that you could fly around and blow up buildings if you NEVER GAVE UP!!!
                  Etc... Basically, a bunch of kiddies running around with over-active imaginations. With a lot of effort of KMiller and his snide-snipering, he converted a lot of idiots into normal-thinking human beings (and pissed a lot of other people off). So, that rule is a reflection of the "No DBZer
                  idiots"-concept. Now, it's not so easy to find a DBZer, because of the strict rules and moron-bashing that we used to do. So the rule seems a bit odd. Back in the day it was useful though, now it's not so useful. So to answer your question: yeah, go ahead and make up any nickname you want. Just don't
                  make it DBZ <img src="wink.gif"

                  <p>But, let's clear one thing up, I wasn't born with any psychic abilities. I started my training in February of 1999 with zero experience. Just like most people here. My life isn't great either, we all have shitty things we have to deal with, but focus on the positive things. Ask yourself: what do
                  you want to learn in psionics? Then put 110% effort into accomplishing your goal. My skills came from practice - you can practice and be just as good, and even better than me. Stick with it <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Yes. I have two or three from annie that are just sitting in my inbox. I am currently working on four (one of them being a cool psi ball one, you'll have to wait and see <img src="blah.gif"

Jaspers has an update on one of his, and a new article on top of that. I also have a pile of new articles being submitted by new authors.</p>

                  <p>I have no dates planned for uploading more articles, but if annie bugs me enough, I'll be uploading hers soon <img src="blah.gif"
