PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #9, for January 4th, 2005

"Imagination is the one weapon in the war against reality."
- Jules de Gaultier


Dear PsiPog Users,

Hi everyone! I hope everybody had a great Christmas and a happy
New Years :-). Hmmm... what's the plan for PsiPog.net in 2005?
I have a lot of new ideas lined up, and I have a vision for where
I'd like to see PsiPog.net in a year from now... the problem is
that it will require some work :-P.

One major change I want to do is start more projects like the
Telepathy Groups thing. We had about 300 applications, and I
feel bad that only a small group of people could participate.
Hopefully the other teachers and myself will learn a lot from
this first experiment, and we can get a system going for doing
more projects, and even allow others to start projects
eventually.

If you have specific questions or suggestions about how I plan
on changing PsiPog.net during 2005, or would like to comment on
anything relating to psi, e-mail: newsletter@psipog.net

I love hearing from other people, and sharing their ideas with
everyone in the newsletter :-).

=================================================================

fedaykin30 asks:
"I've heard you and others involved with psi talking about doing
things like grounding to get rid of extra energy or anxiety. I
can see why that would be helpful to many people but what about
people with a LACK of energy. I am curently doing highschool
sports and trying to maintain grades and a new truck. I am
always tired and have found myself taking a break from psi
because I am always too tired to practice. I have also found
myself more susceptible to things like colds recently. Would
you or any of the staff/readers know of a posible aid to this
annoyance?"

My comments: I'm trying to think if I've ever used psi to make
myself less tired... I usually stick to things like naps and
snacks to give myself energy. Eat healthy, continue exercising,
etc. I have felt adrenaline rushes from using psi, but it
isn't really a useable energy in the same sense that normal food
is.

Practicing psi requires work from the body and mind. I think
we're confused about the definition of "energy". Food and sleep
gives your body energy, but food and sleep doesn't give your body
psi. Your body uses food-and-sleep-energy to do things like
exercise, but I don't think it uses psi-energy to do things like
exercise. (It might though, no one really knows the breakdown
of it yet :-P).

But hey, let's not convince ourselves not to try anything. We
have a good question, and we're not sure of the answer. So let's
try some things out and see what happens :-). Try absorbing psi
and visualize your body sucking it up and working more
efficiently. Visualize your body going from a dark grey color to
a vibrant white color. "Feel" your muscles working better and
stronger. "Feel" your lungs and blood working together to give
you more strength in every breath. Pump yourself up :-). See if
it works, and if it doesn't - come up with another idea and try
something else.

"I try using telepathy with my sister by playing rock paper
scissors. I ask her whether she wants me to win draw or lose,
and I visualise the three pictures in my head and I get a feeling
of which one it is. If she wanted me to win and i had that
"feeling" that it was rock then I would choose paper, thus I
would win."

My comments: Good idea :-). It's fun to take a normal game, and
add a psi twist to it. You can also use psi in other games.
I've used psi to help me in lots of games - empathy and telepathy
in poker make it a lot easier to feel how good someone's cards
are. In basketball, I can feel what direction they're going to
move in and steal the ball a lot easier. It brings up some
interesting ethical questions too - do you consider using psi in
games as cheating? If you do, why?

Reaver_of_souls writes:
"I'm just wondering if anyone else has ever noticed that if you
make a construct program to keep together and draw energy from a
predetermined source, after a while it'll start to fade away.
Think that there is a way to stop it? I had a bunch of self
sustaining constructs that were really cool and I dont wanna have
to keep re-making them."

My comments: Self sustaining constructs are tough - especially
when they aren't around you constantly so you can monitor them.
Try starting simple - make a shield around yourself and see if it
will stay up. Shields are the most common long-term constructs.
After you can get a shield to stay up for a few days around
yourself, try putting a shield in a location that you go by a
lot, but isn't directly around you. For example, stick a shield
in your doorway to your bedroom. See if you can make the shield
sustain itself for a few days and monitor it.

The idea is simple, but it does take skill to do. And skill
comes from practicing and figuring out what you need to do to
make it work.

Amy asks:
"Are those of us who have these gifts of Psi (mine are Empathy
and Psychic Abilities that are premonition form) more likely to
change jobs more frequently or "search out" for that one perfect
job? Do we rely on our gut feeling too much that keeps us from
staying with one field? I am curious as I have found myself in
just about every field imaginable to cure this insatiable hunger
for knowledge."

My comments: That's a cool question - I haven't done any accurate
polling of something like that, but I have read about certain
types of psychic "personallities". Does it surprise you that
people who can predict the future get bored with life? ;-). I
suggest you pick up a copy of "You Are Psychic!", by
Pete A. Sanders. ( surf to here: http://tinyurl.com/6wmqr ). In
it, Sanders talks about different personallities of psychics,
including one that heavly relies on intuition (which is what you
seem to be describing). It's pretty cheap, and a good read.

=================================================================

Ancheron has a cool idea for an exercise:
"Take a few cards from a deck, preferably of one color or suit if
you're just starting out. Now take one card that doesn't have
anything in common with those other cards, and shuffle it in with
the others. Know what you are looking for and make sure your
subconcious knows as well. Sometimes it works well if you sense
what the card feels like and hold that in your mind. Go through
each card and determine whether that card is the one you are
looking for. Try to "feel" that first sense of the card through
them, and see whether it feels right or not."

My comments: Cool exercise :-). I specifically like the idea of
first feeling what your target card "feels" like before
beginning, then after shuffling, searching for that same "feel".

Elrayu writes:
"Okay, here is an excercise that my friend Diana and I have been
doing. I think we're making a psi ball, but I'm not sure. If it
is, it's a useful excercise. Diana first showed me, what she did
was she put her hands together as if holding an invisible ball.
She imagined something there, and when I put my hand between hers
the air was colder than the air around us. When I tried it
myself, I believe she told me the air was warmer. I still have
yet to know if this is making a psi ball, but all I did was
imagine the energy there. No swirling up my chest and down my
arms, I just imagined it there."

My comments: Good job :-D. It sounds like you created a psi
ball. It's important to realize that you don't HAVE TO make a
psi ball any certain way. It's not written in stone, and it's ok
to play with the idea and try different things to see the result.

=================================================================

Alllllrighty :-). Thanks to everyone for writing in for the
newsletter and sharing their ideas and questions. If anyone
else out there has a cool exercise or question, don't be afraid
to send it in. E-mail it to: newsletter@psipog.net

Thanks again, and I'll see everyone in two weeks :-).
