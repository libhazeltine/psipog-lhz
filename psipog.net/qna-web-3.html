                  <p>Hi, I'm new to the group here. I'm 41 yrs. male. I had experiences with a mind-reader in the military back in 1982.<br />
                  I asked a question about my experience at thepsionguild about 3 weeks ago, but never got answered, and then noticed the site went offline.</p>

                  <p>Do you know what has happened to thepsionguild.net?</p>

                  <p>I notice it has been 404 for over 2 weeks now.</p>

                  <p>This is going to be more of a suggestion than a question. I just recently read Peebrain's new article, "Out of Body Experiences" which I thought was great, and I wanted to leave feeback on it but alas, there is not any sort of commenting system for the articles. I think that would be a nice
                  feature to add to PsiPog. That way people who have questions specially about a certain article can ask it there and one of the more experienced members could answer it. Just a feature I thought would come in handy for asking specific questions about the articles. Thanks for reading,</p>

                  <p>Howdy,<br />
                  I have been on google for about an hour, and i have yet to come up with anything on "minneapolis tellikinetics", "psychic internet communities", "find telepaths near you", "tellikinesis groups", etc. (the list goes on). I was wondering if anyone knew a way for a begginer to find a group, experienced
                  teacher, or gathering near their own area. I know many people would find this useful to prove to themselves that it is real, and what they are capable of.<br />
                  Much gratitude</p>

                  <p>Well... you should first make sure you're spelling it correctly. "Telekinesis".</p>

                  <p>But I doubt you'll find groups on TK. If you're willing to sit through some fluff, you'll have better luck with Pagan and Wiccan stuff. New Age, Psychic, and Paranormal are also keywords to search for. Yeah it sucks you'll have some crazies in the group with you, but oh well.</p>
