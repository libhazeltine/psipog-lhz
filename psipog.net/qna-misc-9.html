                  <p>I was wondering if, when storing energy in crystals (i.e. Quartz) would the crstal work better if it was shaped and polished, or if it was simply left rough and "natural"</p>

                  <p>As far as I can tell, from personal experience and the reported experience of friends and co-workers, it makes no difference. I've seen a few websites that claimed that the crystals must be flawless and shaped, but those same websites were selling shaped "crystals", and usually plain glass
                  "crystals", at that!</p>

                  <p>Personally, I favour beach pebbles. However, that is a matter of convenience; I live near the ocean and beach pebbles are easy to come by. Quartz is very, very common. Clear quartz is only one species of it; milky, rose, amethyst, and so on seem to work just as well. Try using a small bottle of
                  beach sand some time. Most beach sands are mostly --or entirely-- quartz.</p>

                  <p>Hello, I have a few questions, i've been watching psychic detectives lately, and have wondered if the police and law enforcement really use them? Do you know that real psychics have been used in archeology? Has remote viewing been applied to find certain artifacts? Like if there's anything under
                  the sphinx, anything worthwhile in the grand canyon etc? Thank you for the help, bye.</p>

                  <p>Yes, real police departments do use them, although several such are reluctant to admit it publically. Looks bad, you know. A friend of mine was heavily involved in the archeological side of psychic investigation, in the last several years of her life. I do not know whether remote viewing has been
                  used to find artifacts, but I do know that dowsing has been used that way. Of course, rather a lot of dowsers deny that dowsing is psychic, psionic, or otherwise "spooky".</p>

                  <p>Photographs are not proof. In fact, nothing online on the internet should be regarded as proof; data is too easily corrupted on computers. For the record, constructs such as "psiballs" _have_ been captured on film, but the effect is so easy to fake in photographs that --especially online-- they
                  really should be regarded as nothing more than novelties.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I'm not sure this is the righ catagorie, or if these questions have been asked before, so here goes:</p>

                  <p>1. is it possible somone could leave a "psionic reside", like an impression of the person, an and object? I was looking throughmy store room and found a world war 1 helmet. when I picked it up, i felt like I knew the person who was wearing it. I could almost see thier face. could this have
                  somthing to do with empathy?</p>

                  <p>2. is it possible to become exausted from passive empathy? Iv'e always been empathetic, to the degree that anyone I so much as see, I can feel their emotions. It leaves me feeling drained, and weak. any shields I try to make can't help. Iv'e always been this way since I was born, and it's gotten
                  to the point I almost can't stand to be around people.</p>

                  <p>3. Is it posible for empathy to subconsiously use other psionic skills?</p>

                  <p>thanks for taking the time to read this, I really apreciate it.</p>

                  <p>1) Yes, in fact, it is quite common. It's more connected with Psychometry, than Empathy. The divide between the various abilities is not nearly as distinct as some people would have you believe.</p>

                  <p>2) Yep, but it is more often emotional exhaustion than a direct effect of the use of empathy itself. If your shields don't help at all, you aren't doing them right.</p>

                  <p>3) Empathy doesn't "subconsciously use" other abilities, no. Empaths do, sometimes...as do Telepaths, Telekinetics, Mathematicians, Engineers, et al. Subconscious (totally unintentional) use of psionic abilities is very common. The tricky part is making it happen when you want it to, and stop it
                  from happening when you _don't_ want it to.</p>

                  <p>I saw a commercial for a movie with telekinesis in it, and was insanely bored enough to google "telekinesis". Saw some people who actually believed in it, and called them crazy. But then I started to think about it randomally, and curiousity eventually got the best of me. The first real site that
                  helped me was Active Psy (which is now on THIS server, at <a href="activepsy/index.html"
                     target="_blank">http://psipog.net/activepsy</a> ). Then I also came across a message board on dimensional-doorways.com , and met Rainsong there along with some other people who helped me get started.</p>

                  <p>The thing that mainly got me interested enough to actually get me to practice was the mass of people who believed in this stuff... I mean, I knew there were SOME crazies out there, but I couldn't logically conclude that SO MANY people were crazy or lieing. After I saw some results myself from
                  practicing, I just read everything on the subject I could... still do today for the most part <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>Hmmm. My parents have been at this rather longer than I have and they would have been surprised if I didn't "practice psi". The mother of one of my flatmates keeps asking him if he has --and I quote-- "learned anything interesting lately". The mother of the other flatmate would probably be deeply

                  <p>My dad takes different stances at different times. Sometimes he thinks it's a complete waste of time, and I should just stop. Other times, he wants me to help him with a situation. Or use me for entertainment purposes <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       border="0"
                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />. It mainly concerns him in the sense that he thinks I should focus on more "realistic" goals. Like getting a job, getting married, supporting a family... i.e., he doesn't want me to miss out on being "normal".</p>

                  <p>My mom is pretty cool about it. We don't talk about it that much - she's more concerned with the social aspects. In a sense that, she likes to hear about people I meet online through my website. I'm not sure what she thinks of psionics specifically - she's very open minded about stuff like that,
                  and usually takes the stance that "you can do whatever you want as long as it makes you happy".</p>
