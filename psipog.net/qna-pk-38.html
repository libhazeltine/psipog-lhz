                  <p>The BEST?! That's like asking "What is the BEST way to become an actor?". It's different for everyone. The best way is to just practice and figure things out for yourself - this stuff isn't written in stone and no one has the ULTIMATE technique or anything. Different things work for different
                  people... I wish there was a best technique too, it would make life easier for me <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>There are cases of both. Sometimes if you take a break, you get better, other times, you get much much worse. Usually if you stop practicing, and you want to do something psychic, you'll fail, but if you get back in the habbit of practicing, you'll pick it back up quickly. Like most skills.</p>

                  <p>I know that cryokinesis is basically slowing down matter to a point where it is frozen. What I want to know is, when one acquires the ability to do such a thing, would't they be able to essentially freeze time? Well not maybe time, but for example everyone in a room? With enough practice of
                  course. Would this be possible at all? And when you actually do freeze something, is it literally like ice, or does the object just not move?</p>

                  <p>It's "freeze", as in "really cold", not the nonsense from "Charmed". Slow down molecular activity, and the substance is colder; speed it up, and it gets warmer. Or, looked at the other way, when something gets colder, the molecules' movement slows down.</p>

                  <p>Hey, This Q&amp;A is much better than the forums and I think it makes people search for the answers to their questions more instead of just asking whats on their mind with no effort at all,(like on the forums). Since nobody knows how TK works, I thought it would be interesting if you could tell
                  what you think it is, or how you personally think it works. Thanks!</p>

                  <p>I personally subscribe to the "magnetic"/"gravity" theory. What's interesting is that no one really knows how magnets or gravity work... they just do. I think TK would use the same mechanism that gravity does, and this is why we can't really figure anything out about it.</p>

                  <p>Of course, that's my current belief. I change my belief on how TK works a few times a month <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>You can find many mediation articles online. Visualization training consists just in "imagining" an image/object in your head and hold that thought for as long as you can. i.e. close your eyes, visualize a red triangle or just a brick wall in you head, and hold that image in your mind for as long
                  as you can. when you notice other thoughts, start again. Don't get frustrated, at first you'll be able to hold it for few seconds only. After some practice(a lot of practice <img src="smile.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"

                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" /> ) you'll be able to hold that image for minutes or even hours. That's visualization.</p>

                  <p>When you do it in tk. You look at the object, then close your eyes and picture that object in your head. If you are good you'll be able to see it very clearly and even more your viewpoint around that "virtual" object in your mind. that is: viewing it from different directions.</p>

                  <p>i have been doing tk for over 6 months, i started out using no hands and got my first sucsess, about an hour after reading the psipog articles. after a wile i started to use my put my hands neer the weel because it was easyer. after acouple months, i could spin the weel realy fast. and i started
                  to try to role a pen. had about 4 sucesfull atempts at roleing a pen but it never got easyer. i stoped impoving. after that i started over from scratch without using my hands. my question is; is using your hands bad? does using your hands make you improve slower or faster? should i start using my
                  hands again? ( i suck now without hands, compared to when i used them) i want to settle the question of Hands or no hands once and for all</p>

                  <p>I don't think hands play a big roll in how fast you progress. However, I'd suggest you to try it without hands,too. After all telekinesis is called telekinesis because it's done fom a certain distance, eh? <img src="wink.gif"

                  <p>If you try each day during months and still see no results, take a break of some days or some weeks and try again. It's like that: if you really don't improve, try something different. Maybe you'll have better luck then. 4 successful attempts at rolling a pen is still more than the most of people
