                  <p>I hope you'll forgive some of the opinions I'm about to express, and I hope you read this email, though I won't get to the question straight away.<br />
                  In The Telepathic Manual by various writers, a warning is given that it should not be used by certain people It is implied that it should not even be read by them. You allow for the interest of children, and there are articles designed for their parents, but you exclude a group of people with no
                  cognitive impairment and no lack of maturity. If I have a question, I would like to know why this is so.<br />
                  I hope I challenge this assumption sufficiently enough for you to feel curious. The Hearing Voices Network will bear out what I want to say, and can be reached at www.hearing-voices.org, or HVN Oldham Street Manchester M4 1LW.<br />
                  According to your Introduction, in A Definition of Terms, schizophrenia (along with a couple of illnesses invited for a joke) precludes anyone from putting into practise the various exercises described. Here is where I have a problem, and with respect I would like to try to put it right. First of
                  all, exactly what is going to stop someone with any mental illness (including, as the article says, Downright Stupidity) from doing what they want to do? The President of the United States does what he wants to do, even though he does suffer from that much widespread and debilitating condition -
                  Downright Stupidity - that led him to invade a country on shoestring evidence.<br />
                  Secondly, I suppose that the article implies that people with a mental illness are in some undefined way less capable people. If I were to point out that there have been award winning schizophrenic physicists, philosophers and writers - although, of course, most are only as successful and intelligent
                  as anyone else - perhaps you might reply that it is the special nature of psychic activity that should preclude schizophrenics, depressives or people with bi-polar disorder. I'm sorry, but to me this smacks of fuzzy thinking and superstition. If I manage to provoke you enough, perhaps you will read a
                  little of the many publications the Hearing Voices Network out. Sandra Escher and Marius Romme, both distinguished psychiatrists, have discovered that a large percentage of the people going about their daily life with a diagnoses of schizophrenia are in fact merely voice-hearers coming to terms with
                  that strange, and culturally unacknowledged phenomenon. To use a terminology accepted by the Hearing Voice Network, they are telepathic. If a certain number of them have come to a doctor complaining of the problems attendant on telepathic linkages, does this make them schizophrenic, and unfit for
                  your articles? The articles stress that problems arise from psychic engagement, for anyone.<br />
                  Marius Romme also discovered, when he opened the debate though a TV progamme, that there was a high percentage of the so-called normal population who heard voices regularly but had never been to a psychiatrist. Of course, these people had not received a diagnosis of mental illness. They had never
                  been to a psychiatrist. You have to ask what makes these two groups of people different, don't you? And it is only that - one group went the way of a medical model, the other (perhaps seeking other answers, perhaps sometimes just less curious) kept their voice-hearing to themselves until ousted by
                  Marius Romme.<br />

                  <br />
                  I am not claiming that schizophrenia does not exist. However, leading edge medical thinking has permanently blurred the distinctions between mental illness and what passes for normality - and normality of course is often something a large way shy of mental health. People who carry the stigma of
                  schizophrenia are more likely to have personal, real experience of all things psychic and spiritual - for some this is enough to give the diagnosis in the first place. Organisations that express enthusiasms for the spiritual and psychic are not insuring themselves against the responsibility attendant
                  on a fragile type of person when they warn off the mentally ill. They are depriving themselves of people who often have a very real, and knowledgeable experience of all things psychic. Some misconstrue for a while, and come to their own understandings at last.<br />
                  I felt I should write because a few of the terms in your articles - scanning, broadcasting - are familiar to voice-hearers and psychiatrists, agreeing on the processes if not their objective validity - and these and more are very familiar to me personally. I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia,
                  and at times I am crippled by an influx of invading minds - but if this diagnosis still precludes me from membership and practise, I will force myself to behave honestly and withdraw from membership.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>You raise some very good points. However, someone with (correctly) diagnosed Schizophrenia _will_ run into problems in practicing psionics without guidance. Any competent psychiatrist can tell the difference between Schizophrenia and telepathy. Note, the key word there is "competent". Likewise,
                  being a telepath and being schizophrenic are not mutually exclusive conditions.</p>

                  <p>The problem faced in a site that is open to the public, as this one is, stems from the "lack of guidance" thing. Schizophrenia interferes with rational thought, by definition. Therefore, not only does someone afflicted by this disease have a harder time distinguishing between real telepathic
                  transmissions and hallucinated voices, s/he also is at greater risk for injuring him/herself by overlooking the early signs, such as the beginnings of hypoglycemia.</p>

                  <p>Also, there is the risk of the changes in blood chemistry interfering with medication.</p>

                  <p>Then, of course, there are the ones who figure that because hearing voices _can_ be telepathy, then it therefore _must_ be telepathy, and they go off their medications completely, without consulting with their doctor.</p>

                  <p>Folks afflicted with "Downright Stupidity" ignore the warning routinely. It would not be too surprising if those afflicted with other mental problems do likewise.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Assuming I am to master each aspect of the psi, where would be the best choice to begin? because I think it's better and more important to begin with perception(how you imagine), like I think psiballs, the kinesis and other aspects need a certain perception, or how you "see" the different things
                  in your mind, so by choosing telepathy or something in the perception category, I think this would alter your chance of success in mastering more psi-consuming skills later on.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>"Visualization" may be approximately equated with "imagination" or "how you imagine". "Perception" cannot. "Perception" is how your mind interprets what your senses pick up.</p>

                  <p>Telepathy is both perceptive and affective. Hearing other people's thoughts is perceptive. Getting them to hear yours is affective. Psychokinesis is entirely affective. Precognition and clairvoyance are entirely perceptive.</p>

                  <p>So, assuming that it is possible for anyone to master each aspect of psi, and further assuming that you shall do so, you would probably be better off learning the rudiments, and some of the vocabulary to make learning further things easier. There is a reason for most high school courses being
                  concerned largely with the terms and basic procedures of a given discipline, be it Poetry, Chemistry, or Calculus.</p>

                  <p>Hi, I was reading this question in the Q&amp;A database concerning telepathy and learning it without another person, and one of the suggestions to make it easier to do when you try it out was to "read silently while forming the words clearly in your mind so you 'hear' them". Well I was just
                  wondering if it was OK if I can just hear the words but not actually "see them" in my mind.</p>

                  <p>Yes, that is what was meant, actually. The "reading" part was literal, because the context was of practicing while you happened to be reading a book. It can make studying your "less-keen topics for school" more interesting, and you'll retain more of what you read, too.</p>

                  <p>I have dealt with bouts of extreme empathy since a young age. As of know it seems to fade and return on a semi-regular basis. I am a writer and find that my creativity seems to be at its peak while my empathy is strongest (sometimes to the point of discomfort). I was wondering if this is common
                  amoung empaths and/or writers, artists, etc.</p>

                  <p>Secondly... ever sicne i was very young I have become accustomed to waking up in the middle of the night at times when the three number of the clock are identical. It not only wakes me up, but during the day random occurances will occur to draw my attention to a nearby clock. I'm fully aware that
                  this is not really a psi ability persay... but i firmly believe that it is SOMETHING... what that is... I have no idea. I would like to know if anyoine has heard of this...</p>

                  <p>If by "control", you mean "decrease the incoming signals", work on Shielding more (it gets better with practice). Avoid large crowds because the mood of the "mob" is contagious even to the least empathic of humans. Try wearing hematite (a variety of iron ore) against your skin; it might sound like
                  fluffy New Age nonsense, but it helps some of us anyway.</p>

                  <p>Short version: the only people who would claim that Psychic Empathy is anything less than a curse have either never experienced it, have only the weakest of Sensitivity, or have the patience of Job.</p>

                  <p>In an answer to an earlier question Rainsong said that in altered states of awareness you can pick up on radio and television broadcasts. Does this mean then, with intense training of course, that one could for all intents and purposes "Watch Pay Per View in their noggin"?</p>
