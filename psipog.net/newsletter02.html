PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #2, for September 28th, 2004

"Wise men know that their business is to examine what is, and not
to settle what is now."
- Charles Kingsley


Dear PsiPog Users,

Our second newsletter! Yay! Welcome to all the new people who
have joined since our last newsletter. Just a reminder - you can
read any past newsletter at any time by visiting:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/psipog_newsletter/messages

You don't even have to sign up for the newsletter to read the old
messages.

So what's in store today? First, let's talk about the little
updates on PsiPog.net. SunTzu's article was posted, and is
located at: http://psipog.net/show_10158.html

Also, I've released an upgrade to the chat client from v3.4 to
v3.5. Not a whole lot of improvements, but a few things that
might help people who were having trouble in the past. So, if
you couldn't connect before, try downloading the new chat client
and give it another shot. It might work now.

We got a little feedback from the first newsletter. Here's an
e-mail I received from FrozenFlames:

=================================================================

"Hey, Frozen speaking. Well I've speculated that psi sigs are all
different because everyone's energy pattern is slightly
different. Thus, a programmed construct also has a unique energy
pattern (I've noticed this mostly with shields at first, when I
just reached out with my mind and felt 'em). Thus, every
different program has a certain energy signiture. I've discovered
that I can take a shield that I've made and feel out its sig
(making sure its perfectly remembered), and then when I want that
shield, I just push the energy out and recreate that feeling."

My comments: Sigs are definitly tied to constructs. A psion can
use this information to backtrack foreign constructs. Another
trick you can do is to implant a different sig inside of your
constructs. This is good for shields, and a good way to cloak
yourself from constructs designed to find your sig. For every
trick, there is a counter-trick, and a counter-counter-trick ;-).
"Pushing" out a certain feeling to anchor a shield is pretty
common. I can't remember the last time I actually visualized a
bubble shield step by step :-P. Usually I just will one up when
I need one, and feel it immediately.

=================================================================

GFW has e-mailed me a tip:

"You were talking about biofeedback, in the [previous]
newsletter. There isn't a store within miles of this New Mexico
town (also known by some locally as a Village, for Pete's sake!)
that has a blood pressure tester! But, very simply, if you have
someone use two fingers to feel his/her pulse, on the artery, in
the neck, tracking how the blood pulses there is just as good an
indicator, and you don't have to leave home!"

My comments: Very true. The best way to do it by hand would be
to get a watch and count how many beats you get in 20 seconds,
and multiplying by 3 to get your Beats Per Minute. We used to do
that in 8th grade science class :-). Another tip - don't use
your thumb if you decide to try it out. Use the tips of your
fingers.

=================================================================

Let's talk about a new topic before wrapping this up. I have a
really cool secret that I don't talk a lot about on PsiPog.net.
It sounds kind of silly and pointless in theory, but if you
actually try it, it's very effective.

My secret is "affirmations". So what's an affirmation? And how
do you use it to do something kick ass? Affirmations are another
way to program your subconscious to do something. It just so
happens that it's a VERY effective technique. All you do is
repeat a few sentences to yourself, and eventually it will "sink
in". The best time to say affirmations to yourself is while in
a slightly meditative state - like before you go to bed, or right
after you wake up.

You have to be careful what you tell yourself. If you say some-
thing with the wrong wording, or with confusing language, your
subconscious might get the wrong message. It's best to make
affirmations very straight forward, simple, and positive.

For example, when I want to leave my body, I get in a meditative
state then tell myself (in my head, not out loud):
"I will have an out of body experience. I will be conscious of
my out of body experience, and I will remember the entire thing."

It's very assertive, and clear. I repeat those two sentences in
my head over and over again, until I completely zone out. And
guess what? No, it doesn't work 100% of the time, but I do get
better results. Notice how I say "I will remember", and I do
NOT say "I will not forget". "Not" is a negative. You have to
be careful of things like that. Stay as positive as possible.
Give your subconscious INSTRUCTIONS. Do not give it a list of
things to avoid. Also, don't say "I want", say "I will". You
can sit around all day and want something, and it can never
happen. So do you want it? Or do you will it?

If you're interested in affirmations, try looking up things on
self-hypnosis and other trance information on the internet and
library. It's a very popular method, and there is a lot of
information on it.

=================================================================

Thanks to FrozenFlames and GFW for sending me some stuff, and
thanks to everyone else who sent me stuff even though I didn't
include it. I'm convinced that if everyone sends in their ideas,
questions, and comments, that we can make this newsletter kick
some serious ass.

:-D
