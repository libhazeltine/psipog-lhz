               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Making a small inanimate object "fly" is certainly possible: lift it with your pk, then move it around, as in the semi-infamous dogfight example from the pk articles.</p>

                  <p>Making _yourself_ fly is another question entirely. I do not know whether it is possible or not. There are quite a few variables involved, not least of which is whether you can lift an object of your own mass and volume. If you choose to try it, I'd suggest lifting something else that big first.
                  You're less likely to be seriously injured when you drop it. (Yes, I mean "when", not "if"....try it yourself, and you'll see what I mean)</p>

                  <p>Insufficient data, so far. I think it is more likely to be connected to physical endurance than mental, because of the physical stresses pk puts on the body. However, as far as I know, there has not been a definitive answer to the question of predicting who can do pk at all, much less what the
                  limits of mass or volume being affected might be.</p>

Research has shown that random people off the streets can learn skills (like RV), so I would imagine that anyone could learn TK as well. But how do you know
                       if you don't try? <img src="wink.gif"

                  <p>I have tried to move the psi wheel for half a week now and I know that i may be rushing this email but is there another way besides the "Just do it" method?</p>

                  <p>Also I would like to know all the types of Kenisis. You have articles about pyrokinesis and cryokinesis on your site. Are there any other forms?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>In response to your first question, read all the articles under The Kinesis' section:<br />
                  <a href="articles.html"
                     target="_blank">cat-psychokinesis.html</a></p>

                  <p>There is more than the "Just do it" method, but I've found that that's the best method. Of course, if you've only been practicing a week and a half, you might want to give it a few months. Read through the articles, try all the methods, maybe you'll find something good, or maybe something will
                  inspire you to invent your own method.</p>

                  <p>As for the second question, there are literally dozens of silly Kinesis terms floating around the internet. PsiPog condones the use of: Psychokinesis (PK), Telekinesis (TK), Pyrokinesis (pyro-PK), Cryokinesis (cryo-PK), Biokinesis (Bio-PK, DMILS).</p>

                  <p>In my opinion, any other terms are just overkill and silly.<br /></p>

                  <p>In the Roman Catholic and Anglican Catholic parts of Christianity, psychokinesis is regarded as irrelevent to religion; I do not know the official stance of the Eastern Orthodox nor of the Greek Orthodox Churches. In the Protestant denominations, the official stance varies from sect to sect (so
                  far, I've only inquired in a few).</p>
