                  <p>Hello,<br />
                  Ok, since January of 2001 I began having procog dreams..like my new high school, then I moved from Texas to Missouri &amp; sure enough, my dream showed me the entire inside of the new school, I was in complete shock. Anway, I used to dream EVERYTHING that would happen &amp; could even do it
                  consiously. But lately, (last 2 or 3 months) it has been gone. Is there anyway to get my ESP back? I really loved it, like this one time, I woke up at 9 am..&amp; I sat up &amp; like a voice popped in my head &amp; said, Emergency at 1 pm..I was like..Ok? Then my grandpa called the fire dept later
                  that day..I checked the cell phone time &amp; it was EXACTLY 1 pm. Thankx -- Ryan</p>

                  <p>While I can't tell you how to "get your ESP back" I can give you a few things to try.</p>

                  <p>Write down your dreams every morning when you wake up. You may still be having them but forgetting.</p>

                  <p>Try lucid dreaming.</p>

                  <p>When it DOES occur, write down in the same dream journal what conditions it occured under. Include things like date, time, weather, general emotional state, solar activity, etc. and see if you can learn what may or may not bring it on.</p>

                  <p>In order for someone to "drain" (ugh i hate that word in this context) energy from you, then they will with or without looking into your eyes. If you're honestly concerned about getting your psi 'stolen', then shield. Don't avoid eye contact. It makes you seem untrustworthy.</p>

                  <p>There are actually two questions in this post and I guess that they're both mainly for Jaspars as he wrote the article they regard. I think I should get to the point now.</p>

                  <p>1) Can links cause a relay? (e.g. - I link to person A and to person B. Do they share a link or a link that passes through me?)</p>

                  <p>2) Let's say I'm still unexperianced in PK and create a limk to let's say (again) NI (I won't do it NI, don't worry), will his experiance in Pk affect on my PK or at least my PK practice? (Making my practice more efficient)</p>

                  <p>PS - sorry for the question's length. I know that by adding this PS and the words that I'm writing now, I actually lengthen it even more but I thought I needed to say so.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I've recently moved to college in a city from a small town. I'm an empath. I could deal with a few thousand near me, but now there are 2,500 on campus VERY close, as well as being in a city. To say the least, it's a bit overwhelming. I've read Anniesocks' seminar on shielding, but I can't seem to
                  keep them up. It's like trying to use a piece of paper for an umbrella (actually, I kind of visualize the other emotions as rain). I don't know if you'd have any more advice, but some help would be appreciated. Thanks-ShadowWraith</p>

                  <p>I strongly recommend shielding. You can either choose to shield these "random thoughts" out completely, or to help you identify/mark your thoughts from the thoughts of others.<br />
                  How to do it on purpose requires practice and a certain honing of these skills.</p>

                  If your goal is to see things you wouldn't normally see, I would recommend more along the lines of increasing your sensitivity (see Gnome's manual) or remote presence.</p>
