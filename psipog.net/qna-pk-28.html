                  <p>My friend and I charged an empty battery once. It happened four years ago and I can't really remember all the details but I know that she had her hands above the battery and I had my hands around the battery and we were both saying something like "the battery is charging, the battery is
                  charging...". My question is: Was this a product of our will power, and is this even possible? If it was our will power did it work better and faster 'cause there were two us, and can people if they work together make better results?<br />
                  Thanks in advance!</p>

                  <p>Hi,<br />
                  I have a question concerning cryo-pk. In my family we have a line of something like cryo pk but Im not sure if that is what it is. My great aunt was able to make like a burn stop stinging and praticly go away. Would you consider that a form of cryo-pk or just plain luck? Basically what I am asking is
                  that is it posible to make a burn go away by cryo-pk? Thanks. =)</p>

                  <p>That isn't cryoPK. It's a form of healing. If she just made the stinging stop it would be pain-blocking. Using cryoPK on a burn (successfully) would result in frost-bite, which makes the wound worse.</p>

                  <p>Hello<br />
                  My friend gave me this site since I was really interested in psychic phenomenon. I read the articles and it says it requires a lot of focus, but the problem is I have ADD and it's hard to focus on one thing at a time, my mind is always wandering off. I've even tried meditation before, but it seems
                  impossible to suppress my thought. I would really appreciate it if you could help me.Thanks<br />

                  <p>Seriously though, 99% of the people who start off have minds that wander around. It's normal... it's what we've been trained to do. We want to watch TV, talk on the phone, play Gameboy Advance, and hum some music all at the same time. You need to force yourself to focus on ONE task. It's not an
                  easy thing, people without ADD have just as much trouble. Just flex a little will power, and overcome your obstacle.</p>

                  <p>Darwin submitted the following information to me, you might find it useful:<br />
                  <i><br />
                  This isn't actaully a question, but I would like to comment on what Crashmatt90 asked on January 31, because I also have ADD with Hyperactivity, and i figured this would help out alot of other people with ADD. When something doesnt interest you, people with ADHD loose their focus more rapidly.
                  However, when something is of interest to someone with ADD, they can sit down, and do it for hours- for me, that is video games. What you probably need to do is get yourself into the mindset of enjoying the training in telekinesis, instead of thinking of it as something that you need to do to reach
                  your goal. I hope you put this up, I really feel this will help other people like me and Crashmatt90 out in the future. Thanks</i></p>

If so, how long does the actual procedure take 20, maybe 30 minutes? I know it would take a ton of practice, but, I think it is possible. It seems highly

I mean, why spend years trying to not screw up your body, and alter a small physical trait, when you can easily change it using a more simple method? Bio-PK can be dangerous if you don't know what you're
                       doing.</p>

                  <p>Hey it's me again. I finally got the psiwheel to move! So far I can spin it but only to a limit (maybe three to five times a day). I have two questions.<br />
                  1. After I move the psiwheel for a while (like an 30 mins) I get kinda tired. Should I limit my practice so I don't wear myself out?<br />
                  2. Also, I just wanna get a heads up on this, how do you know when to start on pen/cils. Like do you have to get a good control over psiwheels? Or do you just practice the same way on a pencil (as the psiwheel) until it starts moving? Thanx in advance!</p>
