   <p><em>by Peebrain</em></p>

   <p>Robert Monroe was a pioneer in the field of Out of Body Experiences. In 1958 he started having OBEs unexpectedly, which eventually inspired him to write three books on the subject, and create The Monroe Institute - an organization dedicated to researching human consciousness. The Monroe Institute has created a
   program based on Hemi-Sync technology, called The Gateway Experience (TGE). TGE is basically a set of 18 CDs that the user listens to while meditating. Its goal is to help the listener reach altered states of consciousness easier.</p>

   <p>The 18 CDs are split into six "Waves". Each Wave has six exercises, each about 30-45 minutes long. The exercises are meant to be done in sequential order, because each exercise builds on the previous one.</p>

   <p>The exercises use Hemi-Sync technology. How it works is one tone is played in your left ear, and a slightly different tone is played in your right ear. Your brain puts these two tones together to produce a vibrating tone in your head. This vibrating tone is said to help alter your brainwaves so you can hit
   different states of consciousness easier.</p>

   <h3>Warnings</h3>

   <p>TGE isn't meant to be a catch all solution to your meditation needs. It's more meant to be a tool to help you get where you want to be quicker. As with any tool, there are risks involved. TGE outlines it's warnings from the start:</p>

   <p>"The Gateway Experience is a system of training in self-exploration and personal development. It is not a form of psychotherapy, philosophy, religion, or medical diagnosis/treatment. It is a means to acquire knowledge - the application and results thereof are solely the responsibility of the trainee.</p>

   <p>DO NOT listen to these Hemi-Sync exercises without first consulting your physician if you have a tendency toward seizures, auditory disorders or adverse mental condition(s). In the unlikely event that you experience any unusual physical or mental discomfort, immediately discontinue use."</p>

   <p>This is to be taken seriously. I know it's fun to try new things out, and see how they work, but you have to be cautious when messing around with brainwaves. You don't want to hurt yourself.</p>

   <h3>Wave I - Discovery</h3>

   <p>Wave I presents six exercises: Orientation, Introduction to Focus 10, Advanced Focus 10, Release and Recharge, Exploration Sleep, and Free Flow 10. While Wave I teaches you a lot of cool tools you can use, it's main objective seems to be to get the hang of Focus 10. Focus 10 is the state of mind where your mind
   is awake, but your body is asleep. If you have any experience with altered states of consciousness, this state shouldn't be new to you at all.</p>

   <p>While I personally have a lot of experience with OBEs, I still found Wave I to be fun and useful. The exercises teach you some handy tricks, and I found it much easier to trance out using the CDs than just normal meditation.</p>

   <h3>Wave II - Threshold</h3>

   <p>As with each Wave, Wave II has six exercises as well: Introduction to Focus 12, Problem Solving, One Month Patterning, Color Breathing, Energy Bar Tool, and Living Body Map.</p>

   <p>Focus 12 is a new state of mind that you learn. I personally found it hard to distinguish between Focus 10 and Focus 12... but I could notice a slight difference. Most of the exercises are dedicated to learning one specific trick. In Wave I, the exercises really built on each other... in this new Wave, they do
   build on each other, but not nearly as much. Each exercises is it's own little project.</p>

   <p>While I did have fun with Wave II, Wave I was more fun. These exercises seemed more "New Agey", and it took a little effort to extract the meat of what was going on. Nonetheless, it was still cool and I did learn from it.</p>

   <h3>Wave III - Freedom</h3>

   <p>Wave III introduces you to OBEs. The six exercises are: Lift Off, Remote Viewing, Five Questions, Energy Food, and First Stage Separation. While I did complete the training in this Wave, I never really got the hang of Lift Off, so I don't think the exercises were as effective as they could have been.</p>

   <p>I completed Wave I and II in about a month each. Wave III took a lot more effort. My schedule was busier at the time, but it was still hard to really feel like I accomplished something in the exercises. Perhaps with more time dedicated to it I would have done better.</p>

   <h3>Overall</h3>

   <p>My overall feeling is that the exercises were pretty cool. With normal meditation it's very easy to have your mind wander off... hearing the exercises in your ears forces you to pay attention to what you're doing though. It was MUCH easier to trance out, and it was fun trying something new too.</p>

   <p>But, I could also see how these exercises wouldn't be for everyone. They helped me, and I bet they would help others, but I could see where some people could have complaints. My suggestion would be to buy the first Wave from the Monroe Institute, and try it out. If you like it, then order the other Waves... if
   you don't like it, then at least you tried. Maybe sell it to a friend and let them try <img src="smile.gif"

        class="smileyImg" />.</p>

   <p>If you do decide to train with them, always keep in mind that it's a tool. Treat it like a tool. And don't be afraid to try meditating the old fashioned way afterwards - you'll notice it's a lot easier to get in the right state of mind. Best of luck, and let me know if you decide to try it out!</p>
