Newsletter #33, for July 15, 2006

"Life is like riding a bicycle. You don't fall off unless you
plan to stop peddling."
Claude Pepper


Dear PsiPog Users,
Alright guys, its been an eventful month, and I've been busy
every day since the beginning of the month. July is always the
busiest month for me due to after the fourth settling down, my
birthday follows it up, right along with my mom's, and quite
a few of my friends birthdays. For those of you who had a nice
Fourth of July, glad to hear you had fun. As for this
newsletter, it will be longer than normal ones, to make up for
the time you guys had to wait. Sorry for the wait!

=================================================================

Last week's Activity:

This activity involves a bit of Remote Viewing and Energy
Manipulation. What I want you do to is program a construct to
be your "camera" and send it off to some remote location you
will have later access to, like your friends house(but not
without permission, of course). Be sure and to program to
to take in sights in the area. Then program another construct
that will sit at your house and recieve the information from
your "camera". Afterwards link the two, and then try at random
times to link to the construct in your house, and see if you
recieve any information from your "camera" construct.

=================================================================
Activity #6:

This activity requires energy manipulation and a partner. I want
you to find a partner who is good with energy manipulation,
but if you can't, you can improvise. Get them to send a
construct out to a random part in your house, and you have to
seek it out. Later on you can spice it up by adding time limits
or hide in seek, and having them move it around. If you have to
make them yourself, maybe program it to move sporadically around
your house at random points. Have fun :)

Now to dig into the mail bag....

Perception
Analytical overlay is just as bad as not being able to sense
what something is, but sometimes it's all just a matter of
perception, what someone might see as new someone else can
say it's old. As a matter of fact most things in everyday
life are only what we perceive them to be; such as some pets
are harmless until they bite, the world was flat and the yeti
exists (or doesn't).

Recently I've noticed simple hallucinations due to simple
analytical overlay; basically I see something in my peripheral
vision and take it as something else, like a dog instead of a
shadow or something moving when its not, it's really not a big
deal and it happens to allot of people only that they don't
notice it. But my point is that the brain has the power to
subordinate our senses to what it thinks it is A case allot
of readers should be familiar with are the blind spots in
both our eyes (if you don't know about it look it up), we
have a point to our right in our left eye and vice-versa
were our eyes cannot see, however we don't notice it since
the blind spots don't overlap, on top of that we don't
notice it because our brain fills in the spot with a vague
or clear image of what it thinks should be there.
So basically we can sense something how it isn't, how it
really is, or just make something up, but two things are
for certain: it can be as clear or more as if you were
actually seeing it with you're eyes or other sensory methods,
and we can have control over this, we can actually see
something instead of having an image in you're mind or think
someone else's thoughts instead of having unclear references.
I have experienced the before mentioned myself, so I'm not
saying this as a theory.

I could go on for pages but to make this short I'm going to
simply give the reader an exercise to actually see what I
mean:

1) Go to a dimply lit place (to make things easier).

2) Start meditating with you're eyes open.

3) Eventually you will stop paying attention from you're
eye's sensory input (for me it all gets black).

4) After you achieve this try it again but in a more alert
state.

5) Try spicing things up; see if you can make yourself see
simple lines or dots.

*if you want you can try with other senses though I haven't
tried so myself.

This exercise should help people that take too long to sense
something, and it also helps boost confidence since its
something you can actually use you're senses with.

My comments: This was another nice write-up from Obsidian, who
always does a great job on laying out helpful information in
understandable ways.

Thomas wonders:

I have been wanting to tell you about this for sometime, but
never got time. I thought I would send it in this time right
after I read the newsletter. I don't practice psychic stuff
nowadays because I seem to have lost motivation... I made a
topic about this in the forums a few months ago....but it didn't
work ;) .

Well anyway, a few weeks ago, something happened to me that I
am sure was an OBE. I have tried my hand at OBE many months
ago...but I usually got disturbed by a mosquito or something...
This time though I had no intention to do it, and I hadn't even
thought of it!!

Well this night, I had a very bad cold and throat problems
and a slight fever... well my health wasn't too great... anyway,
I was too tired to think about anything so I went to sleep right
away. I don't know how many hours passed but I woke up sometime
in the night. I felt that my legs were floating up. It felt
really odd...since if I usually tried to lift my legs while
lying down... it would put a lot of pressure on my muscles
around the middle. And I am not that much of an athletic guy,
considering I have made a permanent a**print on my computer
chair.. Anyway.. I felt as if something was lifting my legs and
holding it at some 35 degree angle from the bed. Then I had
another odd feeling. I felt as if I was being dragged towards
the top of the bed. But the really odd thing was that the edge
of the bed never came, even though I usually sleep with my head
up to the edge of the bed.

I frequently have Lucid dreams. I have had them years before
I even knew that was what they were called. But I am sure this
one was not a dream. It felt too real..I usually know when I
am dreaming and this one felt very real.

I then tried to sort of look towards the top edge of my bed
or something and suddenly woke up and found that my legs were
down as usual. I realized it was an OBE only later, when I
thought about it.

My comments: There are any number of things of what this could
actually be. It is always hard to actually decided for sure
what something is unlesss you have some past experiences
to compare it with. But the mention of your legs floating and
being pulled backwards through the beds sounds like one of two
things I've experienced previously. One, it was either sleep
paralysis, which seems to be a popular occurance in psionics.
I've had some boughts of sleep paralysis where it felt as though
I were falling through my pillow, and sometimes just falling,
the whole time, this all began from a waking state. The other
possibility is that it could very well be and OBE, and you would
just need to work on getting some control on what is going on
if you want to start enjoying it. The easiest way is to
let yourself know before you are going to sleep that if anything
happens you are going to be ready for it, and then remember the
event you are talking about. This helps your mind remember
better in situations when you can't really think quick enough
about what to do.

Richard says:

Hello,

My name's Richard from California and I am new to your site. I
found the articles and the Q&A part in psipog website very useful
and was so moved with the facts mentioned on the site that I
could spin my psi-wheel after two nights practicing. Since then
I'm constantly practicing and get a quite good results from
psi-wheel and hoping to move to straw or pencil pretty soon. I
have some questions about the stuff I cant do and some tips that
has proven to help me with psi-wheel. I appreciate it if you
could include this in the newsletter.

For the questions, I found my left hand stronger than my right
and I need practicing on right too, but is there any particular
reason for that? While I can still spin the wheel from behind
obstacles surrounding the wheel (like I cut the bottom of a
tissue box and put it around the wheel), I dont know why it
won't move at all if I put a plastic or glass bowl on top of
that. My question is how much harder is that supposed to be to
spin it under a container?

Now the tips that someone might find it useful is that
performing TK at night before bed works much better than in
the morning so practicing at night could be more productive.
Another thing before switching to paper psi-wheel it's better
to start with foil psi-wheel as it's lighter and easier to move.
I also dont use any pin in the center, instead I scrunch a piece
of foil and make a pole with a very sharp head, I noticed you
can make sharper pins using foil than the metal pin itself. This
would reduce the friction to a minimum helping to show the TK
movements much easier

My comments: As for left-right hand dominance, it seems to be
more about whichever you are used to using. If you use your
left hand more, than you will be used to using your left hand
in the process rather than your right. As for why you can't move
it through plastic and glass, rather than an open air obstacle,
is a complicated discussion. If you go according to regular
physics, any reaction that you would have with the object that
would cause movement in the first place, would have its effect
lessened by the fact of the glass being present. If you go by
Quantum physical means, There is less of a reason present for
you to be moving the psi-wheel under the glass. This being, of
course because there is a glass around it. While it is kinda
contradictory, it still leaves mean to add suggestions to the
reason that is present, or change it completely, making
Telekinesis possible.

=================================================================

Jordan asks:

This is mainly a question for people who are doing stuff like
AP... why aren't you doing telekinesis (or psychokinesis)
instead first?

To be honest, the other ones are obviously too perceptive and
could easily be the brain getting lost in itself. With TK, once
you get it, and have repeated it with a noticable thing several
times, then you show it to others and ask them to verify the
sight. When they do, it's definately proven and grounded
in reality.

My comments: The only area of Psionics that can't really be
proven is AP. This is the fact that the general accepted idea
is that AP is a different "plane" of existence, where most
people create what is there, rather than it already being in
existance. Any other area of Psionics, from Telepathy to OBEs
have been proven numerous times. Now it is just whether people
choose to believe this proof or not.

Hey y'all, well I havent done psi in like forever but I started
up like four months ago and I started just the simple "nooby"
stuff like manipulating energy and meditating, etc, etc, etc.
Well about 1 month before school ended my body went insane, I
had precogs about 3-5 times a day and I could hardly control
the energy that built up in my hands. It was a pain.
Anywho, I came to talk about what stopped me doing psi.... It
was about 1 year ago and I had got pretty good at psi. I found
out I had a nak for micro-TK, coding psi, and precoging. Well I
had decided to try pull an OBE. I had tried without success for
about a week and a half and I kind of just shrugged it off.
Well the next night I did my usual meditation and psi coding
when I felt myself being pulled out of my body. I was like "ok,
cool and OBE!!". But then, as I was being pulled out (by feet
first) it had almost got to my head and as my chest and shoulder
was being removed I could see my self above me and I started to
lose sight of reality all I saw was my room swirling around me
and I TOTALY FREAKED OUT! I yanked myself back in my body
and almost hurled. I could not do anything after that...
I had made a really good mental block... but I'm back
in the saddle and I'm doing well, I just want to say even if
something freaks you out beyond anything you have ever felt
before just relax research it and keep trying. I dont
regret anything as much as stoping psi just because I got a
little spooked.

My comments: Excellent advice. At least you decided to get back
to what you enjoy, even after your incident. Most people would
of decided that this line wasn't fit for them after something
like that.

Greg asks:

Ok. I had been just searching the net out of boredom and I ran
across a theory on zero point energy. It said that you could
draw energy from the spaces inbetween atoms because zero point
is equal to infinity, to power say a lightbulb. It also said
that that is why every time scientists tried to measure zero
point that their instruments went off the charts because they
cannot measure infinity. I thought that if energy could be
drawn to power a device, then could it be used to draw psi
from? I decided to try it one night and I imagined all the
zero space around me and imagined my self as a recepticale
for all of the energy. I imagined it flooding me with energy.
I felt this sudden increase in the energy of my body. More
energy than I had ever felt before at one time. I told this
technique to a friend who tried it and he said it worked, and
it worked very well.

My comments: Well first, Zero point energy doesn't exist in the
same concentration in all points in space. In parts of space you
have more stress, there is going to exist a higher amount of it
than those with lower stress. The more stress you put on a an
area the more ZPE you can gather at the area. Much like the
simple idea of Potential Energy we learn in Science. So while
no one really brings it up when talking about such, when working
with manipulation one simply causes stress on certain areas of
their enviroment and causes higher potentials for energy. Once
the potential has been created, the reactions can take place,
and energy gathers in the created potentials. Pretty much what
you accomplished was raised the potential of your body, and
caused and influx of energy into your body. Keep up the good
work, we always need people thinking ahead.

Hi, I made a Flare the other night and I used a different method
I think then the psipog site demonstrates. I start by doing
my warm up: Anchoring, meditating, and all that jazz. Well, I
made a psi ball nothing too special I just made a small one that
had a slightly bumpy surface and I started spinning it till I got
it going then I created another psiball overlapping it with a
bumpy inside and I spun it the opposite direction. Then expanded
the one in the center and compressed the one on the outside so
it would rub together and make a "spark" like those spark makers
for lighting gas grills, After a long grueling 5 min of doing
all four things at one time I finally got it to spark and thus
I made a flare. My method may seem weird but I tried it and it
worked for me and I hope it works for yall to.

My comments: Thanks for the nice the visualization. Sounds like
just the visualtization needed for a flaring. Has enough to keep
you concentrated on what you are doing but not too much, so you
forget what you are trying to do. But just because this method
may work really well for one person doesn't mean it will work
the same for everyone else, as everyone else may have a
different idea than you do that they familiarize more commonly
with sparking stuff. Either way, keep up the good work.
