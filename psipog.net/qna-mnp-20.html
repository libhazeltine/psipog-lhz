                  <p>Take a look at what you're doing other than the visualising, and compare that to the instructions and hints. You might find that you've simply overlooked something. Visualisation alone won't get the job done.</p>

                  <p>Yes, that is normal for a decently strong bunch of oomph. What you do from there depends heavily on your objective. For a psi-ball, the next thing to do would be to check its shape, presumably by feel in your case.</p>

                  <p>umm, sorry to bother you again, but i just can't seem to work this thing properly. my flaw may be my visualization. so i've come up with a way i might be able to solve it, i just wanted to run it by you first to see if it may have an effect in what i am doing wrong, before i try it.</p>

                  <p>i was thinking, to increase my visualization, perhaps i could draw what i want to think of, and concentrate and focus while seeing me sketch the picture which could be like a slide show of how my arm and hand should look?</p>

                  <p>If the problem is in the visualisation, then yes, that ought to help. Remember, though, that visualisation is _not_ the means by which most psionic activity is accomplished; it's only a crutch. ("Sending pictures" is an obvious example of a psionic activity in which visuals are essential.)</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Couldn't think of the best subject to put it in (either perception or manipulation). So forgive me If I have the wrong category.</p>

                  <p>While surfing around the Q&amp;A for manipulation, I hear many people talking about not succeeding in making a psi ball. And a few of the responses I hear from some of the moderators is that "making" and "percieving" a psi ball are two separate skills.<br />
                  The question I'm asking is how does one improve his skill with percieving psi balls. The reason I'm asking is because I would also like to read aura's. The downside is that I don't know anyone who I could borrow long enough to see auras. I just had the idea a few minutes ago that if I can practice
                  percieving a psi ball would be similar results.</p>

                  <p>It's a long shot, but that's what I'm thinking, and if the two are not linked, than at least I could now feel and "see" my psi balls :). So I'm just wondering if you have an article or some advice that I could use to practice seeing my psi balls. Thank you for your time!</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Very good. (Could have gone in "Perception" as easily, but this one is also logical.)</p>

                  <p>Practice in perceiving psi-shapes, balls and otherwise, is similar to perceiving the field sometimes called the "aura".</p>

                  <p>A small point first, though: some methods for seeing "auras" are nothing more than optical illusions. Don't waste your time with those. If it involves seeing "opposite colours" or a consistent "bluish" halo about an inch thick around everything, it is nothing more than eye-straing. Remember to
                  blink, and don't stare fixedly when looking at things.</p>

                  <p>To get some feel for "psi stuff", this works for some folk. (Some don't feel anything at all, though, and can still perceive psi-stuff, so don't panic if it doesn't work for you at first or at all).</p>

                  <p>Make as dense a psishape as you can manage. Put twice as much oomph into it as you think it needs. Include programming to hold its shape when set on the table...if only for a minute or two.</p>

                  <p>Set it down, and relax. Put one hand _slowly_ through the shape, and then the other hand, one at a time. Feel anything? Look at the psishape directly, blink a few times, and look again. Heat distortion, haziness, anything? Try it on several different days and record your results. Compare and see
                  if there are any patterns.</p>

                  <p>a) Could be the same thing. Some folks use "psi" when they are thinking in terms of "ki".</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hello Peebrain or Sean, which ever you prefer, I am new to this site, and new to the whole experience of Psi Balls, and i was wondering if you could answer a few questions of mine. The first one is :How will I know if i have a Psi Ball? (will it be visible or will i just feel it?)<br />
                  The second one is :How do i generate the energy that i have absorbed from my source into a ball? (The previous night i had attempted to make one, i felt that i had absorbed enough, and i attempted to make the ball, but i couldn't seem to make it, i looked to my hand to see if there was anything, but
                  all i saw is a black empty circle, it was not too big, about as big as the center of my palm, it wasn't 3-D or anything like that, just a circle, i was wondering how i put the energy i absorbed into that circle to make the ball.)</p>

                  <p>If you could answer these two questions, that would be greatly appreciated.</p>

                  <p>Thanks alot,<br />

                  <p>Usually, when you're just starting out, you feel it. Later, when you become better, you'll start seeing it. Try to get a constant FLOW of energy, from your source, through your body, out your hands. Don't try to "store" it inside of yourself, then after that, move it. Keep it moving the entire
                  time. See if that helps.</p>
