                  <p>Define "psychic". If you mean "clairvoyant", "precognitive" and/or "telepathic", then you do not need to be "psychic" to produce construct and telekinetic effects. If you are using "psychic" in the same sense as "psionic", then if you are making psiballs and practicing telekinesis, you are,
                  therefore, "psychic". "Psionic" is often the broader term, including affective effects, while "psychic" is quite often restricted to perceptive effects.</p>

                  <p>Such a comparison has been noted before, yes. Relaxation is not always involved, however (and there is more than the matter of belief or disbelief in lifting a fighter-plane out of a swamp <img src="wink.gif"

                  <p>Im also wondering, is Psi in any way connected to outside forces besides ones here on earth? regardless of religion, does Psi connect to spirits, or a higher being, or is it just an extent of ones earthly sences? oh, and if a tree falls in a forest, but no one is around to hear it, does it make a
                  sound? lol, tha</p>

                  <p>"Psi" is whatever mechanism or mechanisms allows psychokinesis and telepathy to happen...in this world.</p>

                  <p>Whether "spirits" use psi to move objects is open to question. There are, of course, some people who claim that telepathy and psychokinesis can only happen by means of intervention by spirits. If they are correct (which I seriously doubt, but it is within the realm of possibility), then psi is
                  connected to spirits. Otherwise, no, it isn't.</p>

                  <p>As to the tree falling in the forest, the chances of there being no creature around to hear it are slim-to-nill, unless there had been some sort of catastrophic disaster which killed off _everthing_...at which point, the question is academic.</p>

                  <p>Is there any history of psi that I can see, such as who coined the name, how the phenomena was discovered, how they tested to find out it existed, or whatever? It just seems like I have a lot of unanswered questions about the history and roots of psi, if there is a link, I'd like to know so I can
                  look into it, I've checked all the links on the site already though.</p>

                  <p>For this sort of thing, you'd be better off investigating books than the internet, and you won't find it all in one place. Some good ones to start with would be _The Iron Curtain Lifted_ by Lynn Schroder and Sheila Oestrander (for some information about Soviet research), and any of several books
                  written about hypnosis or mesmerism before 1948 or so (for information about telepathic and clairvoyant effects regarded as a side-effect of hypnotic trance...many later writers downplay or outright deny these effects). You'll still have a lot of unanswered questions, but many of the important
                  questions in this field of endeavor have not been answered yet.</p>

                  <p>"Psi" is the designation for whatever the mechanism is. It may be one thing, it might well be several different things. If you can do telekinesis or telepathy with it, it is "psi" (gotta love circular definitions, eh?). Psi, and "psionics" are the American terms from the mid-20th century.
                  "Bioplasma" comes to us from Soviet-era Russia. Same thing.</p>

                  <p>Probably not, but there is insufficient data to say for certain. _However_, any intense mental activity uses up blood-sugar, just as psionic activity does. Remember to snack while studying, as well as when practicing, especially if you plan to practice after studying.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Yes, it would. More precisely, it would affect the results. If the two people were pushing in opposite directions, at equal strength, the pen would stay still. If the two people have different strengths, or if one has no particular macroPK ability, that would also affect the results. If both are
                  pushing in the same direction, it is more likely to work than if only one person is doing the same. It's sort of like moving a sofa-bed, in that respect: one person alone might not be strong enough, but with help from a second person, the thing can be carried.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>The three terms derive from different cultures. "Psi" is simply the catch-all term for whatever mechanism allows telepathy, psychokinesis, and such to occur. If you can do PK with it, it is "psi"...It's one of the Western terms. There are others.</p>

                  <p>"Ki" is a Japanese word encompassing many forms of breath and "energy". In common usage in English, it tends to refer to "energy-work" related to martial arts and some kinds of healing.</p>

                  <p>"Manna", as you are thinking of the term, is a more nebulous term, from yet a third derivation, meaning roughly the same thing.</p>
