         <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

         <p>During my mere three years of psi-practice I have found that the importance of fun, yet challenging games more and more important. Not only do they cure a bad case of boredom, they help you advance, and find your strength and weakness'. In this "Article" I'll list as much games I know, of or having to do
         with: Telepathy, and Psi-Manipulation. The games will either be listed as: Online, Offline, or both offline/online. Because of the nature of psi, the majority of these games will be both.</p>

         <p>The first category that I am going to list games for is telepathy, this is quiet possibly the easiest to find games for.</p>

         <p><strong>Telepathy Games</strong></p>

         <p><strong>Colors and Shapes (Both)</strong></p>

         <p>When the PsiPog practice room "#Projection" was created everyone really needed something fun to practice; this was the game that was "created" to play with. Although I think of myself as the creator of the game, I'm pretty sure that someone who has never been to PsiPog would have thought of the same thing
         because it's fairly simple.</p>

         <p><em>Learning Objective:</em></p>

         <p>1. Learn to successfully send an object to another person.<br />
         2. Learn to successfully receive.</p>

         <p><em>How to Play:</em></p>

         <p>1. Choose a sender.<br />
         2. Have the sender randomly select a color, and a shape from the following list. Remember, DO NOT tell them the color and shape until you have finished and they have made their selection.<br />
         3. Colors - Red, Yellow, Green, Blue.<br />
         4. Shapes:<br />
         1. 2d - Triangle, Square, Circle, Star.<br />
         2. 3d - Pyramid, Cube, Sphere, Cylinder.</p>

         <p>If you are playing the game online and you have more than one receiver try broadcasting the signal (from you) as far out as possible. Once you have begun broadcasting have the people come to you, to "Aggressively" receive the shape and color.</p>

         <p>If you are playing offline, you will probably be close together (If you are on the phone do the above, if not continue on). If you are offline, and close together you will probably be able to tell when someone in your immediate area (same room most likely) is sending to you, if you aren't familiar with
         people sending to you have them tell you when they are going to start sending.</p>

         <p><strong>Guess the Fruit (Both)</strong></p>

         <p>Guess is a pretty explanatory game, however, it is a necessity for a fun time .</p>

         <p><em>Learning Objective:</em><br />
         Be able to send successfully.</p>

         <p><em>How to play:</em></p>

         <p>1. Select a sender.<br />
         2. When the sender decides that he wants to go have him select a fruit (Or vegetable) to send. If you are playing with more than two people, broadcast.</p>

         <p>Peebrain Suggests: When you broadcast the fruit, or vegetable, send not only the shape and color, but the taste as well! Try it out, it can be pretty fun.</p>

         <p>Sample Fruit:<br />
         Orange, lemon, apple, pear, banana, grapes, tomatoes, blueberry, raspberry, and cherry.</p>

         <p><strong>Ping-Pong (Both)</strong></p>

         <p>Names can be deceiving, this game is for Pinging! While sitting in the PsiPog practice room, I thought of a more standardized way to play with pinging, and improve your pinging skills.</p>

         <p><em>Learning Objectives:</em></p>

         <p>1. Learn how to Ping.<br />
         2. Be able to acquire people telepathically.</p>

         <p><em>How to Play:</em></p>

         <p>1. If you are in #projection you will want to pick a sender.<br />
         2. After the sender has been chosen he will go down the list (from top to bottom) pinging each person as he moves on.</p>

         <p>When you send in this manor only take as long as you need to get a good ping in but don't take too long. Even if you aren't good, I suggest working at a pretty fast pace. Perhaps 3-7 seconds for a beginner. If you still have trouble getting in a ping, take a little longer.</p>

         <p>As I said before this game can be played with both offline and online styles. To play offline and with more than one person line them up on a couch, or against a wall (and shoot them!) and ping them each individually to tell them you are sending just face them.</p>

         <p>If you want to you can add in some feelings to throw in some fun... And try and keep it above the waist.</p>

         <p><strong>Wall Projection</strong></p>

         <p>This game is another semi-self explanatory game. Get together with some friends and improve your telepathic projection skills by projecting on walls!</p>

         <p><em>Learning Objectives:</em></p>

         <p>1. Get better at telepathic projection.<br />
         2. Get better at perceiving telepathic projections.</p>

         <p><em>How to play:</em></p>

         <p>1. Select a group of shapes and colors (you can use any you want) and list them with a friend.<br />
         2. After you have selected the shapes and colors project one onto the wall (refer to "Fun things to do with Telepathic Projection" by Rainsong) and have your friend, or you, pick it up.</p>

         <p>If you feel that this game is a bit too "easy" for you, why not try and compile the shapes together into other shapes... Like a square and triangle to form a house. If you want why not use lots of shapes?! The more you use, the more detailed your picture will be. Good luck and happy projecting!</p>

         <p><strong>Hack-And-Seek (Both)</strong></p>

         <p>Although the name implies that you have to search for something, it's not entirely so. Instead of having your friend send a message to you, they only think it. Your goal is to look into their mind, and find out what they are thinking.</p>

         <p><em>Learning Objectives:</em><br />
         Learn to look into others minds.</p>

         <p><em>How to play:</em></p>

         <p>1. Create a pool of objects to select from.<br />
         2. After you have created the pool choose someone to think about using one of those objects in his or her mind.<br />
         3. Once the person has begun to think, but NOT send, connect and try and draw the information out of his/her mind.</p>

         <p>I suggest that you practice this after you have practiced basic sending and receiving, and after you have a good feel for it. Also, if you wish to use other things, instead of objects, you can choose an action or try play a sport in your head. The limits are only held to your imagination.</p>

         <p>Peebrain Suggests: If you are more advanced, and playing with someone who is at the same (or a higher) level than you that the person who is getting "Hacked" put up a shield trying to stop the would-be hacker.</p>

         <p><strong>Field-Scan (Both)</strong></p>

         <p>Scanning another's field can often be boring, and generally annoying if they keep asking you. However, if you opt to do it on your own, the fun begins! Although the game is simple in nature, it can seriously boost your self-confidence if you succeed in scanning.</p>

         <p><em>Learning Objectives:</em></p>

         <p>1. Learn to scan.<br />
         2. Learn to move Psi. (If you are on the opposite end of the "scanning" side).</p>

         <p><em>How to play:</em></p>

         <p>1. Choose a scanner.<br />
         2. Once someone has decided to scan, the other person will begin to create a psi-shape, a shield, psi-focus points (Dense clusters of Psi), or just random patterns in his/her field.<br />
         3. Once the person who is not scanning is ready, have the person who is scanning scan,</p>

         <p>I did not include this into the "Psi Manipulation" section because it the game was primarily intended to teach you have to scan. If you're out of ideas for what to create, if you are the person who isn't scanning, why not try and use "The Elements" (Not the Periodic Table Elements )? Try creating some fire
         effects, If not that water, wind, or even electrical type shapes.</p>

         <p><strong>Psi Manipulation</strong></p>

         <p><strong>Psi Conductor (Offline)</strong></p>

         <p>This game is probably the most basic of psi practice, and probably really couldn't be called a game. Why am I adding it? Who cares, I'm The Sheep King.</p>

         <p><em>Learning Objective:</em><br />
         Learn to manipulate psi.</p>

         <p><em>How to play:</em></p>

         <p>1. Choose an area of your body.<br />
         2. Now, move psi into the area.<br />
         3. After you have psi in the area push it about your body, try and stay ABOVE slightly above your skin, so as to not disrupt and bodily functions.</p>

         <p>I guess if you wanted to you could play with more than one person. When I play with psi around my friends I sometimes just push un-programmed psi to there body. If you wanted to play with a friends place your hand above or near a part of there body, and then start moving the psi into the location. If
         you're good enough (not very skilled for this one) you'll be able to make them feel something.</p>

         <p><strong>Pass the construct (Both)</strong></p>

         <p>Yet again, the title of the name says it all. In this game, you create and pass constructs that have a certain shape, and a certain feeling implanted into them. If you're feeling "lucky" why not put a color into it?</p>

         <p><em>Learning Objective:</em></p>

         <p>1. Be able to successfully create a construct.<br />
         2. Be able to successfully program it.<br />
         3. Be able to send a construct long distance.</p>

         <p><em>How to play:</em></p>

         <p>1. Create a selection pool. I generally use the following:<br />
         1. Shapes - Cube, Sphere, Pyramid, Cylinder.<br />
         2. Feelings - Tickle, Tingle (numb), Cold, and Hot.<br />
         3. Colors - Red, Blue, Yellow, Green.<br />
         2. Now that you have found out what you can use pick a sender.<br />
         3. Once that is decided create the construct with the desired properties, and make it "hold its form" by programming it to do so. I won't explain this process because that's not what this article is about.<br />
         4. Now that you have your construct send it to the receiver.<br />
         5. If you are the receiver hold a hand open to accept the construct then mentally brush over it... As well as feel it physically. You have better results if you do both.</p>

         <p>This is personally one of my favorite games. It was introduced to me by Rainsong, however, I slightly modified it. If you are playing with more than one person, try modifying the psi-shape that is given to you. Once you get it, change its properties by adding and manipulating psi into the psi-shape.</p>

         <p><strong>Beach Ball (Offline)</strong></p>

         <p>This is another game that was introduced to me by Rainsong. I don't play it much, but it could be fun.</p>

         <p><em>Learning Objectives:</em></p>

         <p>1. Be able to create a construct.<br />
         2. Be able to program a construct.</p>

         <p><em>How to play:</em></p>

         <p>1. Get together with a friend or two.<br />
         2. Create a large sphere of psi.<br />
         3. After you have made that distance yourself apart, and volley the ball slowly to the next person. When you go to volley it, make a motion. So that the person knows you have received it... He or she will do the same. And if it follows according to your generally idea of the location, Good job!</p>

         <p>Remember that you do NOT have to go slow. However, if you are a beginner it would probably be a good idea if you did. If you wanted to, you could even make the net, and have it stop the Psi-Volleyball.</p>

         <p><strong>Cooperative PsiBall (Offline)</strong></p>

         <p>I'm running out of names here, heh. In this game you work together to make psiballs, or other shapes and give them certain properties.</p>

         <p><em>Learning Objectives:</em></p>

         <p>1. Learn to manipulate Psi.<br />
         2. Learn to create a construct.<br />
         3. Learn to program a construct.</p>

         <p><em>How to play:</em></p>

         <p>1. Get together with two or more friends.<br />
         2. Form a circle with your friends.<br />
         3. Once the circle has been formed begin pumping psi into a sphere, or any other shape, in the center of the circle.<br />
         4. Once the shape is done, program it to hold form. And start putting in other properties.<br />
         5. Make sure it can last. Take your hands away (if you used them) and wait until your nerves are rested. Then, place your hands into the shape. If you feel it, cool. If you don't, that's alright. Try again.</p>

         <p><strong>Psi-Paintball (Both)</strong></p>

         <p>Psi-Paintball is just what it sounds like, you create a ball of psi programmed a specific way, and throw it at another person. Of course, you both consent to the game.</p>

         <p><em>Learning Objectives:</em></p>

         <p>1. Be able to move Psi.<br />
         2. Be able to create a construct.<br />
         3. Be able to send constructs long distance.</p>

         <p><em>How to Play:</em></p>

         <p>1. Find someone to play with about the same skill level as yourself.<br />
         2. As fast as you can create a small psiball.<br />
         1. Program the psiball's shell to stay firm, until impact.<br />
         2. Program the contents of the psiball (Stuff on the inside) to feel slimy/gooey/wet.<br />
         3. Exchange constructs with your friend.</p>

         <p>After a while your field will get really dirty, and you'll probably feel all gross. Hope you can clean it up <img src="wink.gif"

         <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

         <p>Well, I'll have to say that this concludes my making of this article. I started it several months ago, probably six or so. But, I never felt like finishing it. Maybe I became attached. Maybe not, Anyway, I hope you enjoy this and find it useful.</p>
