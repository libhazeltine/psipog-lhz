   <h1 class="pageTitle">Psi Ball Warm-Up Log</h1>

   <p><em>by Peebrain</em></p>

   <p>I held this "warm-up" before annie's <a href="art-shielding-log.html">shielding seminar</a> and thought the log might help some people. There was some minor editing just to improve readability. This really wasn't a "seminar" or anything, just sort of a get together and warm-up to make sure
   everyone was on the same page.</p>

   <p>[19:21] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok, I'd prefer to not moderate the channel, and I hope I can trust you guys to not carry on side conversations<br />

   [19:21] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so, if everyone can just chill, and not but in with random comments "lols" and stuff like that, that'd be cool<br />

   [19:26] * peebrain sets mode: +m<br />
   [19:26] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok<br />
   [19:26] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> step 1. relax!<br />
   [19:26] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> FUCKING RELAX ALREADY!<br />
   [19:26] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> whoa whoa whoa<br />
   [19:26] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ...ok<br />
   [19:26] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> breathe in and out<br />
   [19:26] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> try to just chill<br />
   [19:27] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> you don't want your heart going nuts or anything, you want to just be hanging out, sort of zoning out<br />
   [19:27] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> but don't go overboard - you want to keep a focused mind - but you don't want your mind to be racing<br />
   [19:27] * peebrain sets mode: -m<br />
   [19:27] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> any questions about the relaxed state?<br />
   [19:27] &lt;pyromaniac123&gt; nope<br />
   [19:27] &lt;Telekinex_Man&gt; No<br />
   [19:27] &lt;Savant&gt; not really.<br />
   [19:27] &lt;CleanOldMan&gt; no<br />
   [19:27] &lt;Confuzed&gt; Umm I just listened to hemi sync music for an hour hope that will help...<br />
   [19:28] &lt;stony&gt; I'm kinda late, it's hard with a broken toe... Relaxing now......<br />
   [19:28] &lt;Bshwa&gt; is it ok to have thoughts while relaxing?<br />
   [19:28] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok cool, everyone breathe in and out, maybe put on some relaxing tunes like red hot chili peppers or something<br />
   [19:28] &lt;tim93&gt; stick the toungue to the roof of your mouth, breath in through the nose and out throught<br />
   [19:28] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> yeah, thoughts are fine<br />
   [19:28] &lt;tim93&gt; through the mouth<br />
   [19:28] &lt;CleanOldMan&gt; rhcp great!!!<br />
   [19:28] &lt;Telekinex_Man&gt; I love the Chile Peppers.<br />
   [19:28] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> this isn't deep meditation or anything, just your basic "hang out relaxed" state<br />
   [19:28] * peebrain sets mode: +m<br />
   [19:29] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok while breathing in and out, and relaxing, start to visualize psi forming in your stomach<br />
   [19:29] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> right in your ab region, like your belly button etc...<br />
   [19:29] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> maybe a little higher than your belly button :-P<br />
   [19:29] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so, now the question is:<br />
   [19:29] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> 1. what is visualization?<br />
   [19:29] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> 'voice stony<br />
   [19:29] * ChanOP sets mode: +v stony<br />
   [19:29] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> stony, what is your definition of visualization?<br />
   [19:30] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> (is stony here? :-P)<br />
   [19:30] &lt;stony&gt; I'm here<br />
   [19:30] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok cool, when I say "visualize psi", what do you do?<br />
   [19:31] &lt;stony&gt; Visualization: Any kind of picture or thought of glowing blue orbs moving and swirling, making a kind of water rippling type thing<br />
   [19:31] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> 'devoice stony<br />
   [19:31] * ChanOP sets mode: -v stony<br />
   [19:31] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> cool<br />
   [19:31] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> that's a good visualization<br />
   [19:31] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> visualization is basically just picturing something in your head<br />
   [19:31] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> some people like to close their eyes to visualize so they don't become distracted by other stuff<br />
   [19:31] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> some do it with their eyes open<br />
   [19:31] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> it doesn't matter - do what works for you<br />
   [19:31] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> try both<br />
   [19:31] * peebrain sets mode: -m<br />
   [19:32] &lt;abnormal989&gt; chilli peppers!<br />
   [19:32] &lt;abnormal989&gt; wooh!<br />
   [19:32] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok, so now everyone is visualizing psi forming in their abs?<br />
   [19:32] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> 'kick abnormal989<br />
   [19:32] <i>* abnormal989 was kicked by ChanOP ([peebrain] User Kick requested)</i><br />
   [19:32] &lt;tim93&gt; yeah<br />
   [19:32] &lt;Bshwa&gt; trying to<br />
   [19:32] &lt;Mannen&gt; Yes.<br />
   [19:32] &lt;Confuzed&gt; Ya, I'm too fat too though... does that matter : )<br />
   [19:32] <i>* abnormal989 has joined #projection</i><br />
   [19:32] &lt;Savant&gt; Yes.<br />
   [19:32] &lt;Sawyer_Hickory&gt; Yes.<br />
   [19:32] &lt;hyperion2&gt; yes<br />
   [19:32] &lt;Telekinex_Man&gt; Yes<br />
   [19:32] &lt;stony&gt; Oh here's a small tip: If you try to taste, smell and feel the energy, all the sences will help you<br />
   [19:32] &lt;CleanOldMan&gt; jou<br />
   [19:32] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> in one line, try to describe what you feel in your abs, if anything... try not to span what you feel over multiple lines just because there is a lot of people here<br />
   [19:32] &lt;stony&gt; And yes I am picturing it :D<br />
   [19:32] &lt;Lance&gt; what does psi smell like?<br />
   [19:32] &lt;tim93&gt; energy<br />
   [19:33] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> no questions yet, please<br />
   [19:33] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> we'll get to that<br />
   [19:33] &lt;pyromaniac123&gt; jut a kinda like woha feeling<br />
   [19:33] &lt;Confuzed&gt; Nothing!!! : (<br />
   [19:33] &lt;Savant&gt; A strange well of force.<br />
   [19:33] &lt;jaci&gt; energy<br />
   [19:33] &lt;Mannen&gt; A slight pressure and tingling.<br />
   [19:33] &lt;Droshi&gt; it feels like a tingling solid mass that moves with thought<br />
   [19:33] &lt;tim93&gt; like magnets at same poles<br />
   [19:33] &lt;ColdSong&gt; Warmth and presure<br />
   [19:33] &lt;hyperion2&gt; feels pleasant<br />
   [19:33] &lt;Sawyer_Hickory&gt; Really light heartburn, kind of.<br />
   [19:33] &lt;abnormal989&gt; like a sick stomach<br />
   [19:33] &lt;Savant&gt; ditto @ coldsong, sort of...<br />
   [19:33] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> don't aim for your heart :-)<br />
   [19:33] &lt;Savant&gt; lol<br />
   [19:33] &lt;Savant&gt; sorry.<br />
   [19:34] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok cool<br />
   [19:34] &lt;stony&gt; A moving pressure, with variations in temperature and pressures.<br />
   [19:34] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> most people seem to be on the right track<br />
   [19:34] &lt;Confuzed&gt; I think I might have just felt something<br />
   [19:34] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Confuzed is feeling nothing<br />
   [19:34] &lt;Confuzed&gt; : ((((<br />
   [19:34] &lt;Sawyer_Hickory&gt; No, I just mean the sensation is the same, not that it's there.<br />
   [19:34] &lt;Bshwa&gt; feel the sick to the stomach one<br />
   [19:34] * peebrain sets mode: +m<br />
   [19:34] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok, confuzed, try to close your eyes for a minute or so, and just focus on visualizing the energy forming in your abs<br />
   [19:34] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> and stay relaxed<br />
   [19:34] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> always stay relaxed<br />
   [19:35] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> don't get frustrated (even though that's hard sometimes)<br />
   [19:35] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> don't spaz out<br />
   [19:35] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> just let it flow, try to see it, as stony suggested, try to use your other senses too<br />
   [19:35] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> try to feel it, try to hear it, try to smell (?) it<br />
   [19:35] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> what's left?<br />
   [19:35] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> taste?<br />
   [19:35] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ignore taste<br />
   [19:35] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> :-P<br />
   [19:35] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> hearing is a good one though<br />
   [19:36] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I personally like to "hear" it spark and fizzle as it's forming inside of me, like electricity<br />
   [19:36] * peebrain sets mode: -m<br />
   [19:36] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Confuzed, feel anything? yes, no?<br />
   [19:36] &lt;Confuzed&gt; sorry.<br />
   [19:36] &lt;tim93&gt; ooh, hearing makes it stronger<br />
   [19:36] &lt;Telekinex_Man&gt; What if it gets hard to breath?<br />
   [19:36] &lt;Confuzed&gt; Not yet<br />
   [19:36] &lt;hyperion2&gt; not much<br />
   [19:36] &lt;pyromaniac123&gt; i think i might have made uo my feeling<br />
   [19:36] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Telekinex - just relax, don't go nuts or anything<br />
   [19:36] &lt;Confuzed&gt; but thats ok I understand because I have only been trying for 2 days<br />
   [19:36] &lt;tim93&gt; your focusing to hard tele<br />
   [19:37] &lt;stony&gt; telekinex: if it becomes hard to function take a breather<br />
   [19:37] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Confuzed - that's cool, keep listening and trying the next instructions, you may feel it further down the line<br />
   [19:37] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> but let's move on<br />
   [19:37] &lt;Confuzed&gt; Ya I sometimes feel it in my fingers : )<br />
   [19:37] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so most people here have this psi stuff pooling in your abs<br />
   [19:38] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> keep it there, keep visualizing it, watch it swirl, hear it zip around<br />
   [19:38] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> now what you're going to do is just move that feeling through your body a little<br />
   [19:38] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> move it up to your chest<br />
   [19:38] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> (right now :-P)<br />
   [19:38] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> breathe in and out slowly<br />
   [19:38] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> stay relaxed<br />
   [19:38] &lt;abnormal989&gt; i feel it my breat area<br />
   [19:38] &lt;abnormal989&gt; breast..hehehe<br />
   [19:38] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> cool, perfect<br />
   [19:39] &lt;abnormal989&gt; sorr<br />
   [19:39] &lt;Confuzed&gt; I feel preasure in my chest!<br />
   [19:39] &lt;Confuzed&gt; (Well i DID)<br />
   [19:39] &lt;Telekinex_Man&gt; I don't feel anything.<br />
   [19:39] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Tele - do you feel it in your abs?<br />
   [19:39] &lt;stony&gt; A slight tingle in the lower back, and a nice cool feeling towards my lung area. (AKA what I normally feel :-\)<br />
   [19:39] &lt;Savant&gt; I think I can feel it around my lungs.<br />
   [19:39] &lt;Sawyer_Hickory&gt; Is it supposed to tighten up? That's what I'm getting.<br />
   [19:39] &lt;pyromaniac123&gt; i don't feel anything so i;m laving and praticing bye myself<br />
   [19:39] &lt;Savant&gt; I'm trying to contain/focus though.<br />
   [19:39] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> if it tightens up, just try to relax<br />
   [19:39] &lt;Confuzed&gt; Same here hickory stick<br />
   [19:40] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> keep the energy flowing around<br />
   [19:40] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> keep it free<br />
   [19:40] &lt;Telekinex_Man&gt; Yes, and then when I start movng it up it gets harder and harder to breath.<br />
   [19:40] &lt;tim93&gt; youre getting to excited<br />
   [19:40] &lt;abnormal989&gt; dont strain yourself<br />
   [19:40] &lt;Pixie1&gt; same here telekinex<br />
   [19:40] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok, Tele, for you then I would try moving it outside your body, but we'll get to that<br />
   [19:40] &lt;stony&gt; Tele: just stop for a second relax and chill. (Whit, that's sean's department...)<br />
   [19:40] * peebrain sets mode: +m<br />
   [19:40] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok<br />
   [19:41] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so up until now we've all been visualizing this psi stuff moving around<br />
   [19:41] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> visualization is a great tool, and it works most of the time, but after a while you might start to move psi around just by willing it to go to different places<br />
   [19:41] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so, for those of you that want to try, you guys can try moving the psi around using just your willpower<br />
   [19:41] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> and skipping the visualization<br />
   [19:42] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> now, if you have trouble getting psi to move around in the first place, it might not be a good idea to skip the visualization, but hey, you might be better without visualizing<br />
   [19:42] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so give it a try<br />
   [19:42] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> it might not work, it might work awesome<br />
   [19:42] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> you'll find that in most of psionics, it's basically a "figure out your own method"-type of thing<br />
   [19:42] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> do what works for you<br />
   [19:42] * peebrain sets mode: -m<br />
   [19:43] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> if anyone wants to type some of their results, feel free, try not to clutter the chat though<br />
   [19:43] &lt;tim93&gt; not visualizing works for me<br />
   [19:43] &lt;Confuzed&gt; Peebrain - is it ok my elbows are on the armrest?<br />
   [19:43] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Confuzed- yeah, that's fine<br />
   [19:43] &lt;abnormal989&gt; i think this is the most psi ive gathered<br />
   [19:43] &lt;tim93&gt; do whats comfortable.<br />
   [19:43] &lt;Confuzed&gt; My results- tightening in chest and when i try to move it down the arms it seems as though the tightening is less or whatever...<br />
   [19:43] &lt;Lance&gt; even if ive been doing psi movign for 3 years, is it still benefical to visualize?<br />
   [19:44] &lt;stony&gt; I've found over the years that as you become fluent in psi, It comes without visualization. However, Using visualization makes the psi more productive.<br />
   [19:44] &lt;abnormal989&gt; its all the way upto my chest form my sternum<br />
   [19:44] &lt;Arekuruu&gt; um im just got here if any body wants to could you what i missed<br />
   [19:44] &lt;Confuzed&gt; Abnormal- same here<br />
   [19:44] &lt;hyperion2&gt; do you need to feel anything? cause I dont feel much<br />
   [19:44] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Lance - do what works for you, usually I skip visualization because I've done it for so long, but I still use it now and then too<br />
   [19:44] &lt;Sawyer_Hickory&gt; I need the visual to get anything accomplished.<br />
   [19:44] &lt;tim93&gt; i visualize at first, then move it at my will<br />
   [19:45] &lt;Bshwa&gt; well my arms feel heavier and i feel a coolin sensation in my right hand<br />
   [19:45] &lt;stony&gt; Lance: right arond now in your years, the psi will flow to just willpower<br />
   [19:45] &lt;Pixie1&gt; i take the energy from an external source, say the earth, to not exhaust myself... i feel its much easier to collect the energy _directly_ from the source and into the hands and the psiball rather than going trough the sternum and stuff.... is that..<br />
   [19:45] &lt;TKJay&gt; magnetic pull in and out like always<br />
   [19:45] &lt;Confuzed&gt; Lol about to say that ^^^<br />
   [19:45] &lt;jaci&gt; Arekuru do you want me to copy it and message it to you<br />
   [19:45] &lt;hyperion2&gt; I am getting tired....is that normal?<br />
   [19:45] &lt;Arekuruu&gt; yes please<br />
   [19:45] &lt;tim93&gt; tk jay, visualise a different form of energy, like fire, or cool mist<br />
   [19:46] &lt;stony&gt; hyperion: It can be if your not used to it.<br />
   [19:46] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> hyperion - some get tired their first couple times<br />
   [19:46] * peebrain sets mode: +m<br />
   [19:46] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok cool, now that most of us have the general idea on how to move psi around inside our body, we're going to take it another step<br />
   [19:46] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> to make a psi ball, we're going to move the psi from our abs, up our chest, and split it up and move it down both of our arms<br />
   [19:47] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> when it gets to the hands, we want the psi to shoot out, and (while having our hands together), have the psi mix into a ball outside of our body<br />
   [19:47] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> now, for those of you who were experiencing pain, I would suggest moving the psi from your abs, to outside of your body, to inbetween your hands<br />
   [19:48] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> same thing, different route<br />
   [19:48] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> it's good for beginners to move psi in their body just because it's good to get a feel for it<br />
   [19:48] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so, hopefully, most of you are shooting psi into a ball between your hands<br />
   [19:48] * peebrain sets mode: -m<br />
   [19:48] &lt;Droshi&gt; also you can try manipulation with one or no hands, sometimes it works better for me<br />
   [19:49] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> if you want to pull your hands away and type your results, feel free, but like I said before, please don't clutter the chat<br />
   [19:49] &lt;jaci&gt; sorry arekuru couldn't get it to work<br />
   [19:49] &lt;Bshwa&gt; is it ok to feel like your hand is pulsating?/<br />
   [19:49] &lt;Confuzed&gt; Peebrain - I can't seem to get it moving through my arms<br />
   [19:49] &lt;Lance&gt; i use one hand for the ball and one for that chat<br />
   [19:49] &lt;Arekuruu&gt; oh ok<br />
   [19:49] &lt;tim93&gt; i can change the temperature at my will. is that normal?<br />
   [19:49] &lt;TKJay&gt; magnetic like always :)<br />
   [19:49] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> as Droshi and Lance have said, it's very possible to use two, one, or neither hand<br />
   [19:49] &lt;Confuzed&gt; time93 - ya I guess<br />
   [19:49] &lt;hyperion2&gt; peebs may I PM you something I read in a book? it might be helpful in making psiballs or sensing them<br />
   [19:50] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> sure hyperion<br />
   [19:50] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok, so at this point, most of us have a psi ball in our hands<br />
   [19:50] &lt;Confuzed&gt; Not me : (((<br />
   [19:50] &lt;StarCatcher&gt; I can't move the psi out of my hands<br />
   [19:50] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> now comes the next important thing that is required before learning to shield: programming<br />
   [19:50] &lt;Droshi&gt; mines on the counter lol<br />
   [19:51] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Confuzed - just gotta keep practicing, give it some time to mess around with<br />
   [19:51] &lt;tim93&gt; i can let go, and then grab mine again<br />
   [19:51] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> but everyone else, we'll move on to programming<br />
   [19:51] &lt;Confuzed&gt; Peebrain - holy crap that was the first time I felt it go to my hand from my elbow<br />
   [19:51] * _Triocalas|TP quickly creates psiball<br />
   [19:51] &lt;Telekinex_Man&gt; What if your heart rate increases alot?<br />
   [19:52] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Telekinex - gotta relax dude<br />
   [19:52] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok, hyperion brought up a different technique<br />
   [19:52] &lt;Confuzed&gt; I can't seem to get it out of my hands pee brain<br />
   [19:52] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I personally don't like it, but some of you guys might want to give it a try<br />
   [19:52] &lt;Lance&gt; your virculating blood to make up for the nutrients used during psi generation<br />
   [19:52] &lt;Lance&gt; *circulating<br />
   [19:52] &lt;Metsruler2189&gt; is this the warmup<br />
   [19:52] &lt;Confuzed&gt; ya<br />
   [19:52] &lt;Metsruler2189&gt; ?<br />
   [19:52] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> the idea is basically the same as everything else mentioned, except you rub your hands together for 15 seconds<br />
   [19:52] &lt;Metsruler2189&gt; ok<br />
   [19:52] * peebrain sets mode: +m<br />
   [19:53] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> ok, so if you guys want to try something new, you might want to try rubbing your hands together for a little bit, then trying to make a psi ball<br />
   [19:53] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> this stimulates your nerves<br />
   [19:53] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> or at least, that's the idea<br />
   [19:53] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> personally, I don't like doing it, because I don't know whether it's STIMULATING the nerves or TRICKING the nerves ;-)<br />
   [19:53] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> but hey, mess around, maybe you'll like it<br />
   [19:54] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> moving onto programming<br />
   [19:54] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> programming is critical in making a shield<br />
   [19:54] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> (what is a shield? for right now, it's a big psi ball, but annie will go into more depth ;-P)<br />
   [19:54] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so, how do we program?<br />
   [19:54] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> well, this might come as a little shock, but you already DID program the psi<br />
   [19:54] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> *gasp*!!!<br />
   [19:55] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> how did you do it?<br />
   [19:55] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> the big V word<br />
   [19:55] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Visualization<br />
   [19:55] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> as I think tim mentioned, he made it cold, and warm<br />
   [19:55] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> through visualization, you can program the psi to do a bunch of cool things<br />
   [19:55] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> tim made it cold at one point, and then warm at another point<br />
   [19:55] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> 'voice tim93<br />
   [19:55] * ChanOP sets mode: +v tim93<br />
   [19:56] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> tim, you were the one who said that, right?<br />
   [19:56] &lt;tim93&gt; yeah<br />
   [19:56] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so, how did you do it, personally?<br />
   [19:57] &lt;tim93&gt; well, first i thought of changing what i saw in the psi energy. i saw a cold mist when i made it cold, and a fire when i made it hot. i also slowed down the process for cold and sped up for hot<br />
   [19:57] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> cool<br />
   [19:57] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> 'devoice tim93<br />
   [19:57] * ChanOP sets mode: -v tim93<br />
   [19:57] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so what did he do?<br />
   [19:57] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> he just changed his visualization<br />
   [19:57] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> changing your visualization changes the programming<br />
   [19:57] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> very simple stuff<br />
   [19:57] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> simple to try, but it might take a while for your body to get it<br />
   [19:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> all this is is just picturing stuff in your head, and your body makes it happen<br />
   [19:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> so, want a hot psi ball?<br />
   [19:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> visualize fire<br />
   [19:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> visualize steam<br />
   [19:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> whatever<br />
   [19:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> cold one?<br />
   [19:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> visualize ice cubes<br />
   [19:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> glass<br />
   [19:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> whatever makes you think of "cold"<br />
   [19:58] * peebrain sets mode: -m<br />
   [19:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> that's it for my introduction, because I have a phone call</p>
