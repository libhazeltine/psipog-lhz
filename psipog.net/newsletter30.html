Newsletter #30, for May 6, 2006

Use what talents you possess. The woods would be very silent
if no birds sang there except those that sang the best.
- Henry Van Dyke



Dear PsiPog Users,
Recently I've been busy with personal business so the
newsletter's been coming at random times during the weekend
at the two week marker. No matter what though, I'll make sure
it gets there within in the two week limit.

=================================================================

Last week's Activity:

While attending daily life take a minute to pause and look at
your surroundings. For example : Look out a window and try to
obtain as much detail as you can of the area you see. When
ready, close your eyes and take as much time as you need to
re-create the image in your head. Try to include as much as you
can. With practice you will more easily be able to recall
objects in places you have already visited and thus increasing
your ability to visualize.

=================================================================
Activity #5: This activity came from Azric and is as follows :

I have an idea for a game involving pinging. It is a simple
game to play with psions that are in your area. Let's say that
2 psions are in a room together, one is the 'pinger' person
performing the ping, and the 'pingee' is the person reciving
the ping. This is to be done at random times & intervals. For
arguments sake, lets say it is in a classroom, where you want
to keep your psionics a secret, its fun and well, I believe
discreet is the word I would like to use here. The pinger
sends a loud noise or some form of distraction to the pingee,
upon recieving the ping, the pingee looks toward the pinger.
If the pinger HAS sent a ping, they simply mouth the word ping.
Then, to prove that the pingee has actually recieved a ping,
or just looked up coincidently, they nod or shake their head
in correspondance.



=================================================================

Now to dig into the mail bag....

=================================================================
Staysee suggests:

I have a suggestion for anyone trying Aerokinesis:

1) Take a walk and connect to your hands energetically while
you walk (think of strings of energy or a psiball)

2) As you are walking, you are building Kinetic Energy that can
be translated into Psychokinetic Energy

3) I move my hands in a rhythmic pattern as I walk while
maintaining their energetic connection (very similar to
liquid dancing)

4) Pay close attention to how the wind is communicating (it
helps to think of these as a communication between you and the
wind as opposed to forcing it to do this or that)

5) Turn your attention to connecting the Energy you have built
in your hands to the Wind.

6) Be Patient.

I think you'll be delighted with the results !!

Have fun

My comments: I've noticed a lot of requests for this on the
forums, It seems a lot of people newer to PK are interested
in the sort. So here it is for those who are, and good luck
to those of you who try it out. Also a little reminder, that
all forms of PK are basically the same concept. Even when
moving wind, you are simply moving around the air, the same
as you would move your psiwheel, or speed up the particles
in an object to heat it up.

Veno asks:

I had only started working with psi about last year. I
had made one psi ball in my room and in an elevator I
could feel the energy moving through my arms, forming the ball
and felt the ball in my hands. Now I can barely feel anything
at all whether it be the energy traveling to my hands or the
energy in my chest and the ball in my hands.
What could be the problem? Does the fact that I
started during a time when it was raining outside play
any role at all?

Also only after I had started working on psionics my
hands have been doing this thing in which they start
tingling in the pores. I want to know if this has happened
to any other people and if not why is it happening ?

Thank you for your time

My comments: At first most people are more sensitive due to
the fact that it is a new stimulus, such as when you first
go swimming in cold water, and eventually you don't feel
the temperature of the water any longer. Or when you first come
in to an air conditioned room after being in the heat all day.
Unless it is something different from you have normally been
experiencing. Physical feelings are a bit harder to ignore
rather than such things as hot/cold stimulus. But after a
constant of application of such physical stimulus, we don't
focus on it as much as we would a newer one. Such as,
you do not focus on your clothes all day long, but if you
think about them, you can feel them. The same works for
energy, the more you focus on energy, the better you can
feel/sense it. There is a guide to sensitivity you can find
here : art-psiball-source.html7 That should help
alot on getting your feel for energy back. As for rain having
to do with anything....it seems the only affect the rain had
was to keep you inside long enough to try psi out.

Also, it is common to feel energy in your hands, or tingling
when you start working with energy manipulation, as you
are getting used to the whole new feelings and control.

Kiss expresses:

My weridest attempt for an OBE occured about 5 days ago.
Here's what happened: I went to sleep and stuff. I had a lucid
dream and I wanted to leave my physical body, but got stuck. I
heard whirling sounds, and wanted to know what was behind all
this. So I asked "who are you?". Suddenly, VERY heavy
vibration were induced and my heart beat faster. I was resisting
and finally I woke up. Very werid experience. Words can't
express what I mean. Had anything similar to this?

My Comments: The only thing I've had similiar to this would be
what I classify as Sleep paralysis. I would normally wake up
from the middle of another dream, and then I would be laying
there and all of a sudden my mind would shift to maybe ghosts
or the fact of it being dark in the room. At this point, an
overwhelming feeling of fear/another presence would sweep over
me, usually followed by horrible sounds of various types, from
such things as tv static to slow voice like sounds. Normally,
I would recognize it for what it was, and let it pass, since
in reality it seemed to be a state of being half awake while
in a sense dreaming at the same time. I've never worried any of
it as malicious, and have probably had some that would make most
people assume something evil is out to get them. In my
experience I would have to say, that it is simply a point
where you don't fully wake up, and the part that does is
normally bombarded with dream-like images and sounds, creating
the illusion of something real.

=================================================================

KingKai wonders:

Lets say you make a psi-ball, and you want to throw it at
somebody (ping), then do you HAVE to program it? So i guess my
question is - Do you always HAVE to program it?
Thanks in advance :)

My comments : This can go either way. First if your friend is
sensitive enough, and the construct that you send at him is
strong enough, he should recognize it on arrival. Upon
recognizing it, he can scan it for its source, since you made
it, it will contain your signature, and then he will know who
sent it. Second you can actually program the construct to
carry the idea of getting his attention and your name with
it, and when it gets to him, it will let him know who sent it,
and he may recognize it when it gets there, better than the
first method. But third of all....if you can ping in the first
place, I don't think you should rely on a construct to do it
for you, unless, you want a continous ping, setup for certain
intervals. Good luck.

Caleb recommends:

I'm a remote veiwer by no means, but I am trying to improve.
The method I've been using is a standard deck of cards. I find
it very useful because you can do different things with it.

1. You can just simply flip through the cards one by one tyring
to guess first color, then when you get better, guess the suit,
and then possibly the face or number of a card.
The possibilities are endless.

2. You can try to think of a card color or suit, and open it
to that point.

3. You could split them up into red pile, and a black pile; and
not look at them until the end then tally hits and misses.

4. THERES SO MUCH MORE. YOU COULD EVEN PRACTICE IN PUBLIC
WITHOUT NOTICE OF ANYONE ELSE!!!!

Best of all unlike if someone saw you with a deck of regular
cards. No one would think you were weird; unlike maybe if you
carried a deck of zeneir cards, and you can use different
levels of complexity. You could also learn a few simple magic
tricks, and impress your friends with sleight of hand.

So if your going to be practicing remote veiwing like I am, I
would recomend a deck of cards they're simple ; easy to find,
and no one is going to think you're different or weird for
having a deck of cards.

My comments: These are some good ideas for those thinking of
excersises with cards and those who would rather keep their
practicing on the down low. No matter what you use them, for
they seem to be pretty handy.
