Dear PsiPog Users,

In progress is the new design of PsiPog, which should bring with
it more personality and user interaction. For those of you
interested you can find the design here at www.psipog.net/rev .
Also in the mix is the new translation project going on at the
forums, which has a few members already working hard. If you
are interested you can email me or send me a message in the
forums, and I'll get you started ASAP. For those of you
interested in the interview aspect, it is already planned
to setup more interviews later on for your viewing pleasure.

Now to dig into the mail bag....

Metalknight informs:
In the last newsletter, I read a comment warning about putting
certain negative emotions into psi balls because they radiate
that emotion. Well, in my personal experience, as long as you
program the psi ball correctly, you can actually choose to take
the emotion out of yourself, place it in the psi ball, and get
rid of the negative emotion. I like to find an object to place
it in. I have a stump in my back yard that no one goes near, and
I've gotten into the habit of placing any negative energy that I
have into a psi ball, and sort of throw it into the stump. Just
be careful you don't put it into anything alive.

My comments: Thanks for the tip, that's a great way to elminate
unwanted emotions throughout the day. While some claim strong
emotions act as a catalyst for some abilities others find that
psi is a good way to get rid of these negative emotions. Try
and find what ever works for you.

Admiral N ponders:
Once I went upstairs for a nap for a while, I laid down and tried
to go to sleep but I couldn't. I stayed for maybe 15-20 minutes,
got up and walked around for a minute, then laid down for about
another 5 mintues. I came downstairs and almost 2 hours had
passed! This is very strange, because I naturally have a good
sense of time, and I know that I didn't fall asleep. I wondered
what you thought of this, if its happened before. Thanks!

My comments: The only possible explanation I can come up with is
you most likely fell asleep and due to your restlessness dreamed
of walking around, or in a rare case you may of had an OBE in
the process of trying to fall asleep to explain the walking
around, and then fell asleep. Either conclusion I believe sleep
was involved to some extent.

Sleight of Mind says:
I probably should be practicing TK more then I do, but I had a
strange occurrence. I never really was good at the pin wheel.
I would be able to spin it in 1 direction and only have control
of it moving and stopping. It must have been 2-3 months since I
practiced TK last. I got bored one day and I started lifting
weights. Nothing big, just some bicep and for-arm curls. After,
I decided to go and try the pin wheel. I was able to spin it
seemingly without any restrictions and I had full control. Then
I sat back in my chair and put my hands about 2 feet away and
still had full control. I have not tried again right after
lifting but I have never had that control again. Is it possible
that exerting my muscles would allow energy to flow more easily?

My comments: A number of things could of been going on here, so
I'll mention a few. For one, unless you absolutely are lazy
you probably felt more refreshed and relaxed after lifting
weights allowing you to easily get in the mood the for TK. The
second one is that taking a break may have been what you needed
in the first place to succeed further on, because maybe you were
exerting yourself or trying too hard the first time. And third,
in popular opinion some people use energy to move objects, and
the fact that you had just come from a work out and putting
tension and stimulating nerves that you may have generated more
energy. As for more control, if you worry too much about why
it happened that one time, it might lead to thoughts of having
to have preset conditions to achieve such actions of TK. This
will only limit you later on, so try and practice more often if
total control is what you are after.

Ben asks:
For as long as I can remember.... if I get to the point where I
get angry, my psi abilities appear to work better. I dont
like choosing that action to get what I want in practicing
with psi balls and Tk. My other abilities are natural and I can
be calm using them my empathy, tp, and so on.... I am just
wondering what you would have to say. Like I said I dont like
using that anger part to my tk or making my psi balls do u think
there could be anouther way of doing it with out, well with out
it getting out of hand. I can control it for a little bit but
once it goes over where i have no control and it seems my Sub-c
takes over. Like I said, any advice that you have for me I'd
be greatful to read and practice.

My comments: Relying on anger to help with psi will become a big
weakness when you start to grow more dependent on it. You will
not always be angry to help with your psi, and in most cases that
you would actually use psi, are not going to be times you are
angry. If you are angry all the time, then maybe it isn't the
the anger causing the boost, but maybe your stressed emotional
level. Otherwise keep up the good work.

Patrick responds:
In response to "Zero054" theory of brainbuilding... It could be
that as you practice more, the electrical pathways in your brain
become more pronounced to the stimulus. Just like muscle memory,
in that the more you do something, the easier it becomes. The
human body is an amazing machine, capable of adapting to almost
any type of stimulus. The perfect example is bodybuilding. You
lift a certain amount of weight until it becomes easier, then
you increase the weight and your body will adapt accordingly...
This COULD be just as applicable to developing psi as it is your
physical body. So keep practicing!!!

My comments: Thanks for the awesome advice and words of
encouragement.

The Fool asks:
Aright, I've been trying levitation or at least affecting an
objects weight and was wonder about a few things. I have a scale
to see if it's getting light. I usually appear to be able to
change the weight by 1/3-1/2 pounds for about 20-30 sec which,
when referring by the terms guidelines, means that much force
upward. I find it strange that I have no success on the psi-
wheel, if I can apply at least 1/3 lbs constant pressure I should
be able to do it.

So what I'm asking is if this manipulation of gravity, a
different ability entirely. Affecting gravity would not causing
molecules to move though space as with psychokinesis, but
something changing a factor whose cause isn't even scientifically
decided upon completely (gravity). If it is a different ability
shouldn't it have its own name, techniques and such?

My comments: Affecting gravity, would be doing just that,
affecting the force that is pushing down on an object. If you
distort gravity you are going to affect the amount of force it
holds objects down with. Although I see what you are asking, and
if you are actually affecting gravity to where you can distort,
in a way, the percentage of gravity pushing on an object. Which
would explain why you can't levitate the psiwheel because you can
only distort a percentage of its weight due to gravity. But is it
really that complex, or are you just not used to working on
levitation with the psi-wheel as much as you are with other
objects?

Scott suggests:
I was trying to think of new PK exercises, then I suddenly
remembered one that I was already using without really realizing
it. Whenever I am sitting near a bonfire I use my mind to make
the smoke go in the direction I want it to go. It is really easy
to redirect since it is so light. I just thought this exercise
could help people practice so I sent it in.

My comments: Nice idea, normally I have troubles with the smoke
trying to blow on me no matter which side I sit on, so this
should come in handy.

Telepsycho shares:
I had a dream this night about me trying out something I had seen
in a cartoon. The cartoon is actually very well made and has a
good plot and theme. It is called Avatar. Yeah. In it there are
air benders, water benders, earth benders, and fire benders. I
dreamed I had to fight someone, and I decided to use fire
bending, although I had no idea what to do. I put my hands in the
shape of a ball, and immagined fire coming out of my hands. It
actually appeared, but it went in different directions and
dissipated. I tried again with the same result. I thought, "What
if I use psi to keep the fire together?" I concentrated and
summoned the fire again. I used psi to put it in the shape of a
ball, and it actually became kind of dense. Then I thought, "Ok,
now, I am going to program this fire to move forward at a high
speed." I did it and threw it at my opponent. He dodged and it
hit the wall behind him, and bounced off. I then thought, "I
didn't programm it to go through the object it hit, only to go in
that direction, so it didn't go through the wall."

After that, the dream ended. I thought after I awoke, that this
could be used to some extent in psionics to create psi balls.
Imagine a fire cloud between your hands, and use psi to put the
fire cloud together. You don't actually have a fire coud, but it
helps you get a lot of psi together. Also, visualization of fire
helps add temperature to your psiball.

My comments: Nice fun dream. Basically on the point of making
constructs, you summed it up in the last paragraph, the fire
would serve as a visualization, and a shell is always a good
thing to make sure you do to your constructs.

Hi, I've been checking out the site and really enjoy all the
things I've come across and read. Occationally I've tried some TK
(still hasn't worked). But things like Telepathy and Weather
control seem natural to me. I want to know to what extent it is
"normal" to be able to control weather, One example is a few
months ago my friend and I had gone hiking it had been raining
all day which I was enjoying. On the drive back we got a flat
tire and had to change it in the middle of the bad weather which
was at that point going on for a few days without signs of
breaking up. Perturbed I looked at my buddy said I'm tired of
this rain and allowed myself to feel the sun breaking up the
clouds and flowing through me, Within 5 minutes the thick grey
clouds broke up and the next week was sunny. My friend was
astonished that the sun came out of nowhere. and I would say was
a coincidence except that it happens to me often with weather.
How can I tell if I'm actually influencing the weather or if I'm
just picking up on events that would happen regardless? If
someone would like to help me with an experiment I'd really
appreciate it.

My comments: As for influencing, I believe it is possible, but as
far as controlling the Weather, that is more of an iffy subject.
Perhaps you precoged the possibility of sunshine, and then helped
influence along with others who want the same.

Shellie informs:
I thought this was good to use for some people who are bored with
using the pendulum for the same old things. I have even tried to
tie it up on a lamp and tried to move it and the whole lampshade
moved with it. That is what got me interested in Psychokinetics.

I have been working with Pendulums since 1998. I got bored one
night and wanted to use the QuiJa board but no one would use it
so I desided to use the pendulum with it. I used all sorts of
question and it worked. The Pendulum would circle around the
letter or number that normally the pointer would goto with
another person to use it. I could feel where the pendulum wanted
to go. It had a sort of pulling feel to it and when I got closer
to the point that it wanted to go it would lighten up in weight
then start to circle. I got some really good results with this
method. Though I know some people don't like the QuiJa board and
anything to do with it. You can also do this with some words
written on paper and placed on the table in random places to get
some results. I have also tried this with a map and a map of the
stars (I don't mean a map of the Stars like Tom Cruise and David
Bowie) Maps of the constilations and a telescope. It proved to be
a very interesting experiment. I got bored with just the usual
yes no questions with the pedulum and started experimenting with
all sorts of things. I even started trying to keep the pendulum
moving while I was in conversation with someone. I did a
presentation on Parapsychology in school and used the Pendulum as
one of the experiments I told the people in the class that you
could use anything as a pendulum and that it is a good tool to
use if you are trying to increase consentration. I got quite a
few people interested in learning more about it and some even
interested in taking Parapsychology as a major in college.

My comments: Thanks for the nice information on Pendulums, maybe
you will interest the readers as much as some of your classmates.

SorasKeyblade comments:
Lately im having precognitions on a weird chart. Every three days
I get a deju vu that totally stops me because I've seen it before
I was standing right there. Like I dreamt of an apple basket in
my kitchen and then tried to pick one up. Suddenly I stopped
halfway and woke up went to the kitchen to get one because it was
so real but it the basket was empty. The next day when I got home
from school the basket was full and I stopped halfway exactly
like in my dream. It was the clearest I ever got and its getting
faster. Do you think it will increase even greater?

My comments: That depends on the actions you take towards it, if
you try and worry about it too much though, you may drive
yourself crazy. Reason being, it isn't always clear when it is
going to happen, unless directly given, so even small
similiarities you find maybe the next day doesn't mean that is
what you precoged, or dreamed. In fact it could happen the next
day, as you experienced, or days later. The best thing to do
is not try and push it too hard, just let it take its active
course and notice what is going on. After a while you may soon
realize what and why such things are happening.
