=================================================================
Newsletter #27, for March 12, 2006

"Thought is real, physical is the illusion. Ironic, huh?"
- What Dreams May Come


Dear PsiPog Users,

While the new design is still in the works, other things are in
the mix. New and innovative techniques are always in the works
under the techniques section of the forum, so if you are growing
bored with regular old constructs, or just need a few ideas to
get more out of your practice, you should stop by. Also for
those of you who have recently lost things or happen to lose
anything, there is a new project in the Remote Viewing section
aimed at retrieving your lost objects, so check it out at your
conveinence. It was recommended by a few people that the
newsletter needed more substance, so starting this week there
is going to be an activity each week for you guys to accomplish.
This week it is going to start off with Remote viewing and next
week will be something new according to what I think up. Also if
you have any suggestions for the newsletter will be gladly
examined if you want to email them.

=================================================================

Activity #1:
Simple as it is this week, is going to be the Remote Viewing of
a target. If you are interested in trying but not sure what to
do, check this page out for further info:
art-outline-to-shielding.html164

As for those of you who already know the basics of Remote
Viewing, the target coordinates are: 1199-5577

Have fun! :D

Now to dig into the mail bag....

Hey friends!

Well, after 2 years of hard work, I finally know how to make
visible psi. I was shocked when I noticed how easy it can be.
Right now, I can only use my index fingers. I'm working my way
up until I build one between my palms. Here's what I do:

1. Try to build a psi "ball" between your index fingers.
--- --- Cheap illustration of the position your index finger
should be held, but you get the idea. ;)

2. Now, move you index fingers in a slow and constant motion,
like you turning a knob. 1. --- ___ 2. ___ ---
3. --- ___ ... Sorry but this part is hard to explain, but
just simple till the point where it's retarded. Move them in
a circular motion. Not together, but one moving up and the
other down. I hope you get this part.

3. Keep focusing and moving your fingers in a circular motion.

You'll start to see some sorta "electrical" energy. Like a line
moving with your index fingers. If you do (and I'm sure you will
because it's easy as hell), don't get excited because it'll just
fade away. I usually do it before I go to sleep, because it's
dark and quiet. Trust me, you'll probably see something in less
then a 2 days, maybe now! Just practice.

I came up with this when I learned in my martial arts class
that everything in the universe moves in a circular motion. The
atoms, solar, system, and energy.

My comments: Thanks for sharing this awesome technique, maybe
next you can come up with a method for visible constructs? :D

Wushu Psion responds to the post made by Metalknight in the last
newsletter:

Negative energy does not have to be dumped into anything- such
as a tree stump, like we dump garbage into dumps, as we know,
doing that causes future problems, the same goes for dumping
negative energy. Instead, form the negative energy into a
black ball, spinning counterclockwise. Have this ball move
around, collecting other negative energy, as much as you feel
necessary. Then, stop the ball and have it start turning
clockwise, as its doing so, imagine it turning a pure white
light. Then just have the white light explode and dissipate
around the room. This is a much safer way of getting rid of
negative energy. This may take a while to master, but once you
do, its very effective.

My comments: That's a great technique for putting use to energy
that you were just going to dispose of earlier.

Lucifael wonders:
Ok, first off I came here because I wanted to learn how to make
shields to keep my empathy from getting out of hand. That was
my only interest, however as time progressed I began to become
more interested in other aspects of psionics such as
psychokinesis. However there were certain abilties I wanted to
avoid altogether such as telepathy. However it seems that one
can not pick and choose which ones they learn or pick up. I
found this out becuase one day I was talking to my friend and
eventually I already knew what he was going to ask and would
answer him before he did. At first I had actually thought he
asked and I had just forgotten he did. But after a while it
became apparent that wasn't the case.

Why is it that one can pick up abilities they dont want like
that?? Or is it because I tried to avoid that I picked it up.
Which if the latter is the case why would that be? Oh and
another thing is if I dont program my shield to prevent that
from happening it will happen at random times. That has me
very concerned so I've been extra careful to program my shields
to keep telepathy signals from leaving or entering me because
I'm not really sure which that would be.

My comments: This is common for most people just getting into
psionics. For the most part, you became interested because you
had some degree of sensitivy at first and needed to find the
reason for it. Others just getting into psionics are recognizing
the existence of this extra sensitiviy, and are often bombarded
with it in many ways, due to not having a clear idea on what
they want to accomplish in the way of psionics, and basically
they are still open to most forms of it. If you are still
getting any unwanted input later on in your practices, then it
is probably best to shield as you stated. This way, until ready
to deal with what else is going you can avoid it interferring
with your daily routines.

Peebrain's comments: Also, this general sensitivity which brings
about empathy can also be used for telepathy. My guess would be
you picked up telepathy just from already using your empathy
skill and developing a little bit more sensitivity through some
basic exercises. Again, the solution is to shield.

BloodTrail shares:

Hello, I've been practicing TK and psiballs for a few months and
avidly reading all the articles on PsiPog and the newsletter.
While I struggle with TK, I think I've got psiballs "under my
belt". So I'd like to offer my suggestions and tips.

1) Learn anchoring commands. That was the best singular advice
I've ever followed through on. It's easy and I've already
securely programmed it to ground myself (I say "root") on command
as well as instantly make a fairly well formed and dense psiball.
Be sure to read up on it on PsiPog.

2) Don't always rely on other's techniques. After experimenting
a lot with psiball visulizations and techniques, I found the best
way is to really use those as "guidelines". The best way is to
make you're own sequence of visulizations and ideas to help. For
example, I use a Final Fantasy sort of idea to take in energy
and make a psiball (without anchoring). I imagine swirling around
in the pyreflyes that appear in the series, and then absorbing
those as "white" energy, then, absorbing a "dark" energy that
swirls around the white energy energy in my body. I push both of
those into a psiball and make a ying-yang sort of effect in my
psiball. It works great for me, but I still stand by making your
own. Anyways, good luck.

My comments: Most definately right, it is always best to follow
the basic methods to a certain point. But in the end, you are
going to want to form visualizations that mean something more
to you than just the generic terms which only get you so far,
due to your lack of connection with them.

Tim states:

Hey,
I'm new at all this stuff and I just found this site. I have a
question, and it is: that when ever I sit on the ground
(the earth) and try to make a psi ball I get light headed. I've
heard how it means you've took to much energy but it does not
happen when I'm getting energy but when I'm making the ball. I
have felt warmth when I try to make a psi ball but never seen it
do you have any ways to prove you really have one.

My Comments: It actually sounds like quite the opposite of
taking in too much energy, but maybe you put out too much energy
in your efforts of making constructs, which leaves you fatigued.

As for ways to prove they exist, there are many ways such as:
Getting a relative or friend to feel the space the construct is
supposed to be, and if you recieve the same input, then it more
than likely means it is there. Or try and change the temperature
and see if it affects a thermometer. Maybe if you are feeling
adventurous, go all out and try and make it visible.

=================================================================

Packy suggests:

An interesting tip for those who hate tests at school, where you
cant quite think of the answer, but you know it is either a or
b? Try pendling with... a pencil! I use it all the time, and to
see how accurate you are, put a little P next to all of the ones
you "Pencil Pendle" and go back and check if you were right. I
got an A on a test doing this for every question.

Enjoy!

My comments: Nice idea, just might want to start out with a few
doing that method, so you don't get angry if you fail a test. I
have only had one test so far where I have tried using some form
of psionics to get the answer, and it was because I was going to
fail it anyways, and decided "What the heck!". I ended up
getting a low b, but it definately beats the F I was going to
get otherwise!

Rahmid asks:

I got into TK maybe a year ago and didn't have any success so I
would stop and go. But I really got into it, looked up
exercices, and found PsiPog. I was trying to spin the psi wheel
with only random success. Then I went to a party sleep over at
friends house and it was about 3 and I was just able to do it.
It was amazing. Total control. I believe it was the many videos
I watched earlier that day on google video. And my friends were
able to do it instantly after watching. So, I can still do it
sort of currently. But when ever I would try and show someone to
try and prove to them that TK was real, I would bomb. I would
eventually get a few spins but nothing much nothing to change
their mind. I was able to do it under the table, but now I
generally don't do well. It has to do, I believe, with doubting
my skills. I dont understand it I believe, but I KNOW I can do
it. I go and try it, but it doesn't happen until i just stare
and focus for like 10 mins. Then I can get a really good spin but
even then I cant stop it very good, let alone change directions.
Its bad, in the very least.

Any advise, or similair instances, please share!!!

My comments: For the most part, it sounds like doubt is most of
your problem. I say this because you mention being able to do it
at 3 (which I assume you mean 3 am), and this is normally the
time we are tired and don't question many things as we would
during the day when we are more alert. Such as I have read things
at night before, and then woke up the next morning and had a
totally different opinion than I did the night before. Now while
you will probably never be fully convinced even after you pull
it off a few times, it does help when the doubt pops up less
often. So work on the doubt as you also work on Telekinesis, and
it should prove helpful.
