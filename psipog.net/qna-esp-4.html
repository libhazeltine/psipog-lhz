                  <p>I think this was the right section to put this in, but I'm not sure... Sorry if I'm wrong.</p>

                  <p>Anyway, today I was thinking about two of my friends. They're going out, and have been for about 3 months... Then I started thinking about what someone else had said almost a month and a half before... they had said "They're not gonna last very long. He used to like ME before they started going
                  out."</p>

                  <p>Anyway, just about an hour after thinking about both of those things, I found out that they had indeed broken up... I was wondering if this might be precog, or if it could have been a coincidence?</p>

                  <p>You can do it by yourself... some types of exercises require more people though. Usually you RV with two people - one person picks the random object and assigns the coordinates, and the other person uses the coordinates to "see" the random object. You can practice RVing on your own through sites
                  that post random pictures daily/weekly/monthly, or using just a random database of pictures. For example, see: <a href="images/index.html"
                     target="_blank">http://psipog.net/images/</a> Pick a random number, and try to RV that image.</p>

                  <p>More likely Clairvoyance of the usual sort than Precognition, because if the advertisement went up the next day, it had already been in production. If, by contrast, you'd dreamt of the advertisement itself, that would be (probably) Precognition.</p>

                  <p>I've been attempting to speak with my subconscious lately, and think i've gotten a hang of it, I was just wondering If you'd agree that its my subconscious in a couple of things that happened. First, I was studying japanese, and i simply could not think of the katakana symbol for O. So, I skipped
                  it and continued, I then went back to O and heard someone in my head yell. "TREE!" I Instantly remembered what the symbol was (kinda like a tree), I also heard the voice yell "Under the socks" when I was looking for an important paper (it was there). Could these be my subconscious, or am i just
                  remembering things?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Quite frankly, your sub-conscious mind will remember things that your conscious mind may forget or deem unimportant. Whether any memory process is a result of your conscious mind getting direction from your sub-conscious is under question. However, if you are going and doing something else when
                  all of a sudden it 'pops in', I would atribute this to sub-conscious training instead of the result of normal delayed memory function (personal opinion that you have asked for).</p>

                  <p>There is a certain amount of evidence that indicates that most --and possibly all-- people can use psionics for the ESP side of the house: clairvoyance, telepathy, precognition. It is not likely that everyone can reach the same level of proficiency, but that is also the case with such mundane
                  skills as writing and playing the guitar.</p>

                  <p>As for psychokinesis, the evidence is more sketchy on this count, and some researchers express doubt that it is a skill which everybody can learn. However, there is no concrete way to determine which people can learn it, and some people have gotten it to work after trying for several years with no
                  apparent progress in between.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>There are various medical conditions which seem to make it more difficult to do psionics. Also, there are some medical conditions which are affected by psionics. Diabetics, for example, must be much more careful about their blood-sugar levels. Some effects of certain psychiatric disorders can
                  mimic psionic effects (telepathic reception is probably the most obvious such effect). These factors can complicate matters of diagnosis and treatment.</p>

                  <p>More detail than that could very easily creep into the realm of "medical advice", which would get us into legal and ethical problems.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hello, I'm new to this website and pretty new to this whole paranormal stuff. Over the past 2 years I've started OBE meditation and have gained alot of knowledge about the external world beyond the physical.</p>

                  <p>But recently, in my heavy meditation, I've come across the ability to reach others with my mind. I do not know for sure what it is classified as, but I can communicate with others.</p>

                  <p>At times it seems as though my friends, family, and just random people are hearing exactly what I'm thinking. And I can be listening to a conversation( not saying anything, just thinking ), but making the people who are talking to eachother say what I was thinking.</p>

                  <p>I've talked to close friends and they have no clue what I'm talking about, but I can talk to them directly with my mind and have a converstaion in the mental with them. The weirdest part is that they have no idea that its occuring physically. But in the mental, they can mention things about me
                  that are personal and kept silent to me only.</p>

                  <p>I am having a hard time deciding what is true and what isn't, because I have asked my friends mentally to tell me why they haven't discussed this communication with me earlier and they just blow it off. This makes me believe that it is possibly other influences messing with me using friends voices
                  to communicate with me.</p>

                  <p>I would appreciate some help, I am losing my sense of reality and also I'm turning into a jackass around my friends because of this. I need to find out the reality of this whole situation, I hope you guys can give me some good advice.</p>

                  <p>The first thing I suggest is a reality check. That means make sure you aren't fooling yourself. Everyone fools themselves from time to time... I've fooled myself a lot, and made a jackass out of myself in the process... but I've learned <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Second, what you are describing is certainly possible. What you MIGHT be doing is mistaking your own psychic impressions of them for THEIR thoughts. For example, if you are communicating with your own subconscious, and you think it's THEIR mind by mistake... then things might get confusing. Find a
                  way to figure out "who" you're talking to.</p>

                  <p>Third, any time you do something really strange, find a way to confirm it. That means try to prove that it really happened some way or another. For example, if you can project to others and make them say things, try to get them to say something really random (use uncommon words). Get them to say
                  "banana" or "fantabulous", or something random like that.</p>
