                  <p>Well, I have a little problem.<br />
                  I can move the psiwheel very well, but the problem is that I cannot do it NOT to move!<br />
                  I mean that from the time that I move it I can't keep it steady. It keeps spinning!Even if later I dont look it.<br />
                  That means that in the future I will move heavy objects (pens...etc) without my will? or this is a defection of tk?</p>

                  <p>I had the same problem. I had to practice NOT moving it, actually. I would sit there, thinking "ok, now move", and of course it would be spinning, then switch to, "ok, now stay still", and see if I could will it to stop spinning. Practic both, switch between them quickly, etc...</p>

                  <p>Your ability to control the direction needs to be practiced. This is like asking "I've practiced a little, and didn't get 100% correct, why not?" - the answer is because you need more practice. You've got some of it down, keep practicing, and get the rest.</p>

                  <p>I was wondering, when you practice moving an object or levitating one, do you go straight to the just do it method, or do you build off a technique then after you have seen it and felt it do you then move to the do it method. I was just curious to know how you did it.<br />

                  <p>Most people build up to the "just do it"-method. Usually the person figures a way to trigger the TK, then slowly figures out how to directly do TK (i.e, "just do it"). Try both.</p>
