                  <p>Hello, and thank you for looking at my question. I've looked around for this answer but I dont think I found it. I am a newbie at phi balls and stuff. I tried before a while back but didn't really get interested. I was also VERY skepical after I tryed for like 1 day, nothing happened, I quit. I
                  NOW know I was stupid.<br />
                  Anyway, my question is: Could I be PRETENDING to feel what i'm supposed to be feeling? Being a newbie I know I must train more, but I just want to be sure. Thank you for your concern.<br />
                  P.S. Awesome site! Lots of info, easy to understand, good job.</p>

                  <p>You could be "pretending", yes. One of the difficulties of psiballs is that the early ones are hard to verify. Once you've had a bit more practice, ask someone else to put their hand where the psiball is, and see if they feel anything.</p>

                  <p>Sorry; this is not a question, but I just had to tell something. I think the best thing to do with psiballs when you get good is to make a hot psiball in one hand and a cold psiball in the other, then shape them into dragons and make them fight. When I first dreamed this up, I watched it for like
                  a hour(recharging them every now and then). It is the COOLEST!</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hi,<br />
                  When I try to do a psi-ball, I cup my hands closely together and after a while 1 minute or so I feel a prescence of a shape as in like a ball, but I feel the heat usually instantly when I cup my hands. Is this due to body heat or related to a psi-ball? I even asked my mum to feel between my hands
                  when I though I felt a prescence of a shape but she said she didn't feel anything and that there was no heat. Is it just all in my head? Also, you say to visualzie energy flowing from the abdomen, do I have to learn to open the chakras or something like that for it to work?</p>

                  <p>Thanks</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>No, belief and/or existence of chakras does not seem to prevent/help with the formatiuon of a psi-ball. visualization of energy that is flowing from your abdomen is something to help your sub-conscious mind gather the energy for you. If other people cfannnot feel your psi-ball, then the odds are
                  that you are doing something called 'biofeedback' (DMILS) that is the equivalent of it all being in your head (you are causing the physical sensation that are close to having created a psi-ball rather than the actual creation of one). Biofeedback is also a useful technique, but in your case, try not
                  to focus on the sensations so much aws the visualization of energy moving, forming itself, ect (and ignore what your hands are feeling when focusing on this goal).</p>

                  <p>Hope that this helps<br />

                  <p>okay, here is the simple version...<br />
                  1 - Make the psi-ball<br />
                  2 - move the energy around in the psi-ball until a majority of it is condensed on the outside (you can accomplish this by visualization (especially tactile), and try to get it to form into a hard outer surface that is programmed not to break down (it will still break down, the idea is simply to make
                  it take longer to do).</p>

                  <p>It is difficult to describe exactly how it is done, however, what we suggest is that you use the visualization of the psi moving up your chest (along your skin if you find it easier to feel taht way), and then down through your hands. You are trying to create this feeling as accurately as
                  possible. Then, after it does move, you can analyze how it actually happened, and learn from there.</p>
