               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>The answer to your first question is 'until you feel comfortable enough'. Everyone is different and learns at a different rate, whenever you feel that you can start programming, go ahead and give it a try. What is the worst that could happen? It doesn't program right? It is not as if this is a
                  life or death decision, just go ahead and give it a try. If it works, great! If it doesn't work, practice some more and give it time.</p>

                  <p>Yes, you can make a psiball with one hand. In fact, you don't even need your hands to make a psiball.</p>

                  <p>That is completely up to you. After you have amde a psi-ball, what it's purpose is is for you to decide. Some people use them for cooling certain areas, others for heating certain areas, some to make them visible (more for the "I made it visible" factor than for light), some use them for healing.
                  There are a vast number of uses for simple constructs, and what you decide to do with them is up to you.</p>

                  <p>1) Some people argue that that is what 'flaring' is, however it is not my personal view. I have seen no evidence as to the bending theory, and much more to the 'emitting light' theory.<br />
                  2) A number of people can flare psi-balls, and you can too if you practice diligently enough.</p>

                  The idea is that it is a dense layer of energy around the psi-ball programmed not to let the psi-ball fall apart, or just programming the entire ball to last longer (some time-frame).</p>

                  1) How bright is it?<br />

                  3) Is it possible to put other commands into the psiball at the same time as the flare command(like have it glow and serve a purpose)?<br />
                  4) After you finish making the construct and put the shell around it can you still change the programming or is it permanent?<br />
                  5) Have you ever thought of making a flared construct in the form of a halo, telling it to float above your head, and than walking through a church.(In other words, have you ever used a visible construct to mess with someone like scaring them)</p>

                  3 - Yes<br />
                  4 - You can still change the programming, just don't forget to shell it again (I re-shell and it works well for me, but some other don't that that works for them *shrug*)<br />
                  5 - Thought of? Actually, no... but if you can do that, more power to you.</p>

                  <p>Psi-balls are not always visible (in fact, most of the time, they are not visible at all). However, you can still feel the effects of a psi-ball after you have made one, and so can other people. For instance have you felt a hot/cold sensation? Have you felt a "magnetic" attractive/repulsive
                  force?</p>

                  <p>One of the easiest ways to see if you have created a psi-ball is to have another person feel it, and see if they feel anything 'weird' or 'out of the ordinary' and then ask them what they have felt. If you have successfully made a psi-ball, they will tell you that they felt either a hot/cold or
                  magnetic feeling, as well as some of the other things in that very article you linked to. ( <a
