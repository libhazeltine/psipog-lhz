               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>It occurs to me that learning to manipulate psi or one's own "energy" or whatever, is conciously taking control of a system that isn't normally used voluntarily. Therefore, isn't all psi about learning bio-feedback?</p>

                  <p>Example 1: If you imagine strongly enough that your heart is slowing down and put your will (or "oomph") into it, then with practise, your heart slows down.</p>

                  <p>Example 2:If you imagine strongly enough that an invisible tentacle of energy comes out of your body and hurls a glass across the room and put your will into it, with practise, you're going to have to go out to buy new dishes everyday.</p>

                  <p>This all leads me to believe then that (seeing as how psi is apparently a part of the bio system) if you master bio feedback to the point where you can totally control your body, then you master psi aswell, as it is just another part of said body. Just thought I'd get that little essay/theory off
                  my chest.</p>

                  <p>Questions, comments, corrections, arguments, (on this subject) or large cash sums from anyone would be most welcome. Peace. :)</p>

                  <p>Short answer: you have the right idea. Biofeedback-like skills are the apparent basis of deliberate control of psionic activity.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>I'm confused at this question. We get a lot of things similar to this. You want something, but that something can't be in the articles. To me, this seems like a cheap shot. If you ask for something specific, we say "read the articles". So now you ask for something in general, and specficially
                  state it can't be in the articles? Have you read all the articles? Our articles work well because we work hard on the articles. If we reply to something like this with information that isn't "article-worthy", it won't work as good. If we reply with information that IS "article-worthy", chances are
                  we've already put it in an article. We don't hide information, we are discovering this at the same rate as everyone else. First step: decide what you want. Second step: look in the articles. Third step: if not in the articles, then ask in the Q&amp;A specifically what you were looking for.</p>

                  <p>Sorry if it seems like I'm picking on you. I'm more picking on all the hundreds of people that ask a similar question.</p>

Anyway my question is, does psi work in this fashion, i.e. are there certain materials that are more
                  pliable to psi (easier to manipulate telekinetically, easier to charge with psi, etc.) than others?</p>

                  <p>Yeah, it does in fact effect your "powers" a lot. Focus on getting better, then resume practicing after you're back in shape. On the other hand, some people do report more OBEs while sick, but I personally think that's because they spend more time in bed drifting in and out of consciousness

                  <p>Background<br />
                  There were several questions asked by others in the past relating hypnosis to psionics. Having some experience with self-hypnosis in the past I have observed many simularities between a self-hypnosis technique called "finger twitching" and manipulating psi. "Finger twitching" creates a bridge of
                  communication between your concious mind and your subconcious. The method requires one to ask the subconcious to designate four fingers for "yes", "no", "I do not know", and "I do not wish to answer". After doing so you can ask your subconcious questions at which point it will answer by raising a
                  finger. This is remarkably similar to Rainsong's article on pendling. While performing "finger twitching" one would experience jerky movements ( twitching) , the finger that the subconcious is trying to raise will become tingly/warm, and obviously there is a pulling sensation as the finger is in the
                  process of raising.</p>

                  <p>Question<br />
                  Has anyone else observed the same simularities? It makes me question the ease of affirming the creation of a psiball. Perhaps manipulating psi is only creating an environment where the subconcious fabricates these perceptions. Or perhaps it is vital for the subconcious to be involved in one level or
                  another for psi manipulation and that's why "finger twitching" and psi manipulation are remarkably similar.</p>

                  <p>Forgive the length of this question, but I felt it was necessary to go in depth with the self-hypnosis technique. I would very much appreciate any comments/arguments/answers.<br />
                  thanks</p>

                  <p>Very perceptive.</p>

                  <p>The fact is, the "finger twitching" you describe works on the same principle as pendling, and finger-twitching can be used for precisely the same purpose as pendling....and vice-versa. Using the pendulum to get answers from the sub-conscious was quite popular in hypnotherapeutic contexts for a
                  good part of the twentieth century.</p>

                  <p>In both cases, the idea is to get a clearly understandable answer from the subconscious. The only difference is in where the subconscious is getting the data on which its answers are based. In hypnotherapy, _usually_ the data is already in the memory somewhere. In psionics, _usually_ the data is
                  gained by clairvoyance, telepathy, precognition or such.</p>

                  This is very very hard for me to explain... but I'll try my best<br />
                  I keep having ideas coming aparently from nowere... mainly like the pyro and cryo kinesis axplained on this site... I uased to ponder about it and come up with the same comclusion as in the articles (before I read them). And that has hapened with lots of other aspects.<br />
                  My real problem is that I dont know what I should consider that, I've taken a few tests to see if I have precognition but the results were negative.<br />
                  How the hell am I geting these ideas then?<br />
                  PS: one of those things is that psi energy is radiated through the eyes, I realy need to know if its true since I havent been able to confirm it anywere else.</p>

                  <p>Congratulations, you are capable of rational thought.</p>

                  <p>Most of the "Cryo" and "Pyro" stuff could be thought up through a combination of a rudimentary knowledge of Physics and Chemistry, and some logic. The "Fire and Ice" essay is based on experience, but none of the ideas in it are especially earth-shattering. Speed up the action of the molecules, and
                  the substance heats up. Likewise, if you heat a substance, the molecular movement gets faster.</p>

                  <p>Although psi-stuff _can_ be sent from the eyes, it is not recommended, nor is it common. However, it is a popular convention in cartoons and some kinds of special-effects in movies. Likely as not, you picked up the idea from science-fiction depictions of telepathy, psychokinesis or even some uses
                  of hypnosis.</p>

                  <p>Although "mental capacity" and such are sometimes used as indicators when someone is trying to figure out the best candidates for military-type projects with psionics, psionic talent is found in the entire range of mental capacity, from the very top to the very bottom of the scale.

                  there are people on both ends of the scale and all of the middle who seem to be unable to produce certain (or, in some cases, any) psionic effects.<br /></p>
