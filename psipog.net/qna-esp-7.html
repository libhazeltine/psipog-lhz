                  <p>I was wondering about meditation. I find it very hard and wanted to ask a few questions.<br />
                  1)what method do YOU use to meditate?<br />
                  2)could you explain it in detail?(position,thoughts,breathing,ect.)<br />
                  3)how long it took YOU to get good at meditation.<br />
                  4)any advice to a begginer at meditation.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>I use a simple count-down method of meditating. I usually find a comfortable position (easy chair/couch), sit down, close my eyes and take a few deep breaths. After that, each time I take a breath I will count a number (starting at 20 and counting down to one). Example:<br />
                  *breath in* 20 *breath out*<br />
                  *breath in* 19 *breath out*<br />
                  at each step, clearing away more thoughts, and focusing only on the numbers.<br />
                  After that, I go through the colors (Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet) picturing each color as clearly as I can, as a visualization exercise. Ending with white, I am in a meditative state.</p>

                  <p>Took me at least a month to get a decent meditation out of it (but I was doing it on a bus-ride that I had to take every morning)</p>

                  <p>Advice? Stick with it, it can be a very helpful tool in your psionic ability list. A meditation before a practice can make a practice be much more worthwhile.</p>

                  <p>2. A good idea? Eh... no big deal really. Pings aren't that powerful, and are usually just used as a "HEY!" type of thing. If the speaker is sensative, they MIGHT feel something... depends on how strong of a sender you are.</p>

                  <p>To whom it may concern,<br />
                  I am having some really big issues with clairvoyence/precognition type things. I get premonitions or so every once in a while, nothing big, just a slight pain in my head and I see something. Well, just yesterday I was in the car, and I envisioned a really gory thing. Someone was sitting in a torture
                  chamber and they had a razor slammed down on their backs. EWWW! I continued to see this same vision over and over and over again throughout the day. Why? I am also empathetic, and I sort of felt what it was that happened, is that normal?</p>

                  <p>Um, no that's not usually considered "normal". It sounds like your imagination to me. Just because you see it in your head doesn't mean it's a premonition... I see lots of shit in my head, most of it is just my mind keeping itself occupied because I'm bored. I would suggest writing down the
                  "visions" you have, and see how many actually come true.</p>

                  <p>I think this would go under perseption. I was riding in the back seat of my dad's truck and kind of noding off. He steped on the brakes real fast and it jerked me back to full alert. It hurts being yanked back to full awareness like that. But anyway, when I started to relak again I noticed a
                  feeling in my hands. It was kind of tingly and slightly magnetic. I was just wondering if it was a common thing for fear to automaticly triger that, without actualy having to try. It would be cool if it could be trained like a reflex. Thanks in advance.</p>

                  <p>If you have been training psionics, it is possible that you inadvertently triggered a release of psiv However, it could have just as easily been a surge of adrenaline. As to the question of whether it is possib/e to train psionic skills as a reaction to the environment, it is possible and it has
                  been done before. I have personally have had psionic reactions to certain events (typically in distressing circumstances), and havu trained precognition (short range) under simisiar circumstances.</p>

                  <p>What you are probabaly experiencing is little bits of precognition, or the random images that come from quieting your mind. You can persue the images in your RV practicing if you are curious an to which each image is, you can persue it with a RV or RP.</p>

                  Anyway, a couple of nights ago I was moving psi around my body, I moved it to my head when suddenly it started to come out of my forehead. As this happened I thought about something my friend had said all of a sudden I felt like I was standing beside her I could tell she was asleep her breathing
                  pattern and even what she was wearing when I asked her later I got every thing right.</p>

                  <p>Did I scan her? what do you think happened?</p>

                  <p>It is hard to say exactly what happened, but it is possible that you scanned herw and also possible that you RV'ed her. If you have been training any perceptive skills lately, then it is even more possible for a random occurence like this to happen. Still, what happened is anyones guess.</p>

                  <p>I can get the same feeling... I don't like using the term "third eye", or the verb "opening", but semantics and technical definitions aside, it might be that. If you are trying to see auras, I really haven't read any crediable information on them EXCEPT for the information in the book "You Are
                  Psychic!" by Pete J. Sanders. He takes the position that auras aren't REAL, but just a way for visual people to interpret the information they're receiving. The book has ways to receive the same information using different senses... I recommend it.</p>
