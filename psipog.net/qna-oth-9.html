                  <p>No. Disorientation that severe is a problem. I would strongly suggest consulting a medical professional. There are some illnesses which have symptoms similar to that; it'd be best to make sure that none of those are present, before assuming that you just got in a bit over your head playing with
                  out-of-body experiences.</p>

                  <p>Hi Peebrain, I've read one of your articles concerning communication with the subconcious mind. Thank you for writing it, it seems like a very useful skill. I also have some questions about the subject that I was hoping you could answer.</p>

                  <p>In your article, you say that you went into a test knowing 20% of the material but came out with a 90% grade. I was wondering how that worked? For example, did your subconcious tell you the answers to each of the problems as you were taking the test?</p>

                  <p>Also, can you use your subconcious to improve yourself? Not nesscarily just in psionics, but other areas. For example, can it help you improve social skills, attract more friends, and improve confidence? If so, how could that work?</p>

                  <p>Thank you.</p>

                  <p>To answer your first question: I knew 20% of the material, and the teacher TESTED that 20% basically, and ignored all the other stuff. I knew exactly what I needed to know for the test. I do that a lot now, actually.</p>

                  <p>To answer your second question: YES! You can use subconscious communication for all sorts of things not related to psionics. I actually go over some in the article. For example: doing good on a test <img src="wink.gif"

                  <p>Judging from what happens when two inanimate objects phase through each other, I would _guess_ that your arm/leg/whatever would end up fused. I do not know for sure. Your subconscious does _not_ prevent injury in these things, however.</p>

                  <p>I have read on other sites that lentation ( using adrenaline to alter your bodies perception of time i think) can be very dangerous. I was wondering if you guys knew anymore about the excess adrenaline greatly shortening your life thing. Does lentation belong with phasing in the highly dangerous,
                  very difficult, DO NOT ATTEMPT category or what? IF you guys (and gals) know anything about the danger involved please answer. And I know that every psionics thing can potentially kill you, I was just wondering if this was more so.</p>

                  <p>Hi, I'm fairly new to Psipog, and I would first off say its a fantastic site, now, carrying on. I don't know if it possible to do this, but I was wondering if it was possible to Dreamwalk during an OBE. You see, I natuarally (I hope I spelt that right) OBE, for example, my friend informed me that
                  OBEing was difficult, so I decided to give it a shot. So, my first try, I get it, thanks to the articles about it, My friend suggests that I'm a somewhat "natuaral" at OBEing. Then i tried Dreamwalking. Im not very good at it, so i was wondering if it was possible to Dreamwalk during an OBE, since
                  I'm much better at that, Thanks in advance.<br />

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Strictly speaking, biofeedback is a method of training a person to take control of certain subconscious activities (such as blood-pressure) by using audible and/or visible responses from a machine which measures the "subconscious activity" (such as blood pressure). There are various such devices
                  on the market, ranging from simple "lie-detectors" from Radio Shack to elaborate medical devices worth many thousands of dollars.</p>

                  <p>More loosely, the term is also used to describe any method of taking deliberate control of subconscious processes. Psionicists tend to favour the "visualisation" approach, mainly because it is simple to explain. Make a "mental video game" of a relaxing experience such as chilling out at the beach,
                  and your pulse and blood pressure will lower in response to it....eventually. This is a "skill" rather than an innate ability, so the time it takes to effect such changes varies with the amount and effectiveness of the practice of the individual.</p>
